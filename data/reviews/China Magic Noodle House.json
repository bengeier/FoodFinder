{"text":"I'm not easy to please, in fact I'm quite picky when it comes to food, but I have to give this restaurant 5 stars.    I could easily go for some China Magic right now, and I'm not even hungry!  This is a great little restaurant in an area full of tasty places to eat.  Kind of an Asian enclave in Mesa, near the great Asian grocery store, Lee Lee's.  This place faces Warner road and is directly across the street from the fantastic Lee Sandwiches, possibly the best (maybe only?) Vietnamese/French bakery in the area.   But back to some China Magic, my friends.  Why do I like this place?  First of all the restaurant is clean and welcoming, which is essential.  I don't care how good the food is if the place is skanky, sorry.  Friendly and quick service.  Inexpensive.  They give you little dishes of boiled peanuts and pickled daikon and carrot before your meal.  I haven't worked out if these are appetizers or condiments, but who cares?  They are tasty!   Home-made noodles.  Have I got you yet?  HOME-MADE NOODLES.  The food is very basic, nothing crazy.  Delightful and satisfying, nice choice of vegetarian or meat entrees.  The specials board is worth a look as well, especially the Chinese greens, which are absolutely wonderful.  Probably my favorite Chinese vegetable, and here they are expertly cooked to perfection.  Oyster sauce is light and flavorful, not that goopy nasty stuff you probably know from your local Chinese take-out.  You have your choice of noodles, as if you need that, as they are all wonderful.   The love doesn't stop with the food as they make lovely smoothies and drinks, with or without tapioca (sorry, reminds me of frog spawn).  The smoothies are made with soy milk, so even the vegan can get some joy at this place.   Tip the noodle makers too, they deserve it!!"}
{"text":"i love this place!  they make the noodles fresh and you can watch the chef as he's making it through a glass window looking out into the dining area.  they have a good-sized menu selection.  i like to order their spicy version of their chicken & noodles dish forgot which number (sorry), plus their excellent fried spring rolls and chicken shishkabobs.  the dishes taste light not greasy as some other chinese restaurant dishes often do.  beverages are ice cold or you can have hot tea.  seating and service is fast, food is served fresh and piping hot, portions are large.  in this case, i like larger portions so that i can take a to go box and feast on what i could not finish on the very next day.  if you like chinese food, this is a bucket list item.  top3 reasons why... 1- fresh delicious dishes 2- great value for quality & portions 3- atmosphere (clean site, service is quick, friendly, cheerful, responsive)"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to China Magic Noodle after buying the Groupon deal. The place was nice with plenty of tables and the service was prompt. Our waiter was very helpful in picking out the right dishes for each of us.   We started with the Spring Rolls which, oddly enough, came out after our entrees. The Spring Rolls were a bit of a disappointment... a bit too greasy and kind of plain in taste.   I got the Fried Noodles with Beef and my friend got the Friend Noodles with Beef in Spicy XO sauce. Both dishes were very tasty and filling. We each went home with a to-go box of over half of the dish left. The noodles were good - I had never tried hand-made noodles before and was pleasantly surprised.   I also tried the Honey Peach drink. This was very good if a bit sweet. I will definitely try another flavor next time since they have 5+ flavors to choose from.   Note: China Noodle does accept credit cards, but they prefer cash.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now.  Was introduced to it by a coworker when we decdied to take a bit of extra time for lunch one day.  First thing I tried was the seafood with corn, and was happy to find the noodles were tasty and stretchy; there is a big difference between this and buying them dry at the store.  And, yes, it is a completely different texture than what most people here are used to.  They are Chinese noodles after all, and not pasta.  The dish as a whole was good, even though they used imitation crab, which I usually avoid.  The fact I enjoyed it regardless is saying something.  I also stole both some of the steamed and fried dumplings from my lunchmates, and both were great, although I prefer the fried.    Second visit I went for the seafood noodles and, this time, it was straight up what I love: fish balls, shrimp, squid and scallops, all cooked perfectly in a flavorful sauce.  Also ordered the spicy pig ear, which was quite good, even though the portions are a bit much for an appetizer.  My wife enjoyed her beef noodles with oyster sauce, and I also sampled from my friend's \"mixed meat\" platter (largely marinated beef and pig ears).    All-in-all a great place so far, and it's nice to have an Asian place to eat again that's not a buffet."}
{"text":"The whole smell and flavour are exactly how it tasted when I was in China, although the noodles tasted a little bit harder than I thought, I still think it's a good dish"}
{"text":"Noodles here are very good. Hand made and tasty. The dishes we tried were a bit more bland than we expected. (#32 and #15)"}
{"text":"Meh. I had high hopes. I heard really good things and really...hand-pulled noodles! Yum! Unfortunately, the noodles are where it ends. The food was very greasy and lacking flavor. I feel the quality of the meat was subpar. We will give them another try (because I really want to like it) and I will update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best fresh noodle in the valley. I absolutely love their dumpling, they're huge! Everything is pretty standard and I didn't have any problems for the most part. The only thing I didn't like was how quickly they handed me the bill as if they wanted us out of there asap. Good food tho! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to LOVE this place, turns out I only LIKE it. I had heard about the fresh noodles stretched by hand in a window for diners viewing pleasure...sounds like a rare gem of a place and in a few ways it is! The problem is the physical experience while you are in the restaurant. It's just plain ugly. You feel like you can't trust the food that is about to come your way. The paradox is that the food is really good and for the price, it's excellent! We had the Pan Fried pork dumplings and they were enormous, tender and very well seasoned. The dipping sauce was almost unnecessary, they were that good! The Beef and Pan fried noodles with XO Sauce was REALLY good! Spicy, flavorful, tender beef and their special soft noodles. I think this will be our take out special place from now on."}
{"text":"Great food. Pleasant atmosphere. Friendly smiling faces that make you feel welcome as soon as you enter the door. Will be back definitely"}
{"text":"Really great noodles. My favorite are the wide flat noodles (labeled \"D\" on their menu) with beef in the XO sauce. They're thick and pleasantly chewy. And they're hilariously long. One very generous serving might contain only 2-3 noodles, each a several feet long."}
{"text":"I always seem to crave these noodles on a Monday, when they're closed! Regarding the noodles, they are amazing. You'll never want ramen noodles again once you have them fresh. I love the vegetable stir fry noodles. They put lots of fresh, crisp veggies in there, including sprouts which I love. We ordered potstickers once and were taken aback at how big they were! Would love to see the addition of more vegetable options (eggplant, potato, beans, bok choy, green beans etc). I'd still give them 5 stars because as they are, everything is fresh and delicious :)"}
{"text":"The China Magic Noodle House is down the street from my house. Since I couldn't think of any other place to grab lunch today, I thought I would check out the noodle house to see what all the fuss was about. What fuss am I referring to? This place was voted in the Phoenix New Times as one of the best places to get hand made noodles in 2010.   I'm not a small eater. I make it a point to try a few things on the menu to get an idea what the place is like. China Magic Noodle House offers more to customers than just noodles. That being said, my order consisted of 2 egg rolls, 8 steamed pork dumplings, and a bowl of beef with hand pulled noodles. To drink? Water. Gotta keep that palette cleansed.   After placing my order and waiting for about 10 minutes, all of my menu items appeared on my table steaming hot. The bowl consisted of sliced beef, cilantro, green onion, beef broth, and of course the hand pulled noodles. The bowls are huge and for $5.75, I was getting more than I was paying for. Not a bad thing! The flavor of the bowl was good. There was a little too much cilantro for my liking, but not enough for me to complain about. So, if you are NOT a fan of cilantro, beware. For me though, I like spice and I added two spoonfuls of chili oil with chili flakes to my bowl of beef and noodles. Just to ensure that I had enough spice, I added just a teaspoon of Sriracha sauce to the bowl. The broth stayed hot the entire time in the bowl and the hand stretched noodles were amazing. You can definitely tell the difference from their noodles verse the crap you buy in the store. You know what I am talking about!  The steamed dumplings were great as well. They served a mildly sweet sauce with the pork dumplings. Honestly, the dumplings on their own are amazing. All of the dumplings were about the size of a golf ball and definitely enough to fill you up.   Finally, I had the egg rolls. They were filled with pork and veggies and served with hot mustard and sweet & sour sauce. They were the best egg rolls I have had in a long time. My total bill for all of these items was $15 and some change.   I would definitely go back again. The food was great and the front of house staff were very nice and friendly. The China Magic Noodle House is tucked away in the Lee Lee Market Center on the southside of the property. I was very pleased with my experience and even more excited they are down the street from my house."}
{"text":"Pretty average. It seems to me that their attraction is the handmade noodles (which are good) but we tried two preparations. Thick noodle in soup with beef slices and regular noodle with spicy sauce. I did not care so much for my noodle with spicy sauce which seemd to have a really oily texture and overwhelmingly fishy taste. We also shared an order of pan fried dumpings: very large with tasty filling but required plenty of vinegar to cut the greasy coating. Overall, the food was overwhelmingly oily. I'd try again as perhaps we didn't hit the jackpot on our menu items. The boiled peanuts with daikon appetizer they bring you is pretty damn good, though!"}
{"text":"Wow the food was wonderful and the prices were great. My Husband, 9 year old granddaughter and myself took the trip to Chandler based on the yelp reviews and we were not disappointed   Our granddaughter loved watching the chef make the noodles to order. There is a large window between the dining room and the kitchen so you can see the noodles being stretched and your meal prepared. We had the potstickers (dumplings) to start delicious. Then 3 different noodle dishes - all fabulous. This is not a fancy place the decor is simple and it is located in a strip mall  the emphasis here is definitely on the food.  Great family place.    We will be back often."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing little find. It serves fresh, delicious noodles for next to nothing. The absolute best part of this place is that you get to pick the kind of noodle you want meaning you can try your favorite dish multiple times while changing it up!"}
{"text":"This is a FUN place to go!  You can see them making noodles right in front of your eyes, though I have been there many times, I am fascinated every time I see the chef making a piece of dough into a bowl of yumminess . And the big clear window also help you see what's going on in the kitchen, so no worry about what's really going on during preparation.  Price is fair, flavor is good, but personal preference can be twicked with the provided condiment.  You can also choose what type of noodle you would like and have different sizes and shapes to choose from.  If you are a noodle person, this is THE PLACE to try!"}
{"text":"This may be my favorite Chinese restaurant. I love noodles a lot, and these are quite good. Watching the noodles being made, chowing down on squishy noodles, sipping awesome fruit smoothies (try the Honey Peach, it's super awesome, especially in July)--it's just a really great experience overall and I never get tired of coming here. Even my wary-of-Asian-food mom and grandma love it here. I enjoy it a great deal and I'd say this is a very solid choice if you're in the mood for inexpensive Chinese food."}
{"text":"OK, I'm somewhat between 3 stars and 4 stars on this.  I really want to like this restaurant a lot so maybe I will have to return again and try another dish.  Positives:  Price!!!!  Wow, the prices are amazing.  I got the hand pulled spicy noodle dish ($4.00), my boyfriend got the hand pulled pork noodles ($5.95) and we shared the pork dumplings ($4.95).  The dishes provided rather generous portions (we ended up taking half of our meals to go).    The dumplings were quite tasty (approx 8 large dumplings)  I got the passion fruit smoothie with boba which was quite good (I love bubble tea so much and this place is pretty legit).  The restaurant was really clean and the window to watch the noodles being made was really interesting and ingenious!  Negatives:  My noodle dish just really didn't have a whole lot of flavor and was not even remotely spicy for being titled 'spicy noodles.'    All of the food was really rather greasy.  The sauce for the noodles was pretty much pure oil and the dumplings/sauce were pretty oily too (but still tasty).  I was just hoping for a bit of a cleaner feeling meal instead of heavy greasy food.  Maybe if I try one of the soup dishes next time I will have better luck!    The experience was overall a good one and I would like to try this place again, I was just a bit disappointed with the grease content of the foods which gave me a bit of stomach ache.  Regardless, this place is worth a shot!"}
{"text":"Love this place, true it's no frills but ... efficient service, delicious boiled peanuts (which I like so much I now make at home after much experimentation) and who can complain about noodles made on the premises (mmm xo sauce!). Generous portions, excellent value!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome! Authentic hand pulled noodles. Pretty similar like what I eat in China. Only one deficiency of the soup, it's supposed to be curry beef broth instead of clear beef broth."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best noodle soup in the East Valley, then you found it. Hand pulled noodles that you can see being made through the window that they have into the kitchen. At one point an older lady came and watched over the younger guy pulling the noodles as if to make sure that it was being done the way she was taught. So you can only assume there is some history to what they are doing here and it shows in the food. I got the ox tail noodle bowl and pan fried dumplings. Both were delicious and decent portion sizes. I have seen some negative reviews about hospitality here, but it was not an issue for me. It definitely was not the over the top American family chain style restaurant service, but it was not bad service by any means. I recommend it to anyone who can appreciate a good broth and delicious fresh noodles."}
{"text":"The place is actually reeeeally hard to find. It's behind the grocery store. And it's further than it seems on google map. There are parking spots in front of the restaurant, so just drive all the way around the building~ and you'll see it... Environment is fine~ it has a huge lobby and tables are far far separated, so if you want some privacy, you'll get it! Nobody's gonna hear your voice~~~ The food is just fine. The noodles were great! I had knife-sliced noodle (if it's what it's called in English... Anyways it's ???) in lamb soup. The soup was just average. My boyfriend had the beef noodle soup with the 1st kind of noodle on the list... It was pretty tasty too. And they open till late. So pretty convenient if you run late from school or work."}
{"text":"Quality of food and price can't be beat - not to mention the homemade noodles are unbelievable. I live in Cincinnati and whenever I'm in Phoenix visiting my brother, this is the first place I want to go. I would give them 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"This is an amazing noodle house. The noodles are fresh and prepared in front of you (well, actually behind an open window into the kitchen, but its good to know the kitchen is clean.)   Only come here for the noddles, everything else is not that great. This is why I removed 1 star. We ordered the gyoza multiple time, both steamed and pan friend, and they were different every time. We usually order them because its $4 for 8 pieces, and its not the regular size you are use to, they are \"Super-sized.\" Don't waste your time with the boba, they are not prepared well.  We come here every week, because we get full off of a large bowl of noodles, for cheap! The average entree is at most $7-8 which I think is a great value for fresh noddles."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite places to get Chinese food. A few of these other reviewers must have confused this with a different restaurant, because my service was perfectly fine, and the food is absolutely to die for. I almost can't believe how low the prices are. What's even better is that it's right next to Lee Lee's (which could be a huge factor in keeping prices low). I've only been once, but I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The fresh noodles at CM are a treasure for this part of the valley. The stir fry was savory and satisfying. The soup was not too salty like many oriental soups can be. Would have liked more variety of veggies in the \"vegetable\" soup but I enjoyed the freshness and simple flavor of the the broth. The potstickers were crazy big! Tasty too. Servers came up right away to take our order but were a little hard to get back to the table throughout the meal."}
{"text":"Fresh pulled noodles ahhhhh what more can you say. I have been to this joint a couple of times and tried some of the different noodle sizes. For soup I prefer the traditional hand pulled (its easier to eat). For fried noodled dishes I like wider noodles. For the more adventurous try the mixed appetizer plate. It has marinated beef, beef tendon (they have it as beef tender) and pigs ear. I was surprised that the taste was on the traditional side and not too westernized. I have to say I tried the pot stickers and didn't care for them. They were too chewy and did not like the taste or texture of the filling. But, to each his own. Overall I like this place and I will go back."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the reviews that indicated handmade noodles, and the storefront prominently advertises on its windows ?????, Lanzhou-style hand-pulled noodles, so I stopped in before my usual Sunday night meeting, hoping to make it in time, ordering a starter of pan-fried dumplings and the XO sauce beef fried noodles with shaved noodles as others have recommended. This is a technique where the noodles are shaved from a block of dough, and it can be pretty theatrical, but, wasn't here for the theater tonight. Both dishes came out pretty quickly. The dumplings were a meal in and of themselves, lightly pan fried, stuffed with seasoned beef, but a bit dry, and served with a kind of vinaigrette-like dipping sauce: recommend using that and also a combination of the black vinegar, soy sauce, and hot chili oil as well to taste. The noodles were very good -- I've only Chicagoland's Katy's Dumpling House to compare against -- possessed of a springy al dente texture that is the hallmark of the hand-pulled noodle and very well seasoned, but a bit light on the beef. Nevertheless, a carbolicious meal. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Casual place with great noodles @ reasonable price. The portion is generous. I always end up getting pan fried dumplings and vegitable & egg noodle, but should try other things, too!"}
{"text":"I will say that the service is not the best in town! However, you really don't go there for the service. The food is wonderful and quick. I would suggest the Spicy beef fried noodles and pan fried dumplings."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my house but I had never noticed it. I saw the groupon for it and thought we should try it since my husband loves Asian noodle dishes and the groupon made it seem vegetarian friendly (I'm a vegetarian). I won't be back! I was really looking forward to trying the \"vegetarian vegetable and egg noodle soup\" which they advertised on the groupon. However there aren't any vegetarian soups and only TWO vegetarian dishes!! So I got the vegetarian spring rolls which were actually very good (although they came with a sauce packet) and the spicy vegetarian noodles. The noodles had cilantro and seaweed, which I think is the reason it smells and tastes \"fishy.\" at least I hope that is the reason! I did not like the seaweed and only ate a few bites of my noodles. The smell was really grossing me out. My husband said his dish was pretty good but he wasn't as excited about it as I had hoped. I was totally disappointed!! And yes we both got the hand pulled noodles which were supposed to be awesome but I didn't think they were anything special :( To top it off, no one refilled our waters the entire time we were there!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend.  I decided to give it a try since she insisted it was \"so bomb.\"  Knowing her for being a foody, I trusted her taste buds and decided to make it a point to try out this place.   My husband and I went one Saturday for a late lunch and as We walked in you could see an Asian man making fresh noodles as you sit to order.  I decided to try the oxtail noodle soup.   First, i Really did not care for their noodles.  Second, oxtail was so thin there was barely any meat on it but a majority bones.  Everyone is different but from my experience it will be my first and last time to eat here.   I'm taking my noodle fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service. Loved the chicken fried noodles."}
{"text":"Either we caught them on a bad night or maybe my expectations were too high. At any rate, food was not too flavorful and very greasy. The noodles with minced pork had good reviews, and what I had did not match up with those reviews. Dumplings and egg rolls were delicious though. I may try again in the future, but will order something different."}
{"text":"It's good to finally see a food place making hand pulled noodles. That is definitely one of the more artistic things around in cooking, using their hands to make different noodle thickness in less than 20secs.  This place is not that big, but decent size enough for a casual restaurant. I like their variety of soup noodles, stir fry and appetizers. For appetizers, they have my favorite marinated beef tendons. That's a nice dish, as it has some spice to it and nice and chewy. They also have some classic HK dishes like the mantou gok.  . As for the soup noodle, their bowl size is not the biggest, but the flavoring was pretty good. I liked the ox-tail soup with the hand pulled noodle.  Overall nice change to the chinese food scenery in Phoenix. Glad to see we are getting more LA style variety and not the cookie cutter dim sum places and chop suey."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant for a long time since I came to Unite states. The food is awesome, and always remind me of traditional Chinese foods in China."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. I did not like my food, I asked them to please remake it and the cook started yelling and took extreme offense. They have a window where you can watch the cook and he was standing there giving me and my date a dirty look while yelling and refused to do what I requested. I felt very offended and confused. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Pretty boring food and the service was...well let's just say nonexistent.  There are so many other good places to eat, not quite sure why you would eat here.  Boring ( as in no flavor), luke warm food, and cold service....Yikes."}
{"text":"Great Chinese restaurant in the area. Foods are delicious, staffs are nice and the place is clean. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for noodle soup.  The flavor is awesome. The portions are plentiful. The only complaint is the spring roll is deep fried."}
{"text":"I've been here 3-4 times now, visited again today and the other times were a few years back.    I went at about 12:30pm, and it was well attended for being the middle of lunch.  The service was good, took a little bit of time (~10min) for the food. Tried the XO spicy beef noodle dish (#34) with shaved noodles, as I recall liking the chewiness of those thicker noodles.  I feel like the noodles here are good - delicious, but the sauces are lackluster.  I tend to like my dishes fairly flavorful.  The dish I tried today was moderately spicy, but aside from the spicy taste, that there wasn't much flavor to it.  A good array of veggies, bean sprouts, lettuce, carrots. The beef was good, but not remarkable.  The price was ~$9, more expensive than I remembered (and for lunch), but the portion was large and fitting of the price.  My key determinant for food is the flavor/sauce of a dish, though, and since I haven't recalled being wowed by the dishes I've tried so far, I probably will not be back for awhile.  Side note:  When I visited years earlier, I had a dish that was very flavorful, but primarily because it was mainly a slightly diluted oyster sauce.  If you are familiar with that sauce, it is tasty but very strong by itself.  While that dish definitely had a lot of flavor, it's too much flavor such that it is hard to eat large portions of it.  Not sure if that dish has since changed."}
{"text":"This place has the worlds greatest dumplings! Definitely a must try. The best part is they make all their own noodles."}
{"text":"Nice modern clean environment.Not to much ambiance other than the noodle flipping chef in the window. Service was good with the exception of the language barrier. They did not speak a lick of English. The food was relative inexpensive, but then it was just some noodles with a few pieces of meat. Fresh noodles are very sticky and hard to eat if you allow it to sit. Will try the soup noddle dishes next, they looked better."}
{"text":"The Phoenix metro area is definitely not known for authentic Asian cuisine. China Magic Noodle House, however, is the real deal. This place reminds me of the Taiwanese delis that I used to go to in LA, as well as noodle houses that I've frequented in Taipei.  They have a great selection of cold noodle, hot noodle and soup noodle dishes. And, a variety of ways to have your noodles (I typically order the thick noodles or shaved noodles). There's always a veggie on the whiteboard to try and the fried tofu is very tender and tasty with the dipping sauce.  If you're looking for a reasonably priced, ethnically authentic meal in Phoenix (especially the East Valley), China Magic Noodle House should be near the top, if not first, on your list. the only negative that I would have about this place is that there isn't enough choices where chicken is the main protein."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Chinese place in the Phoenix/East Valley area, and this fills the bill.  Handmade noodles make a big difference, and you can literally watch the noodles being pulled here.  Shaven-style is my favorite, but there are plenty of other options to choose from.  The beef with spicy XO sauce was good - could have been a little more spicy though.  Jia Jia Mein here is also good.  Surprisingly, the restaurant is reasonably clean, which is unexpected for the typical small, strip-mall type chinese restaurants.  Prices are also reasonable and the service as decent.  Would go back."}
{"text":"I don't like to give places a 1 star review unless I have either gotten sick or had a really bad experience. I sort of had a combination of the two at China Magic Noodle House. I saw a groupon for this restaurant a couple days ago and it looked simple and good so I went ahead and bought it. I am always in the mood for noodles so I was excited to try this place, and it was right down the street from my house. So Sunday afternoon we decided to eat here for lunch. I have been sitting on this experience for two days now and I feel that I am not giving a harsh review based on my experience.   We walk in around 3pm and there were only a few tables being served. The first thing that hits me is the smell of this place. My first thought was that it smelled like urine. I'm sure it was just a combination of the spices and whatever was being made in the kitchen, but it was not a mouth watering smell like you should experience when you walk into a restaurant. I should have turned right around and went home, but we stayed. So we sit down and someone brings over some water and some boiled peanuts and pickled vegetables. I still am not sure if this was supposed to be some kind of appetizer or a garnish for the noodles. It was a little weird. So I decided on the spicy vegetarian noodle dish, and my husband decides on the vegetables and fried noodle dish and a strawberry smoothie. I see that there are spring rolls on the menu as well. There is a language barrier here with the waiters so when I asked if the spring rolls were vegetarian at first she just thought I was ordering them, but after asking three times whether or not they were vegetarian I think she finally understood what I was asking. So I was a little bit concerned about these.   Everything came out really fast. Like around 5 minutes fast. The spring rolls were vegetarian, but they tasted like they came out of a freezer bag. And the vegetables inside were really limp and not crisp at all. A couple packets of mustard and some gelatin like duck sauce come with the rolls. I didn't use either. How hard would it be to make a really simple nice sauce for the rolls? My noodles come out first and at first they look really good and I was excited. However as I am eating them I am noticing some weird textures in the supposedly vegetarian sauce. It tasted almost like some kind of seafood and it was gritty. I didn't finish it and when I asked two different waitresses what was in the sauce, neither of them could tell me. Which is concerning. I can't feel good going back to a place that can't tell me whats in the vegetarian sauce. My husband liked his noodles, but he isn't as paranoid about what his food is made out of as I am. His smoothie tasted like a slushie you get at 7-11. I am sure it was made with some kind of red dye and not fresh strawberries. Sickeningly sweet as well.   About an hour later we are walking around Target and my stomach starts to burn. I feel this intense burning sensation in my stomach for the next two days. I think there is some kind of issue with MSG here possibly. I don't know what else could have made me feel like that. I also didn't eat pretty much anything for the next two days because of how bad my stomach felt.   The only cool thing about this place is the guy who pulls noodles in the big window in the middle of the restaurant. Prices are also pretty cheap. Its cash preferred as well. Other than that, I am sorry to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"After I ate there yesterday, I had serious diarrhea and throw up. I didn't have breakfast before and no dinner last night. It definitely caused by the unclean food that I ordered there. I have been there few times and I was ok but yesterday was horrible for me. I cannot say they does that every time however I will not go back again. If my friend ask me why I stop go there I will tell them the truth. This is my first time to write a review. I was very disappointed with a such high rate place."}
{"text":"This was another one of those place where everyone tells you you must try out NOW...so I came here w/several friends for lunch last week.  The restaurant is pretty much standard Chinese hole-in-the-wall...nothing remarkable.  It wasn't packed but had a good lunch crowd there.  The waitress was also nice & polite and came by a couple of times to see if we were ready to order (since it was our first time, we didn't immediately know what we wanted upon arriving).  When ordering noodles, they have a list of about 5-6 different types of noodles...first you pick your noodles, then you pick how you wanted it prepped...pretty neat.  I got the beef stew w/the wide noodles and it was so wide I had a hard time eating it.  Each noodle strand was almost an inch wide so it wasn't easy trying to stick it all in my mouth.  I should have stayed w/my original thought of getting the hand pulled noodle...and will get it the next time I'm there.  Although the wide noodle was slightly difficult for me to eat, the beef stew & the pickled greens that came w/it were really good.  I also had the boba milk tea and it was okay.  Complete lunch for me came out to ~$10...I was a happy camper  :)  There are also several vegetarian options so our vegan friends weren't left hungry.  Our friends' vegetarian noodle plates came out to only $4/each...what a deal!  They felt their meal was very satisfying and we shall be back."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise!  Read about this place in the newspaper and decided to give it a go.    We had: Watermelon juice with tapioca pearls Milk Tea with tapioca pearls Fried Dumplings (appetizer) Beef noddle soup with Shaved Noodles Sea food noodle soup with hand pulled noodles  The 'boba' drinks were excellent!  The watermelon one tasted as if they just blended the watermelon itself adding nothing else.  It tasted quite fresh.  You can get them without the 'boba' for those who has an aversion to tapioca pearls.  The milk tea one was a bit on the sweet side but it was still good.  The dumplings were VERY VERY good.  I haven't had anything better in Phoenix.  Even thought it's under the appetizer category, these dumplings (8 of them for $5) were humongous!  Not only were they huge, the dough was home made.  Very chewy and fresh.  They were the best I've had in restaurants in many years!  They were so good that we ordered 'to-go' order for the dumplings!   The noodle soups were really tasty too.  I think for noodle lovers, this place would be heaven (at least in Phoenix).  The home made noodles are very fresh, chewy, and oh so tasty!!!!    You can also see how they make the noodle through the window inside the restaurant.  The place is a simple table/chairs and booths.  It seemed as the place ran on swamp cooler so it was a bit humid inside......not a big fan of that but the food made up for a bit of uncomfortable stickiness.  I'm looking forward to going back there again to try other noodles!"}
{"text":"Great hand stretched noodles and huge portions.  Every dish that we have tried is excellent."}
{"text":"I've been to China Magic Noodle many times over the years; it's one of my husband's favorite places to eat. The employees are friendly and prompt to provide service.  I always get #34 (Beef, Noodles, w/XO sauce) or the #27 (Seafood Noodle Soup) and love both. The noodles plates are big; unless you are a big eater, expect to take some home. The mango smoothie w/boba is also delicious; you can taste the fruit and know it's fresh.  I agree w/some of the other reviewers regarding the smell - this place definitely has a \"smell\" to it, who knows what it is - but it's not a disgusting/offensive smell. Overall the place is clean, the service is good, and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our lunch here. Potstickers are amazing as was the shrimp noodles and beef noodle soup."}
{"text":"Went here with a bunch of friends. The place was recommended to me. It was my first time eating hand-pulled noodles. I always see it on TV and have always wanted to try it out. I ordered a noodle soup with beef. The noodles, I will agree, are very good. I'm so used to eating dehydrated noodles for years from a can or at restaurants. This was a treat. The meat quality was not great, in fact, the majority of my beef was just cartilage. But with noodles so good, I didn't look to having meat to distract me. I would definitely go back and try another dish, preferably vegetarian so that I can focus on the noodles again."}
{"text":"Lunch with mom at the China Magic Noodle House, wow, I'm impressed! The flavor was very authentic. I had the Beef Stew Noodle Soup with a marinated egg and mom had Noodles with Minced Pork Sauce. Mine was really good, the broth was tasty and noodles were chewy.  They were very generous on the amount of beef stew in the bowl! Just the marinated egg was kinda cold, wish it could be warmer. Mom really liked hers as well, the sauce was really tasty, and the portion is BIG. And the price is really good!!! It's $13 for both of us including tax!  Why are the noodles so good? They really make their noodles on site,  you can see how the chef hand-pulls the noodles through the window in the inner side of the lobby. Also, the restaurant is next the Lee Lee's supermarket, very convenient for majority Asians who go their for groceries."}
{"text":"hand made noodles!! Actually this is the first time that I found a place that offers hand made noodles. Casual and enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Pinch me... I must be dreaming!  A real hand-pulled noodle place here in the desert?  Wow... and it's not a mirage...! We visited on 2011-06-02 after yelping for restaurants nearby.... gotta say, this place will make you both happy and sad! Happy... Found the place... Sad... It's hidden around the corner from Lee Lee and we almost missed it... Happy... Watching the guy making hand-pulled noodles in the kitchen... Sad... Wish we'd ordered more variety to see how he does each... Happy... Good variety to choose from on the menu... Sad... can't decide... Happy... Really yummy, fresh noodles... Sad... I overate.... Happy... Each dish could easily feed 2 people... Sad... No leftovers to take home... Happy... Great prices for what you get... Sad... Cash preferred... Happy... Bright, clean interior of restaurant... Sad... the outside doesn't reflect the inside... Happy... There's now a real noodle house in the valley.... Sad... I live about 20 miles away.... Seriously... once you've had fresh hand-pulled noodles, you'll never be satisfied with dry-packaged noodles again.  The texture and taste is amazing.  We decided to try two preparations; a soup noodle (beef brisket), and a dry-style noodle (spicy beef with XO sauce).  We stayed with the one preparation (the pulled noodles) just to see how the noodles are under each preparation.  Verdict: Both rocked!   Okay, I know it's a noodle house, but as good as the noodles are, they need something to convey flavor... and this place delivers.  The noodle soup has a nicely flavored broth, chunks of brisket, and vegetables.  As others have stated, the ratio is about 3-1 in favor of noodles, but hey, it is a noodle house.  Oh yeah... it's a big bowl.  The spicy beef with XO sauce really stands out... the XO sauce wasn't very pronounced, but it was there.  It's a huge plate... and it's served in front of you (translation: you eat the whole thing).  It really can serve 2 people... I thought I'd take some leftovers home... but somehow, everything evaporated off my plate and I was somehow a bit heavier... it was just that good! The complimentary boiled peanuts and pickled carrot radish appetizer does wake up your taste buds.  Nice touch. Ambiance?  Hey, it's a chinese restaurant.... pretty austere... but it is clean, and it is fun to watch the guy through the kitchen window as he stands in front of the window and dazzles you with his noodle pulling skills... man, he is fast! Not ready to give it 5 stars yet... but mainly because I've eaten all over the world and have had some amazing food in a lot of cities... but this place is darn good and could compete in SanFran, Toronto, LA, and a few other asian centers known for good food.  I'll also reserve a star after a couple more visits when I try some of their other offerings...."}
{"text":"The decor is  a little lacking but the food more than makes up for that. A favorite place for me to eat. Helpful staff and reasonable prices forces me to give this 5 stars. The noodles are fan-tabulous!"}
{"text":"Their noodles are amazing! So delicious and at a great price. They are also really quick with delivering your food."}
{"text":"Great Little Noodle Shop! Very clean dinning room and staff was great. Went yesterday first time, my wife's friend told us about this place and being my wife and her friend are both from China I was glad to check it out. BONUS the menu is in both English & Chinese she was soooo excited :) I Had the stir fried beef with wide noodle very tasty, although I did find the noodle being so long a little hard to eat, but I'm told that's how they do it in China. Other then that I wish my noodles had a bit more spice so will definitely try the XO sauce next time."}
{"text":"Authentic.  Homemade on site.  Clean with good service.  Good location - next door is LeeLee's Grocery store and Boba tea :-)"}
{"text":"It is one of the best Chinese food in Chandler.  I am an out of town person and liked it so much I had it 2 times within 3 days.    I hand made noodles and dumplings are tasty and large portions for the price."}
{"text":"Tasty fresh handmade noodles. We tried regular size noodles.  Egg rolls were ok not great.  Noodles is worth coming back :)"}
{"text":"YUM!  I was craving some noodle soup and made my way to China Magic Noodle House.  Not because I thought the magic noodles would make my cold go away... but because I had heard of the fresh, hand pulled noodles.  And those noodles were craziness - soft and chewy with great texture.  Who knew that the little man behind the window could stretch and slap the dough to create these fabulous noodles?  We also shared pan fried dumplings - huge dumplings with a savory filling.    My friends and I were pleased with the meal.  Nothing is better than a great bowl of noodle soup.  I know some people complained about the meat to noodle ratio.  Personally, if I'm eating noodle soup, I'm there for the noodles, so no complaints from me!  This place is a great value as well.  3 noodle dishes with 1 appetizer ~$25.  Happiness for your tummy without breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place on Friday night for the 1st time...and loved it. Very much like the little noodle restaurants hidden on little side streets all over Hong Kong. Just a small dive eatery, basic tables and minimal decor, chopsticks and spoons sitting in holders on the table for patrons to get themselves. The clientele was heavily Asian when we were there...as every table looked to have at least one Asian person, lending a degree of authenticity to the place. The menu is minimal, maybe 40 items in total, including soups and appetizers, and split in to four primary sections: appetizers, \"special\" noodle dishes, soup noodles, and fried noodles. The noodles are made fresh for each dish, and after you order, you can watch the noodle guy making your noodles through a big window that separates the kitchen from the dining room. He pulls and stretches the dough, and 5 minutes later you're eating those noodles. Great noodles too! For soup, we had the fish ball soup, which is roundish, white balls of fish stuffed with a ground pork mix, and cooked in soup. Very good.  The first dish that came out was the shrimp with corn noodles in curry, and that was great. We simply devoured that dish. We also had the seafood noodle soup, and that was good. Not as full of flavor as the curry dish, but a nice, standard Asian soup. A nice feature was the amount of squid included in the soup, and the cuttlefish ball. Finally, we had #34 on the menu, the spicy beef with the XO sauce (though we actually substituted chicken for the beef), and it definitely has a little bit of chili powder and kick. Not extremely hot, but just enough spice to mix with the flavor to produce a great dish. The only thing I'd change is that they were pretty heavy on the amount of onions in the dish, but overrall great dish. Service was quick, efficient, tables are turned quickly, and food came out quickly. On top of that, the place is CHEAP! Most of the dishes are $5.95, at best, and several are under $5."}
{"text":"Truthfully -- I have been here not once, not twice, but THRICE and my noodles were  always a little funky and dry. \"Pete, why are you continuing to eat there if the food is marginal and the service average at best?\" you ask. I'll tell you. Where else in the whole state of Arizona can you watch a man make noodles (Chinese or otherwise) RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE!!! I support that kind of dining experience. Noodle on China Magic Noodle House!   On another note, those complimentary boiled peanuts and pickled daikon are gonna give you some wicked breath. I say avoid that and pray your food comes fast."}
{"text":"Yeah...what they said ^ .  The flavors were a little foreign to me, that is to say unconventional. Maybe it was just my batch, but the soup had a bit too much vinegar flavor. Point is...it doesn't matter. Fresh noodles from here are a hit. Closed on Mondays...it took me like 3 trips to figure that out. Hey, it's Monday man...back off!  They ask that you pay cash to save on credit transaction costs to keep food prices as low as they are. So stop at the ATM and help them out."}
{"text":"There are a lot of good review's about this place. IMHO kinda greasy. Yes the noodles were hand pulled, but kinda ...  I will try again, just because I sense it has potential. Unfortunately for now I can only give two stars."}
{"text":"Background on Egg Soup Supper Club: We are (for the most part) white, American, Chinese speakers. The majority of us are ASU students. We are all between the ages of 20 and 30 years old. We meet once a week at a different Chinese restaurant around the Tempe/Chandler area for Chinese food.  _______________________________________________________________  China Magic Noodle House is some of the best Chinese food in the valley. The noodles are excellent, the broth is flavorful, and the dumplings (??) are as big as your hand. Literally. These things are HUGE.   The food comes out quickly, and is fairly generously portioned. Between the six of us, we ordered six kinds of noodles, ranging from stir fried (??), to traditional noodle soup. I don't think anyone was dissatisfied with what they ordered.   We also got drinks. I think there were three milk teas with boba (????), and a banana slush (??). They were all very excellent. Well, I assume the milk teas were good. I had the banana slush. It was good, although usually with banana, they add milk instead of water for consistency. It was also very sugary. Not bad, by any means. It just wasn't quite what I was expecting.   The dumplings: We got pan fried (??), as opposed to steamed (??). They literally were 4 inches long and 3 inches around in the middle. The filling was very delicious, and they were perfectly cooked. They were not burnt, but they were not soggy. They were deliciously crunchy.   We also ordered the meat sticks (???). They were basically little bites of heaven. One of our club members noted that she thought they should be spicier, but they everyone agreed that they were very flavorful, and cooked just right. No one regretted ordering them.  All in all, the food was VERY good, for a very decent price. I will definitely go again.  Note: The restaurant is mostly Asian customers. American customers will not be turned away, but like some reviewers said, they're not super nice if you don't speak Chinese.  Miscellaneous stats:  Number in attendance: 6 Cost per person: ~$14 Food: 9/10 Service: 6/10 Authentic: Yes."}
{"text":"We did a quick take out order and we were not disappointed. The service was fast and friendly and the menu was decent. We ordered beef chow mien and potstickers. The potstickers were excellent. I ordered the wrong type of noodle to go with my chow mien, so that dish wasn't as enjoyable. Watching them hand pull noodles while I waited was a treat.  The place is clean, plenty of seating and the food was fast, fresh and delicious. The 4 stars are for the potstickers."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! Since we moved to Phoenix we have felt that there is a shortage of good Chinese restaurants. Now we have finally found a great place! They make their own noodles from scratch and it was worth the drive to Chandler from Central Phoenix. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time tonight and will definitely be back. I had the spicy noodles, which were terrific! Loved watching them make the noodles fresh through a window.   Only thing I didn't like was the salt and pepper shrimp. It had a great flavor, but they left the shell on. I ended up tossing all of the salt and pepper flavor and ate plain shrimp because of the shell. Maybe you're supposed to eat the shell but I didn't found it appealing."}
{"text":"We went her for lunch and had the noodles with minced pork and the noodles with spicy sauce.  Both were very good, but the spicy sauce, although not too spicy, was more flavorful.  If you need more heat, there is a sauce on the table make from chili and sesame seeds.  The mango smoothy was great and a good complement to the food.  This is a wonderful restaurant and we will definitely be back to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"Love this noodle restaurant!   We eat here almost weekly because it is conveniently close to my kids Taekwondo school.  We are always greeted with a smile from the owner.  The beef noodle soup is very filling.  The sauteed noodles, fried rice and appetizers-the garlic shrimp and fried fish are generous portions, so we always share.  Food is very affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"Best Chinese noodle place in they valley. Hand made fresh right before they cook it for you. Great prices too!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much.  The handmade noodles are amazing.  When I make the trip to Chandler, I usually buy extra food to bring back with me.  Please open a restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Was very pleased with this place. A jewel in my eyes, fresh noodles, wonderful stew and fresh vegetables. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal, even better than what I expected! Just like China! Yummy."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for noodles. It is amazing to walk in and see the cooks hand pulling the noodles. I have order most of the menu. I will say my favorite thing is the ox tail soup and the pan seared dumplings.  If you have ever seen a cooking show where they make noodles and wanted them. This is the place to go. I have been to different  noodle houses in L.A. and San Francisco. I can tell you this place is one of the best. Definitely give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"This is a small, utilitarian restaurant located at the back of a busy shopping center.   It's a quick, cheap meal that will fill you up.  I like the food, but some dishes are definitely better than others -- the noodles with lemon was not to my taste.  The big draw here is the fresh hand-pulled noodles.  It's a unique experience to watch them being made through a window into the kitchen."}
{"text":"Amazing noodles, great price! Noodles hand made from scratch. Awesome pot stickers. Nothing but great experience overall. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I loooove Asian food, and this place didn't let me down.   I've been eating at non-chain Asian places for a while. Had my fair share of ramen, pho, galbitang. And this place will be one I will revisit many times.   Aside from the spotty service and drink selections, this place is pretty close to 5 star."}
{"text":"Awesome! Food was really good and watching the noodles get made was really cool. My son even enjoyed himself! I suggest trying the pan dried dumplings."}
{"text":"I had the seafood stir fry noodles with XO spicy sauce and it was very good! I also ordered the noodles with spicy sauce to go but that was not near as good. Very bland. My friend had the beef noodles soup and that was good as well. So we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Pretty good noodles. I think the cutting type or 'shaving' noodles have the best texture. Probably not worth the trek for more than 20 minutes away.. The oxtail soup was filled with pieces of oxtail that were mostly bone and chewy and the xo fried noodle dish with beef seems to be catering to western tastes. Be sure to go to the register to pay."}
{"text":"I came here thinking it's a good place to grab some noodles but again yelp reviews are not trustworthy. I don't know who thinks this noodle is good enough to eat. This is the worst noodle joint I ever had. Take a note. I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Best fresh noodle soup and  hand pulled noodles in Phoenix. Good service and reasonably priced. Boba drink is subpar."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the review I recently read about the terrible smell was accurate.  We first went here shortly after it opened and it was terrific.  We finally got around to going back.  We walked in the door and it smelled terrible - something not unlike urine as one reviewer said.  There was one table occupied (6:30pm on a Saturday).  We understood why.  We turned around and left.  I hope they can fix this problem and return to what they showed themselves capable of early on."}
{"text":"Freshly made Chinese noodles you can't get anywhere else in the city.  Their menu is quite diverse and you can get anything from seafood cream pasta to beef noodle soup.  I came here on a Tuesday and ordered the beef noodle soup, it was good but the soup was lacking the complexity of flavors and the beef wasn't as tasty and tender as the ones we have in Taiwan. Still a pretty decent effort by a Phoenix restaurant.  Prices are very good and almost nothing was over $10."}
{"text":"Pretty cool to see the chef pulling the noodles by hand.  Great taste, great prices.  The decor can improve.  Cheers"}
{"text":"This was seriously one of the best meals I've had in a very long time. I had the spicy ground pork dish - it was almost a religious experience. I'll definitely be back. As soon as I can!"}
{"text":"Shaved noodles, shaved noodles, shaved noodles!  Am I too butt lazy if I only go for shaved noodles?  The dish ordered with the handpulled meant I had to hold chopsticks high into the air trying to separate a portion of noodles out onto our plates.  Not bad but wasn't special... but the shaved noodles, loved the chewy texture.  I unashamedly used my baby godson as an excuse to get a mini noodle pulling show at the window.  I'm going to work my way thru the fresh fruit juice offerings...  I used to drink that daily while working as an expat in HK.  Speaking of which, the bathrooms are sooooo HK grand (Amy L, you and I think alike!)...  Overall the stir fried dishes were a bit greasy and the flavors decent, but the draw here is the shaved noodles (can I plug this anymore?!) and the fresh fruit juice."}
{"text":"This place is legit!  Best noodles ever, great friendly service, clean, huge portions, great prices!  The sauces were so flavorful as well!  We will be bringing our picky eater kids here for sure!"}
{"text":"Don't let the silly name fool you!  China Magic Noodle House does a pretty stellar job of stirring up some nice Chinese noodle soups.  You can definitely tell that the noodles are freshly made from your first bite (if you can't tell, just walk to the back and watch the chef tossing the dough).  The soups are flavorful and refreshing (and clean!), the meat tender, and its fun trying the same soup but with a different noodle type!  And man those peanuts are addicting!  They also make boba/juice drinks and have a variety of appetizers.  If you can get past what it is, their pig ears are exceptional and come in a pretty decent-sized portion.  I'm so hungry now!  :'("}
{"text":"I ordered the seafood noodles soup and was turned away from it from the second it got on my table. It had that bad fishy smell that makes you lose your appetite. There was also cilantro on it, which I personally don't like at all. The seafood was also waaayyyy too overcooked and was very hard to chew. The broth also did not really have a flavor, tasted like hot salted water. I don't know of I would come back here,  but if I ever did, I would never order soup again."}
{"text":"Best Asain food we have found since moving here. Worth the time to try. Food is Great. Atmosphere is ok, and you can walk over to LEE LEE's after to do some shopping."}
{"text":"This is my first 5 star review.  What a novelty this place is with home made noodles you can watch being stretched and cut with every order.   So delicious....and it's the fastest sit down food delivery I've ever had.  Homemade noodles are just amazing!!!  Can't wait to take the hubby back.  Fast & friendly service, huge portions, delicious!"}
{"text":"Didn't quite know what we expected walking in but it was definitely a new experience.  The kids had a great time watching the noodles being made in the kitchen.  We ordered dumplings for an appetizer,the beef stew soup, the minced pork on thick pasta, and the beef stir fry with wide pasta.  Service was mediocre, but you expect that for a casual spot like that, esp considering the pricing.  We had to get up and get our own utensils a couple of times, and didn't get water refills quickly enough.  Food - dumplings came when we were almost done, which was odd.  Beef stew - flavor was great but we could not eat the beef.  Very odd scraps with fat/cartilage and veins.  Next time we will order the sliced beef.  Rest of the food was very flavorful, esp the beef stir fry, so we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here at China magic noodle house won best to Phoenix 2010 new times best Chinese restaurant in the United States by cnngo.com. What I like about this Chinese restaurant it's a noodle house that means all the noodles are fresh made here on site they come in different sizes and when ordering your food whether it's stirfried noodles or in your soup you pick the size of what type of noodles you'd like! I had the seafood noodle soup #27 for $7:35 it was delicious it was clean clear with plenty of shrimp scallops squid and fish balls! Wow!! Didn't know fish had balls! Anyway try it you'll like it very good!  Yea!"}
{"text":"So delicious! I loved everything! I have no clue why anyone would say anything negative about this place.  I will for sure go back.  The dumplings are a must have! Don't let the negative reviews stop you from eating here."}
{"text":"I spent few minutes to find this noodle house is behind the supermaket. It is good to stop by here before to Phoenix airport, just 15 minutes away!"}
{"text":"I did not like this place.  I had the chicken stir fry and I thought it was just awful.  The chicken had a strange taste to it- it was so off putting I could barely eat it.  While the noodles were good, the sauce to the dish was very bland as well.  I highly doubt I will return after this experience."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had lunch here today.  It was a cool, authentic Chinese restaurant reminding me of a recent trip to China.  They serve a bunch of smoothie flavors which was great for my daughter.  The room where the fresh noodles are made has a huge glass window so you can watch.  More fun for the kid.  The food was great for both adults and kids.  Great prices too."}
{"text":"Home made fresh noodles.  Reminds me of San Francisco china town food."}
{"text":"I really love it here.  There is a big window that looks into the kitchen where you can watch the noodle chef hand make the noodles for your dish.  My favorite is #17, Beef with lemon garlic noodles.  The beef is sliced thin and served cold.  The sauce is a fish sauce, the fish smell is pretty strong, but it doesn't taste strong, the citrus and garlic are more evident.  The only reason I'm not giving 4 stars is because the water taste really funny here.  Opt for a soda."}
{"text":"Is hand making delicious china noodles a magic or an art? Whichever the process requires is fine by me because they are delicious. A little chewy, but full of the favors of the Far East. I had the #24, which is a soup with a healthy portion of beef and the handmade noodles. We drove 40 minutes to try this place, and we were not disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the best noddle joints in town. There are a ton of Asian businesses and restaurants on the Dobson/Warner and this is my favorite spot for noodles. Where else can you get a window to watch them make noodles for you!!! Also, try the pig ears!!!!"}
{"text":"Great noodles, great prices and good portion sizes.   Oddly quick service as well. I like the XO spicy fried noodles and beef/lemon noodles the most.    Overall this is my favorite little Chinese place for food.  Also you get REAL CHOPSTICKS so no splinters or horrendous asymmetry when trying to break apart those wooden pieces of junk."}
{"text":"Its pretty ethnic as my mom would say, and I like it.  Our server looked at me kinda funny when I ordered the beef with noodles in fish sauce, but as I've said before I'm a white girl.  People don't always know how to react to my food choices.  Yes, I'm sure I'd like the fish sauce, thanks.  I like it.  Yes, I know it stinks.  Its good.  The sliced beef was cold, which was unexpected, and it was super fatty, which was a bit weird.  I enjoyed it anyway.  The only fail was the spring rolls, they were cabbage egg rolls.  Ew. Inedible. The fried rolls with sweetened condensed milk were an amazing new find, I've not had those before coming to the hand tossed Chinese noodle places here in town.  If you aren't adventurous enough to try the more exotic items on the menu ( hot and spicy pig ears...ew! I'm not even that brave), you have to try these little fried dough balls of happiness! Yummy! Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Love this place,  I have had every soup they offer with the hand pulled noodles.  I like the Ox tail soup the most.  This place is a little piece of heaven since AZ has no Chinatown.  Maybe one day, I can only dream!!! For now this place rocks!!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place tonight and it was awesome. Had the shrimp with corn in curry sauce and I loved it. I'll definitly be back to try some other things!"}
{"text":"The hand drawn noodles are pretty fantastic. I get the noodles with sesame sauce, and through many conversations with the staff, my boyfriend has clarified it's \"vegan\". From what he's asked in Chinese the noodles are just flower, water, and salt. The sauce is just your basic sesame paste. If you're vegan go get your noodles on!"}
{"text":"There aren't a ton of Asian restaurants in the valley so of course I was very excited to discover this hand-pulled noodle shop. I stopped in after shopping at Lee Lee's supermarket. The ox-tail noodle soup hand-pulled noodles caught my eye.   My server was very polite and took my order and also bringing me some hot tea and water. The ambiance is very quaint and traditional looking like Chinese hole in the walls. I got my order and found it to be very delicious, authentic, and hearty. It definitely fulfilled what I was looking for.   As I paid for my check, I was told that my credit card wasn't working. It appeared that because my credit card had a chip, it was giving them trouble charging it. They asked me if I had any other forms of payment. I only had enough cash to cover my meal, but was only able to give a 5% tip with what I had. I apologized profusely and they told me genuinely that it was okay, and not to worry.   They are very kind, but I would recommend bringing cash just in case, or another credit card as backup. All in all, a great experience!"}
{"text":"After three years since I had a bad experience, I tried giving it another chance. Unfortunately they have not improved. I asked the waiter to halve the oil in my food and I still got noodles soaked in oil. See attached picture. The red liquid in the bottom of the dish is oil not source! So if you want to be super unhealthy. Eat there!"}
{"text":"Okay, if you LOVE noodles.... This IS the place to be. The soups are amazing. The stir fry is amazing. Even the pigs ear is amazing. They make the noodles fresh. You can even watch them make it through the little window they have. It's always very clean. The staff is friendly. The boba teas/juices they have are delicious. My favorite one is the mango. I also love the beef soup or the veggie stir fry. So yummy. The dumplings are also pretty dang good! Definitely a place worth trying, especially if you are a noodle-lover like myself!"}
{"text":"I ordered beef with pulled noodles and xo sauce, egg rolls, and dumplings.  The noodles were bland and extremely oily, the dumplings wrap was like some sort of bread instead of noodle. Possibly because I got it fried instead of steamed. The egg rolls were alright but no better than I've had anywhere else.  I was disappointed because I saw lots of great reviews and overall... Meh."}
{"text":"I love this place. The streamed and pan fried dumplings are to die for! The beef stir fry with spicy XO sauce is my favorite. Friends had the chicken fried rice and soup and noodle dishes, they were not disappointed!"}
{"text":"6 star food, 3 star ambiance, 4 star review.  It is the real deal for Chinese food. I have pretty Americanized tastes, but even I could appreciate their menu watching them make the noodles right then and there is so cool for someone who does not know much about the process.   The food itself is very darn tasty. The shredded noodles are thick, filling, and delicious especially with beef. I have gotten beef tripe stew here and it was awesome; it felt like I was eating Asian menudo and that's a great feeling.  Service was good, but this place is just not special inside. It is not very nice inside to impress people which is a shame because the food is great and priced very well. One last thing the portions are also very large, a definite plus."}
{"text":"You haven't eaten here yet?!?  What  are you waiting for??  The best noodle restaurant, hands down.  Don't listen to the bad reviews of bland broth.  Duh, see the condiments on the table?  Use them.  The soup is delicious.  Chewy, slurpy noodles in a light broth with your choice of meat or plain, served with spinach, cilantro and green onion.  I can never finish an entire bowl, but get to have them for lunch the next day.  Ohh...the dumplings.  Best I've ever had and they are huge - and cheap.  Very casual, good service but not hovering.  We go at least once a week - or more!"}
{"text":"Great food and inexpensive too. The noodles are fantastic.  Very fast food to the table.  Only thing holding back a five star rating is the service. Order to go and miss the curt service. The food is too good to pass up."}
{"text":"The first thing you might notice when you walk up to China Magic Noodle House (assuming you survived the horrible crush that is the Lee Lee's parking lot) is the cute caricature of man holding noodles painted on the window. Then you walk in and... HE DOES EXIST! There really is a man in the window that is hand stretching fresh egg noodles. This is real life people. My personal favorites are the cut noodles - they're a little thicker than the regular, and always have a bit of a chew to them that I love. If that's not your jam, they also come in regular, thick, narrow flat and wide flat. We always order the beef stir fry with spicy XO sauce. The dish itself isn't spicy in a mouth-burning way, but just plain savory and delicious. The sauce is a little on the salty/oily side, but I think the veggies and the thicker noodles help to balance it out. They do not skimp on the meat, either. The beef is the same as every other Chinese restaurant - exactly what kind of magic do they perform to get it that tender? On second though, I'm not sure that I want to know, but I'll definitely keep enjoying it.   Though the noodles are fantastic, the real star of this place are the dumplings! China Magic Dumpling House doesn't quite have the same ring to it, but I'd still be a loyal follower. Like the noodles, the outside of the dumpling (I don't know the technical term - wrapper? skin? dough?) is always perfectly cooked and has a nice bite to it. The pork mixture inside is SO delicious, definitely juicy and flavorful. My sister and I shared an order of 8 between the two of us and couldn't finish - these things are massive! Oh, and don't forget to load up on the chili oil on the table. Put that on EVERYTHING. I'm pretty sure it's the magic ingredient in the spicy XO stir fry, because that stuff is addictive. Somehow I always seem to lose all self control and willpower when I walk in here. But China Magic Noodle always satisfies by inner glutton, and I always walk/roll/waddle out of here a happy little dumpling myself."}
{"text":"If you're craving delicious lo mein(fried noodles) done right this place has it!  Their noodles are hand pulled and the difference is evident with the first bite.  I've tried their beef lo mein and chicken lo mein so far.  The seasoning is decent not overly salty maybe a tad too much oil but the star of the show is definitely the noodles.  I also had an order of dumplings and they were the best I've had in AZ.  The filling was seasoned just right."}
{"text":"4.5 star for certain!    Man I really like this place.  I dined there for the first time with my family this evening and none of us were disappointed at all.  The noodles are very good and have a lot of texture to them.  The broth that they used in the soups was very flavorful but not greasy or oily.  It felt really healthy and fresh.  The cooks were making noodles in the back and it is very entertaining to watch.  There smoothies are freaking wonderful!  I would however shy away from the tapioca balls unless you know you like them.  They are pretty gummy and do not dissipate or melt in your mouth like I expected.  . We also had an order of pan fried pot stickers which is one of my favorites and these were the best I have ever eaten.  The dough was perfect, light, crispy, yet moist.  The filling was very meaty and had nice flavors of lemongrass and ginger.  The sauce was excellent as well - lighter than most butt this is good in this case.    I am very excited to have found my new lunch and dinner place.  The bill for a family of four was $40 and that included three smoothies, four entrees, and a large app of pot stickers.    The setting in the only drawback but as a foodie I do not go to places often for ambiance.  It is clean and the kitchen is visibly clean as well which is great to see. The service was efficient and and prompt.  I swear they will get you your food faster than Mc-E-D's which just adds to the place when dining for lunch when you only have an hour to burn.  Go, and enjoy it!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here on Sunday August 17 and got the same cold and unfriendly service we got the two previous times we've been there before. We kept going back because of the sliced beef with noodle soup and tolerated the service. We didn't get the usual peanuts and salad at the beginning and I had to get up and get our own straws for our water. We weren't asked if we wanted something to drink, they just brought warm water without straws and immediately we were asked what we wanted. I keep asking myself if it's the culture difference that makes them act so indifferent towards the customers. Anyways we ate and left because we were being watched by the lady at the cashier to see when we were done from the beginning of our meal. We felt rushed to say the least even though there was still 45minutes till they closed. The worst part was halfway home when my girlfriend and I had to make an emergency stop at a bathroom because of the beef noodle soup we had. We have had it before but this was the only time our stomachs did not agree with the food. I don't think we will be returning. Decent noodles but gawd awful service. Hope this helps.    Oh and I kept noticing the noodles chef messing with his phone between stretching the noodles without washing his hands. (No gloves either)"}
{"text":"For people who haven't eaten here yet and the people who claim that the soup is bland:  When your soup is served, go ahead and add half a soup-spoon full of soy sauce, an equal amount of vinegar, and a tiny scoop of chili oil.  Taste the broth and add more if needed.  After you've achieved perfection, sprinkle some white pepper on there.  It's so much better than ground black pepper.  Trust me.  Especially with the soup, they're pretty much handing you a blank canvas.  It's up to you to personalize it to suit your taste.  --------------------------------------  For those who like to order appetizers and have a little time between your first course and your main course:  In this restaurant, you have to be proactive.  You have to take the timing of your meal into your own hands.  Order your drinks and appetizers first, nothing else.  Wait until you finish your appetizers before you order your main course.  It usually comes out very quickly anyways.  If you order all of your food at the same time, most likely it will all come out at the same time.   --------------------------------------  This is just an update of my first review of China Magic.  Please read my original review for my critique of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best fresh noodle house hands down. #34 with shrimp is the best, also don't forget to try the honey peach smoothie....YUM!"}
{"text":"If your'e looking to get your noodle fix, this is the place.  Tucked in a strip-mall with a funny (yet somehow appropriate) name, this little humble place offers 'hand-pulled' noodles made all day (you can see through the window in to the kitchen where they are pulling the noodles.  Been here several times already and I must say, they are a) very friendly b) very quick  c) affordable for going a few times a week and... most importantly d) have tasty food. The atmosphere is mostly of asian families and couples, also enjoying their meal here.  I was impressed with our party of, yes, FIFTEEN co-workes (my idea!) who sloppily put together 2 round tables and 1 square so we could all fit and who were promptly served... it wasn't even a few minutes after I had said my order that I got my dish... the only bummer was that we all got our dishes super quick except for our boss (who actually paid for all of us! poor guy!).  They were apologetic and he's a nice guy, so it worked out.  Their tapioca milk is yummy and perfectly sweetened, too.  Like I said, this is a great spot if you're looking to fill your noodle cravings... I absolutely will be coming back.  PS: I would not recommend take-out of the noodle soups... did this and, though it was filing and such, it wasn't as flavorful that the noodles hadn't melded w/ the broth long enough."}
{"text":"I reviewed China Magic Noodle House once already over a year ago. I had a problem with their bad service and their unfiltered water. However, that has changed. The last couple times I've been here, the service was outstanding. They hired two waitresses that really go out of their way to make you feel welcomed and have everything you need for your meal. Nice job, and I will see you next time when I drive to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant listed on a top 100 Chinese restaurants in the USA list. Initially I thought well...that's just bs because the top 100 chinese restaurants in American should all be locate in San Francisco/Bay Area, Los Angeles/San Gabriel Valley and New York City. I figured I'm in the general Phoenix area and will need my Chinese food fix so why not give it a shot?   Food:  Hand pulled noodles! In Phoenix! I ordered the Ox-tail hand pulled noodles (wide noodles) in soup. Absolutely delicious. Very al dente texture. Soup and oxtail had good calm flavors.   Beef tendon - Sliced and soaked in a sweet vinegar sauce. Slices were a bit too big, but it was very well made.   Service: Very plain robotic service. Not bad. Nothing stood out of the ordinary.   Environment:  This placed is tucked to the right of Lee Lee market. Clientele is 50% Chinese which is impressive considering this is Arizona and Asians seem fairly rare.   Price:  Fairly well priced. Two dishes ended up being less than $14.   Food: 5 Service: 3 Environment: 4 Price: 5"}
{"text":"It was love at first bite! I ordered the fried noodles with beef in the xo sauce. The sauce was spicy and savory. I don't like sweet and savory so it was the perfect sauce for me. There was a nice balance of noodles, beef, and vegetables and the portion size was very generous (only 7.95!). We ordered egg rolls for an appetizer and they were your standard egg rolls with pork. The only thing I could give constructive feedback on was that the egg rolls came out after the noodles. The service was friendly and attentive and it was so much fun to watch the noodles being made in the kitchen. I think this will be my new go to carry out restaurant when I am craving chinese food. I definitely want to try the soup next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I saw this place when we went to the (amazing) Asian market in the same shopping center, and decided to go back later that night and try it out for dinner.  Initially, it looked like your standard not-quite-fast-food place. Not really impressive in terms of decor, but it was clean and bright. Busy on a Saturday night, but not packed. When we sat down and looked at the menu, both of us were almost overwhelmed -- there's quite a bit to choose from and it all sounded so good.  We ordered the potstickers as an appetizer, and they were really yummy... and HUGE. I've never seen potstickers that size before. The noodle dishes we ordered were excellent. I got a beef/lemon noodle dish. He ordered noodles with a seafood blend. Really impressed with the quality of the food (and it helped that you can literally see the noodles being made right behind you in the kitchen). Our server told us to \"mix up\" the noodles right away so they wouldn't stick together, and that advice was appreciated.  We'll definitely go back. The people at the table next to us ordered soup (it looked *fantastic*) and there were a bunch of other dishes on the menu that we'd like to try."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have not reviewed this place yet! Fresh, homemade noodles large portions, cheap prices. Word of warning though, the service is terrible, keep that in mind when you go in and you'll enjoy your experience.  Five stars for the food. The service takes it down to four, sometimes 3 depending on the day."}
{"text":"I tried this place again after getting something I didn't like personally from the first time I've been. I got the beef noodles with oyster sauce and I got picky cause it tasted like gravy and I didn't like it so I decided not to give a low review cause of my pickiness. This time I got the stir fried beef noodles and they were excellent. Service is great and I enjoy watching them handpull noodles. Dumplings are good also, but I went with a friend who had a kosher diet this second time and doesn't eat pork so I was able to have a half order cause she couldn't eat them. She enjoyed this place as well as it was her first time."}
{"text":"Get dumpling pot stickers they are the best!!! Great!"}
{"text":"YUM. delish, fresh hand-pulled noodles. parents are from Taipei, and this passed their verdict as well.  pick your noodles (original/sho lah, knife-shaved/dao hsiao, among others), meat (lamb, chicken, beef, beef tendon), and preparation (broth, pan-fried). of note, the noodle broth comes with cilantro and pickled vegetables, which some may prefer to order without.  highly recommend the dao hsiao - is as good as the quality you'd find in L.A. wish this were in Chicago."}
{"text":"Ok, I've been looking for a good noodle place ever since I found Noodle Asia in Vegas at the Venetian.  They have the best Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup I have ever tasted.  Being in the Venetian and on the strip though the prices are high.  So when I heard about China Magic Noodle House I was very hopeful.  Looking at the menu the prices were great, very reasonable even cheap.  They did have a Beef Noodle Soup and a Beef Stew Noodle Soup.  Wasn't quite sure of the difference but neither were spicy.  All in all, I was pleased with the taste of the Beef Noodle Soup.  It had a good flavor not bland at all like some of the reviews suggested of their dishes.  I was disappointed I was not asked what type of noodle I wanted since they had a few to choose from I was not given the choice, I would have preferred the thicker noodle than what I got.  Also, putting some of the hot sauce from the table in the soup spiced it up quite a bit which made it that much better.  In the end it's no Noodle Asia but for a cheap bowl of Noodle Soup I would go back.  I would have given it 3.5 stars but they don't do halves so I rounded down since I didn't get to pick my noodle."}
{"text":"Very good. Cheap. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"It's a treat to take my son here to practice his mandarin and order items in the language.  What's more noteworthy is the consistency of the meals.  They make the noodles onsite through a window where you or the young ones can watch and there are choices.  What I enjoy is that there is around 40 choices limited to a few types of dishes and your. It overwhelmed with 1000 items that are impossible to quality check.    Today we ordered the steamed dumplings (a favorite), slices beef stew (see pic) with amazingly tender and quality beef and noodle and egg roles which are delish.  I rated a four because there is always an awkward aroma when you arrive which makes the event somewhat difficult at first.  The other reason is that I find the noodles to be a little bland but that may just be preference not quality.  Note: No adult beverages served and very family friendly."}
{"text":"What's magical about this place? It's the actual making of the noodles and its authenticity! Oodles of noodles!  The skilled chef and the art of noodle making can be seen in the back of the restaurant as you are eating. My fave dish is #22 minced pork noodles with julienned cucumber slices, on a bed of lettuce and sprinkled with scallions. You're able to select the type of noodle but I always go with the hand pulled noodles. It's a great take-out item. I've also tried the beef noodle stew with the hand pulled noodles. If you're dining in you will most likely be served with a plate of steamed peanuts lightly salted and de-shelled. Try picking it up with your chopsticks for those of you that are chopstick challenged. ;)  This place is awesome because it's considered a cheap eat! Who doesn't love that?"}
{"text":"Love this place, we have been here many times and the owner is very nice and they have the best hand made noodles in the valley."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting this restaurant after reading numerous great reviews of the place.  Overall first impressions of the restaurant were mediocre at best, as the decor isn't anything special.  We were greeted promptly after walking through the door and were seated right away.  Based on previous reviews, we ordered the pot stickers as an appetizer.  The reviews definitely didn't disappoint, as these were BY FAR the best I've ever eaten!  They were fried perfectly, large in size and the dipping sauce they came with was delicious.  My husband ordered the beef w/stir-fried noodles and I had the chicken w/stir-fried noodles w/the spicy sauce.  We both ordered different noodles with our dishes and both were delicious (wide and flat & thin noodles).  Overall, we were VERY happy with the quality of the food and the portion size - very generous and we took home lots of leftovers.  When we visit again, I'm going to order just the pot stickers, as they are a meal in itself.  As for the service, the restaurant wasn't busy, yet we didn't have anyone checking on us and we had to wait for our check to be delivered (servers were sitting in chairs on their cell phone).  Luckily, the food made-up for the  poor service and will not prevent us from coming back again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed as there are some great reviews for this place. We were not  impressed. I ordered the noodle soup with beef. The noodles were fairly doughy, beef was not very lean with large areas of gristle and fat and the broth was fairly bland as was the overall flavor in general. We also ordered noodles with seafood. The white sauce was akin to \"Campbell's Cream of\" soup. Our waiter was unfriendly and borderline rude.     Atmosphere was cold and unwelcoming, will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"The noodles here are tender, yet chewy and firm. The asian dude that makes your noodles is good."}
{"text":"My hungry family of 5 tried this place out because of the location and high ratings. I got a little nervous when we pulled up because the front isn't all that inviting (in a strip mall with a vacant tenant next door). We pressed on.  I'm really glad we did! Our 3 kids shared the chicken noodles (we chose the flat thick noodles, which was a great choice), and my husband and I shared the beef noodles... which was way better than the chicken. Both were good though. We also got the famous dumplings which were really delicious and huge.  Our food came super quick, which is awesome when you have little ones. We got the boba teas for desert and we were full and happy. We still had left overs, even with the two dishes and 1 app. Oh, and the bill was awesome, around $25. Can't beat quality food for that price. We had good quick service too. Totally happy, we'll be back :)"}
{"text":"I had the beef with fried noodles and it was good for my first time here You get to pick from several types of noodles. Will definitely come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I truly wish I could give it a better review. My sister loves this place and the reviews make it sound amazing! The only thing I liked were the noodles! I must say those were amazing!!! Best I've ever had. There was 1 person when we walked in at noon. They sat us at a booth that had holes ripped all in it. I guess for a hole in the wall kind of place it makes sense but still. It quickly got packed though within 20mins! They brought us cold noodles and peanuts to munch on till we got our meal. It was decent. My kids ( 7 & 5 yr old) shared the teriyaki chicken appetizer w/white rice. It was good but basically tasted like fried chicken without the breading. Again, good just not what I expected because there was little to no teriyaki flavoring. I had the shrimp & noodles. Shrimp was very rubbery which is a let down. Not much spice (which it did not say it would have any) so next time I will ask if we return. So 50% of the dish wasn't good. Saving grace was the noodles of course. My fiancé did have the spicy beef & noodles. Wasn't spicy AT ALL!!!! So that was a huge let down. I excepted that to be spicy. We love super burn your mouth spicy and this was basically good seasoning....that's it. So overall my whole experience became a let down. I hate to do this to small business owners but I think it it's important to know true experiences so you can decide if you want to do anything about it."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night. Complimentary boiled peanuts and pickled veg along with water were brought to the table immediately. Water was good. The peanuts and veg were meh.    We ordered the egg roll appetizer.  They served it piping hot with to go packets of \"duck sauce\" and \"hot mustard\". I expect more from a place with hand pulled noodles. They should really take the time to make their own sauces. Which more or less was a foreshadowing of things to come. The rolls themselves were good but greasy.  Our drinks were brought out quickly. Boba Milk Tea for me, iced tea for my husband. (Which I later had to ask to be refilled. Yes, one more please).  Our entrees soon followed. Both dishes were cheap, hot, and heaping. As with many Asian places, they provide condiments for you to customize your food. This tray had hot chili oil, vinegar, soy, and sriracha sauce.  The food itself was rather bland though.  It needed doctoring.  I wish they had added more flavor at the beginning during cooking.  We ended up taking about half of our food home. I reheated in a pan with some stir fry sauce and a little fish sauce. Much better.  We probably won't be back. I'd rather spend my money on a lot more flavor."}
{"text":"Fun place with the family. Literally \"hand made\" noodles.  Plus the serving size was gigantic!"}
{"text":"Great place for noodles! They have really good price also with sufficient amount of noodles. Definitely get full by one bowl. The people there are also really nice at services."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite noodle shop in Arizona!  They have a big window so you can watching them stretching the noodles out.  My favorite dish is the beef noodle oyster sauce.  Also swai fish filet is really good."}
{"text":"Noodles hand rolled right infront of you.... doesnt get much better than that. Love it! Once you see the 5 different types of noodles that you can chhose from, you'll just be confused. But confused in a good way :-)"}
{"text":"Probably one of the most authentic Chinese restaurants in the Phoenix area. I come from LA so I've definitely had better but after living out in Arizona for the past 5 weeks, I've been craving some authentic Chinese food.   The noodles are fresh and chewy. Soup base for the beef noodle can use improvements though. More pickled vegetables, please. And the vegetarian sesame noodles had nothing but sesame paste and noodles so it was a bit disappointing. Usually, I'ld expect cucumbers and carrots or something. The stewed beef cold dish was alright also. The drinks on the other hand are very good and sweet, just my liking. However, I wished they used real fruits for the smoothies rather than just flavored high fructose corn syrup. (total 3 stars)  So, for the pat on the back for opening one of the first authentic noodle house in Phoenix (+1 star)."}
{"text":"Interior is meh. Booths are torn. Watching the guy make your noodles is cool.   The soups are terrible. Tried the beef stew and the sliced beef soup with the wide and regular noodles respectively. The broth was the same for both and tasted old and off. Noodles were good though. Beef stew beef was tough and chewy. However, there was bone in the soup.  Customer service is atrocious. The beef stew had broken chips in it from the beef having sat in the soup for so long. It was soft but it was still bone chips. Wtf. Complained to the manager said they don't do refunds. 1 star take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Loved their noodles! The food is good and portions are huge, but service was really slow. Maybe because I was there at lunchtime. I spent almost 30 minutes waiting for my order."}
{"text":"Great place loved their noodles. She brought me more lamb in a side dish because my soup didn't have much lamb. Very nice people."}
{"text":"I had the seafood noodle soup with hand shaved noodles and it was delicious.  It came to the table really hot.  It was full of shrimp, fish balls, scallops and squid along with the shaved noodles.  It was a good broth that over time acquired flavor from all the ingredients and was very tasty."}
{"text":"The noodles here are so good and taste so fresh!! I got the veggie stir fry and was a little disappointed to only find cabbage, carrots and bean sprouts. I would like to see more veggies and less oil in the future but I still definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"China Magic Noodle House is one of my favorite names of any restaurant ever. Tucked away in a corner of the plaza, the worst part of the China Magic Noodle House experience is decidedly the parking. Even so, you can usually find a spot pretty close to the entrance because it's fairly far from the Lee Lee's.   The first thing you should do for yourself after you sit down is order the dumplings. For real. They are gargantuan and hearty and wonderful. I prefer them pan-fried, but the steamed are also great. They are probably my favorite dumplings in the entire world. Strong words, I know. Another appetizer I'd recommend is the assorted marinated meat platter. I couldn't for the life of me identify which meats they are, but are served cold and are excellent, and come with pickled vegetables that pair perfectly.   Also highly recommended are any of the stir fry noodles. My personal favorite are the beef with XO sauce, because they are just the perfect amount of spicy, in my opinion. We also had the noodles with spicy sauce (a separate menu item) and would probably pass on those next time. They're good, but just don't hold a candle to the stir fried.   This place is great for a casual meal, and super affordable. Things come out quickly, so you can get in and out in a reasonable amount of time. If you're looking for an affordable, authentic Chinese meal (that consists almost entirely of various shades of brown foods), then look no further."}
{"text":"So so so good!  What a delightful surprise. We stopped en route to CA, mainly because of the homemade noodles. But this place surpassed our expectation. Very good noodles, sauces, cooked to perfection. With great service to go along with it. Thank you for making my family happy eaters tonight!"}
{"text":"For those who hate kim chee, stay away, because the smell of it will hit you in the face like the horrible phoenix heat.  As soon as I get seated, they serve complimentry steamed peanuts and what looks like julienne carrots and white radish... yum!  I ordered the Beef Stew w/Noodles, and I swear, it look them literally 6 minutes to bring it out. Now that was quick!! I immediately scarf down the tasty broth with thin noodles, green onions, baby spinach, and what looked like chinese radishes. Very authentic. If you crave P.F. Chang's and Panda Express, you will probably not like this place.   It's cool since you can see the Noodle chefs going at it through the window of the kitchen, twisting and slapping those noodles!!  Service is not super friendly, but enough to get by. I wish I could only doc 1/2 a star since this place is ssoooo good. Eating here made me nostalgic just thinking of where I'm from (San Jose, CA).  I have now found an authentic Noodle House - - Not from the Bay Area, CA?! I am truly shocked.  $6.50 for my experience? Magical."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp so decided to give it a try.  You can easily see the noodles being made through the window from the dining room, looks like fun :)  Had read about the pot stickers (aka dumplings) so ordered those and I have never seen dumplings this big before, full of delicious meat filling. Also got the green beans which were crisp and fresh cooked with garlic.  The Hong Kong buns are like having a little dessert before the meal, lightly fried pillows of dough dipped in a sweet sauce, so good.  For the main dish and trust me after all the other stuff hardly had room, but ordered the stir fried chicken and wide noodles.  Very tasty big portion.  Have enough leftovers for another full meal for 2!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really cool and has some of the freshest Noodles in town. Just happened to be in the neighborhood and had to check them out. After all they have a dude in the back tossing noodle up and down and slamming them on a large table. You can see him through the kitchen window.  The menu here has a large assortment of different types of both noodle sizes and shapes. You can basically pick the type of noodle you want and they will make one of their tasty dishes to your specifications.  Inside is very nice with all the condiments you need right at your table. Some of the tables are bigger and can suport those crazy noodle parties that can spontaneously erupt.  Started with the Pan Fried Dumplings with dipping sauce. The plate was gigantic and could be a meal just by itself. Ordered the Seafood Noodle Soup with one of the larger flat noodles. Both dishes were delightful and I really enjoyed getting to doctor them up with their homemade hot sauce.  So many different things on the menu with several choices of flavors and textures. This place is really fun and a delicious treat. Can't wait to come back and try some of their other items. Hear that the Spicy Pig Ear is also very good. No Pun intended.  Located in the same parking lot as Lee Lee's. See ya there next time. MAGIC TAKES THE SHOT ... SCORES!  4.5 STARS"}
{"text":"Had the cold pig ears, pork noodle dish, and pan fried dumplings.  Meh, it was okay but not worth going back."}
{"text":"Well what can I say, this place is too legit to quit.  My wife, child, & I went to eat here on a whim and ordered about 5 things on the menu and each was equally good.  I can't say enough about this place, I am a Chinese food pro and this place is worth trying before any other.  Every one enjoyed the food, definitely a city treasure."}
{"text":"Chinese is usually not my cuisine of choice but I LOVE China Magic Noodle.   You get to peek in the kitchen and see the noodles made fresh. Everything here is quality from their ingredients to their to-go containers lol. Fast and friendly service. Everyone who've I've recommended to come here has also become regular customers.   My favorite dish is the seafood stir fry with shaven noodles (E) and the pan fried dumplings are a must!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Gyoza, pot stickers, mein and noodle soup.  Nothing else comes close."}
{"text":"All of the noodles are hand pulled so this is definitely a must visit! I was recommended to it by an elderly Chinese gentleman and I was not disappointed. You can choose what size and type of noodle you'll like and you can even watch them make it. The noodles can come with vegetables, meat, and either on a plate or as a soup.  We ordered The Beef Rib Noodle Bowl and The Beef Noodle with Oyster Sauce plate. Both were very delicious! I did however find the plate more flavorful than the bowl, so I recommend that one more.  The service was exceptional! A young woman helped us who had an incredible amount of patience and was very sweet. Also, our order did not take very long at all.  Also, the bathroom is gorgeous. It's gold leafed so definitely take a look at that.  I actually look forward to coming back very soon. I'm so happy that we have an authentic Chinese noodle house in the valley."}
{"text":"The food is good, and the best part is the ability to see the noodles they make but at the end of the day their food tastes similar to other restaurants in the same category.  The atmosphere is boring and it is plain. Not an intimate restaurant, not fancy and typical casual dining."}
{"text":"Pretty good variety.  Been here a few times.  Hit or miss. Sometimes really flavorful,  sometimes bland. I think I just don't know what to order.  Small place.  Staff is pleasant"}
{"text":"I was actually against going to this place, but my boyfriend insisted and was drawn in to these hand-pulled noodles. So off we went...  Plenty of parking in front of this corner resto in the plaza. Open til 10pm I believe on Saturday. Typical Asian joint. We got the assorted marinated meat combo appetizer (which tasted awesome IN my soup). I went for the oxtail soup while the boyfriend had beef noodles in oyster sauce. Both of course with the hand pulled noodles.  We both slurped up all of our noodles. Happy tummies! And very friendly on the wallet. Great find on our short visit to Arizona."}
{"text":"I love funky food and the marinated pig ear is really nice. Love that you can watch them hand pull their noodles fresh to order. Being right next to Lee Lee Market you can have a bite to eat and get inspired to go next door and look for the off the wall ingredients to go and make your own at home. Only thing I don't like is it is a 45 minute drive from my house."}
{"text":"Took off a star and a half because the novelty of the hand pulled noodle show has worn off and to be honest I don't think the hand pulled noodles taste any better than store bought dried noodles, or dare I say it, not even as good, and aside from the fresh noodle show I don't think the dishes here are that good.  I'll just be going back to all my favorites a few miles further north on Dobson, or just around the corner at Peking Palace - oops I mean Phoenix Palace - Peking Palace is my favorite in Tucson.  2 1/2 stars rounded up to 3."}
{"text":"Beef noodles with oyster sauce. Thats dat shit I do like! Nothing fancy here. If you're lookin to grub, this is just the place! The steamed dumplings are huge and delicious. Get them!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty food but. I was sick so I don't know if it was that or if the soup was loaded with MSG, but my mouth was pretty dry and scratchy afterward. There was also .5 in of a sharp wooden skewer in my soup. They said it was to add flavor to the broth?? Pretty sure it was just a skewer that wasn't caught. I denied the discount and just told them to be more careful. Maybe I'd come back for the dry noodle dishes."}
{"text":"Fast service,amazing pot stickers,good prices. Tons of food that is freshly made. Will go again"}
{"text":"love this place! i really like their soups and how you can see the guy in the kitchen window making fresh dough and stretching it to make noodles!everything is fresh and looks like a clean atmosphere.its a small hidden place in the leelee market plaza.its like a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Special today was salt and pepper shrimp.  Lightly dusted with corn starch and magic then deep fried and topped with jalapenos. all gone, tails and all =9"}
{"text":"Best place for hand pulled noodle along with pan fried dumplings!  Not much to say about this place other than it is a crowded lot, but the food here was surprisingly good for being in Arizona."}
{"text":"Saw a noodle house advertised and wondered where it was.  Been eating at Phoenix Palace for several months before I discovered China Magic.  First time we were the only patrons in the restaurant; my friend from Long Island is very particular about her Chinese food; she loves this place.  My other friend is very picky about food to begin with; but still he loves this place.  So, we brought another friend from the Philippines and he really loves this place.  Just mostly stick to the noodle dishes.  Wish the drive wasn't so far; but definately be back."}
{"text":"I came here once a long time ago and found their food rather bland so I swore to myself I'd never return. This week, I mistakenly returned to this restaurant not knowing I had been in before until my order came and I remembered the taste of their broth. It is realllllllllly bland. But I notice their clientele is on the older side and maybe these older Asians prefer their soup on the more watery side (I've had asian soups that taste intentionally bland before) so I can't dock them completely because it didn't fit my taste. And their noodles are very good. They have a nice texture to them. But their lamb soup was just filled with bones and I felt rather shorted for my meal because I barely got any lamb meat to eat. And I had to work for my meat by sucking it off the bone, which was not easy! I did give them credit for hospitality tho because when I brought it to their attention, the server said he would bring me more meat. Sadly tho, the extra meat was just extra bones, so I was still extremely disappointed. I am now bookmarking this restaurant as a restaurant not to return to. But if you like bland soup with tasty noodles, I'd say come here and experience their noodles. I really want to give them 1-2 stars for food taste in my personal experience but feel that would not give them some credit for their hospitable service after serving me my gross (and dangerous!) food. So thru get a mediocre 3..."}
{"text":"Love the hand made fresh noodles and their steam dumplings made by home made dough. Good price good value. However, recently I found the noodle quality is not very stable. One time, the very popular noodle C ox tail soup is cooked perfectly tender, another time the thickest kind of noodle ox tail soup was not completely cooked.  The dumpling meat favor is so strong that my hubby can't tell it's pork, which is a good thing to us, because he doesn't like pork, if he knows ahead, he probably won't even try. Anyway, the meat favor is so strong that even he knows it's pork later, he still didn't mind and ate them all :) like!"}
{"text":"I was in town from L.A. visiting family and friends for the holidays and thought I'd try this place out. What a disappointment, the noodles were rubbery and the potstickers sucked. The only thing good was the broth. I'm pretty sure there are some good items to eat but my order was a disappointment. The service wasn't very good too."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best noodles I have ever had I ordered number 34 and it was a Amazing it said spicy but it wasn't overwhelming it's a noodle stir fry with veggies and beef also that the dumplings omg perfect in size and more then enough per order will be returning very soon to get my noodle and dumpling fix"}
{"text":"Best Noodles In Town!!!  I love China Magic Noodle so much that when people ask for a good Chinese restaurant I always tell them China Magic Noodle!  A few people that I have told about this restaurant have come back to me telling me how good it was.  The noodles are so delicious you will not be disappointed. I like that you can watch the chef make the noodles through the window. Because they're freshly made in house the noodles tend to be long, which I like.  The wait staff is very attentive too.   You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place the noodles are hand made, great prices, large portions, super quick and friendly staff !"}
{"text":"Fresh noodles . Soup broth was not that flavorful. But they were nice and fresh. . Service was a little slow. I need to try again. Noodles  were a little  over done. Prices were reasonable"}
{"text":"Ordered the seafood soup with regular noodles for takeout. The soup and noodles were both amazing! The regular sized noodles were huge (but not too big), I can't imagine how big any of the larger noodles are! The seafood soup had lots of seafood and a good variety. I like that they served the soup separately of the noodles and that I could add the amount of noodles to the soup as I wished. The serving was large enough to have a whole bowl leftover for the lunch the next day. I dare say it was even better the day after!  We also had an order of egg rolls, and spring rolls. I though the egg rolls a little bland and dry but the spring rolls were phenomenal! Highly recommended. Looking forward to trying more dishes."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the noodles are fresh and come with a texture thats unforgettable. There is a wide variety of noodles and rice dishes as well. I got the OX tail when i went and let me tell you it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I personally love this place. They have the BEST noodles ever. The only down side, although not a problem for me, is the smell. The people I take here only talk about the smell and how it stinks. But trust me, GET OVER IT. The food is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Man I love this place. I am so happy it rained today because what a good excuse to get a steaming bowl of noodles. Simply delicious and unique. I dream about these dumplings and can't go too long between visits! To the person who complained that the staff is not friendly: just keep on going to Applebee's and stay away from this gem. These are professionals. They ain't in it for the flair."}
{"text":"This quaint little noodle eatery has a cool window through which you can view the hand-drawn noodles being prepared. I tried the fried tofu, which was excellent - a generous serving of little bricks of soft beancurd covered in a thin crispy-chewy batter, accompanied by a zesty dipping sauce. I also ordered the seafood noodle soup and specified rice noodles.  The rice noodles were pretty bland, which was not the best choice for a dish with relatively delicately flavored seafood; but keep that in mind that this is one dish that was really meant to be made with wheat noodles (the default version of the dish), which would also have given the dish the proper chew texture. Nevertheless, the broth was tasty and I will remember to order the wheat noodles next time. The dining area itself very basic but spacious, service was efficient, and the offerings are pretty inexpensive."}
{"text":"Noodles are cooked right, and taste so creamy-buttery! The family ordered different things, soup, stir-fry and braised noodles. Everything was yummy, although the service was not the best. They were not very attentive at times, and the girl that gave us our check, almost thwrew it at us (don't know if by accident) saying 'thanks for coming\". The 4 stars are based on the food solely, service is lacking."}
{"text":"Beef stew noodle. The taste is okay, but a little salty."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal... Being next to Lee Lee's, I expected a run down Chinese restaurant (hole in the wall).  I walked into the complete opposite.  Great looking restaurant.  But that's not why I ever go out to eat.  I had their fried rice and it was spectacular (bargain too).  The first thing I noticed was that all the ingredients looked very clean.  It wasn't soaking wet with soy sauce.  Just the right amount of seasoning.  Perfect.  I can't wait to try their other meals."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite Chinese restaurant, I can't get enough of it.  No matter what you order, make sure to try the pan fried dumplings with it."}
{"text":"Very fun place to eat.  Super friendly and helpful staff allow you to understand this unique format for eating.  Great way to eat at your own pace and the food is light, full of variety, healthy and hugely flavorful.    Nice atmosphere that allows an intimate table for two or a decent sized group.  Comfortable, hip atmosphere.  BYOB allows you to not be disappointed with the wine list.  Great stuff!"}
{"text":"I really love this place! I come here for their hand shaved noodles and usually order beef in xoxo spicy sauce and it's always delicious!  I've also had their soups before and love them too. My husband and I recently tried the dumplings-we got an assortment of steamed and pan-fried-and they were huge and really tasty. My husband usually gets cold dishes and recently had the beef noodles with a lemon and garlic sauce. He chose the thick noodles and they were incredibly long but he figured out a way to eat them easily and he ate everything!   They serve generous portions and I love that their servers are the perfect level of attentive (they come as soon as you sit and seem to know exactly when I'm ready to order). I also love that you can watch them make the noodles :). Definitely worth trying if you like noodles."}
{"text":"This place is hidden away in a little strip mall but SO great!. It is super clean inside.They have lovely padded highchairs for the baby.  There is a window to the kitchen where you can watch the very nice man (he always waves and smiles to the kiddos) pulling your noodles to order right when you ask for them. It keeps the kids happy and busy watching him twirl and stretch the dough. The portions are big and inexpensive."}
{"text":"An acquaintance of mine from out of town had recommended this place to some friends of mine this afternoon, saying that it was better than noodle places in Seattle, Washington, so we had checked it out. I had ordered iced coffee with boba, as well as #34- Beef with Fried Noodles in XO Spicy Sauce.   The order seemed to have been brought to us fairly quickly, and the portion was fairly large; thus a good amount for the price of $7.95. I have a high level of spice tolerance, and so the level of spice was not very high for me, and I had ended up adding Sriracha sauce. However, it tasted good, and I would recommend trying this dish.  Also, the server was very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"One of my friends recommended this place to me and the food was ok, but made me super sick! :("}
{"text":"I think this place went downhill since the last time I went which probably was 3-4 years ago, did they change the owner? The owner back then was a skinny tall lady  I ordered what I usually ordered \"lamb soup\". Now they don't ask what type of noodles I want anymore  Taste? The soup has no flavor and the lamb is too salty. Well, that combination works quite well I guess but still, the whole bowl is rather flavorless to me  Service? The waitress gave us really little time to look at what we wanted to order. However, the food is served very fast. Making me wonder if they already prepped it before hand.   Price? The price is cheap honestly. I don't think they changed the price at all since forever"}
{"text":"I drove 45 minutes to get here. The place was chinatown cute and the menu looked bomb but the service was SKIMPY. They were nice enough but they seat you,, get your drinks/food to you and that's IT. We aren't high maintenance so it wasn't a big deal for us but I can see this being an issue for others.   3 of us got soups with different width noodles. I ordered the same type of noodles as my husband but when received, my noodles looked at least twice the width as his. The broth was ho hum just not enough of a savory type flavor and the noodles bland and tasted doughy. There were a couple things that were good (like the potstickers YUM, teriyaki chicken, fried tofu) but the general feeling at the table was an ehhhhhhhh :/  My  family politely chatted about maybe trying other items next time but I felt like there was alot of disappointment around the table (not to mention leftovers that no one wanted to take home).  Yelp-You totally let me down on this one :("}
{"text":"I think that the best part of this place is the authenticity. I went in and felt immediately at home. Family style seating, clean orderly seating, open windows, and you can even see them cook in the kitchen from your table!   I ordered the hand pulled noodles with spicy noodle sauce and the pork pan-friend dumplings. I wasn't enthusiastic about what I got though. I think what I expected was more of a Southeast Asian style, but what I got was East Asian. I wasn't a fan of the noodles in the sauce, but knowing where it was coming from, I think it would be excellent for the right person. The dumplings were large and intense. Two could have been a meal easily and were great for a side or appetizer, the sauce was sour and complimented the dumplings well, but the dough was almost too heavy for me. Again, I was expecting something lighter, but knowing now what they are, I'll get them when the time is right, but probably will go with a HK style dumpling next time.  The soups looked incredible, and I believe that most people in the restaurant had soup ordered, so I'll come back again and get that immediately. Each table was stacked with everything you'd need to eat: chopsticks, soup spoons, napkins, Siracha, soy sauce, etc. It was such an efficient place and the waiting-staff was great. If one was with a customer, the other was right there to help me out!  Thank you CMNH! I'll see you again and try something new!"}
{"text":"Best little secret!  Handmade noodles.   Delicious every time!   We would recommend the wide noodles. More flavor. They will run out because they are made in house.   Our favorites are the beef noodles and the fried rice.   Also quick service to go  check it out!!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is good. I usually get the chicken fried rice but I really like the dumplings and noodle soups (of course lol).  What i like most is the service -- everyone is friendly and the food comes out super quick. I would recommend it for weekday lunches if you only have an hour."}
{"text":"Amazing. Only regret is not going before now. Spicy beef noodle is the freshest flavor packed meal I have had in years. Lived and worked in San Francisco for years. I had given up on finding the same quality Chinese food in the Valley. I am very happily surprised and will be back"}
{"text":"You can really tell the difference with the homemade noodles. They are wonderful. The spring rolls were kind of strange for me. I would not get them again. We had the 16C and beef stew with A. Both were very flavorful. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is legit.   It's probably one of the few noodles houses in the Phoenix-area, unlike the myriad in California (which I so dearly miss).  I'm glad to see that the varieties of food are diversifying more and more now.  Anyways, grabbed lunch here with my mom earlier.  I got the zha jiang mian/noodles with minced pork sauce and my mom ordered the beef with fried noodles in XO spicy sauce.  The prices were relatively reasonable and the portions were generous, as you'll see from the pictures uploaded.  We both stuffed ourselves pretty well and still had leftovers to take home.  The dishes themselves were quite delicious, unlike anything else in Phoenix (at least in the East Valley).  The zha jiang mian/noodles with minced pork sauce wasn't too salty or overwhelming.  Just lots of thin noodles with ground pork with bits of garlic in a light brown sauce.  The dish was garnished with some green onions and raw cucumbers.  Definitely a good lighter dish.   The beef with fried noodles in XO spicy sauce was also quite appetizing, but a little on the oily side.  The waitress suggested we try the dish with the \"shave noodles\", which are hand-cut noodles that are wide, flat, and do not have a consistent shape unlike ordinary noodles.  The dish itself has a slight kick to it with some dried red chili peppers in it and contained a good helping of veggies and beef.  It even had a slight shiitake mushroom flavor to it, but there were no mushrooms to be found.  Either way, it was delicious.  Overall, my experience at this restaurant was pleasurable and I'd recommend it to anyone else looking to try a more authentic, less represented style of Chinese food here in the Valley.  *As an addendum: Food tends to come out quickly here so that is another big plus for this place."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow, they forgot one of my parties order and joked about it after. Noodled were fresh and good, portion was a bit small, good price, and soup was okay."}
{"text":"It's really difficult for me to locate above average Chinese restaurants, but I was pleasantly surprised upon encountering this place next to Lee Lee's Market. I'd return for the spicy stir fry noddles."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since moving to Chandler last month and especially after reading the reviews.  Ordered take out tonight and it was absolutely delicious!  They take \"carbs\" to a whole new level :)  The noodles stand on their own....you can absolutely tell that they are homemade.  The thick noodles (there are several varieties) with minced pork sauce have a wonderful savory flavor and include diced cabbage and green onions.  The egg rolls were just as delicious and even the chicken fried rice (I know, rice at a noodle place?) was perfectly prepared.  This will definitely be another \"go to\" spot in lovely Chandler :)"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome price, and the owner has never forgotten an order he took.  The prices have gone up a little since they first opened, but it's still very cheap, especially considering the portion size. I especially love the hot sesame/chilli oil that they have but it's kind of a hit and miss, Not always made right"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in greater Phoenix.  Hand made noodles that you can watch through the window.   The portions and prices are great.  They are a bit skimpy on the meat but regardless the dishes are not too salty or saucy.  I enjoyed the pan fried dumplings."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband on our date night and I must say, the noodles are delicious.  The texture had a nice bite to it, but not too al dente.  I had their beef noodle soup and my husband had their vegetable and beef fried noodles (lo mein).  Both were very good.  Best noodles I have had in AZ, hands down.  They only make one kind of noodle, but you can choose from a variety of shapes.    A warning however to those who have an aversion to certain meat sinew.  The beef that came in the my beef noodle soup came from, I believe, some cut of rib, straight off the bone.  So, although the beef was nice an tender, there were some pieces of sinew that were attached to most of my pieces of meat.  They were mostly tender, but some were a bit chewy.  Some people, like myself, actually enjoy eating these pieces of meat, but for those of you who don't, you might want to order a different kind of noodle soup.      We also ordered the pork steamed dumplings and the beef stick.I was not a big fan of the beef stick.  I think the cut of beef they use for the beef stick is not ideal for that type of treatment.  It was overdone, tough, and I wasn't too into the sauce.  I can't quite describe it except that it was a light soy sauce marinade, on the slightly sweet side, with little to no depth.    The steam dumplings were okay.  The dumpling skin is not typical; thin and delicate.  Simply based on the skin, they were very \"hearty\" dumplings.  I think they may use the same or similar dough recipe for their dumpling skins as with their noodles.  The filling was okay.  A bit on the mushy side for me and the sauce that they serve with it is lighter in terms of sweetness than most sweet and sour sauces.    The staff is very friendly and the prices are very reasonable.  Like my husband said, \"any time I am in the mood for some noodles [Chinese wheat noodles specifically] I am coming here.\""}
{"text":"This place is very good.  They have 5 different noodles, good sauce, and fresh vegetables.  They also have a window to see the noodles being made in house.  Prices are decent as well."}
{"text":"Best hand made noodles hands down.   Spicy xo beef is my favorite with the wide noodles. Dumplings are very good too, just very big"}
{"text":"Well worth a visit. #34 Beef w/ fried noodles in XO spicy sauce is bomb!! The #5 pan fried dumplings are also delicious and a meal in themselves."}
{"text":"I had the #34 with noodle C. The noodles were very good and the beef was tender. The dish was spicy enough to provide flavor, but did not overwhelm everything else.  I also enjoyed the #32 and the egg rolls."}
{"text":"so i discover this place through groupon, me and my fiance tried it out one day, its a bit far from where we live but since i save half price by  purchasing a groupon i figure the other half can pay for gas. plus since there's so much good reviews on this place.   i would say this place does have the best fresh noddles , my fiance order the beef noodle with broth, and i got the seafood fried noodles, they both tasted delicious i'm very satisfied with the place and food, its just if only my shrimp in the noodle i order were fresh and bigger shrimp and not frozen and tinny i'd definitely give a five star.im a big seafood person, i can taste when they're fresh or at least decent quality and when they're not."}
{"text":"If you crave authentic and freshly made Chinese egg noodled noodles,this restaurant delivers. It has a fairly unassuming presence and can easily be missed in the strip mall. Obviously Seafood Palace gets all the traction for dim sum, but we came here in the evening and were happy about our decision.  The first time I had flat wide fresh egg noodles, was in Xian in NYC. This is the only of the restaurant in Arizona that matched the quality.  We ordered Steve Jobs links, two flat noodle beef stews, medium sized noodle chicken stirfry, and sautéed  Chinese broccoli. The dumpling casing was so good and fresh that you could've eaten it even without the stuffing.  The soup bowls were packed with noodles and other ingredients. The flavor was flawless.  After eating for fantastic dumplings, I could only finish half of my soup.   The restaurant may not be fancy, but the food is done just right and deserves five stars."}
{"text":"We tried this place based on all of the great reviews.  It was hard to find, but we eventually made it.  It was crazy noisy inside too and quite hot.  I must say, while the flavors were good, and the fresh noodles were great, everything was quite greasy.  We drained a 1/4 cup of oil from our egg rolls onto a plate and napkin.  The fried noodles with chicken were also swimming in oil.  I may try one more time and get some that are not fried and hope that they are better."}
{"text":"Awesome noodle place that serves hand-pulled knife-cut noodles. If you doubt that these noodles are hand-pulled, just look through the window into the kitchen and get a glimpse of the chefs freshly making your noodles for you.  This is a pretty authentic Chinese restaurant that had many dishes to choose from I was in the mood for noodle soups so that's what I went for. I ordered the beef noodle soup and was offered a choice of 5 different noodles. They all looked good but I went with Option E (knife-cut) and absolutely did not regret my decision. The noodles tasted extremely fresh and the soup was quite brothy. I did add some Siracha sauce for extra flavor but the soup was good on its own as well."}
{"text":"I have been itching to go here for the fresh noodles which seems like forever. I ordered the beef with oyster sauce with flat wide noodles, I was expecting a nice dark, flavorful sauce but it was light & pretty mild. I wouldn't order it again. Other people with me got beef & chicken stir fry which I tried & it was PHENOMENAL! I didn't care for the dumplings because it was basically just meat with the dumpling wrapper. I will be back soon for some chicken stir fry!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes based on previous reviews and were disappointed on all counts. Service was terrible. Our waiter stood with his back to us chatting with the other servers. He forgot our tea - not a huge problem except the water tasted like chlorine. Appetizers arrived after we were served the main course. The salt and pepper fish was good, but pretty flavorless. The vegetables and noodles were very salty. Vegetables were only cabbage and bean sprouts. The only reason this got two stars is the noodles were good.  Decor is basic- one step above school cafeteria."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I've tried a few items off the menu and I have yet to have something I didn't like. There were some complaints about the fried dumplings not being good, but idk what people are talking about! First of all, they're huge dumplings, so you get enough bang for your buck. Seriously, they're very good. If you go, you have to have their noodle dishes. My favorite noodle dish is the minced pork....so good! Also, idk why, but every time I go, I have to get the chicken teriyaki on a stick. So simple, yet so so good. I also always get one of their smoothies, usually with the tapioca or the coconut jello. Great place! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Everything I have tried here has been wonderful. My favorite are the shaved noodles and the dumplings! There is a window into the kitchen so my kids (and I) love to watch the cook hand stretch the noodles and make our soup."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy the food here. Make sure you get the boiled peanuts and pickled radishes before your meal arrives. I usually get the egg noodle vegetable soup, perfect bowl of noodle soup when the craving hits. The tables have delicious hot chili oil to add to your liking. Shrimp fried rice is also great. Love to watch the hand pulled noodles too."}
{"text":"The hand pulled noodles were chewy and cooked perfectly. The sauce was not too salty or soy saucey. The fried rice was crispy and not overly cooked."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The noodles are the perfect texture. Love every dish I've tried here. Love that there's a large open window to view the back kitchen to see a behind-the-scenes view!"}
{"text":"Amazing food by a great staff. We have been looking for a decent  noodle house since we left the culturally diverse Bay Area and we stumbled upon this gem.  I had the Beef Noodle soup and it was perfect, not too salty or too bland.  We also had the dumplings and they were not your tiny little frozen steamed and fried version these were obviously hand made and were full of meat. I would highly recommend this place and look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"1. Bathroom is sparkling clean. Tells me te kitchen would be too.   2. Yes, handmade noodles...you can watch them do it all day long.  3. Stellar service both times.   4. Very VERY reasonable prices.   5. Omg best soup and wontons ever. For real. Seriously. Really really real for seriousness.   6. We are the only white people. All Asians eating here. This is key to knowing if an Asian restaurant is good."}
{"text":"I have been twice now.  The thing that assaults me as soon as I walk in the door is the smell of baby poop.  I have no idea what causes the smell but it is very strong.  My children noticed and mentioned it to me the moment they walked through the doors also.  The sat at the table with their noses plugged.  My kids liked the Deep Fried Tofu for $3.50 and it was a good portion size.  8 large chunks of tofu.    I tried the Braised Noodle with Sesame Paste (vegetarian) for $4.  It was so plain with very little taste.  Tasted slightly like peanut sauce.  I had to cover it in srarachi to get it down because I was so hungry.  Kids liked the Beef with Fried Noodles for  $7.95.  With the tofu it was enough food for my 3 kids that I brought home leftovers of both the noodles and tofu.  I tried the Vegetables with Fried Noodles on my first trip for $7.25.  They were just okay.  Even though the noodles are being made right there and you can watch through the window the taste was very similar to Panda Express to me.  Had three of the smoothies- Watermelon, Papaya and Strawberrry- all with boba.  The boba was pretty good but the smoothies weren't great.  I prefer Boba House around the corner in the same shopping center.  I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Anytime I get a craving for savory I'm usually thinking I need to head to magic noodle. I love that you can watch the noodles being made in the window and that the service is so quick.   I get the wide noodles usually, and I've had some salt and pepper shrimp, and salt and pepper crab that I would leave a loved one for. No joke. I thought it was kind of hard to find at first and that the prices for drinks were pretty high, especially for a really small Thai tea, but eh, I guess I'll take that over any other place."}
{"text":"First-time hand pulled noodler here.  They're so great!  With a little bit of chew to them and the non-homogeneity to keep it interesting, and whatever flour they use is awesome.  They were like a cross between buckwheat soba and pho noodles in texture.  I want them all the time.  Three of us had soup noodles.  You pick your sauce/topping, then one of five kinds of noodles to go with it.  All three soups were super, with not too salty, flavorful broths and lots of meat.  I only wish there were more vegetables in my soup, but I guess it's a Chinese thing.    We also got the spicy pig ears.  The large is a waaaay big plate, and they come with a little bit of pickled vegetable slaw too.  My first time, I think, having pig ear.  I don't know how to describe it... gelled?  Firm?  It's worth trying just because the texture is so different from other animal parts, and because it's an interesting animal part, but I probably won't get it again.  Too much meat for me.  Quick, tasty, cheap.  Not the healthiest though."}
{"text":"They have really nice hand pulled noodles, with various choices of soup broth, or sauce and ingredients based.  They make the noodles here themselves and it is its key ingredient.  I like their beef noodles soup which comes with broth and pieces of beef.  One complain which leads to their 4 star is the lack of pieces of meat.  Noodles aplenty but the condiments and meat are not enough.  I had only a few pieces of lamb with my lamb noodles soup.  Do order their combination appetizer plate which comes with pieces of cold cut meats.  Also, the wait is very long if u come on the weekends and during lunch time.  Remember to flag down a employee and get a number, its pretty chaotic with no one at the front, but U need a number so U can get a seat when they have one.  But I will be back, for sure, thanks to their good noodles and tasty broth."}
{"text":"We have been trying pho and ramen places around Tempe and Chandler and this may be the best ever. the beef is perfectly tender and seasoned and the broth is so tasty one could drink it alone. Best this though...noodles. Hand made noodles that are so delicious and perfectly chewy! I ordered the XO beef with noodles and although it could be saucier and spicier but so tasty. Oh, they give you a tiny plate of boiled peanuts and kim chi to start which only gets you excited to eat their food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First off, the portions are HUGE and the food quality is great! Delicious.  We ordered pan fried dumplings as an appetizer - they were huge and delicious - stuffed to overflowing. I think six came in the order, so there is a bunch to share with your friends.  We also ordered marinated pig ear, cold. It was good, but you have to like that kinda chewy texture. Maybe just a novelty to try, but good nonetheless.  I ordered the seafood soup with wide noodles. The noodles were fantastic - firm and chewy and fresh. You can even watch the guys make the noodles by hand through the window in the kitchen. The soup was loaded with shrimp, scallops, fish balls (like chewy meatballs), and a few veggies here and there.   My dad got the standard beef lo-mein or some such thing - he enjoyed it (and had a ton left to bring home). My mom got the beef soup with the skinny noodles - she enjoyed it also, especially the noodles.  I will definitely be back to try more stuff on their menu. It was busy at lunch time, but we only had to wait for like 10 minutes. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Fun spot! You get to watch them make your homemade noodles! Dumplings are large and enough for a meal. We will be back!"}
{"text":"How fresh can noodles be?  They make it fresh by hand right in front of you.   The stir fried noodle with XO sauce is to die for."}
{"text":"I was not impressed! The staff was OK but I have to call into question the freshness. We ordered our food and literally our food was out in two minutes...and we ordered a lot. This was our first time (and the last time) here. We ordered egg rolls, dumplings, minced pork & beef in XO sauce. How could it ALL come out so fast AND be fresh? The noodles were lukewarm & microwaved, especially the minced pork dish. The egg rolls tasted refried and bland. My wife ordered hot tea which came warm in a plastic soda cup.The best part was the dumplings. Very good and one order is enough. We felt uncomfortable there, packed up a horrible meal & left. One to the next one!"}
{"text":"Meh, just meh. I was sooooo excited to try this place and not just because it has the greatest name of all time. The noodles were good, don't get me wrong, I mean, you can actually watch the chef's pulling the noodles in the kitchen, but the food was just meh. I felt like it lacked flavor which was truly disappointing. The ratio of noodles to veggies in the chow mein was off. With all the other great Asian food options out there I don't really see myself coming back."}
{"text":"The restaurant contrary to alot of chinese restaurant it is a very clean establishment.  They even have an open kitchen!!!!  but if u were looking for good servise, this might be the wrong place for you, we all know with most of the authentic asian restaurant \"good servise\" doesn't really go with their menu. (haha just kidding, but no really the servise was just okay).  You can see the chef making the noodles from scratch through a display window it is actually cool.  If you are looking for a real \"hand pulled\" noodle house, this is it!!"}
{"text":"Very good soup, as usual and the homemade noodles are awesome.  I didn't get condiments this time like they usually give with the soup ?????"}
{"text":"Beef stew x Ox tail soup noodles, beef tendon and chef special, hot and spicy crawfish. Perfect combination on this chilly night  #chinamagicnoodlehouse"}
{"text":"HUGE FAN OF THE POTSTICKERS! I also had the spicy noodles with the \"thick noodles\". They were good as well but next time i would try them with a smaller noodle. Staff was nice and helpful and on their recommendations the next time I visit i will try a few different things."}
{"text":"This is what I would say is a great Chinese joint with fast service and good quality food.  Be aware, this place is not Panda Express so don't come here and complain they don't have orange chicken.  That's not what this place is about.  It's about the noodles!  They do have a smaller menu with the variety really about the kind of noodle you can order (different widths and thickness of the hand made noodles).  Thus the aptly name of the shop.    My favorite things to get are their garlic green beans, mix of thinly slice beef parts (tendon, ear, and shank) and and their XO beef noodles.  The pan fried dumplings come out nice and hot and every time I have had them, it is crunchy on the bottom as it should be!  I have tried many of their noodle dishes and other than the XO noodles, the minced pork with sliced cucumbers noodles and beef noodles are my second and their favorite.  They do give a hearty portion of noodles.  I don't know why but I feel that the thinner noodles are better because the sauce and other flavor coat them better but that's just a personal preference.  Ultimately, what drives me back here even though it is in Chandler (and I live in Tempe, right next to ASU so it is a 20 min drive) is the reasonable prices and fast service.  They really do a great job and I have never in my years of eating here had to wait very long before the food comes. Yes, it is true the inside decor, chairs, and table are kind of worn and well-loved but who cares?  The chopsticks are clean and the food is awesome - that's all the Asians care about when it comes to food!  Just like in Taiwan - we'll happily sit on a bucket and  slurp down the cheap and great tasting noodles with the greatest of joy!"}
{"text":"Good dumplings, they're huge! It's a meal in itself.   Stir fry noodles are great. I like the seafood better than the xo beef. Didnt really taste any xo sauce, seems like they just added a bit of chili oil and some whole fried chilis (like the ones that come in Kung pao)  Noodles with minced pork - I was skeptical at first because it didnt look promising based off the photos I've seen but it was really good. Good flavor.   Beef stew - will not order again. Beef was tough n chewy, not edible. Broth was bland."}
{"text":"I love this place! We used to live in chandler and we have dined in and gotten take out, never had any complaints. Take out is nice for the soups because the noodles come in a separate container from the broth, I usually keep some noodles in reserve and have used them to make my own stir fry noodle dish the next day or freeze them for later. The beef stew is my go to for the soups, but I also like the beef stir fry in spicy Xo sauce! We always get an order of the dumplings, they are huge and we always have left overs.   I overall would recommend this place, but as always it's not for everyone. You won't find New York style Chinese dishes here, but you will find delicious hand made noodle dishes and who doesn't love to support a local business!"}
{"text":"It is magic that in this modern age that the noodles are not mass produced very far from my table.   One of the fun aspects of this place is the window in to the kitchen where they pull noodles. I had my back to it and managed to get a good amount of sauce on my short trying to catch a glimpse of the noodle artists in action.   The menu is a pretty good size, however there are only 3-4 vegetarian options.  The waiter was nice enough to make a few recommendations and modifications.   Prices are low about $7 per dish. The dishes are a bit on the Smaller side for us big Americans so if you have a few people get 1 extra and share.  We had the veggie noodles and noodles with sesame paste. The veggie ones were quite familiar with the wake taste beansprouts and other veggies  The one with the sesame paste was great, but could have used a veggie to offset the texture.  bottom line fun place good food but limited veg options."}
{"text":"A well deserved 5 star restaurant. Cheap and authentic. Fresh pulled noodles everyday. Fast service, lots of space and clean environment."}
{"text":"Must have some Asian food....  Okay, I packed up the kids and headed for Lee Lee's Market.  As I turn into the parking lot I saw the Noodle House.  \"You guys want to have noodles for lunch?\"  I asked my niece, nephew and son.  \"Yes!\"  they replied.  Almost all kids love noodles.  I only know of one kid that does not like any type of noodle or pasta.   We were seated right away.  My niece informs me that the table smelled funky.  I had them re-wipe it once more.  Then out comes the boiled peanuts and sweet pickled daikon and carrots.  That explains it!  The vinegary pickled daikon is to blame.    There are poster sized pictures of the dishes on the walls in case you want to know how your dish should look like.  It's about 100 degrees and we felt like eating Ox tail soup and seafood soup ($5.75 each).  I asked for 3 extra bowls for sharing.    Hours of boiling soup bones lend to the beefy broth of the ox tail soup loaded with ramen, baby spinach and other greens.   Not much meat, but I really like the broth.  The seafood soup consisted of shrimp, bay scallops, fried fish balls, squid, ramen noodles, spinach and other greens and herbs.  The kids enjoyed their meals.  We'll be back to try the other dishes.  Awesome prices, too!"}
{"text":"Freshly made to order hand pulled noodles in stir fry or soup style with huge pan fried potstickers all house made. Great to eat in or take out!"}
{"text":"Noodles just didn't taste good. Good presentation of how the noodles were made, but it did not taste right."}
{"text":"Definitely the type of place where there may be some hit or miss dishes but the hits will keep you coming back.  One of those places where i'll crave it frequently.  The noodles are always nice and fresh with a good consistency."}
{"text":"I just polished off a few things and I'm actually having a hard time figuring out what I liked most.  Ordered the #34 per another user's recommendation and it is pretty not bad - definitely spicy!  Enjoyed the pan fried dumplings - fat and flavorful!  Very tasty - definitely a re-do.  And ordered the #56 Salt and Pepper Shrimp.  Wasn't sure what to expect with that one, but it's basically tempura shrimp with sliced jalapenos on a bed of lettuce.  Good enough for me - I topped my noodles with the extra roughage from the shrimp and kept going.  I'd go on, but I really need another drink and something to keep my nose from running - it was nice and spicy, oh so worth it.  Will be going back to explore more options!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chinese place in Chandler. It's super cheap and you get tons of food, and the noodles are fantastic (and also hand pulled).   I have always ordered the seafood hand-pull noodle plate with handpull noodles. Take out or eat in, this is a great option for anyone who needs to eat fast (they normally operate very quickly)."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing..  The noodles are made fresh and you get to choose the thickness or thinness and style of noodle you like.  They don't speak great English there and I was trying to get them to find a way for a newsletter to remind me they exist because the place is fantastic but I always forget but to go there.  There are large portions and the price is definitely definitely affordable"}
{"text":"Loved every last noodle. Which, might I add, are homemade and there's a window you can look through to watch them make your dinner. There are multiple shapes to choose from as well.   My friends and I came here and got the seafood noodle plate which resembles a Chinese Alfredo, sliced beef noodle soup and vegetable egg noodle soup with spinach, cilantro, and green onions. All three dishes came with a heaping mound of noodles and none of us finished.   Prices were great! $5.75-$9 for a ginormous serving.  Good service! Ladies were super helpful and nice.   If you're in the area and want some great noodles, please oh please, come here. Delish."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Chinese noodle restaurant in town.  I lived in China for 10 years, and it is great to speak to the owners in mandarin.  The food is very delicious, and with a wide variety of hand pulled noodles.  One of the best parts is the window to the kitchen.  Have you seen noodles pulled by hand before?  Well here instead of seeing pizza dough being tossed, it's noodles.  And it is nothing like you would imagine!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Arizona since 2014,  I discover this restaurant totally by chance but I like it so much that I keep coming back for more,  my nephew moved here to chandler since November last year and he and his wife love it and will come back again"}
{"text":"Husband, step-son and I went here for Christmas Day lunch.  We all agreed it was so very, very tasty!  We ordered steamed dumplings.  YUM!  Next time that is ALL I will order. :)  I had the chicken and noodles dish, which I think was much better than my companions dishes.  Husband had beef and step-son had pork.  They both liked my chicken and noodles dish.  I can't remember the number on the menu.    If you are looking for great ambiance, décor, etc, forget it.  You won't find it here.   We prefer hole in the wall places like this where we always find great food.  No language barriers for us...service was prompt and friendly.    Definitely a great find for us!  Jeez, now I have to go wipe the saliva from the corners of my mouth."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Hand pulled noodles are awesome and I love how fobby it is!    This place gets awesome-points for hand pulled noodles, looking like Taiwan, inexpensive pricing, big portions, and the large window that allows you to look into their kitchen and watch the guy make noodles.  I must say I'm hard on Asian restaurants because I've eaten lots of Taiwanese/Chinese cuisine in the bay area and LA.    The food here is authentic.  The taste is pretty good if you order the right things.  The beef noodle soup could be better; if you do have a hankering for \"hong shao niu rou mian\", this will allieve it but you'll probably think there's something missing from it.  Favorites:  Noodles in spicy sauce (vegetarian) Beef noodles with oyster sauce"}
{"text":"Their noodle soups are Great, I would have to rate them beyond expectation. I've been to Taiwan and tried Taiwanese noodle, this place is IT. The waiters known us by name. Since I always come here after stop by the boba shop next door, one time I didn't bring my boba and the lady owner even gave me their Boba free of charge. Great food, Great price, Great service."}
{"text":"Kids and I ate there on Friday 9-24-10 for dinner.  Not being \"regulars\" to this sort of food, we did not really have any idea what to expect.  The kids loved watching the dude pulling the noodles.  They each gave him a dollar in his tip jar.  We loved the ground seasoned pork on hand-pulled ramen-sized noodles.  5 Stars for that puppy.  The oxtail soup was \"OK\" as was the beef noodle soup.  Not overly salty, but really, not a LOT of taste.  It did not make any of us say, \"Yum Yum !!\" after the first bite.  All in all, an average meal."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic CHINESE style ramen I've had in AZ. The best thing is that the noodle is made fresh. You can even see the chef toss/stretching the dough through the glass. The beef in the beef noodle soup is very tender, which is a plus plus in my book! The beef stew broth was also very flavorful. A bowl of noodles was only $7! I'll be going back real soon!"}
{"text":"Tried this place it for the first time with my boyfriend and everything was delicious!!! We shared the pan fried dumplings which were delicious. He and I each got our own entree but it was entirely too much food. He ordered the beef stir-fry with spicy xo sauce. Holy cow!!!!! His was amazing! By far the best noodles I've had. I got a chicken stir fry with shaved noodles and that was amazing too. Loved watching the noodles being made and the staff was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of potstickers this is the place for you.  It's been a bit since I have been here and my memory is a bit fuzzy on the details but I do remember some amazing potstickers that were enormous and enough to make a meal out of at a fair price. I remember they were full of meat and the noodle case was not to thick but enough to hold things together when you cut into it and provide solid doughy goodness not the slimy sort found elsewhere.    Half the reason I'm doing this review is so I remind myself to come back with a group of friends to try some more of menu items and share an order of potstickers so I don't leave over stuffed.   I will be sure to update my review when I get back over there."}
{"text":"Visited here a few more times & tried a few more dishes but just can't get over the overly doughy noodles in both soup & stir fry.  Guess this style of noodles is not for me after all.  At least the service got a little better now."}
{"text":"This is a smallish interior sparsely decorated home made noodle house. No a lot of English is spoken here but communication wasn't difficult. The steamed dumplings to start were ginormous! Beautiful flavor and done just right. From the menu you pick what you want and then your size of noodle. I got the seafood soup with wide noodles. Hot and fresh it arrived with so much parsley on the top it over took all of the soup flavor. Seafood was done right but no flavor whatsoever to the broth other then parsley. Next time I will considering ordering chicken or pork so the broth will have flavor. Make sure to bring your chopstick skills, not a fork in sight. (I'm sure if we asked we would have gotten one). Tables were slightly sticky.... all and all, good fresh food at a very reasonable price. AND you get to watch them make noodles!!!"}
{"text":"So exciting to have a local restaurant that makes chinese noodles from scratch.  The noodles at China Magic Nodle House are delicious (and cheap)!  The decor is typical little-Phoenix-strip-mall, but the environment is NOT why you come to a place like this!  I like noodle dishes where you can actually taste the noodles...can't go wrong with the beef chow fun.  I am excited to return to try some of the other noodle dishes."}
{"text":"Just one word.... Perfect  Hand pulled noodles to order. Beef in XO sauce is my main go to however the dumplings are the size of your head. Well not really just the size of golf balls"}
{"text":"I went based on an article in the New Times.  I ordered the fried noodles with chicken, and my girlfriend ordered noodles with spicy sauce.  Both were great.  The menu isn't very friendly to those not familiar with asian food, but it had a very good selection.  I want to go back and try one of their soups...they looked wonderful.   Also, it's fun to watch the noodles being made by hand."}
{"text":"I am in love with this joint. Let me break it down to you, there is something very magical about the handcrafted noodles and the seasoning of the broth. Every time I visit Arizona, I have to make a pilgrimage here. I don't care if the weather is blazing over 100 degrees in the summer or dropping down to 20 degrees in the winter desert; I just have to come and get my fix. The lady owner is super sweet and the waiters are also very attentive and nice. (Also if you're feeling under the weather and need some soup, this is such an ideal place.) Otherwise, for all the Cantonese people in the area who need their soup fix, this is it. Lastly, the food is very affordable, hence why I love this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place, always get the spicy stir fry noodles. I should try something else, but when it comes time to order I have to get #34."}
{"text":"I lalalove this place! A friend came with and enjoyed it too! The food was great, the restaurant is clean. We had the shaved noodles with pork, regular noodles with beef, chicken fried rice (real chicken), and pan fried dumplings! Leftovers are delicious!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly Great.  Was not sure by the looks of the place, but don't be fooled.  This place is Da Bomb.  I'm a huge Chinese Food fan and this place did not disappoint.   Fried rice Broccoli rabi  Shrimp and corn curry noodles (this was the best surprise dish) Stir fry (we had 4 different ones) Dumplings are HUGE and delicious"}
{"text":"Ordered the vegetable noodles and substituted the boiled egg for a fried one (how I like to eat it). Noodles were delicious and fresh. Only downside is that \"vegetable\" meant a little bit of spinach and some cilantro.   The pan-fried dumplings were surprisingly the best part of the meal. Really chunky dumplings with lots of meat inside and fresh tasting skin.   Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"They know how to cook but service appears to be a problem.  The taste and quality of their dishes are a five but service is a two at best.  Let me give you an example.  We ordered egg rolls, pan fried dumplings, the Seafood (Shrimp, Scallops, Squid & Fishball) with Soup Noodles,  and Beef With Stir-Fried Noodles In Xo Spicy Sauce.  Everything was delicious but the order of served dishes was funky!  After just a few minutes they brought my son's soup, hot and steaming.  He thought he could wait until they delivered my noodle dish and of course our appetizers.  About ten minutes later out came my noodles, hot steamy and delicious.  Another 10 minutes and the eight huge dumplings were brought to the table.  We were finishing up our food and asked what happened to the egg rolls and they replied they were coming.  Five minutes later they brought the egg rolls which we ate as our dessert!  The food is too good not to return, but I will be sure to quarterback their delivery so I can eat in the appropriate order."}
{"text":"I got their spicy stir fry and it was really good.  I also got their dumplings steamed and it has just meat in it, no veggies, and its better fried.  The restaurant has the hot oil chilli sauce as well as sriracha so thats cool.  It was my first time going, and id probably come back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"We like this place.  The noodles are always fresh (they make them, and you can watch them!), and the food always tasty.  The quality of the service depends on how busy they are and which server you get.  If they're busy the service is spotty even with the better server.  This visit we got the server who doesn't seem to want to be there.  She's mostly indifferent but if you ask for stuff she will bring it.  The food is good.  Some of the best noodles anywhere.  We will keep coming back as long as that is true."}
{"text":"They have authentic chow mein. My favorite is Beef chow mein with XO sauce. It tastes like the ones I used to have on the side of streets when I was in college in China."}
{"text":"Just your average hole in the wall Chinese restaurant. I got the Mongolian Beef and all I can really say about it is that it is average. If you're in the area and craving Chinese food this is definitely a good fix but I wouldn't go here unless I was already nearby."}
{"text":"This place has amazingly low prices and really fast service.   The atmosphere of this place is pretty authentically Chinese. I could imagine seeing a place like this in Chinatown. I'd categorize food as Asian comfort food. There's nothing incredibly flashy about any of their dishes, but it always hits the spot. The prices are also incredibly low, even by Arizona standards. You're pretty much guaranteed to be really full while spending less than $10.   Despite the low prices, the service here is actually very good. Waiters are patient and will get your food out to you very fast. They don't have that slightly rude attitude that a lot of Chinese places will have. The employees are also really helpful and will make suggestions if you are overwhelmed by the incredible number of noodle options. There have also been many times when someone at our table orders some sort of combo and our waiter has suggested that he order it in a different manner that would produce the same results with cheaper pricing. The one problem is that, once in a while you get a waiter who speaks mostly Chinese. This isn't usually an issue for me, but if this is your first time coming here as a nonChinese speaker, I'd imagine it could be a little off putting.  I recommend this place if you're looking for someplace cheap, fast, and filling. I know I definitely will be back next time I swing by AZ."}
{"text":"The quality and freshness of the ingredients is 2nd to none.  They are known for noodle dishes obviously and the \"Noodles in Soup\" as it says on the menu are remarkable. You can customize your order if you like (i.e. add fried egg)  Handmade noodles are made at time of ordering. This is ever so apparent in the window to the kitchen where all the \"magic\" ;) happens.  All the noodle soups I've tried have been very good. So far the only broth I did not like was the chicken which I did my best to doctor up using the condiment carousel of soy sauce, vinegar, hot chili oil and sriracha. My favorite dish they make is noodles with minced pork sauce....I drool just thinking about it.  For my personal experience, dine in customer service was more enjoyable than take out customer service.  Don't forget that Lee Lee's market is in the same plaza so you can pop in there while you're in the area.  This one of a kind noodle place is definitely worth the drive across Valley!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of the place fool you, the inside is a regular hubbub of activity. You can watch full grown adults try to inconspicuously push other smaller adults and children out of the way whilst smushing their face up against the glass window to get a better view of the chefs hand pulling noodles. It's simply mesmerizing to watch. Not only was there prime window watching going on but the rest of the place was crazy busy too. Packed full of people and for a reason because the food is delicious, prices are beyond reasonable and the service is solid."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and I always order the same thing over and over. Pan fried Dumplings and X.O stir fry noodles with beef.  I love how the noodles are freshly made here. You can actually see them make the noodle through the window. The prices here are reasonable.   What I love about the X.O. Noodles are the spices and fresh noodles mainly. I am not really a big fan of the beef here it just taste slimy for some reason. They probably use some type of flour to make the beef wet and slimy. I think it would've taste better with hand cut steak.   The service here is great the food came out quickly and we got our water refilled before even having to ask. Good job on that!"}
{"text":"The menu at China Magic Noodle House represents the school of thought that if you're going to make just one thing, it's got to be good. They pretty much only serve one thing -- noodles.  Located in the Lee Lee shopping center in Chandler, the owners have done a great job of making the interior bright, clean and welcoming. Greeted with a smile, we were seated in the one of the generously sized booths, as if they knew about the feast we were going to order.  On the farthest wall a large window provides a view of the kitchen where the magic happens. After you place your order, you're welcome to go to the window and watch the noodle master go to work. Each order is hand pulled, something that's amazing to witness. I was put into a foodie-induced trance while he twisted and beat the dough. The noodle master makes it look so easy, but it takes a ton of practice and skill honing.  Wanting to attack the menu from all sides, we ordered a Chinese noodle feast. When the first dish arrived we knew we were in for a treat. The huge made-by-hand Pan Fried Dumpling ($4.95) was stuffed with seasoned minced pork. Alongside was a bowl of a vinegar-based dipping sauce, which brought a bright tang to each pork bite. I enjoyed the fact that the skin was thick since each bite was substantial and toothsome.  The Hot Spring Beef Tender ($4.50) was kind of a surprise when it arrived. My impression when ordering this dish was that it would be tender sliced beef, but when it arrived it was a plate full of paper-thin slices of spiced marinated beef tendon. I love beef tendon, so it wasn't much of a problem. Our waiter explained that the tendon is tender, and pointed out that the Marinated Beef ($4.50) was sliced beef.  There's a choice of five types of noodles, but we homed in on the hand-pulled version. They also offer wide noodles, shaved noodles, thick noodles and vegetable noodles.  Noodles with Minced Pork Sauce ($5.50) offered chewy bites studded with green onion and little pieces of ground pork. The noodles did a great job of absorbing all of the flavors of the dish. I'd order this one again.  Beef with Fried Noodles in XO Spicy Sauce ($7.95) is similar to a house lo-mein, but this was bursting with taste. The Spicy XO Sauce added a salty and savory dimension to the noodles and tender beef that was indeed spicy, but not overly so. If you need additional spice there is a jar of red chile oil on every table.  I jumped at the chance to try their version of Homemade Lemonade ($2). Sweet and tangy, this is how good lemonade should be made. The Homemade Lemon Tea ($2) pretty much bests any other Arnold Palmer. Both drinks did a great job of cutting through the richness of the highly flavored noodle dishes.  Similar to Vietnamese pho, Ox-Tail with Soup Noodles ($5.95) were so comforting, I can imagine these on a cold day warming your belly and your soul. The broth was complex and each bite of fall-off-the-bone tender ox-tail and chewy noodles were a joy to slurp.  The only negative thing I can say about China Magic Noodle House is that they aren't closer to where I live, though on second thought, this might be a good thing."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but today was the first time a tried the pan fried dumplings. So delicious! And gigantic portions. It could be a whole meal itself. The noodles taste so good and fresh. And I can't help but get a strawberry smoothie every time I come. Service is quick and friendly. They really know the menu too! Love this little gem"}
{"text":"First time getting hand-pulled noodles, and they were not bad!    Fried noodle w/beef, and thick noodles ($8).  The noodles were thicker than the chopstick and had a distinct chewiness to them, which i enjoyed.  Despite being a noodle dish, there wasn't much noodles.  There also wasn't a lot of beef, but there was a ton of veggies.  Lastly, there is a viewing window customers can walk up to and watch the chef work his hand-pulled noodle magic."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!! They make the noodles fresh to order and even have a little viewing window so you can watch them make it. The prices are reasonable and the staff is super friendly. I love coming here."}
{"text":"Do you like Potstickers?  I mean GIANT Potstickers?  Then you have to check this joint out.  Located in what I call the \"Asian Corner\" of Chandler (Dobson / Warner) this place serves up the best Potstickers around.  Not only are they the best, they are the Biggest you will ever see.  Usually you think of Potstickers  as an appetizer, right?  Well, not these babies; they are an enormous serving of 8 huge dumplings, pan fried or steamed.  This is a serious meal in itself and I can not finish a plate of these by myself.  Okay, enough about the Potstickers.  All their noodles are handmade and spun in house.  There is a kitchen window so you can watch them work their magic!  Whether you're a Potsticker fan, or just fresh Asian noodle fan, hit them up, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome! Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants. We go here probably once a week. The servers make an effort to know you and your order, which is always appreciated. The food is fresh and delicious always. You get to see the cooks make and stretch the noodles! Very good prices. The atmosphere is nice for a quick serve place, and it's always clean. Basically, we love this place and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Authentic. Very good pot stickers and egg rolls. Be prepared, the noodles are not like Top Ramen, they are more like what you would get in China. They do give you a questionable smelling plate of pickled things when you are seated, expect the smell but don't let it put you off."}
{"text":"I guess a lot of people come here for their hand pulled noodles... but I'm not the biggest fan of those.... If you like the thicker style noodles, then I think the hand pulled noodles is worth trying.  This place is definitely different from other chinese places, so its a good change from typical chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Dinner and a show! It's the only place I have found in Arizona to get ??? Dao Xiao Mian or Knife Cut Noodles, and fortunately they do a fabulous job with them! The hand cut noodles are thick with a great chewy mouth feel. The pot stickers are fantastic, we get an extra to-go order every time. The orders are prepared quickly and it's fun to watch them through the kitchen window as they pull the noodles and the stir-fry flames up.  This place has authentic Chinese noodles and to me it's well worth the hour it takes to get there! I usually order a watermelon slush and drink it with a straw because I am used to it. That's punny in Chinese. ;-)"}
{"text":"The noodle here is not very good. It was not cooked thorougly. I warn you. Do not get the smoothies. I think 7-11 slush tasted much better than this crap"}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about this place so we checked it out. Food was bland. We found a long hair in our noodle they remake it for us no big deal. It might have been an off day but we were disappointed."}
{"text":"best chinese noodle in town! unlike japanese ramen(which i really love also), chinese noodle has its own different unquie broth, the one i usually get is the lamb soup, always keeps me warm during the winter,even though in az its pretty short lol. and other cool things about the noodle is they all hand made by the noodle chief, so the bite texture on the noodle is way better than the instant noodles."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from the West side just to eat at this place, and it was worth it. The spicy cold cuts (beef, tendons and pig's ears) made it all worth it. Also ordered dumplings, noodle stir fry with beef and noodle ox tail soup. Love the noodle ox tail soup also. The others were okay. This place definitely has awesome noodles. I got mango smoothie with boba and it was meh....it was diluted. The service was good and quick. Would definitely go back here for another cold cuts order and another noodle dish."}
{"text":"Next to Lee Lee market which makes it a convenient place to run into before going grocery shopping.  You can watch the chefs make the incredible noodles.  This is the first place in Phoenix with actual hand pulled noodles which is an art.  I can't imagine the patience and skill it takes to transfor simple ingredients like flour, water and salt into these beutiful noodes.  From flat and broad, to thin and delicate, they have all styles. The different styles of noodles will complement different types of sauces and toppings.  The waiters are pretty good at recommending the right kind of noodle for the type of toppings.  Tea costs extra (which is a little annoying), but other than that I can't really complain.  You know it's good when about 90% of the restaurant is made up of hungry Asian folks :)"}
{"text":"So this place is pretty good overall -- depending on what way your preferences lean.  The service is amazingly fast!!! We had our food coming out in less than 10 minutes (o-o).  It was also a lot of fun to watch them make the noodles through the big picture windows.  The portions are VERY large - definitely enough for left-overs - and the prices are very reasonable.  The food is good, but not necessarily special or memorable.  The appetizer menu is nicely diverse, but as far as main dishes go it is essentially a choose your meat and sauce kind of gig.  For my tastes it may have been a bit too salty, but hey some people are in to that sort of thing.  Health wise the food is probably 80% carbs (I mean the restaurant name has noodle in it so no surprise there right), 19% meat, and maybe 1% veg.  They do have a gluten-free option of rice noodles FYI.   TLDR: If you are looking to fill up the tank quick and cheap then give this place a try.  If you are looking for something more healthy or tasty then maybe keep driving ;-)"}
{"text":"Worst customer service i have ever had. Cant believe this place is reviewed so high. They should seriously change out the staff. The food was okay not as good as i expected it to be based off the reviews. Expecially since this place has been reviewed by food critics (Howard Seftel to name one) which i think might have been paid off by this restaurant. That critic must have not been a true food critic and is most likely looking for a free meal because this place is at best a 3 star and thats if the staff had any normal manners."}
{"text":"The best stir fried noodles ever!! I came to this place three times an each time the food has been amazing! They make their noodles in house and it's too die for!"}
{"text":"Don't worry about the fact that this is in a strip mall, or the Chinatown decor, sit down, preferably near the window & get ready for the show.  I ordered pan fried pot stickers, which were easily the best I've ever had.  Then the fresh mango juice, best I've had since I lived in Brazil & cut the mangoes off the tree.  The spicy pan fried noodles with beef (#34) were flat out incredible.    With prices that are pretty close to what they charge at Panda Express, the food is easily ten times better.  The noodles are scratch made, fresh for every order, and you can watch them slapping & pulling the noodles through the window if you have the right seat.  Go here, even if you order ahead & take it to go.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"A nice sit down restaurant despite it not being anything fancy. I wasn't expecting too much when I went to dinner here with the boyfriend and his family. I did get excited when I saw that they hand make all their noodles here.   The menu is pretty extensive with a variety of different noodle dishes with \"less Americanized\" appetizers and veggies such as marinated pig ears, beef tendons, and yu choi. But that doesn't seem there isn't something for everyone. Their menu also lists the different types of noodles you can choose with your dish, along with a close up photo of each.   Since I'm normally not a huge noodle soup fan, I decided to go with #22 which is the Noodles with Minced Pork Sauce. I LOVE minced pork so I thought it would be hard to go wrong with this dish. Andddd, I wasn't wrong. First off, the dish is HUGE. They definitely do not skimp out on the portions. It was a very filling two meals for me, and for only about $8! I recommend getting the thick noodles since they are so chewy and delicious. My boyfriend opted for the regular noodles since his friend mentioned that that was his usual order, but he didn't like it as much as mine. The noodles come with a generous topping of minced pork, slices of cucumber, and cabbage. It gets even better near the end with the collection of sauce on the bottom!   I also got to try #34 which is the Beef with Stir-Fried Noodles in XO Spicy Sauce. Also very good and more like a chow mein dish. (So a good rec for someone who isn't used to eating different types of Chinese food)."}
{"text":"Ho ho ho It's China Magic you know Never believe, it's not so It's China Magic you know Never believe, it's not so (Lyrics - E.L.O. - Oh oh oh It's Magic)  China Magic Noodle House is located in the heart of what I call the Asian Center!  Yes, right on Dobson and Warner is where all the my Asian peeps hangout - haha!  CMNH is both a specticle and an eatery.  The man behind the glass window stretches and spins noodle dough while you watch in amazment.  How does he do that!?  Needless to say, he is spinning your noodles up and around the air.    This time around I ordered the Stir Fry Noodles with spicy X.O. Sauce, while my bro ordered the Ox tail soup with noodles.  I must say my noodles were a tad bit hard, but I ordered the \"D\" noodles which were the large flat noodles.  I would recommend the spaghetti style since I think they would cook better.  With 5 different styles you can't lose!  My bro's Ox tail soup looked interesting, but he said it was OK at best so I'm going to have to take his word for it.    Overall, I really enjoyed the hand made noodles and the different ways they cook it up.  The best part is being able to watch them make the noodles.  For what you pay for I think it's awesome.  Some dishes start at $5 -- where else can you find that aside from Mc-d's! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Chinese Magic Noodle House. I have to admit, after growing up in Beijing and finding only decent hand-pulled noodle restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area, I didn't have high hopes for Chinese food in the Phoenix area. Admittedly Chandler is a half hour's drive away, but I've happily made the trek three times in the past couple of weeks, and I definitely haven't been disappointed.   Located in a small strip mall, the restaurant is simple yet functional. The furniture may be a bit dated, but the food more than makes up for that. There is a little window where one of the cooks is hand-pulling large hunks of dough for the noodles, and that reminds me so much of similar displays in Beijing.  There are several options for which kinds of noodles customers would prefer, but I highly recommend the thick hand-pulled noodles for almost every dish. The noodles here are amazing, and I'm especially a fan of the noodle soups. The beef noodle soup is probably my favorite, followed by the ox tail noodle soup, dry tossed noodles with ground pork, and XO sautéed noodles with beef.   Beef noodle soup: This is a heavier soy sauce based noodle soup with large chunks of tender beef. I like that the soup is slightly saltier to allow for the flavor to permeate through the noodles, but not so salty that the broth is undrinkable. This is hands down my favorite preparation for the thick hand-cut noodles.  Ox tail noodle soup: This is a much lighter noodle soup when compared to the beef noodle soup, as the ox tail is sliced into thin pieces and the broth is clear. I thought that some of the cook on the ox tail was uneven, as there were pieces which were overly chewy and others that were tender. A good choice for when I'm hoping for a lighter broth, but I felt that the beef noodle soup was a hard one to beat.  Dry noodles with ground pork: This was a decently good dish, although the lettuce strips on the bottom instead of cucumber strips were a bit unconventional. The thicker noodles can be harder to navigate in this version, but they were still tasty. I could have used a bit more sauce, but the ground pork was seasoned well and paired nicely with the fragrant noodles.  Sautéed noodles with beef and XO sauce: I was so impressed that the thick noodles weren't overlooked or undercooked in this dish, as I've had so many versions where the noodles were mushy and falling apart. The XO sauce was a bit heavy for my taste, but I could tell that the wok breath was fragrant and ingredients timed well. This was a far step up from the stir-fried noodles at Cherryblossom Cafe in Phoenix.   Potstickers: These were huuuuge! I don't know if I've seen potstickers this big, and truthfully they were more of dumplings than anything else. I thought that with such thick wrappers and hand-made, these would probably have been better if prepared in the traditional boiling of dumplings; it's just hard to steam such large portions adequately through pan-frying. The flavor was still good, but I'd pick noodles over these potstickers without hesitation.  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"China Magic Noodle House is my go-to place for Chinese comfort food. I always order the pan fried dumplings and beef stew noodle soup with \"thick\" noodles. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So the first time, I really loved this place.  The second time.... I have fallen out of love. The noodles (esp the shaved noodles) are still great, but the portions are smaller and the quality has just gone down.   On our latest trip, the husband decided to venture from our norms\ and ordered the lemon beef noodles - which was really really.... interesting. Not terrible, just interesting. The beef is the cold sliced beef you get on those appetizer plates, and is bathed in a sweet-lemony sauce. It was alright. The saving grace was the shaved noodles we got. I basically ate this dish because I love the noodles.   We also ordered the combo seafood noodles with the thick round noodles. I think it was composed of maybe 4 super looooooong noodles and couple teeny pieces of shrimp, 3 miniscule baby scallops, and a couple slivers of octopus/squid. and a whole lotta celery and cabbage.   The best thing we ordered was the blistered long beans. Sigh.   I might be back IF I'm in the area and IF I'm craving some shaved noodles, but aside from that, I wouldn't make a special trip to dine here."}
{"text":"I ordered one of the beef noodle soup bowls. Like other Chinese noodle bowls, I find that the broth flavor is a little lacking compared to ramen or pho. The noodles were delicious though and the meat was great. The service was pretty fast and you have the option of buying boba. I didn't get the boba but I will next time.  I give the place A-OK just because the noodle bowls didn't impress me much flavor wise. The saving grace was the fresh noodles made in house."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try China Magic Noodle for a long time because I heard that their noodle soups are pretty authentic and they pull the noodles by hand. Although it is true that the noodles are hand-pulled, and you can watch this process through the window in the back, I found the noodles to be a little undercooked. I was initially suspicious when our orders came so quickly. After tasting it, I realised that the noodles were a little too hard (undercooked). I allowed the noodles to sit a little longer in the broth to soften up, but it's just not as good as digging into a perfectly prepared bowl of noodle soup."}
{"text":"Great noodles and other traditional Chinese food. Portions are huge so you'll definitely leave happy."}
{"text":"The potstickers here are a-mazing! Noodles are fantastic. Fried rice was nothing special, but still flavorful."}
{"text":"Decent hand pulled noodles. It looks dim from the outside but on the inside..it's really spacious and clean.  there is a lookout window to watch the Chinese Chef pull noodles. He'll do a demonstration and there is a tip jar by the window.  Noodles are $6.50-$7.50 a bowl.   There are different appetizer (pig ear specialty but I did not try it)   COME HERE TO EAT instead of BEIJING #9 Noodles in Vegas  CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"Delicious broth! Fun to watch them make the noodles :)"}
{"text":"I don't understand some of the low ratings. The food was wonderful and the service was prompt and courteous. The noodles are the best I've had! If you aren't used to firmer and fresh made noodles don't come here. If you prefer over cooked store bought noodles you will be disappointed.   Culturally if you disapprove of the food you don't outright complain as it is seen as extremely shameful and rude! If you disapprove then don't eat the food and leave. A full plate left is also insulting but a more acceptable way to show your dissatisfaction. If you don't care about cultural customs then just be a typical un cultured person and whine.   Besides all the formalities this is truly a gem of a restaurant as most(99.9%) don't bother making their own noodles. If you like the best noodles outside of expensive places than this is the place!     I had the pork noodle stir fry and it was excellent! It was out to me hot and prompt in about 8 minutes! The service was friendly and I will return :)"}
{"text":"They serve the best Chinese style noodle in Arizona. You are able to try from soup noodle to fried noodle, from hand-pull to shaved noodle. They can be very thin or very wide. Price is reasonable. My favorite is beef stew with soup noodle. Cannot get enough!"}
{"text":"I ordered beef with stir-fried (shave) noodles in XO spicy sauce today and it tastes really good! Before my boyfriend always suggested me to have ox-tail with soup noodles, but the noodle was sometimes a little bit plain and floury if only goes with beef soup. I dont hate it but just cannot finish the bowl all the time. But today I keep eating fried noodle until i cannot fill my stomach anymore.  Also the service is great and fast. They rapidly provide a small plate of side dish (steamed peanut and pickled daikon) right after we sit down, even though the water tastes really bad! (For me, it's probably the worst water in Arizona) We still enjoy the food and service very much!  Will return when I want some fresh homemade noodle."}
{"text":"I was cranky on a Saturday morning and the only thing to pull me out of the funk was the promise of good Chinese food.  This place has been bookmarked for THREE YEARS and I finally pulled the trigger because - noodles.  We ordered the following: 1. Pan fried dumplings 2. Assorted cold meats 3. Oxtail noodle soup 4. Minced pork noodles  Quick tip - they have several different kinds of noodles here, but we didn't specify which type we wanted to they just defaulted with the skinny ramen-looking kind - such a shame and should be addressed with the order!  Certain dishes would definitely taste better with thicker noodles.   The appetizers were awesome.  Dumplings were huge and meaty and fried to perfection.  The assorted meats were well marinated.  Make sure you dip it in vinegar and chili oil.  YUMMM.  The noodles were unfortunately such a letdown.  They had great texture and I love that they made them in house.  The flavors, however..... ehhhhhhh.... sad.  If you're Chinese or Korean you know that zha jiang mian is one of the ultimate comfort foods.  Every household has a different way of making them but it's usually minced pork with either yellow or black soy bean paste as a base and garnished with cucumbers and sooooometimes cilantro (if you're adventurous).  My family has always added scrambled eggs in the sauce (highly recommended).  I took a bite of the minced pork noodles here and tasted NOTHING.  And for some reason Magic Noodle House garnishes this dish with iceberg lettuce...? Ick!  Why put that on anything?  Oxtail soup wasn't much better.  The broth was okay - but the oxtail was definitely not stewed long enough.  The soup had the teeniest pieces of oxtail and the meat was so rough.  Pass on this.   I usually judge a Chinese restaurant by how it compares to my mother's cooking.  This I couldn't even compare to mine.  Three stars because the service and appetizers were good, and the noodles had great consistency.  I wouldn't be back, though."}
{"text":"We went to China Magic Noodle House for a late lunch.  Met our granddaughter and we all were soooo disappointed in food, service, and attitude of personnel.  We went there because we had read Howard Seftel, ( AZ Republic food critic) article about them on Feb. 19, 2014, and decided to try it.  It was horrible!  The two dishes he had recommended in his article were tried and ugh!  The cream sauce with seafood and corn was tasteless and was the consistently of milk. They brought each of our dishes separately and almost threw them on the table.  Tried the dumplings which were ok but not outstanding.  We did not really feel terrific after meal, AND will never go back or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"It's no exaggeration to say that since our first visit here, we have gone every weekend. Their focus on the noodles really sets them apart from other Chinese restaurants. Try one of the flat hand-pulled noodle options; you'll see what I mean. And the portions are generous; each visit to China Magic Noodle House provides us with lunch and dinner for a very reasonable price -- that makes justifying the repeat visits very easy."}
{"text":"I have been coming to China Magic Noodle House for years and definitely my favorite place in Arizona for noodles. It's a fun experience getting to watch them hand pull the noodles and the food is always delicious. Had a problem yesterday calling the restaurant and when I got there I told them and they changed their phones. The Beef Stir Fry Noodles with XO Spicy Sauce is my go to it's amazing with the chili oil. Also the Pan Fried Dumplings and Sesame Balls are really good as well. Definitely a great spot will be back soon!"}
{"text":"For February's International Supper Club we went to China Magic Noodle House.  The inside is plan, the main attraction is the opened window were you can see them making the noodles, its sort of mesmerizing  to watch them pull the dough into the noodles we are all going to eat.  Service was fast and friendly.  I ordered fried dumplings and the #34, which was spicy beef stir fry. I wasn't a fan of the dumplings , not any fault of China Magic Noodle; I just don't think Im a fan of dumplings haha..   The #34 was delish! The noodles were soft and perfectly cooked, the dish was spicy and the meat was tender! So good!   Another great meal for the ISCUYE! Thanks China Magic Noodle!"}
{"text":"Fresh and yummy.  I nice change from Pho"}
{"text":"Kind of hard to understand the cashier but the food came out quick and was delicious.  No issues other than that."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Serves fresh noodles and quality made dumplings that taste home-made. The two dishes I normally order are the noodle with minced pork and beef noodle with spicy XO sauce. Both are delicious have different taste. This is definitely my go to spot when I'm craving Chinese noodles. Reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"HAND PULLED NOODLES...  I have had these before in Hong Kong and Cali.  Never expected in AZ.  These are as fresh as you can get your noodles!!!  Got the #18 - Beef with Oyster Sauce and I picked the standard ramen noodles.  The noodles were good and the flavor of the beef and oyster sauce was outstanding!!  The steamed dumplings were so so good.  YUM YUM!!!  Also ordered the milk tea with boboa (it was ok).    The service was ok too.  We were waiting for 2 more people to join us, they never came to take our drink order.  They waited for everyone to get there and then took our drinks & food order."}
{"text":"Their chicken chow Mein is delicious!! You can customize with different noodle types. The service is fantastic and very quick! I love their smoothies as well with boba! I definitely will come here on a regular basis. It's a bit hidden but on the northeast corner of Dobson and Warner!"}
{"text":"Last night I came out of a 3 hr meeting starving and did a nearby search for restaurants- China Magic Noodle House came up with 23 mins before closing!  As I was 5 mins away, I quickly got into my car and dashed over there!!!! When I got there, there were 2 other people in the restaurant and the waiter, understandably was telling them they could only order take out as it was so close to closing time.  Of course, I was crest fallen. I mean, I was STARVING!!!  It was a busy day- the last time I had something in my stomach was before noon- and now, I have to have take out and eat the noodles in a darkened parking lot inside my car?!?! What's a girl to do in a situation like this?  I pulled out my best sad puppy eyes and my best Chinese!!!!  And I asked them if I could PLEASE eat the noodle soup inside the restaurant. I think it was the Chinese that did the trick as they were surprised this banana spoke Chinese!!!! Ha!  You can bet this bowl of noodle soup was the best tasting one I had ever had!!!!! Oh so tasty and satisfying for my growling empty stomach!!!!! Yes, be impressed as I ate furiously away at my noodle soup while 3 people watched me, waiting to close. And I finished my bowl of lamb noodle soup, noodle style D in slurping 15 mins so I was belly full satisfied by 9:30pm closing time.  That's right, fastest noodle eating ever!!!! Thanks wait staff at China Magic Noodle House for having a little compassion for this (was) starving little 'ole me to let me eat in the restaurant when really, what you wanted after a long day of working was to close up shop and go home!!!!"}
{"text":"Love it, staff are friendly and fast. This place is always busy when the family and I come here. Prices are good also."}
{"text":"No complaints. My son and I had our favorite, Sliced Beef Noodle soup. My wife had Braised Beef noodle soup. The noodles are always fresh and the flavor of the soup is excellent. We also had fried dumplings, too good."}
{"text":"I have never had hand pulled noodles before so i ordered it in both the beef stew soup i ordered which was okay. Also in the fried chicken noodles i had ordered. The noodles were tasty but i suggest cutting them a bit so its a little easier to eat.  What i happened to love the most out of our full order was the fried pot stickers and the sauce that came with it was amazing!! i cant wait to go back to order more of the pot stickers and try their boba smoothies and milk tea because i love GOOD boba spots worth going too.   upon arriving i could tell they seemed irritated i had come last minute. i personally am not a fan of staying later than what avg store hours are because i know how it feels.  But only thing was that it was probably half an hour before closing time! i understand you want to go home, everyone does! but to make me feel rushed is not a benefit to your establishment IMO.  I will give it another go one of these days but not just yet."}
{"text":"The noodles are bomb because they are made fresh and the portions are big so it's good to order a few things and share everything. The food came out very fast and the prices are great. I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Watch the noodle man make your noodles from a large plexiglass viewing area. Talk about delicious noodles with texture, chewiness, and your choice of six different cuts ranging from thick to thin to chunks.  Without the help of Yelp our party of 11 would never have entered this place.  Slightly intimidating because it is so authentic, one of my friends actually told the server he was lost about the menu and if she could  help him order.   We ordered noodles, pot stickers, veggies galore, rice, etc. All of it was loved by the group with us all sampling everyone else's dish.  The surprise of the night was the Corn Noodle Shrimp dish which turned out to be the big hit.  Hints of curry combined with the fresh noodles was a flavor dream.   Service was friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"We wanted noodles and thought to ourselves, why not magic ones? All joking aside, the noodles are fresh - as in made right in front of you, and delicious. The service isn't amazing, but that's not why you go to a place called China magic noodle. Don't expect refill offers or suggestions for appetizers. The menu has pictures, which is useful for some. For a delicious authentic experience, stop here."}
{"text":"The food was great but to be honest the service was horrible. We went on a Wednesday night, arrived a little before 9 PM knowing the place closed at 9:30. We thought that was enough time to order and eat because the service is usually really quick. From the start the waitress was rude and trying to rush us to order, and we had literally just sat down. The people in the window were just staring at us, waiting for us to order. The food was prepared really fast but the employees were just staring at us the WHOLE TIME looking annoyed. The waitress handed us the bill while we were still eating. It was so uncomfortable. I've never been treated that way. We didn't feel welcomed at all. We even left before 9:30. Just a warning if you go, go early. :("}
{"text":"fantastic!!! i have been searching for a good noodle place since my move & love it!!! steamed dumplings to start were delicious and arrived within 5 minutes of ordering. ordered the seafood soup with noodles and was thrilled with it. the brooth was hot and tasty and the noodles were fantastic!!! will def be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"The hype is real. I was blown away. These noodles are no joke. The beef,  the sauce ..all just sooooo good. We got there at 11m on a fri, right when they open. By noon, place was absolutely packed. You choose the kinda noodles you want. There is a window where you can see the chef back there flinging around this wad of dough, making the noodles by hand. 5 stars.  To the owner.. one small thing... Tell the teenager working the register up front to turn OFF his horrible music. I don't wanna hear the annoying vocal stylings of eminem when dining at a wonderful, highly-rated Chinese noodle restaurant."}
{"text":"Probably the best hand pulled noodles you can get in town!  I usually order the XO Sauce Beef Noodle Stir Fry (Shaved Noodles always shaved noodles!). Their pan fried dumplings and salt and pepper fish dish is also awesome.  They do have a viewing window where you can see the incredible skilled chef pulling the noodles apart.  Lastly, I normally finish the meal with a Boba milk tea (delicious).  All in all, you're not going to be disappointed with this place!"}
{"text":"(+)s: Hidden in a random plaza, staff that only speaks Chinese, a view into the kitchen where you can watch the hand pulled noodles being prepared. Great prices for authentic chinese food.   I've only been here once but the spicy noodles here are scrumptious.  If I come back the next time and the food is still consistently delicious, this will definitely become a 5 star review"}
{"text":"This place really is a \"hole in the wall\" location.  In fact, if you blink, you might miss it!  But you have to check it out and keep looking until you find it.    All the noodles are handmade fresh, and they are delicious!  Cooked just right, and you can even watch as they are being made.  They let you choose the type of noodle you want with your dish.  My favorite so far are the thick noodles.  Similar to udon noodles.  Their steamed dumplings are HUGE (and also handmade) and are probably the best I've ever had.  The staff is very friendly.  No complaints at all about this place.    My most recent time, I got the spicy beef stir fry.  The beef was tender and seasoned perfectly.  And of course, the noodles were excellent.   My one suggestion is that if you are with a big group, do carry out instead.  It's a very small location and you might be in for a long wait if you're with a large group.  Just make sure you try it!  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Finally a decent Chinese place for a good price. Ordered a xo beef fried noodles, pretty good with good portions for like $8.25. The waitress could use better customer service though"}
{"text":"If I could leave this place ZERO stars I would. Online and on their door it says open till 9:30, so when we arrived at 8:45 they were already doing side work which is fine but the gal sweeping said \"you take out\"...REALLY? Poor customer service,  we chose to go elsewhere and probably wouldn't give this place another try."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Generous portions and a great price! Service is okay, not the best but I def keep coming back because of the food!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend so we went for lunch. Loved the homemade noodles. I gave it 4 stars because the noodles were like a ball. There weren't any ends to them. When you pick up the noodles they just kept going. While it was impressive with the homemade noodles it was a little difficult to eat. You either have to cut it before you take a bite or you have to bite it off while eating it or just keep slurping.  One thing for sure..we will return and try other dishes!"}
{"text":"I came here based on the positive reviews. How is this place still operating?  I ordered the Beef Noodles w/Oyster Sauce. It tasted like something a college freshman put together in his dorm room. I was shocked that they were serving something like this in a restaurant.  The sauce was a thick gravy that was not characteristic of any type of cuisine I have ever tasted. It was sweet and very SALTY; it kind of tasted like a blend of soy sauce, mushrooms, and milk. Once again, I can't put my finger to it, but it was gross. The beef was extremely starchy and rubbery. I tried to cover the taste up with hot sauce, but that didn't work.  One of the ladies (probably the owner or a manager) was nice enough to replace it with their Beef Noodle Soup. This was not disgusting like the first dish, but did not taste good either. The broth was bland and tasted like boiled water with cilantro and a splash of soy sauce.  I left very unsatisfied. I hope readers will take my review seriously and not waste money there."}
{"text":"I really love this place! I try to make it every time I travel to Chandler for supplies at LeeLee's. I've had several soups--oxtail, lamb, sliced beef, braised beef--with varying thickness of noodles. All are in flavorful broth with perfectly cooked noodles. Looking forward to trying more dishes--wish i didn't live an hour away."}
{"text":"I like this place. Each time I eat here I'm thankful Ryan K recommended CMNH to me years back. Ryan, hope you're doin' well on your unfolding Colorado adventure. Let's catch up soon ya big loser!  ANYWAY!  First, don't be scared away. Yeah, at first glance, it's a bit authentic for most Arizonan's comfort zone. Chin up, Imma get ya through. And it will be worth it for ya. We're talkin' lookin-back-years-later-in-fond-remembrance-of-a-life-changing-growth-experience type worth it.  5 Steps to Success. Do this:  1. Grab a seat. Under most circumstances you will be shown your seat with grace and a smile. Understand though, that CMNH isn't the type of place to fawn all over you with appreciation that you have arrived. If the seating is brusque just roll with it. It you find yourself having trouble \"rolling with it\", try \"getting over yourself\". One of those approaches should work for ya. Just remember, they aren't trying to offend you.   2. Order some Eggrolls. They're in the OK range of the eggroll quality spectrum. Just do it so you know for next time.  3. Order some Pan-fried dumplings. You could go Steamed, but I prefer, and recommend, the Pan-fried. They are made with Pork, Napa Cabbage, Happiness, and a smidgen of Blocks-Out-The-Freakin'-Sun. Seriously, these things are huge... and damn tasty. Dayum!  4. Order #34, Beef with Stir-Fried Noodles in XO Spicy Sauce. It's not very spicy, relax. You'll need to give them a noodle type. I like the \"C\" Regular. Hard to go wrong with this choice, just go where ya want on this one. All the noodles are fantastic, hand-stretched on-premises, and undeniably chock-full-a-magic.  5. If feeling adventurous, pick something else off menu. Whatcha got to lose?  That's it. Give it a shot. No need to be intimidated.   Sometimes you just have to jump in. The water's just fine.  Branch out of your next visit. Yeah, I said your NEXT VISIT. That's how confident I am you'll be back.  CMNH tends to be my Pre-Lee-Lee's Supermarket go to. It keeps me from buying up the whole store when I go to Lee Lee's. ;)  Enjoy the Magic."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  They need to clean up the facility, and definitely clean the window where you watch them make the hand made noodles."}
{"text":"Magic noodles.  What else do I need to say."}
{"text":"We ordered those HUGE dumplings. They were good and tasty. I think that they would be much better if they were smaller, though.  We also ordered garlic green beans as appetizers. HUGE plate of food comes out.  We were going to order a couple of items, but the waitress said \"You can share one.\" And she was right. We ordered beef noodles and it was quite tasty.  The noodles are hand pulled and there is a window into the kitchen where you can watch. When he is not pulling noodles, he is watching the customer crowd. He seems to really enjoy that as he has a smile on his face.  The service was outstanding. Our appetizers and entree came out zippity fast! I noticed that for all the other customers that came after us that their orders came out super fast, too.  When you order, you pick what size of noodle you want in your dish. There is a picture in the menu with brief descriptions. I can't remember them all, but there were five selections from regular to thin to flat, to thick, etc. I wish the pictures were better so you could really tell better.  The prices are outrageously cheap for the quality and quantity that you get. My only beef was with the beef as it was a cheaper cut of beef. But I guess that just adds to the authenticity? :)"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for noodles or something and happened upon this Chinese place tucked around the corner  of a strip mall/grocery plaza.  Not opened Mondays so that is a good thing to note.  I wasn't overly fond of the beef and lemon...but the dumplings were amazing...huge...a meal in itself.  The egg rolls were good but a little crispy for my taste.  Prices weren't terrible..I spent 20 bucks on 2 apps, 1 enter and a soda( can so no refills). I would go here again just try something else...another note...freshly pulled noodles and you can view them through the picture window facing the inside of the kitchen."}
{"text":"China Magic Noodle House is truly magical. It is the best Chinese food I have EVER tasted, hands down.  Every single time we order the same thing when we are here (because it's SO INCREDIBLE) and we go out of our way to visit this restaurant. Definitely order the Beef With Stir-Fried Noodles In Xo Spicy Sauce & Steamed Dumplings.  The portions are generous and you can't go wrong with anything truly! I also love their boba teas."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other reviewers. If you are looking for an authentic Hong Kong style noodle house, this is the best in the East Valley. Prices are very good, restaurant is very clean, portions are huge, and food is extremely tasty. Clear windows to watch the \"magic\" of noodle making, and the kids had a blast watching. They were even given a dough ball by the very nice chef to try their hand at it. Overall, quite impressed!  I would suggest the \"Hand-pulled\" noodles over the other variety."}
{"text":"Wow so yummy! Family style so don't over order. We took a lot home, but it was worth it. Fair pricing, excellent food and some entertainment ie you get to watch the noodles being made. This is a great casual dining experience."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like noodles?    While you can get noodle-based dishes almost anywhere, China Magic Noodle is special.  Theirs are hand-pulled to order, by someone I can only describe as a Magic Noodle Man.  From the window between the dining room and kitchen you can watch the stretching spinning process as they are created, just for you!  While I love the noodles (and I have tried four of the five varieties offered), the real attraction for me are the steamed dumplings.  They also have a pan-fried version, but I like the steamed ones better.  They are amazing - beautiful, huge, pork-filled packets of goodness.  I have at times skipped the other dishes entirely and just had dumplings - they are that good.  What would happen if that Magic Noodle Man decided to go on vacation?  Or realized that hand-pulling noodles was no longer his career calling?  I can tell you that for me, the world would be a little less Magic."}
{"text":"So yummy!! The noodles are amazingly fresh. I had the #34 I've tried other things on the menu but keep going back to the spicy stir fried noodles with beef! Their homemade spicy XO sauce is delish!"}
{"text":"It has been a few years since my first review of this place, and I still love it just as much as ever. It's really kid-friendly and my kids love watching their noodles being made. The staff is really helpful and brought out chairs for the kids to stand on so they could see the kitchen better.  I'm sick and all I want are is the sliced beef with soup noodles. I skip eating all other foods when I'm sick and just drink that amazing broth. It's almost magical.  Really, the worst part about this place is trying something new when all my favorites are so awesome. The pork dumplings, the pan fried noodles, and the beef soup are just heavenly. Sigh, one day I'll take another reviewer's advice and try the salt and pepper fish (\"the best thing on the menu,\" according to her,) but it'll be hard."}
{"text":"We went for a weekday lunch and the place was packed. We had to wait 10 min to get a table.  The place is pretty organized and neat. Service was average since there was quite a lot of people.  This place makes fresh noodles from scratch. One can see the chef making the noodles through the glass. I went ahead and ordered lamb noodles. This dish gave me food coma. It was delicious beyond description. Lamb was cooked so good and the broth was light and nice. I chose regular noodles and it was alright for me. They have 4 kinds of noodles and I probably should have chose any other. I would love to try other dishes here.   The price is very affordable and I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"This was just ok I thought. The noodles were fresh and you could pick so many different kinds but it was pretty salty. We had the stir fry noodles with XO sauce and sliced beef noodle soup. The noodle soup tasted more like a pho broth."}
{"text":"Eh, not sure what all the hype is about the noodles here. For homemade noodles this place kinda sucks. I think they have A LOT of room for improvement in that department.  It was cool to watch the guy make the noodles, I had huge expectations but completely let down.  I wanted a soup so I ordered the oxtail soup (tasted like pho broth) with wide noodles. I should have been able to slurp the hell out of those noodles but I couldn't do squat! The noodles were extra chewy and soooooo long. I mean, I get it the noodles are made in house, but sheeeeesh this ain't lady and the tramp.  You can barely cut them with ur teeth, I promise u, this place is over rated for the noodles.  Oxtails------ total fail. This was super small slivers of oxtail. Don't expect much meat at all   The only thing that was super delish was the spicy pig ears. Yes, pig ears cuz I'm nasty like that!!!  It's sliced thinly and hot pan fried with chili oil and pretty darn good. It was so good we got another order to go for later.  Only thing is they pile it on top of some pickled veggies so it seems like you're getting a lot, but you're really not   Bottom line, if you're in the neighborhood and nothing else seems yummy, I guess try this place so u can say u had it.   Noodles 2 stars Pig ears 4 stars"}
{"text":"1st time there and we were NOT disappointed.  Spicy stir fried beef with those fresh homemade noodles was quite tasty and the place reminded me of being in Asia.  Very reasonable priced and right next to Lee Lees World Market!"}
{"text":"4the time went there. I like fried noodle and noodle soup, my husband really like the starter peanuts and veggie, our friend likes here too:) staff there are really nice and friendly"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Chinese restaurant in the Valley! The atmosphere is casual and unpretentious, the service attentive, and the food phenomenal and homey. Lots of parking spots in the strip mall too!  I've tried 4 types of noodles-- and they were all delicious. The thick noodles were my favorite, kind of like an udon noodle in thickness. The wide flat noodles were also superb, though a little hard to eat times because it was so long and wide. My s/o found the regular noodles yummy, but a little too long to handle (though I had no trouble with it). Because of this, I suggested he try the shaved noodles. He much preferred these because they were shorter noodles, but I found their texture a little off.   Noodles with minced pork sauce have been one of my favorite dishes since childhood, and though the ones at CMNH didn't blow my mind, they were solid and the best I've had in the US. The beef with fried noodles in XO Spicy Sauce didn't have a strong XO flavor, but was great, with lots of veggies."}
{"text":"The cool thing about this place is that they hand pull your noodles to order. They have 5 different varieties of noodles, and you can watch them pulling your noodles, if you are in to that kind of thing. I am.   We stopped in for dinner around 8, and it wasn't too crowded.  We started with the Pig Ear and eggrolls as appies.  The eggrolls were pretty typical for a chinese restaurant, kinda blah.   I couldn't eat the pig ears, because, uh, I just wasn't in the mood for pig ears. Yeah, that's it.  Of course, the platter came to the table with a HEAPING serving of pig ears. We ordered a small, so I can't imagine what the large size looked like.   I had the spicy noodle with beef in XO sauce, and my guy had the spicy noodles (vegetarian).  The noodles had the perfect chew, and the sauce was really good. I would recommend the XO sauce, the spicy sauce was good, but the XO was just better.   I would prolly hit this place up if I was still in Arizona.  It was one of the better meals I had while I was there."}
{"text":"It's one of best Chinese restaurant in the valley! Very authentic, good atmosphere, very kind staffs, tasty food, reasonable prices and great portion! They also make hand made noodle there. Very fresh!!  We had no.16 and 22 noodle and pan fried dumpling. It was great portion. Food was great! Very impressive! Especially 22 noodle! It's awesome! Very flavorful dish :)  I'm very glad to find the restaurant today :) I must go back next time and try other noodles! Can't wait to go back here :)"}
{"text":"The Best Noodles I have had in the Valley!  They make traditional noodles in house and they have a window to watch how. If you have not seen real noodles made stop by this place not only do you get to see how but the food is very good as well.   Of course the noodles are Awesome but the dumplings are as well one of these says I will try something else but I am stuck on the these two items right now :)"}
{"text":"The homemade noodles here are awesome.  You can definitely tell the difference between homemade noodles and the other stuff."}
{"text":"About time I found legit ??????.  The interior feels like a cheap Chinese restaurant with poor countryside chinamen that man the booth.  The broth tastes good and tastes more or less what I expect it to taste like.  The hand pulled noodles are chewy (This is how noodles should taste) and matches the noodle soup perfectly without making it ever being soft and soggy.  The Pig Ears were also plentiful and packed into a nice small hill.  The price is a bit more than what I am used to, but it's a great restaurant and I will return again."}
{"text":"Steamed dumplings were large, homemade but refrigerator cold inside.  Not pork filled like typically found.  Brown discoloration.  Noodles with crab and shrimp - homemade noodles all stuck together.  My guess is covered with store bought Alfredo sauce.  I will not return."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants in the Phoenix metro area! The Beef with Spicy XO Sauce and wide flat noodles are amazing.  The dumplings are great too and are HUGE."}
{"text":"I'll have to try one more time this place. On a weird week where I was having cravings for noodles this came perfect! noodles are made in your face!! Very affordable and tasty.   PLUS it is in my favorite asian corner, where Lee Lee's  is, Dim sum, boba tea, dairy queen.... heheh."}
{"text":"So good! I heard about this place from a recommendation of a friend on FB. I'm glad I came here the noodles were extremely fresh and good. One thing I would change is to cut the noodles up more so it's not so long (it was hard for little ones to eat them). We dined inside and the customer Service was great, fairly fast and efficient."}
{"text":"This was the best noodle house I had been to.  The noodles were freshly pulled and the broth was very tasty.  Wish they had such a noodle shop in Sacramento."}
{"text":"I really loved this restaurant.   I love fresh noodles and I ran over after seeing they make them to order.  They do this in some areas of China and the beef noodle soup tasted just like I had when I was in Bejing for the first time 15 years ago.  I recommend bringing your children in to see this man make noodles and have a nice, casual, well made, delicious,  inexpensive bite!"}
{"text":"Super authentic Chinese noodles. I've spent a lot of time in China and had many bowls of ?? which roughly translates to Ramen, and this is the best I've had in Phoenix. it's also the only place I know of to get ??? or shaved noodles. A must eat!  The atmosphere is what I would call classic Chinese restaurant, something very similar to what you would see in China. Nothing fancy, but certainly adequate. Service is also great. Don't miss out on the Boba drinks."}
{"text":"i love the xo sauce in my shaved beef soup with the shave nooodles , yummm the service is always excellent , the restaruant decor is right on point for a no frills noodle shop, it's all business and the business is great. staff is always smiling and friendly .."}
{"text":"Six of us had lunch today at the China Magic Noodle House, and all of us enjoyed it.  We sampled the beef dumplings appetizer (virtually \"pot sitckers\") while awaiting our order.  My brother-in-law and I had the #19 Shrimp & Crab* over hand-made noodles in a creamy white sauce (like Alfredo sauce) which was very good.  My wife had the #19 Oyster Beef and was quite pleased with it.  The portions were large, and all of us took boxes of left-overs home.  This is a great place for lunch in Chandler, Arizona, and in the same shopping center as the LeeLee market (Asian foods). *imitation crab"}
{"text":"Best I have ever had. Leftovers still good when heated up... Very good, so much I got a takeout menu and at the rest of my food later in the day. I am soooo going back. I have yet to find any place that is this good and easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"tldr; extremely rude service, slightly below average food   Had the worst experience here last night. We arrived at 9:05pm. Well aware of their closing time, and not wanting to be assholes, we decided to order Togo. The waiter came over, and asked us if we were ready after less than 30 seconds with the menu. When I asked him to please give us just another minute, he made a face, harrumphed, and said \"come on guys we are closing\". Fair enough, but I'm not ready to order. Please give me just another minute. Even more impatient now, he repeated \"no we are closing come on guys hurry up.\" I am a server myself, and I know the dismay of having a table walk in late. But the first rule of being a server is having common courtesy. After all, you are working for tips. After his rudeness we promptly left, at which the other waiter yelled thank you to us, thinking we were a happy, satisfied table who was leaving after their meal, as there were still SEVERAL other tables inside eating. Sorry to say that wasn't the case. Will never come here again.   Side note, I have been here twice before. Each time the service has always been typical small restaurant asian service. You sit, they bring you water, take your order, and bring you your bill. Nothing extraordinary and certainly nothing like where they are checking on you to make sure everything is okay. Being Chinese who grew up in the industry, this is the type of service I actually prefer when I go out to eat, simply because I don't want all the fuss. This last experience was on a whole new low. Aside from that, the food is alright. Nothing extraordinary. The broth tastes like msg and the noodles, both times, were underdone and slightly doughy. In China, there is one of these noodle stands on every single corner and they all blow this place out of the water. I kept wanting to see what these great reviews were about to see if they stood up to the challenge, but I guess I'm just the unlucky one."}
{"text":"Owner messaged me with two more vegetarian dishes: vegetarian spring roll and yau choi(Chinese vegs)with oyster sauce or you can do it stir fried with garlic."}
{"text":"First Impression: Strong stench when walked in that made me  almost turn around & leave. Not sure if it's kimchee, pickled veggies?  Typical hole in the wall non-chain Asian eatery Translation: expect mediocure service, passable                        very basic plain decor                         Open kitchen looked messy, things everywhere                       chefs just chilling in dining rm til order in   (ladies bathroom was strangely ornate compared to rest of place, like someone had leftover tiles and decided to use it)  Now the yummy Food: After all, we certainly didnt go for it's ambiance Came out very quickly. Sesame paste noodles was delicious  Reminds me of ones I had in China my mouth waters just thinking about it may have to pinch my nose and make a run mrw.. hehe Beef Stew Soup Noodles was ok.  Happy to see a noodle house addition to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Whoooo-Hoooooo Hand drawn noodles are da bomb and this place didn't disappoint.   Chinese Dumplings were some of the best I've ever had (including Mainland China). The filling was perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of ginger and garlic.   The soup with noodles was to die for, it's not PHO people (other yelpers have confused it) it's Chinese soup and they pulled off the broth perfectly. The Stir-fried noodles had a wee bit too much Sesame oil IMHO but they were still very yummy.  Service was spot on and friendly. Watermelon and Mango smoothies were super delicious.   Price - GREAT value, wish we had this place where I lived."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. The noodles are prepared to order. The regular noodles with beef and XO sauce excellent. The savory flavor of the wok chard goodness came through this dish and delighted my palate as well as my olfactories. Everything here is well prepared. Fried dumplings are excellent as well as filing. Looking for the real authentic noodle house experience? This is it my friend."}
{"text":"I was the first time I went to try the dumplings because you would already be getting the homemade noodles. This is why magic noodle stands out over other Chinese planes they hand pull the noodles there are 5 to chose from. You can have them stir fried or in soup. They have different appetizers like cold meat plate"}
{"text":"I had wanted to visit this spot for a long time so one weekend I took the trip... I entered to a pretty busy spot I was seated right away. I was handed a menu and water and a plate of peanuts and pickled stuff... I was passed over for a bit and I called someone over to order... I went with the No. 34 Beef with Noodles in XO Spice Sauce and an order of egg rolls. I rate the food as followed.  Beef with Fried Noodles in XO Spicy Sauce - B Egg Rolls - C + Staff - D   I want to give this spot another try... I was kind of disappointed on this trip but there are many other things I want to try off the menu let's hope the next trip is on point."}
{"text":"Went there the other night my boyfriend had #34 and ate the whole plate with shaved noodles.  I got the seafood noodle bowl soup and it was so delicious.  We had a side of pan fried dumplings and there were so yummy!  We are for sure going back there again.  The staff was super friendly :) Cash only for a reason and worth it!"}
{"text":"the best place for noodles and fried dumplings!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the tap water is nasty so i recommended getting a drink, not the boba tea."}
{"text":"SO Good!  Homemade AND absolutely yummy.  Affordable, generous portions. Deserts are also out of this world. Can't go wrong between this and other restaurants in this shopping center.  Best to go on weekdays to avoid crowds.  I'll be frequenting this place often!  I'm from Boston and thought this tops many of the restaurants, there. That's quite a compliment."}
{"text":"Full of flavor. Huge portions! Great prices. Fast service. I was so happy to find a place here in Arizona that serves noodles made to order. You can't go wrong with what you pick. I've tried the potstickers, soups, seafood with noodles. So many times I can't decide so I take a friend and we split our soup and noodles."}
{"text":"Believe the hype. Best noodles I've ever had. Wish I could wear them around my neck. Ordered steamed dumplings and #34 with wide noodles. The only reason I'm waking up tmr is to eat the rest for breakfast."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. We kindly asked for lemons since their tap water tasted contaminated and the server replies, \"I only have 2 hands.\" When the food finally came, the 2nd server slammed the food on the table with liquid from the soup splashing all over us and server made no apologies.   We asked the server what kind of sauce was included with the fried tofu with we had ordered and waiters response was \"tofu sauce\". That's when we asked him why he was being so rude and he literally began to use vulgar language towards us in front of multiple families with small children. Will never return here and be sure to complain to the BBB in regards to this incident. We will NEVER come back here.   Please consider any and every other restaurant before even considering this classless restaurant. With such horrible level of service I really don't understand how they are open."}
{"text":"the pot stickers were da bomb!!!  most def revisit joint!  \"Piece\"!!!"}
{"text":"Super yummy noodles! But the seasoning and sauces lacked depth and were a tad heavy.  I got the Shrimp and Corn Curry Noodles, the sauce was good but was super super heavy.  Also got the XO Spicy noodles, I liked how they're were an assortment of veggies in them, but the sauce was lacking flavor.  I do like how you get 5 noodle types to choose from!"}
{"text":"Noodles are the heart and soul of Asian cuisine and I know that finding a genuinely good and authentic noodle house is an exciting prospect for all of you fans out there just as it is for us. I discovered this place just by surfing online and when I learned that one of my Elite Yelp friends, on whose opinion I rely religiously, had given it a 5-star review I knew we had to try it as soon as possible.  My girlfriend and I were pleasantly greeted with a small plate of pickled daikon and boiled peanuts. We the shared a small order of Spicy Hot Pig Ear appetizer, Noodles with Minced Pork Sauce, and Ox Tail with Soup Noodles. The portion sizes for all the dishes was very generous and more than enough for the two of us.  The texture of the pig ear was delectably tender and satisfying and it was served at a perfect slightly warm temperature with just the right amount of spice. We ended up mixing some of slices of pig ear to both noodle dishes to add an extra dimension of yumminess, We ordered regular pulled noodles with the minced pork and shaved noodles with the ox tail and we thoroughly enjoyed the excellent consistency of both as we watched the chef pulling more noodles in the kitchen The soup broth was yummy with good depth of flavor, the ox tail was tender, and the minced pork was nicely seasoned, and the veggies were properly cooked.  My girlfriend, who is a native of mainland China, vouched for the authenticity of all the dishes. The service was prompt and courteous and the prices were reasonable. This restaurant is now on our list of favorites and we will definitely return.  Photo design by Billie Z."}
{"text":"Great hand pulled noodles are a textured sensation! Watching your noodles being pulled to order is an added extra! Very simple preparations so don't expect a lot of complexity. Just plain good noodles."}
{"text":"Ordered the famous chicken stir fry noodles to go tonight..  I was really disappointed the noodles was bland and the chicken was nasty.."}
{"text":"Ok it's a noodle shop!! So unless you're a noodle junkie ,it is just ok!! If you like noodles it's great"}
{"text":"A group of us came for dinner and arrived at 6:00. We were seated immediately. The restaurant is, to put it nicely, sparsely decorated, and is quite simple inside. However, don't let the lack of decor fool you. The food more than makes up for it. This is the only Chinese restaurant in the greater Phoenix area that makes real hand pulled noodles. The last time I had noodles of this quality, it was in Hong Kong!   There is a big picture window where you can watch the chef stretching the dough and making any of the 5 kinds of noodles. I started off with the marinated beef tendon. Usually, you get a small plate with a little portion of the tendon on it. Here, I was surprised to get a big plate with a huge portion of tendon on it. To be honest, it was more than I could possibly eat, but we all made a good stab at it.  Next, I ordered a portion of noodles with XO sauce. This is a spicy sauce that really brings out the flavors in foods, and I was not disappointed. It was fun to watch the chef prepare the dish through the window. All my guests were mesmerized watching the preparation. Each person ordered a different dish, and all were pronounced flavorful and excellent.  Service is simple, but quick. Considering the prices, one has to wonder how they can stay in business. Big plates of food at very low prices.  Were it not for the simple decor, this place would easily rate 4 stars.  3 stars for portion size and quality.  A good place to eat your fill at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for about a year now & really love it here. No, it's not fancy, but the food is great, the service is great and the noodles are to die for! If you are looking for a great carb fix, this is your go to place"}
{"text":"My Dearest China Magic Noodle House,   I have lived barely a mile away from you the past three years and have never given you the time of day.  How wrong was I to neglect your heavenly cuisine and ambiance (suspect olfactory assault included) that brings me right back to the Bay!   Dude and I dropped by on a lazy Saturday afternoon.   Based on many of our friends' Yelp reviews, we knew going in that we were going try the XO Spicy Beef Noodles ($8.25) and the Pan Fried Dumplings ($4.95).   Oh, those dumplings. Not your typical Chinese restaurant freezer dumplings; these babies are on 'roids! There's eight to an order and they're practically a meal on their own. We were pleased to find these weren't overcooked or greasy, a common mistake.   My only complaint is I wish there were more vegetables.   As for the noodles, you can pick the width (really thin, really wide,  somewhere in between, insert your dirty jokes here). We went with the standard C noodles.   While they were fresh and delicious, the beef was just OK. I also wish the XO delivered a little more heat as promised, but nothing a little chili oil can't fix. Next time, I'll ask for them extra spicy!   Can we also talk about the portion sizes here? Between a heaping plate of noodles and behemoth dumplings, we were able to take home leftovers that heated up perfectly the next day for lunch.   Prices are similar to what those corporate Asian food establishments charge, but it's obviously so much better.   Sit by the window and you're in for a real show. So much fun to watch all the noodles being hand stretched!   Already plotting another trip to this little slice of home on Dobson and Warner to work my way through that extensive menu.   Yay, I'm a fan indeed!"}
{"text":"We jumped in for lunch. Never been here before. Noodles are made on the spot. Chicken Fried Rice, Vegetable and egg soup and Chicken stir fry were all so good. Try it, you'll sure to be back."}
{"text":"09/08 and 09/29  On my first visit here, I ordered egg rolls and a stir-fried beef noodle dish.  It was such fun to watch noodles being made that I couldn't wait to bring Mom over so that she could see it herself.  Service was friendly and helpful, and the place (and restroom) looked very clean.  Really loved the egg rolls!  They're so good, I'm going to have to order them every time I visit.  The noodles were good, but the meat portion of this dish was pretty dismal-- the noodle to meat ration had to have been at least 3 to 1.  No exaggeration!  (I had hoped it was a fluke, but it wasn't-- more detail to come later.)  Once I'd exhausted the beef content (and there wasn't much), I wasn't satisfied enough w/ the noodle flavor to continue.  (If only the noodles were as tasty as those I'd tried at Saigon Bowl the night before...)  There was no doubt, however, that these noodles were freshly made--  I really enjoyed its texture!  Took Mom w/ me on my second visit.  Decided to try the steamed gyoza and a noodle dish w/ ground pork.  Wished I'd ordered the eggrolls, instead :(  The gyoza dish was, without question, the worst WE'D ever tried!  Too heavy on the batter, and steamed was definitely not the way to go.  (Once you have a look at the photos, you'll agree!)  Same thing w/ the pork.  Too crumbly and unexciting flavor (salty and lemony), and again, the meat to noodle ratio was very low.    Two visits, and it's Hit-1, Miss-1.  At least I'll know that the app will be a hit (egg rolls), and if I remember to order a double- or a triple-serving of meat, maybe the noodle portion won't be a miss..."}
{"text":"I honestly just love this restaurant. Mainly because the food is just so good. The Pan Fried Dumplings are honestly the best I've ever had. My family loves getting the green beans as a side dish. While I know Hong Kong rolls are listed as an appetizer they are a great dessert. I do find the soup broths a little bland.   I admit I have not liked everything I've ever had here but I was exploring dishes. I am an adventurous eater though so I don't blame the kitchen in those cases.  You need to be aware that you're only coming for the food. It's a small hole in the wall location. There is no fancy decor. Most of the wait staff does not speak English. I find a lot of times the behavior some people find rude stem from a difference in culture. You're not going to get a waiter who is super perky and grovels for you if you're the slightest bit displeased. You will instead get basic service that gets your delicious food to you as quickly as possible.   The noodles are amazing. So amazing. No matter what dish you get. Nothing can beat a fresh noodle. I know some people not used to fresh noodles can sometimes find them a bit oddly textured. It's ok. Don't try to compare them to your dried noodles at home. These are different and wonderful.  Everything is super cheap. The food is hot, quick, and delicious. The noodles are amazing and fun to watch being made. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"Went last night (6/13/11).  We also had the Groupon, and were anxious to try the place.  We were NOT disappointed!  My wife had the Fried Noodles with Chicken, and I had the Fried Noodles with Beef in Spicy XO sauce.  Enormous portions, and soooooo tasty.  Noodles were excellent, beef was super tender, and seasoning was just about perfect.  Highly recommended, and we'll be returning soon."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you want to keep secret so they won't get overwelmed and go downhill.   Or raise prices.   Get the dumplings, ever if you don't like dumplings.  You will like these.  Its good .   Soup or stir fry.   Its yummy yummy.   Its not fancy.   The wait people are polite and keep the drinks filled."}
{"text":"There are so many different sauces! And types of noodles! And ways that they are cooked! And, you can be a creep and watch the noodle guy through the window. The noodles are really good, and the soups are pretty good too, although I am still not sure what exactly fish balls are. I recommend the sesame paste noodles if you aren't feeling too risky. If you are feeling risky, go for the fish balls and let me know how that goes."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the noodles were really good and you get to watch through a little window as they make the noodles (which is very cool!), but the place smelled REALLY bad. The odor was hard to describe - between really really really bad rotting fish and something chemical/synthetic. The rest of our food was average (fried tofu, shrimp platter, fish/shrimp noodles, vegetable noodles), but the horrible smell turned our stomachs. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Watch noodles being pulled while you wait! lol  The thick noodles are the best, they are long, mis-shaped, chewy and just plain wonderful. However, the real gems on the menu have nothing to do with noodles! Their you choy (their spelling) and the green beans with garlic are phenomenal. The you choy is served in a delicate light broth, and steaming hot. The green beans are stir-fried whole with large cloves of garlic, worth the long drive to Mesa.   The service is not great, at all, but if you are looking for good customer service and cheery employees, you are shopping in the wrong plaza. Its part of the fun though right?"}
{"text":"Fresh handmade noodle. You can select different width of the noodle. El dente.  Service is very fast.  No doubt this is best Chinese noodle house in town."}
{"text":"I live about 1000 miles across town from this place, but was driving my husband to the Mesa Gateway Airport, which I swear was in western New Mexico and needed to take a detour here on the way home. I had heard and read so much about it plus I am a sucker for Asian food and noodles, so not really a choice.  I took some time to learn the menu, full of dozens of options plus LOTS of authentic Asian delicacies, such as pig ears and tendon (neither of which I fear) and after a recommendation from the waiter, settled on the ground pork in sauce (over noodles of course). The food literally hit my table in less than 5 minutes! It was hot and delicious and I got to watch them making noodles while I ate. There were so many combinations I would have like to have tried. Next time I have a few hours to kill, I will grab some friends or family to go with me so I can try more entrees by stealthily eating off their plates. If you are lucky enough to live near by, GO. NOW! And think of me...  PS: In multiple subsequent visits I would have to say you should not miss the XO sauce on either the wide or shaved noodles and the not to be missed dumplings, steamed or fried (though I think I preferred the steamed) are mind boggling in the amount of flavor packed into those puppies and the amount you get for the teeny price is incredible."}
{"text":"I am a real fan of Pho and there are quite a few option in this area. I have seen this place next to LeeLee's for a while but never thought anything of it. The other night I needed something just for myself so i figured I would go in for a to-go order.  It was really quite good. Everything was fresh - especially the noodles - and the meat and broth were great tasting. One of the better places in the area. Looking forward to going back. Service was very friendly and fast  While the place had a funky smell upon entering - don't let that put you off. The food is excellent and watching them make the noodles fresh on the spot is an extra treat."}
{"text":"Freshly made noodles for a good price.  Portions are fairly large for the price as well.  We got 2 noodle dishes to go, and they were pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"I had wanted to try this place for a long time, but was extremely underwhelmed. I got the seafood with stir-fried noodles and my husband got the beef with stir-fried noodles in XO sauce. Mine was so bland and the noodles too chewy. I had to add chile sauce and soy sauce to taste it. His tasted good, but was missing the beef. There was only one other table in the place and three people working in front, but nobody came to check on us until we were through and they all were engaged in their cell phones. One employee was even watching videos, and very well could've been on a break, but I didn't care to hear them. The magic noodles weren't enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"The noodles here are spectacular! I have never been able to deviate from the chicken stir fry with noodles because I love it. You can watch them make the noodles on site, which is a great way to entertain my kids while we wait for our food. On several occasions, I have also purchased noodles to take and stir fry at home. You can get an order of plain noodles for about $3, which I think is fair."}
{"text":"Best noodles ever!! Plus service is fast and friendly. The wavy flat noodles are the way to go. All of them are good but that's my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Fresh noodles and the largest Dumplings I've ever had. I had the Beef Rib Noodle soup and my hubby had Spicy Chicken noodle stir fry.  There were too many onions in the stir fry dish. The servers seemed a bit annoyed that we were not ready to order.  Serving size was enough to bring home leftovers. The flavors of our food was ok, but  we won't rush back. Decent place for lunch."}
{"text":"We all have those iconic food moments in our lives and one of mine was in a small noodle shop off the Hibaya subway line in Tokyo where they made noodles by hand, scraping noddles off a huge block of dough, with a pastry scraper, into a large wok of boiling water with huge clouds of steam rising up into the cooking area (they also made one hell of a pan fried Gyoza that I still dream about), and I've spent the last two years thinking how great to have a place like it in Phoenix.   Well, wishes do come true because I was flipping through the 2010 best of Phoenix from New Times earlier this week and China Magic Noodle House was in there as a place to try so today, after watching the early screening of the movie Social Networking, I headed over to Chandler to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised to see it in the same shopping center as Lee Lee's, an Asian market that people have been telling me to check out for ages.  Well, I walk in and a fairly large space with plenty of tables. The menu had several types of noodles and through a glass window in the back you can see cooks making fresh noodles. I chose the scraped noodles with minced pork since that seemed the closest to what I had in Japan. I also noticed that they had a variety of fresh fruit drinks (included a special of watermelon for $2), but stuck with water so I could focus on the noodles. The ones that came out were scraped and somewhat longer than the ones I had in Tokyo and they seemed a bit drier as well, though when I mixed up the bowl there was some great pork broth, along with shredded lettuce. I added some hot chili paste that was provided on the table and a splash or two of soy sauce, did another mix, and well, started eating.  Okay, different from the noodles in Tokyo but...I had one of those great food experiences where you sort of zone out a bit because you enjoy what you are eating so much. Something about the fresh made noodles, the flavorful mix of pork meat and broth, and the slight bite of the chili paste was, as we say in Hawaii, Ono (good)! I don't know if I am willing to say I love the place yet but from a first try, I am definitely a fan. The best part, after the meal you can go cruise around in Lee Lee's for a bit and see specialty food items from just about every Asian culture you can imagine. Next time I go to the noodle shop I'll try the soup noodles - the soup noodles with lamb is on my radar! All I can say, I hope they expand and open a place in Tempe. Their food is inexpensive, fresh, and tasty, perfect for college students."}
{"text":"These are some of the best dumplings I have ever had!! Way more than I expected. I got them to take home along with the beef noodles and I have plenty left over for a couple more meals!"}
{"text":"YUP.  Came here for lunch today, and it's official-  this is a Scott P. spot. I crave this shit, even just a few hours after eating it. Granted, this was only my second time here, and that's a big soon for a five-star rating, but I'll be duckfucked if this place doesn't make me smile in a big way.  For starters... they serve BOILED PEANUTS and daikon radish as soon as you sit down. Did you hear me?? I said:  THEY SERVE BOILED PEANUTS!! When's the last time you had some boiled peanuts!??! Have you EVER had boiled peanuts?? I know it's a Southern thing, but it's just one of those unexpected treats in life where you're like:  \"HOLY SHITSTEAM! This place serves one of my favourite foods without me even asking for me!!\"  Yeah.  So anyways- their noodles = I crave. Especially the 'hand-shaved' noodles (style E). THey just absorb whatever sauce they're in, and their texture is just MM MM MMM goodness.  Yeah. I'll shut up now, but I really have to say that you need to at least try this place. You owe it to yourself to try this place. And bring your mom."}
{"text":"I asked co-workers to treat me to CMNH for my birthday and wasn't disappointed. The dumplings weren't vegetarian friendly, but I sampled one, and it was amazing.  Huge portions at great prices."}
{"text":"Inspired to write this because I saw a photo on yelp that was titled \"steamed gyoza-FAIL\".  Allow me set the record straight: The dumplings here are straight up amazing. I lived in China for a year and I ate more than my fair share of dumplings...and I will tell you that these are the only ones I've found in the US that we're even close to resembling what I had in china.  No, they aren't the same as the pre packaged skin, tiny, flavorless gray meat filling ones you get at nearly every other restaurant in the states. They are made fresh and legit. The skin is thick and chewy. The meat highly seasoned. And fried to perfection.   If you call Chinese dumplings by a Japanese spelling, that should tell you something. And ordering them steamed is a fail in itself, but that is user error, not a fault of the kitchen.   In short: go here, order the dumplings, get them fried. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"I got their beef noodle dish which was pretty good, though just a little bland. My food came out pretty quickly as well which was a plus."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we found this place. At least once a month China Magic Noodle House is a go-to for us when we don't feel like cooking. Obviously the noodles are the star here, and for good reason, but the pork dumplings are also huge and so good! We always get the spicy xo beef noodle dish which has varied quite a bit in spiciness from order to order but is still always good. I always get take out but its still fun to watch them making the noodles when I pick it up. They always get our order correct and are super efficient. Never have to wait! :)"}
{"text":"So we got carry out from here, and when I walked in it smelled funny and I was worried. I should have been, because the food was AMAZING! Shaved noodles in OX tail soup was to die for, as were the steam dumplings of heaven! My husband got the hand drawn noodles in XO sauce and just loved it. Really good price too! I recommend the shaved noodles myself for a yummy chewy noodle, but the hand drawn weren't anything to sneeze at.  I would like to eat in, you can watch the chef prepare the noodles which sounds fun!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. All the food is off the hook yummy! The food comes out very fast. The best part is watching them make the noodles fresh!"}
{"text":"having waited for an Asian noodle shop to open in the East Valley, i was thrilled to read good reviews about this place that was right down the road.  So, on New Year's Eve day, we headed to CMNH.  It was filled with families of all kinds, including a birthday party.  The host was cordial, and willingly walked us through the menu explaining the different types of noodles and dishes.  We each ordered something different.  I had the shredded pork with shaved noodles...which are toothsome and tasty.  The sauce was full of flavor and it was hard to stop well after i was overfull.  Husband had a spicy dish with a thinner noodle.  He managed to eat it all!  Daughter had yet another noodle and another meat.  We enjoyed them all immensely.  Nice touches -- the pickled veggies they bring out to snack on while you wait for your dish, being able to watch the noodle maker through a window into the kitchen (he likes to wave at the kids), and great fruit smoothies."}
{"text":"This place is still pretty good food-wise but everything in my last review is still the same. No changes have been made to their attitudes or how food comes out so I can't give any more stars but I'll continue to visit every so often."}
{"text":"First things first, potstickers.  I don't care that this place is called a noodle house, and a magic one at that, get yourself some of those potstickers.  And fried too, none of this boiled business.  Heck, just order that and have that as your meal, they're definitely big enough.  Okay now on to what the name says they're good for, noodles.  The hubby ordered the stir fry beef with spicy XO sauce (#34) with thick noodles and well, to put it simply, he was extremely satisfied with his order.  However, I had a try and though I'm no noodle connoisseur, the noodles were a little tougher than I was expecting, reminding me of undercooked spaghetti.  I'm not sure if this was the correct texture of this noodle, but I wasn't a huge fan.  I did however, really enjoy the spicy XO sauce which definitely gave it a little kick, but nothing too overwhelming which was much appreciated.  My beef stew (#25) with flat noodles, was more of a soup (who would've thought, you know, being a stew and all), and flat noodles were a mistake.  The noodles aren't cut up to fit on your spoon so you're left to fend for yourself against these absurdly long, flat noodles with a pair of chopsticks, and in my case, some feeble chopstick-wielding hands.  I made a mess, with noodles falling back into my bowl of soup ever so often, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  The soup which is broth-ier than pho was delicious - I finished every last drop, and the meat which was so flavorful and soft, was gone seconds after I got my bowl.  Now that's saying something, cause I'm a carbs girl and would go all out for them noodles but, but!  I am really sad to say that in either noodle dish, I felt that there wasn't enough meat.  I probably got 4 slices of beef in mine, and there was probably 5 slices in the hubby's dish.  Otherwise, the portion sizes are substantial, as long as you like noodles.  I mean seriously, if you don't, you shouldn't be here.  Oh well they do sell fried rice, so there's that."}
{"text":"First time coming to this place. Can't believe I didn't know it existed! I've been to Lee Lee's market a bunch of times in the past, not recently though. Never really stopped to get food nearby though. I'm glad I came back to this area to eat.    We ordered: - pan fried dumplings  - beef with noodles  - minced pork with noodles   All of it was really good and came out super fast. Definitely will need to pay that supermarket area/ restaurants a visit more often when craving Asian food."}
{"text":"Still have awesome noodles! I always ordered #16A & veg's garlic stir fry!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is as good as it gets with respect to fast casual Chinese food.  They could easily redecorate the inside, get a liquor license, and charge 3x what they do currently and they would not receive any complaints.  Generous portions with authentic flavors in all of the dishes I have tried.  I am already looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"China Magic Noodle House could hands down be the best noodles I've had in all of AZ. Awesome local spot that never disappoints. No joke, my family and I have come here at least twice a month for the past six months. Our kids love it too, which is hard to achieve.   The wife and I share a #34 - Beef w/ Stir-fried Noodles in Spicy XO sauce, and a #24 - Sliced Beef with Noodles Soup. We also share an order dumplings (which can be ordered steamed or panfried) with the kiddos, who typically enjoy chicken with stir-fry noodles and dumplings.   They also have a HUGE selection of boba options, which is always nice after a great meal!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a handful of times and believe that every single experience has been great.   Service: Prompt, friendly and quick Food: Handmade, tasty and consistent  Atmosphere: Clean, spacious and modern"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon 4pm, meeting my sister for late lunch. Parking was terrible as there was no parking near the restaurant and I had to park across the way with a sleeping 1 yr old. Outside the restaurant is an empty tent and tons of young Asian men with blaring music. Why? No idea. I keep wondering what was going on.... There was no promotions or specials or anything..... Very obnoxious. Food was good however. We split the chicken stir fry. I would try it again and hopefully there will be less commotion next time."}
{"text":"I tried this place for lunch and got the #32 which was chicken noodles and an order of steamed dumplings. The dumplings were huge and were pretty good. The noodles on the other hand were very chewy and it honestly tasted like beef ramen noodles (I ordered chicken). The chicken tasted like flavored plastic. There were more bean sprouts, celery, and onions, than there were noodles. I could have boughten a pack of top ramen for 25 cents and made it taste better. I was so excited to try this place because of all the reviews on here but oh well!   The customer service in the beginning was good but after that they never came to check up on us.So many of our \"excuse me mam's\" went unnoticed. I definitely don't plan on coming back here."}
{"text":"Number 34 is out of this world! This is my new comfort food :)  Servers are nice,  no pressure to hurry and eat.  Noodles are of course fresh.   Need more vegetables in the noodles though."}
{"text":"Dayamn these are some good noodles! Went here for lunch with a Chinese friend at work who recommended it. Got the beef with XO spicy sauce and they were delicious. The soups look really good too but I have gotten fried noodles both times. Like most places in Phoenix, the location fucking blows, a strip mall in the sprawl. But that doesn't affect the flavor, which is excellent. Hopefully you can avoid getting served by the moody young girl."}
{"text":"I love this place. Hard to find authentic Chinese food in the valley, but this is one of them. All noodles are made fresh in house. Simple menu,Huge portions..."}
{"text":"my entire family likes the Noodles with spicy sauce(any shapes) and the Pan fried dumplings."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing. I am not a big Asian food fan but once my girlfriend dragged me here I absolutely loved it. Their dumplings are delicious and their noodles are out of this world. Got to go with the noodles and pork sauce! You won't be disappointed! We ordered two dishes each, dumplings, and fried tofu and it came out to 30 bucks, super inexpensive and delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their made to order noodle dishes are delicious and have spoiled me. Yes, I recommend dining here and yes I will definitely return again and again."}
{"text":"Awesome!   Here are some of the dishes we order every time we are in town. Steam dumplings, greens, fried tofu, salt and pepper fried shrimp, beef with fried noodles in XO spicy sauce, and beef noodles with lemon topped with garlic. All are very tasty.  Oh and the boiled peanuts and pickled radish appetizer are really good."}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant. It is our go to for all occasions. It's authentic, cheap and damn delicious! The noodles are perfection, dumpling on point, tofu is excellent and their customer service is awesome! Not to mention that their boba is so yummy!"}
{"text":"Best noodles around!! Love watching them hand stretch the noodles so you know they are as fresh as possible."}
{"text":"Outstanding!    Places like this are a dime a dozen in Beijing or Monterey Park, but not so common here.    Big, hearty portions of hand-made noodles.  Dumplings the size of a fat plum, full of meat.  Grandpa making noodles by hand and dozing in a chair in between courses.  What's not to like?  This is northern Chinese \"stick to your ribs\" style.  Nothing fancy but perfectly executed.  I love it, personally but some people here are apparently a bit less enthusiastic.    Just thinking about it makes me hungry.  The display kitchen is a nice touch.  Great value too.  A huge lunch for two and an extra order to go for later ran us about $24."}
{"text":"The Magic Noodle was our first stop after getting off the plane for our AZ weekend and we were pleasantly surprised at how good the noodles were. In particular the \"seafood with cream sauce\" dish which sounds totally disgusting (and not much better looking) but was the best dish of the day. Of course, be sure to order all of your noodle dishes with the hand pulled noodle option.  Back to the seafood with cream sauce dish: I am not a fan of cream sauces. I hate alfredo, bechamel, etc. but this cream sauce was the BEST medium to bring out the natural sweetness and full bodied flavor of the hand pulled noodles. This cream sauce did not have any cheese in it and the seafood wasn't the highest quality either (just ignore the seafood). Our young waiter recommended this dish as the best of the house and my mom decided to give it a shot. No one touched the dish until we ate all the other food and were forced to acknowledge its presence.  Overwhelmingly, this dish became our favorite. Luckily it was generously sized so everyone got enough.  The hand pulled noodles were thinner than I expected, about ramen width sized and I enjoyed watching the noodle man smack and twist them into my order.  Something I could never do and the packaged stuff just doesn't compare. If you really want to appreciate the flavor and texture of these noodles, I highly recommend trying out the seafood cream dish.   Overall, this place is a bargain. Besides the above referenced dish, we had the oxtail noodle soup (not a lot of meat in it although the broth was delicious), stir fried noodles with XO sauce and a fried fish special. All were very good!  I always rate small hole-in-the-wall places solely by the food because service is usually dismal and this place was no different."}
{"text":"We were driving from Tucson to home in Cali and stopped here to eat dinner. We found this place on Yelp and tried it coz it has good Yelp reviews and pictures.  We ordered Seafood stir fried noodle, minced pork sauce noodle, and pan fried dumpling for two. Portion was so big so we took more than half of our food home. Service was great and food was ready in 5-10 minutes! Homemade noodles were so fresh and yummy! We want to come back when we are back in the area again. Too bad we don't live here..."}
{"text":"My short trips to Phoenix always include a meal (or 2) here. Noodles are fresh and made at the restaurant. There are lots of options to choose from and a handful of various noodle sizes to try. My favorites are the minced pork with noodles and the niu rou mien (beef noodle soup). This place is definitely worth a try! Service is always quick too."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for awhile and I love this place. It's all about the food and the freshens of the noodles. Don't come here thinking about great atmosphere, decor, or service. This place is all about the good. Fresh noodles.   The place is very casual and either you pick  a table or they will pick a table for you. The table already has a bunch of chop sticks and soup spoons stack on each table with paper napkins for your liking. The servers there speak mostly Chinese but can speak English. Sometimes you have to repeat yourself to make sure they got the order right.   I always order the seafood noodles with shrimp, squid, and fish balls. It has cabbage, carrots, onions. I have order the different noodle types. Usually order the normal or thick noodles but any noodles you order are always good. They have four or five different noodles you can choose from.   Oh yes, the pan fried dumplings are huge. It comes with eight in an order. They are so juicy and always cooked perfectly. I always have to order their dumplings. I think they are probably the best that I've found in Arizona or California. It's that good.   Overall, I love this noodle place and have no problem coming here all the time cause the noodles are so fresh. Yum yum. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Poor service. We're about to finish and they rushed us to finish our food because they are about to close"}
{"text":"i'm not a big noodle person but i had to try this place after reading a number of articles on it.  I got the seafood pasta and the bf got a beef stir fry. We also got a small plate of fresh veggies and pig ear. The food was fast, tasty, and cheap. I was a little disappointed with the seafood pasta dish in that it seemed to just be some corn, shrimp, and crab meat in alfredo sauce but that was more my fault on picking the wrong dish.   The noodles were soft and tender. You can also watch the guy match the noodles too. The small dishes or veggies and pig ear taht we got was a lot more than what I was expecting. I also liked that they give you a small dish of peanuts and radish. Overall the food was cheap and tasty which is what I like and look for."}
{"text":"I liked CMNH.  I didn't love it, but I'll be back because my 3 year old daughter LOVED it.  She had the B noodles in the chicken stir fry.  I liked the flavors in her dish a lot.  I had the D noodles with beef.  Very bland.  With the chili oil and a little srirachi, it was ok, but still not a lot of flavor.  When I go back, I'm going to try one of the soups and get one of the stir fried noodle dishes to see if I just chose the wrong dish.  We also had the chilled spicy beef tendon which was ok, but not great."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!  I got the noodle chicken stir fry. The flavor was really good and there were plenty of vegtables and chicken. You can see them making the noodles through a glass window . Very cool.  Service was ok and it is a bit pricey for a whole in the wall little place."}
{"text":"Went there last night had the beef stew noodle soup . It was ok till you hit the meat it was tough and kind of on the beef jerk side told waitress she said oh im sorry but with that look of and ..ok the noodles where good nothing extciting and you can watch the no enthusing noodle maker make them .. why have a window . the service was bad never brought our peanuts and pickle plate till we ask because we saw someone else get and was curious. never asked if we need another drink so tip was 0.00 .. if looking for a noodle soup get some Pho i know this was a chinese noodle but it lacked compared at any of the other restaurants in town making way better then this.. the food is just ok once you eaten at many other Chinese based restaurants it fits in as another fill spot."}
{"text":"We ordered the noodle lamb and oxtail noodle soup with the wide and thick noodles respectively. The helpings were big, but mostly noodles with a small portion of meat. I admit was a little disappointed in the lamb, I was hoping it was the sliced lamb and not the littles lamb bits with lots of skin. The lamb flavor was still very good, it was just not what I was hoping for. The broth on the hand was really yummy; normally  I'm the type of person that just eats the noodles and leaves the soup, but this time I kept wanting more of the broth.  The service here was really good, they were quick to take the order and patient in telling us about the different types of noodles. I love the boiled peanuts and pickled veggies the brought out for us to snack on, and they were kind enough to give us more when we were done. They also gave us sesame balls with red bean paste inside (complementary) to try as well.  We definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite Asian food in Tempe! The broth is so flavorful and the noodles so fresh. Watch the guy in the window make the noodles :)"}
{"text":"Portions are large.  I got beef tendon did order which comes as a cold side dish.  I added it into my oxtail soup and OMG!!!!  It became soft and melt in your mouth delicious! Salt and pepper fish is delicious also with the dark vinegar.  Mmmmmm highly recommend this place!l"}
{"text":"This place is kinda no-frills, but it deserves five stars because it is a tremendous value and a rare treat. I mean, it's all about the hand-pulled noodles, which makes any other pre-made pasta develop a severe inferiority complex. Enough anthropomorphizing the noodles though... the window into the kitchen to watch the noodles being made is such a cool feature! The dude I saw working the impossible noodle slinging had really impressive forearms... I'm sure he earned them from years and years of pasta wrangling.  This is the kind of under-celebrated hidden spot that is worth showing off... and picking up the tab will not hurt you dearly. I blew my roommate's mind by trotting this one out, although I had only been once a couple of years prior. What reminded me about this place was another friend raving about the potstickers. The pan-fried dumplings are huge... and essentially pure meat inside. The only \"filler\" is a smidge of green onion. Share these as an appetizer and then pound your delicious entrée (I had #22 - noodles and minced pork). And then the Oompah-Loompahs can roll you out the door afterward, because my friend, you will be stuffed blissfully full with noodle goodness!  Do yourself a favor and pool your couch change. Then come down here to see the Asian Popeye whip your noodles from fresh dough. Get the fried dumplings as big as your fist! Stuff an ungodly pile of steaming pasta down yer gullet! But you might want to wear a bib, if you're hesitant to cut your luxuriously long noodles. The need to slurp them up is very strong indeed... and you know it's just that good when you soil your shirt."}
{"text":"I got the chicken fried noodle. Sizes are definitely family style. Depending on how hungry you are, you will definitely have left overs. Service was fast and great. The food was not the most exciting or pretty looking but will fill you up. They have a window inside where you can watch them hand make/pull the noodles, which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times but my most recent visit was phenomenal. My fried noodles were seasoned to perfection, usually it's a bit salty for my liking. Way bigger portions than before. I also noticed a difference in the milk tea. It had a stronger aroma of the black tea."}
{"text":"The egg rolls here!! Enough said. Really cool experience to be able to watch them pull the noodles in the window. Food took a little bit but it was busy that day. The main noodle dishes are what u recommend. The meat/restaurant smelled a little funky but maybe it was just me/the raw meat smell of Lee Lee's permeating through the walls"}
{"text":"Solid.  Fresh noodles right now.  I pull for you.   Menu is not huge but varies from pedestrian dishes like yellow curry chicken which was very mild to spicy pigs ears.  I had the yellow curry chicken and while it was good I wished for heat from the curry.  Fellow yelper Kevin H had the spicy pigs ears which proved that he is more adventurous at ear chewing than I am.   Overall I think China Magic Noodle House is pretty good and you can't beat fresh pulled noodles."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Been here a few times, always liked it, this last time was the best and finally bumps it up to 5 stars.  We ordered marinated tendon, hot and spicy pig ears, an oxtail noodle soup, and a beef rib noodle soup.  The marinated tendon and spicy pig ears were both good.  Chewy, well-seasoned, no complaints.  The review mainly goes to what should be the star here - the noodles.  Sometimes the broth here can be a little salty.  Not today.  Clean, beefy taste, balanced, with herbal notes from cilantro.  The noodles were plentiful and perfectly cooked.  They were long, good chew, good thickness.  The meat in each of our bowls is kind of an afterthought.  You can order whatever meat you want and the broth and noodles are going to taste the same.  The meat is a welcome but unnecessary addition to this excellent bowl of noodle soup.    I also heartily recommend the noodles with XO sauce.  These are a fried noodle and the sauce is great.  Really delicious.  A little oily, but delicious.  Hand-pulled noodles are just superior in most ways to factory noodles, and the noodles here measure up to great pulled noodles in NYC and LA."}
{"text":"Dumplings. Awesome. Noodles. Also pretty awesome. The texture of the dough/noodles was chewy and yummy. We ordered four noodle dishes... And all had the same flavor except for the meat of choice. Sliced beef. Meh. Go for the beef stew meat if you want beef. The stir fry noodle dish was also more flavorful than the noodle soups.   Dont pass on the dumplings. You get 8 gigantic pieces. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Noodles are freshly made, service is quick, plentiful portions. Flavors are just ok. I got the seafood noodle soup. Hubby got the chicken lo mien and it was better than the soup.   The highlight was the appetizer. The dumplings (pot stickers;fried ones) were super good and large! Almost equivalent to meatballs wrapped w dough & pan fried. The dipping sauce was good but needed extra spice for my taste."}
{"text":"This place is the best for noodles - hands down.  You'd pay three times this amount for noodles this delicious.  The noodles are not only made fresh, they're freshly hand-pulled before your eyes.  Watch through the glass window in the back of this small, no frills space as the noodles are stretched and pulled to the perfect thickness, then cooked up fresh to order.  Can't get noodles like this anywhere else in the state - the last time I had them was NYC's Chinatown, and I'm not convinced this place isn't better.  Make sure you remember to specify what type of noodles you want when you order:  handpulled are standard, but the shaved noodles are also a favorite of mine.  The shaved texture helps pull sauce into every nook and cranny - and the sauce is fantastic!  The XO sauce has great spice and flavor, the oyster sauce has a delicate sweetness, and the beef and lemon noodles' tangy, savory sauce - although unusual - has a strange addictive quality.  Although going just for the noodles is reason enough, don't miss the pig ears, either.  Served hot or cold and good either way, they are chewy, spicy, oily, and a great way to snack during the short wait for your food.  They pair nicely with the complimentary boiled peanuts.  You may also want an order of the dumplings, either steamed or pan fried.  While not the best dumplings in the Valley, an order is plentiful and not unsatisfying.  The dumplings' texture and flavor is great, but they are so plump and large that the seasoned meat flavor overpowers the dumpling."}
{"text":"The noodles are delicious here. I had the vegetarian spicy noodle. It doesn't come with anything but noodles and the sauce. It would be great if they could add some veggies in there though. So you chose the type of noodle you want and then the flavor. The prices are super cheap and the service is fast. The portions are huge and I could have eaten the whole plate if I didn't stop myself. I am curious to know if they use MSG because it was that hard to stop eating."}
{"text":"They HAND MAKE their OWN noodles! It's a rare find to find a place that does this!  A friend and I ordered their:  Noodles minced with pork  Beef rib with pork noodles  So I thought to myself, China Magic Noodles? Sounds cheap and not very good. I was completely wrong. I enjoyed with noodles minced with pork! I even told my friend I was going to save some for dinner but I ended up eating the entire plate to myself. YUM!!   The portions are pretty huge too, enough to feed two per plate. We split the bill and it came out to $7 each -- not bad! =)"}
{"text":"China Magic Noodle House China Magic Noodle House is located on N Dobson Rd Ste 2 Chandler, AZ 85224. It is a nice restaurant with alot of options. We were confused on how to order but the waiter was very helpful. Our  meal was okay we order noodle B and it was too thick for our taste but if we order another type of noodle I bet we would've liked it a whole lot better. The spring rolls were amazing especially with sriracha sauce! We also order dumplings and they were huge we didn't finish them all it comes with 8 per platter and we only finished 2 dumplings. The food affordable and you get a big serving for the price. The reason why we wanted to go visit China Magic Noodle House was because you get to see the noodles being made right in front of you which was pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Love the food the noodles are great. But I feel strange coming in and eating here, because we are not Asian we get treated differently and I'm sure that happens many places and cultures are different so it might seem a lil strange when someone else from a different ethnic group comes in. The time we came in to eat we waited and sat down first. A group of Asian guys came in after us and were greeted and served small dishes before the meal they were more helpful with them than us. We got water and then they left us alone till they brought out our food. After we sat there eating everyone was just staring and I got very uncomfortable so I told my husband let's go. I probably will not dine in here again but the food was great so maybe To go is easier for non Asian people."}
{"text":"I must have ordered the wrong thing here. My hand pull noodles stuck together the same way the Safeway brand noodles I undercook at home stick together. The beef and its sauce was pretty darn tasty, but isn't this place supposed to be all about the noodles?  Service was completely rushed and they stared at us while we ate. It was so awkward."}
{"text":"Hand pulled noodle is my favorite dish ever. I wouldn't miss a single hand pulled noodle restaurant I can find. We ordered a lamb noodle soup and a beef noodle soup. The lamb one was pretty good, however, the beef one was not that good. When it comes to hand pulled noodle, it's always about the soup. Their beef soup was tasteless and too sweet."}
{"text":"I was impressed with their selection of noodles. The dumplings were amazing also. This kind of food takes me back to my grandma's home cooked food. Would like to come here if I am ever back in Arizona."}
{"text":"I'm happy to discover Magic Noodle exists. Moving to the area, I thought it might be difficult to find a Chinese place with decent noodle soups and homemade dumplings but I was wrong. Now China Magic Noodle isn't exactly the fanciest place, but I wouldn't expect it to be. I lend the five stars because the quality is great, and this cuisine with this level of quality is rare in these parts.   Obviously the most important part, the noodles, are homemade on the spot. There's a window into the kitchen where you can actually watch them roll and hand pull the noodles. Not only are they homemade but there are 5 different kinds depending on your preference for thickness and length. I had the beef noodle soup with shaved noodles and the broth was excellent, as were the homemade noodles. Truly well done.   We also ordered some dumplings which were also very good, but given the portion sizes there was no way we were finishing everything. The dumplings are huge! Great homemade wrappers and they come either steamed or fried.  You could probably share an order of these and be satisfied without having to order anything else.  The menu items are all priced very fairly, especially given the massive portions they dish out. If you order like two entrees and an appetizer, be prepared to take a bunch home or feel really uncomfortable at the end of the night.   Overall, I'm a bit biased because Chinese noodle soup is one of my favorite foods, and also hard to find, but I think Magic Noodle deserves recognition for its great homemade noodles and dumplings. They also offer some more traditional fried rices and noodle stir fries which are every bit as good, but if you're in the market for a nice Chinese noodle soup, this is your place."}
{"text":"Wow.  Who cares about the interiors when the handmade noodles are this good.  My new go to for Chinese stir fry or soups in the East valley.  What a little gem!"}
{"text":"It's due time I write a review for this place.  I come here and pick up food twice a week.  Like others say about it, I crave it hours after I am done eating.  I always get the same thing because I love it.  The sliced beef soup.  I am not sure why.  I am not one to eat the same things all the time, however... this is my favorite meal of the past 6 months.  My wife loves the chicken stir fry.  Yesterday we tried the dumplings and they were splendid as well.   This place also always has a crowd.  It's not like Jong Wah where you're lucky to find one person dining in.  The family that runs the place is very friendly and accommodating.  They remember me and my son when we go in there.  Some conversation is struck up with the owner, he is a very nice man.  My son loves watching them make the noodles, they always smile and wave to him.  He also LOVES the smoothies.  SLICED BEEF TIP OF THE DAY Word of advice with the slice beef soup for take out... take all the noodles and put them in a bowl.  Spoon out all the veggies and beef (I also add a marinated egg every time) now you have a cup of broth.  Add one packet of soy sauce, a tsp of sirachi and half a ramekin of the homemade chili oil they give you.  Stir it up and pour over the noodles.  It will have a tiny kick but will not be over bearing.  Do not try this if you don't like spice."}
{"text":"Beef stir fry #31. I've had better. I don't get the hype. The wait staff wasn't friendly at all. The only person that was nice was the noodle maker behind the glass. He smiled at me. The egg rolls were not good."}
{"text":"Really neat little place. The dumplings are delicious and HUGE. You can tell the noodles are hand made, and that the chefs know what they are doing. Very authentic, and delicious. Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I just try Magic Noodle House and it is the best place for real home made noodles. The dumpling is just amazing and so good a must try. My new favorite place for sure!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here on Small Biz Saturday, and I don't need to visit again to give it 5 stars. Outstanding.  It's not the suavest-looking, spotlessly-clean interior here at the end of a Chandler strip mall next to the Lee-Lee Asian Market, but the taste of the food they serve is pretty incredible.  We ordered the pan-fried dumplings, and the #24 (beef and noodle soup) and $34 (beef and stir-fried noodles in spicy XO sauce). Portions were pretty big and perfect to share.   The noodles are made by hand when you order. There's a window where you can see them being tossed, pulled, stretched, wound, and cut to be cooked.   The flavor of the filling inside the dumplings was not at all like the likely frozen and re-heated dumplings at most asian restaurants. It was more savory, meatier and had a lot more depth. The texture of the fried dough on the outside and the softness of the inside of the dumplings is also unique. If I didn't know better, I'd say they were roasted instead of fried.   The noodles have the perfect chew and sublime al dente, it's hard to stop eating them, no matter how they're prepared. I did like the flavors they absorbed with the XO sauce and the hot chili oil, and would definitely recommend trying #34 if you visit.   I don't live anywhere near Chandler, but I'm looking for excuses to come back to China Magic real soon."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love freshly hand made noodles?! I brought one of my coworkers along with me to try this place out. Went during the lunch rush so it was pretty busy in there & only 2 waiters working! Service was quick though.  I ordered the pan fried dumplings & the spicy xo beef with wide noodles. The dumplings were huge! The outside dough of the dumplings you can tell were made using the same dough for the noodles. They were generously stuffed with meat & pan fried to perfection. The noodle dish was also such a huge portion. Not as spicy as I expected it to be. My coworker loves spicy food but he was afraid it would might be too spicy but when he tried a bite of mine, he said it was just the right amount of heat. I on the other hand would have liked It a little spicier.  Overall flavors of the noodles were amazing. Just wish it had some more veggies in the dish. The noodles had a nice chewy texture to them. & You can even watch the guy through the glass hand tossing noodles!"}
{"text":"I usually whine and complain about places, but I can't with this place.. Great service the ten or so times I've been there. Portions are huge, my two girls and I can share two orders and still have left overs. I love the fresh hand pull noodles.. The prices and varieties are great, for those who rated one or two stars I really think you need to give this place another shot..   I usually have the beef with fried noodles, dumplings. It is all good at a great price."}
{"text":"We had tasty beef soup with hand-pulled noodles and a chicken dish with noodles. We were in noodle heaven.  The service was quick and attentive. My daughter got a strawberry smoothie, which was good."}
{"text":"Fresh.  Hand-pulled.  Noodles.   Not only can you watch the chef create and pull your noodles a minute after you order your dish but once he's done it takes about 5 minutes for them to reach your table. I ordered the thick, fried noodle w/ vegetables and my husband ordered the same but with the wide noodles. The noodles have a great texture that I could best describe as being slightly firm with some pleasant chewiness. The sauce was well seasoned, light and flavorful.  The restaurant is clean and bright, the prices are very reasonable, the servings are huge, the staff are fast and friendly and most importantly? It's a short drive from our house.   This was our 1st visit and we're already big fans. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for years, since I love their soups. The last 3 visits I have ordered the lamb noodle soup and the broth has been like drinking water, no flavor at all and only had 3-4 pieces of meat. I wanted to try it again, give them another chance, I even went when they opened to make sure it was fresh. Once again I was disappointed. No flavor, 4 pieces of meat and the noodle quantity was even less than normal. Their noodles are great, you can see them make them! but if you want soups with lots of flavor or just some flavor, I recommend not coming here."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time we tried this place. Hands down the BEST Chinese food I have ever had! I got the beef with stir fry noodles and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing noodles. The shaved noodles are absolutely bomb. Awesome egg rolls too."}
{"text":"Finally, an authentic Asian noodle house in town, I really hope they stick around for a long time.  I wouldn't see any problem if the line of people continue standing out the door waiting for a table on a Saturday night.  I had ordered their pan fried dumplings, but somehow they came out steamed. I had to request to take it back.  I normally don't like to refuse food; you never know what you end up.   As for the noodle dishes, the shaved noodles were okay, it wasn't what I expected.  I was thinking of thinker noodle in ball shapes instead of long strips.  It was sort of difficult to eat.  The beef noodle with lemon topped with garlic was delicious according to my Sis-in-Law.  It just doesn't look like an Asian dish.  The noodle with Minced Pork was the best.  However, I wish they had cut the noodles so it would be easier to pull by using the chopstick.  The beef tripe noodle soup wasn't bad either.  One thing is that they actually ran out of wontons.  WHAT?  Wonton and noodle are like bacon and egg.  How can you run out at a noodle house?  As for the service, we had friendly waitress, but very forgetful.  If you want to sit and enjoy a long meal, don't come on a Saturday night.  I felt the wait staff was rushing us out after we paid.  I know there are people waiting, but you can't rush people out like we didn't pay.  I didn't even get to finish my dumplings.  Boo Hoo!  I thought the guy making the noodles deserve more tips as he was entertaining the kids. Great babysitter as the parent dines."}
{"text":"Round 2, Had to come back and try this place again.... OK, the food was great and noodles are bad ass... but we ventured out to try the Dumplings,,,,  Ohhh La La , best Dumpings I have ever had in my life thus far.. Large meat filled and the dough/wraps were friggin awesome... Its a whole meal in itself..."}
{"text":"The portion is big but the quality is not that great. The noodles were undercook and they are stingy with the seafood and meat. Was not satisfied at all. The oxtail soup with noodle did not have that much meat but the soup was good. Not coming back again."}
{"text":"What a great little find.  We had flat fried noodle with chicken (best thing of the night) spicy thick beef noodle, tasty You choy with oyster sauce, very tasty green beans, very yummy Pan friend buns, also delicious  I really enjoyed my meal. they hand make every noodle to order  I typically don't care for fresh noodles because they have a \"raw egg taste,\" to me, but this place had fantastic noodles.  I'm excited to go back and try one of the noodle soups."}
{"text":"I love this place and get take-out from here often.  The staff is always friendly and the food is great!  I usually get the braised noodles with sesame paste, noodles with minced pork sauce, or the salt and pepper swai filet.  Their egg rolls, pan fried dumplings, and teriyaki chicken on a stick are fantastic, too.  And always the lemonade.  I haven't tried dine-in yet, but I plan to because the atmosphere seems nice and the aroma that greets you when you walk in the door is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Fast service, awesome food. I am so full and happy after that meal. The frier buns are delicious and the slightly sweet dipping sauce they're served with is good. Both the regular and spicy stir-fry beef noodles are great. The beef is well cooked and tender and the noodles are pleasantly firm but not hard or raw at all. If you like noodles, come here honestly."}
{"text":"This is my favorite go-to when I'm craving some noodles you really can't beat some fresh shaved noodles they're the right texture and so tasty and they have pretty large portions too"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never been here before. This will now be part of my routine when I travel to Chandler to stock up on supplies. Noodles had just the right amount of chew and were well seasoned. My favorite, though, was the spicy pig's ears: an old favorite that I haven't had in a long time. Lightly chewy and crispy at the same time, very thinly sliced, and nicely flavorful. Lunch and a show! Totally will be returning."}
{"text":"Wow.. I am blown away by my meal here last night. The lamb noodle soup has me craving more. I am going for seconds tonight."}
{"text":"Loved the fried chicken noodles and the dumplings are huge! They only took a few minutes to cook and you can watch everything from sitting inside the restaurant into the kitchen."}
{"text":"I like the idea of hand-pulled noodles but the dish I got lacked any sort of complexity and all flavor was absent."}
{"text":"Handmade noodles, pretty much as good as it gets  Remember that just like Pho, you need to add vinegar, white pepper, chile paste, sirachi, soy, to the flavor profile you desire - it may take a few attempts to create the perfect flavor profile  However once you unlock your hidden combination it is fantastic  The best soup is the beef stew, it is superior to the ox tail, the oxtail is good but the beef stew is a better overall dish, and I highly recommend getting the salt and pepper shrimp, they serve you a huge plate of shrimp  The boiled peanuts and daikon are for texture and palate cleansing to break up the soft noodle and salty broth, great combination"}
{"text":"I've been to China Magic Noodle House a few times now and I have to say they haven't done me wrong yet.  The food is always fresh and good and the service is super friendly for an Asian joint if you know what I mean -=o)   Watching the chef make the fresh noodles in the window is pretty cool.  The noodles itself are so tasty.  I just wish they would have more options for noodle soups.  I've been waiting for a noodle house to open up here in the Valley since I moved out here a few years ago.  The food here is good but it's not the best i've ever tasted.  For the price and quality though, you can't find anything else in the valley like this.  So GO! Cause if you're reading this, you know you want some noodles!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and decor are pretty basic and may fall  short for some, but the food more than makes up for it. Portion sizes are generous and food always satisfies. Great place to go when your tired of the usual.  Soda is sold by the can, just FYI."}
{"text":"Yessss a great noodle house this is ...strictly second time around and no disappointment! Minced pork was fantastic! Mmm pot sticker too...oh they got boba tea!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp and crab noodles. (Wide) they were so delicious. I would have liked less Alfredo sauce and no corn but over all good noodles."}
{"text":"I met a couple of my AOB buddies for lunch here. This joint is really close to my house and I frequent Lee Lee market plus meet buds for coffee at the Micky D's which is practically next door. We got there a little after 1 on a Friday. We were the only ones there. Now, when you talk about Chinese or Asian restaurants in general, one of the \"I'm freakin out\" moments is when you walk in and you're the only one(s) there. Immediately I confer with my comrades and we decide to hang out. \"What's the worse thing that could happen\", T says. \"You've had food poisoning before, it didn't kill ya\". Geeez. The 3 of us grabbed a booth and checked out the menu. Pretty straight forward. The cool thing is you see some of the standard Chinese fare but you get to choose the type of noodle that's in it.  There are 5 different sizes of noodles which are all hand pulled by the noodle maker right behind the glass window. So, if you have kids, bring them here. They can watch the guy making the noodles they're about to eat while you explain that REAL food doesn't come out of a box. But I digress. My one disappointment at this point is that there was no Rice Noodle. My favorite.  T ordered the Pan Fried Dumplings (8) $6.35. You can also get them steamed. Whoa. This is a meal in itself. The dough wrapper, lightly fried around the beef filling was yummy. We each had 2 and were already getting full.  I ordered the Spring Rolls (2) for $3.25. These were ok. Nothing special. I would have preferred a lot more vegetable stuffing. I would not recommend these. Because T, S & I were yapping away and not paying attention to anything but the noodle maker, we didn't realize that we pretty much ordered the same thing. I ordered the Beef With Stir-Fried Narrow Flat Noodles ($8.65). T ordered the Beef With Stir-Fried Shave Noodles In Xo Spicy Sauce ($8.65). So aside from the XO spicy sauce and the size of the noodle, we basically got the same dish. Oooops. With so many yummy things on the menu, this was a major goof on our part. S didn't order anything else which is a good thing because the portion size is plentiful.  Both dishes had plenty of sliced beef, the sauces were quite good and of course the noodles were amazing. S & I devoured the non spicy dish. Be prepared, the narrow flat noodles are VERY long. Which is a good thing because that represents long life and all, but it does make it hard to move from the serving plate to your plate. Plus, the noodles stuck together which made them more of a clump then individual strands. I also helped T with the XO spicy one. This dish was not as spicy as I thought it would be. T was sweating pretty good though and for someone who's family is from Myanmar plus he eats spicy food all the time, I chuckled just a little. This dish was made with shave noodles. These were much easier to move from the serving plate to my plate so yippee there and it was really tasty. Winner winner hand made noodle dinner. I would say that for an empty restaurant, the service was slow. Plus, the waiter brought out my entree first and after a very long pause the two apps, and then finally the other entree. Strange way for the kitchen to put out the dishes. I'll chalk it up to a cook that was maybe woken up from a nap when we walked in. Sorry. The other thing I didn't really like was that the noodles were piled on top of the veggies and sauce. This made it hard to really get the full flavor and texture with each bite until we ate enough of the noodles so we could actually get to some of the veggies. Strange way to present the food. Good food, good portion size, fair prices, cool to watch the noodles being made, friendly staff, slow, out of order service, sticky noodles, upside down presentation. 3 Stars"}
{"text":"This place should be called Magic OMFG Noodle because it was soooooooo gooooooood!    I had the regular noodles with the Beef/Oyster sauce and it did not disappoint.  My friend got a larger size of noodle and said that it was a little too much noodle and she would go with regular next time but the food was still very good.  I ordered the egg rolls which were very \"meh\" but the noodles more than made up for it.    Wish they carried beer or wine but by the time I finished my plate, there wasn't room in my stomach for anything else."}
{"text":"Quality of ingredients have gone down sharply. They have stopped cleaning the veggies (found dirt on my veggies) and shrimps in my seafood soup were not cleaned. The squid had a rancid taste to it. The quantity of meat in the noodle soups have gone down sharply. All I get are the noodles with just a slight amount of meat. Ah well strike this off my list of possible places to eat."}
{"text":"We love this place. No where else can you get dredge noodles made to order including the thickness! The prices and quality are amazing. Love love love this spot!"}
{"text":"The noodles here are so good! I love their pot stickers. They have the perfect ratio of meat to noodle and they have a really good sauce as well. I also ordered the xo spicy noodles. The noodles were great, but the meat was not so good. Also, it didn't have a ton of noodles on the plate. Next time I'll order it without the meat, I want more noodles!! I will definitely eat here again, I will just avoid the beef."}
{"text":"Ordered the stir fry seafood w/thick noodles, my son had the x spicy beef noodle and my bf had the oxtail soup.... All of us said the same thing \"NO FLAVOR\"! Major disappointment, will not be eating here again. Wish I had something nice to say :/"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!  I'm so excited that we have a place like this in the valley.  Simply the best freshly handmade NOODLES!  Soft, chewy, and delicious.  I've been here 4 times already despite living 40 minutes away.  My fav is 'Beef with Soup Noodles'.  You will not be disappointed.  I've traveled to Vancouver, Toronto, Shanghai, Xian, and Beijing.  This is as authentic as Chinese noodles get.  If you don't like this place, you're just not a fan of homemade noodles."}
{"text":"***UPDATE*** I was craving this place so bad, I had my husband drive from Glendale for take out!!! If I could give this place 6 stars I would! Now get your magically delicious noodle butts to the WESTSIDE!!!!   ***Original Review*** We saw this place when we were at Lee's having Bahn Mi and we decided we were gonna try this place next. I am SO GLAD WE DID! This place makes their own noodles on site and I have to say they are the absolute best! We started out with the fried dumplings. These things were so big they could be a meal in itself. They were filled with well seasoned pork and served with a tangy vinegar soy sauce. I have a hard time with dumplings because most places seem to have a weird taste to the pork. They are not that way here. Very fresh!!! I had the Noodles with minced pork and it was amazing! My husband had the pan fried noodles with beef and XO sauce. Both dishes we rediculous!!! The noodles were just out of this world! And the portions are extremely large!!! No complaints here, since we now had leftovers. And living in Glendale makes it quite the trip but a trip I am happy to make!"}
{"text":"Food was worthy of 5 stars, 4 for the ambiance and service.  Staff was friendly but my order was wrong, but they fixed it, no big deal.  Noodles were AMAZING, as were the potstickers.  Will definitely be back to try some new dishes!  UPDATE 6/4/16 5-star food again.  Got the spicy beef noodles with XO sauce, which was good and spicy!  Also got the noodles with minced pork sauce for the first time, which had an excellent flavor.  I added a bit of the chili oil to heat it up and it was delish!  We also pounded down 8 pan-fried dumplings which are excellent.  So glad I came back for take-out!  Ordering over the phone was easy and there were no mistakes in my order."}
{"text":"One of the few really unique places I've been to in the East Valley. I really like that you can watch them pull the noodles that you're going to eat.  I got the seafood soup one, which was a bit bland without me adding a bunch of sauces and pepper to it, but the beef noodles with oyster sauce that my brother got was quite tasty. I totally stole a few pieces of beef from him. The noodles in both were chewy and fresh. If you don't request a specific type of noodle, I think they default to the ramen ones--a little thicker than \"normal\" ramen but much yummier. We also both got boba milk tea, which was decent (you could tell it was made from real tea) and reasonably priced at $2.50.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome \"Gyoza\"!  Huge portions.  I had the beef, noodles in soup.  That was pretty good.  However, I would have been more satisfied with a good bowl of Pho...  I would like to go back and try some of their other dishes.  I would have gave 3 and half stars if I could...  I was ignorantly expecting a \"David Chang\" style of noodle bowl and it was hardly that."}
{"text":"You get to watch them hand pull your noodles fresh for your order! What else do I need to say? This place is great and not very expensive. A must try for sure!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better then freshly made noodles made right in front of you I had the beef noodle soup and it was so delicious the noodles were great the beef was so tender and the broth tasty I also loved the fresh greens they add to the soup also had the pork dumpling the best I've ever had good place nice friendly service good food at a fair price"}
{"text":"This place has finally done better.  After several pleas from my friends, I gave another try but this time it was good.  The services were much more attentive than it used to be and even the chef behind the glass say hi to me (I do stand out because I am well known in the community now and they need good word of mouth).  I still can't get over the cold egg that they served me a year back so I don't order that anymore.  Everything is now acceptable and the water mellon juice was absolutely outstanding.  I've been back twice already and was pleased with the food now."}
{"text":"One of the places in Phoenix that can get your (okay! my)Chinese food fix. None of the places in Tucson can compare to here, No! Not even come close! Hand pulled noodles is like home made pasta, you can taste the freshness. maybe is not the best I had  but its solid 7.5 out of 10. So you get an idea.  For you people who have big appetite think one bowl is not enough but two is too much, you can add more noodles. What about meat lover? Yes! you are covered as well. Customize the way you wanted it, Go big or go home!  Few side notes: Quality of the meat are good, broth can use a little more flavors. under the cold cut meat (appetizers) they use some daikon radish to \"propped it up\" so don't act like \"OMG! that's so much food for what they charged\" Sorry! they are not giving you one pound of roasted beef for $7.95 (I am not even sure that's how much they charged). Overall its a legit Chinese noodle house."}
{"text":"Okay, I love these noodles. 5 star noodles. 4 star soups. 4 1/2 stars. I'm torn up. I love this place. The dumplings make me so happy. There is so much magic here. So. Much. Magic. Order all the dumplings!"}
{"text":"The noodles are delicious and this is an excellent place for kids. I loved that the kids were able to watch the noodles being made and watched them come right out to the table. It makes their food experience more interesting and made for great table conversation.  The noodles are hand pulled so don't expect what you would get out of a package. There are inconsistencies in the noodles sizes and separation and that's what makes this place so awesome! it's amazing to watch the process and unique in our cookie cutter machine operated day and age. I felt like I was watching, wait for it...MAGIC! If you don't like thick noodles then be sure to order the thinnest option on the menu.   My opinion, yummy and worth taking the family!"}
{"text":"As always, the oxtail soup broth is so good. I just realized it's also very good for hung overs...lol. The broth is made clear & not greasy at all. You don't see any floating oil,fat like some of the other chinese restaurant that serve oxtail soup."}
{"text":"Filling, hearty food for a very low price!  I ordered the seafood soup with soup noodles.  My dining companion ordered the curry shrimp and corn plate (odd... I know).  He seemed to enjoy his dish, but when I tried it, the noodles seemed a bit hard like they were not cooked long enough.  That's why I enjoyed my soup better, because at first the noodles were a bit hard, but as they sat in the broth longer they softened up.  If I come back, I would get another soup.  We also tried the steamed dumplings.  The dumpling skin is VERY thick, not necessarily in a bad way.  Overall, the dumplings are tasty and filling, but not my favorite I've ever had."}
{"text":"China Magic has fresh handmade noodles. The menu is straight forward with lots of pictures. With any dish, you can choose the type of noodles. We opted for two of their noodle soups, oxtail and beef. Our waiter helped us choose regular noodles for the noodle soups. He said it pairs better and he was right. The broth was so smooth and full of deep flavor. It is a comfort food.   We also tried their pan fried noodles with XO sauce and it was really tasty. The noodles had perfect chewiness and the vegetables gave the dish perfect balance. It also had Chinese chili oil which gave it a nice kick.   As appetizer, we ordered the cold spicy beef tendons. Small is plenty to share as an appetizer. This dish was amazing. The pickled vegetables that came with the tendons gave a nice balance for the dish. Fried tofu appetizer was also nice. It came out piping hot almost burned my tongue, but enjoyed this dish and the sauce was perfect with the tofu.   Overall had great meal here. We came around 3 pm on a weekday and they still had lots of people eating here. I can't wait to go back! I probably order exactly same dishes again next time."}
{"text":"The beef stir fry noodle was good. Large portions and good flavor. Also, the boba drinks were interesting. The server seemed like he didn't like his job and came off as rude."}
{"text":"This review comes long overdue but hey, it's better late than never, right?  The entourage and I came in one rainy monsoon night to tuck into some delicious noodles.  I've been hearing about this place for a while --- about how their noodles are all hand-stretched and made with love.  I wanted to experience that for myself!  Walking to the restaurant was like walking into your typical cha chaan teng.  Service is speedy and not very personal and they do seem to treat people who speak Chinese a lot better from what I've observed.  Lucky me for being the table's representative, right?   After ordering an assorted marinated meat combination plate with pig ears and other succulent pieces of cold-served meats, we all got our noodle dishes.  Honestly, I wasn't too wowed by my dish.  I had ordered something that they assured me was similar to dandan noodles, what I was really craving for on this rainy night but it didn't really taste like it.  I think it was more like zha jiang mian.  Don't get me wrong, it was still delicious but it just took me by surprise.   Anyways, this is a pretty solid place and it definitely makes you feel like you're eating in Chinatown, San Francisco or something.  Place gets packed around dinner time so unless you want to rub some elbows with strangers, come for a late lunch or early dinner!"}
{"text":"An old customer lost.  For years I've been coming here every time I come into town.  No more.   We had a table of 9 and the waiter was so rude and condescending when we asked him to repeat our order (he did get one wrong, btw).  When our food came is was ok, not spectacular like before.  The waiter slapping our dishes down where ever he wanted on the table didn't make it any better.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"sure the place is a hole-in-wall, but the food is great! hand pulled noodles are wonderful. my sis always comes here when she visits from SF.  we cannot get enuff of the place! and alot of asian clientel, so if you are not familiar with their style of table manners (ie ... alot of slurping eating noolde soups), be for warned.  that is just how they eat noodles. nothing wrong with that!"}
{"text":"I Have To Try This Again. Loved the Hand Pulled Noodles! Hated the Dumplings.\"  I visited China Magic Noodle House with mixed expectations, but an open mind. The reviews are on the spotty side, but I really wanted to try their hand pulled noodles.   Once I found the restaurant (on the back side of the building) I was immediately pointed to a nice booth by a smiling server and brought water and a menu. I had heard that the lemon tea was good, so I ordered it and settled in to consider the menu.  I had brought a few suggestions from the reviews I had read, and after some consideration, although I knew it was too much food, I decided on the dumplings (pot stickers) and the #34 XO Sauce Beef Noodle Stir Fry so that I could try more than one thing. I only had to wait a couple of minutes for the server to return with my lemon tea (wonderful!), and to take my order. When asked about the heat level of the heat of the XO sauce, the friendly server indicated that it was a little hot for her, but that they can tone it down to be sure it was not to hot for me. I agreed to that.  The dumplings came out first, and fairly quickly, but were a huge disappointment. They didn't look very good and I could tell without touching them that the wrap was dry. The wrap was tough, and where it wasn't tough it was hard. I initially tried to use chop sticks to pick one up, but it was large, heavy and awkwardly shaped. I tried to cut it with a fork I had been brought, but in was too hard to cut. I gave up and picked it up and took a bite. Even that was a bit of a challenge because along with the toughness of the wrap, the meat inside was very densely packed. I tried dipping it in the accompanying sauce, but it wouldn't absorb any of it. Granted, it was a large serving (8 dumplings) but inedible and not very tasty. I didn't even finish the first one. This was starting to look like a bad idea.  As I decided to give up on the first dumpling, my #34 was brought to my table. It smelled great, and was a HUGE portion. As I blended the ingredients together, it felt to me that the dish needed a bit more moisture to keep the ingredients from sticking together. I also realized that the noodles were extremely long and that I had forgotten to order them shaved (easier to eat), but that was my bad.   The dish was, however, delicious. The meat was tender and tasty, I really liked the noodles, and that they still had a slight chewiness. Per my request, the dish was spiced to a perfect heat level for me. The heat was present, but not overwhelming. My HUGE serving had a nice balance of noodles, meat, bean sprouts, carrots, etc. Eating the unshaved noodles was awkward, but I didn't let it slow me down. I only managed to eat about 1/3 of the dish.   I was provided take-out boxes and a plastic bag (helpful), and for what reason I don't know, I took even the awful dumplings with me. I later tossed the dumplings, but found the noodle dish reheated well in the microwave given several minutes at power level 4 in a covered microwave dish.  Overall, I'm glad I came and plan to return again because I loved the hand pulled noodles and lemon tea. I will not be having the dumplings. I still want to try the Ox Tail Soup, and the Noodles with Minced Pork.  I rated this as 4 stars instead of 3 because it is interesting to see the noodles made while you eat, my main dish was REALLY good, and I received prompt friendly service."}
{"text":"Ok, I tried it. Guess I'm not Asian enough to appreciate this place, though I lived all over Asia for a couple of years. My take...sort of a mediocre cafe, nothing fancy. If you like garlic, you will probably like this. Good noodles, but, they are still just noodles. Flavor, garlic, and noodles. Boring. Tried the marinated meat appetizer. Thin slivers of meat, in garlic. I don't like excessive garlic, but that's just me. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Tasty thick noodles. Nice service. Clean. Good selection. Served hot. Beef stew soup and seafood corn and cream sauce noodle dish were superb!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pick up order arrived at time they said it would be done... well I ended up waiting an additional 36 minutes for the food. No apologies from staff for the wait time, unacceptable."}
{"text":"There is nothing overly special here. The noodles are cooked well, but the broth choices are not unique. Our selections were either overly salted or under seasoned. If you have any allergy concerns, be prepared to figure it out yourself. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I really like the food here but as other's have mentioned, this is a pretty low-frills place with a very particular (and unappetizing) smell to it. However, the staff is always friendly, the prices are reasonable and they bring your food out super quick. Your first time here (and if you are not used to authentic Asian noodles) you may feel like the noodles are undercooked and a little chewy but once you get used to it you'll realize they are much better that way! If you order the thinner noodles then it is less noticeable. I can recommend anything off the \"stir-fry\" section of the menu. Even those used to American style PF Chang's will like those options. I love their dumplings as well but as other reviewers have mentioned they are humungous and you get six of them so only order that if you are with a group of hungry people!"}
{"text":"Service is fast and polite depending on who you get.  I've had the soup noodles and creamy noodles previously. It's not over seasoned or salty. Perfect for pairing with their other entrees like the salt and pepper shrimp or fish.  Both I recommend, so crispy! I always go with the shaved noodles. Their regular ones are a bit thick and hard to eat and for a place that serves noodles, no one has scissors for you to use.   The establishment is small, but you can definitely fit a big party there and if you have kids, they can entertain themselves by watching the noodles being made!"}
{"text":"I've always thought this place was extremely mediocre. The people that rave about this place.. I seriously wonder what they've eaten in their lives that they can talk like this is the best place on earth. They told my girlfriend and I today that they don't have #17 any more because nobody ever ordered it and it was gross. Luckily, that was her favorite dish, so I no longer have to go there anymore.   If you still consider going here, know that the noodles are good but the flavors are bland as hell."}
{"text":"Noodles! It's all about the noodles as it appears in the name! The superstar ingredient!  Your taste bud will be blown away by the authenticity and freshness of the noodles!  Whichever dish you order you will taste the same consistency in the noodles!  Comes in various shape, style and sizes! You can order it soupy, brothy or stir-fry!  I had the minced pork dish and a taste of a seafood and beef stir-fry.  Overall great tasting flavors! Most Chinese joints is about the sauce, here it's the opposite, it's the noodles! When you take your first five bites, you almost forget about the other ingredients! It's that yummy!  I also ordered the pan-fried, dumplings! Delicious! I assume they used the same dough to make them!  It's situated in an Asian mecca of Chandler, so do not be surprised if you see many Asians around.  Its true per other reviews and pics, you get to witness one of the cooks twirl and toss around the fresh dough behind a glass window!  I plan to return for more magical goodness, next time, I will try  the broth/soup style!"}
{"text":"Two separate visits, outrageously good fresh hand-pulled noodles and amazingly low prices.    Aileen (from review dated 11/14/2010) these aren't gyoza.  Gyoza are Japanese.  These are Chinese 'pot-stickers'.  These are the remotely the same dough or preparation.    These pot-stickers are very, very good.  Pan fried - for once they are not too crispy or dried out, like most valley restaurant prepare them.  The dipping sauce that accompanies them is good, but add a bit of red chile oil to your plate, a splash of black vinegar.  Now you've got the real Chinatown pot sticker good stuff.    5 different kinds of noodles -ask the waiter which one goes best with your choices.  The beef with shaved noodles was terrific - beef just melted in your mouth.  How do they do that with beef?  We also ordered the curry with thin pulled noodles.  The shrimp were large, sweet and perfectly cooked.  The curry sauce was not all that great, and I wouldn't order it again - but I'd order another dish with those shrimp without hesitation.  Chicken fried rice, no usually one of my favorites, was a shining star in this place.  Again, the meat was tender, moist - and all white meat chicken.    Beef soup with noodles.  Again, that superb tender beef.  Broth was deep flavored, with a distinct tinge of anise.  Just wonderful.    Service is friendly, helpful and anxious to please.  Excellent service from Charles, and nice guy to chat with.  If you like authentic Chinese noodles, don't miss out on this place"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome.  You can watch through the window when they make your homemade noodles. It's pretty impressive and the kids love it.  Service is quick, but the service itself is almost nonexistent but the most Asian restaurants are like that so I don't expect anything more or less.  I ordered the seafood noodle dish. The broth was tasty and the noodles had a great texture with chewy perfection.  The hubs had the lamb with noodles which he enjoyed and the toddler had the beef noodle soup.  All were pretty good.  We also ordered the pan fried dumplings and holy cow they were huge.  It was also very good and juicy.  Wish this place wasn't so far from our house because we'd frequent it very often."}
{"text":"Not only are  their noodles delicious, but my most favorite item are their fried Spring Rolls.  I  typically make it a two order of these delightful crispy  goodies because they come two per order. ..just heavenly"}
{"text":"Ate here a few years ago and was not really impressed and with all the Chinese Restaurants in the Tempe, Mesa and Chandler area I would rather go to a sure thing.  Decided to give it another chance and glad we did. Maybe the first time we did not order the right items.   A must item are the pot stickers, you get 8 to an order and they are huge monster size and could easily be a meal by itself.  Must item 1A - The fried fish fillet is also very good and has a nice minor kick to it but is not spicy but good and flavorful.  There are quite a bit of choices for noodles which are freshly made on the spot and good entertainment. You can get thin, thick, regular, flat thin, flat thick. I like the normal or thin, the thick is too much for me.  We had the #22 and the #19 Noodle dishes, the #19 was the Seafood with an Alfredo style sauce which was a bit thick and just okay sauce.   Would recommend the #22 Noodles with Minched Pork which has good Sauce.  We also ordered the green beans which came out as a huge serving and were pretty good.   Keep in mind this is a no frills place so come for the food not the decor and the service is pretty good.   Glad we gave it a 2nd try and will be back again"}
{"text":"Really great place, with awesome food. Yes, watch them make the noodles fresh. The entrees are perfect. The pan-fried dumplings are killer. Staff is great.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Noodles are all handmade. If you've never tried a authentic noodles from China, this is the place that you must go."}
{"text":"I'm currently a few beers in and just polished off the leftovers from my earlier trip here, so take this with a grain of salt... but this was amazing. I'm not really a noodle or soup person and would typically order fried rice over anything, but the #34 really hit the spot. Earlier today when I was sober, from bite 1, I was sold on the dish. The only criticism is it can be a tad spicier and next time I visit I'll ask them to kick it up a notch. My sister's soup was also great (she had the beef and noodle soup), I kept begging for sips of the broth alone. The pan fried dumplings were nice crispy and big. The dough of the dumpling was the thickest I've ever had but you won't hear complaints from me. I'll be back for sure, might be a new fave until I eat it so much I'm sick of it."}
{"text":"Delicious. Cheap. and FUN!  This place is AMAZING....fresh, hand-made noodles (or pulled, I should say) taste as good as they sound! They give you a TON of food, and most dishes are under 7 bucks! You just can't go wrong! The beef with oyster sauce I think was my favorite thing at our table. I had ordered the noodles with minced pork, which was also really good. I heard high reviews at our table for the soup in beef broth and my husband was in heaven with his ox-tail stew. Everything was so fresh and awesome, and the service was so friendly!!! They have really nice people working here and helpful in suggesting what to eat.   Now, the fried rice did come out a bit bland....but, just add a little soy sauce and it's *perfect*. I actually prefer it when restaurants let you control the saltiness of your food, so that wasn't a big deal to me.   I'm so excited about this place! Can't wait to introduce it to my friends :)  (the boba is really good too!)"}
{"text":"Very delicious and fresh! The noodles are hand made (obviously), they have a nice texture and bite to them. We had the salt and pepper fish appetizer and that was extremely good as well. We tried the steamed dumplings and they were just ok... Too much dough and the beef inside was a bit tough. We really enjoyed the noodle dishes, though. The pan fried noodles with veggies are the best!"}
