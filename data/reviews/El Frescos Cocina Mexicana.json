{"text":"Hard to find in an area of 2-story office type buildings near the airport but don't miss it! Very fresh, perfect seasonings, and their chipotle mayo is the bomb. The thick triangular chips and homemade green tomatillo salsa while we waited were terrific also. We were the only ones there when we walked in late afternoon on a Saturday which surprised me, but every table was full when we left."}
{"text":"Not Tex Mex. Short menu but it covers most tastes. The part of town is not really sketchy, as another put it. That is if sketchy means dangerous. It is a strange location near the airport and the rental car places. But we were staying at the Best Western and the 5 of us walked there. We had very attentive service and the food was really good.  The burrito was huge, as was the quesadilla. Mahi tacos were awesome. Great experience - exactly what we were hoping for"}
{"text":"Discovered this little gem from yelp and was not disappointed. The service was great and quick. The food was wonderful. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Coming from San Diego, I'm used to good Mexican food. By FAR some of the BEST Mexican food I've ever heard including traveling through Mexico. Mahi mahi and shrimp tacos are to die for. The carne asada quesadilla bar none amazing!   I never write Yelp reviews but I felt this meal was worth it. Little hole in the wall feel but OMG soooo good"}
{"text":"Just had some amazing fish tacos.  The ingredients all are very fresh.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food conveniently close to our hotel. Tacos were authentic and fresh while quesadilla was generously filled with fresh chicken and cheesy enough to satisfy an 8 year old."}
{"text":"Food was bomb ,  1st time trying shrimp  tacos  and they we're amazing,  customer service was also great good I found u guys will definitely be back"}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I weren't on our side of town and we were craving some good mexican food. Did a search and found El Frescos Cocina. A bit hard to find, but something good doesn't always come easy right!? Is what we were thinking. From entering we noticed a lot of sugar skulls and day of the dead art and figures in the restaurant which I thought was pretty neat, and different. After looking over the menu, my boyfriend and I decided to just get  chicken, and carne asada tortas. By our surprise, each one was deliciously seasoned/marinated and full of flavor. My boyfriend said, that had to have been the best carne asada he's ever had. After finishing our plates, we thought, if the chicken and asada tortas were delicious, we could only imagine the rest of their dishes. After speaking with the owner and the chef... They have so much passion for what they have created and that is why it shows through their dishes. Will definitely be back, with friends!!"}
{"text":"??????????????? ???/????????????????????? ????????????????????"}
{"text":"I found the restaurant on Yelp and figured I'd give it a shot. Boy am I glad I did. The location is a little hard to find but well worth it.   My wife who is very decerning loved The Chilaqueles. The salsas they serve were also very good. I had a burrito and it huge and very flavorful.  I'll make this a regular stop when I come into town."}
{"text":"Don't mind the location, tacos are legit.  Very filling and delicious. Had the max taco and have no regrets. Go here."}
{"text":"Wow..tried this place on the advice from my brother. I have never had better fish tacos! My wife and son enjoyed their meals as well. Staff is friendly. Portions are very generous. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food, great prices, small little hole-in-the-wall. Everything I love! We tried the specials for the day, mahi fish tacos and enchiladas. Also tried the fresco fries, wasn't see war to expect-very fresh, hot potato wedges. Yummy but simply that.   Will definitely go back and try again on the way to the airport!"}
{"text":"This place is so dope. I honestly don't know what else to say outside of that. I got the max burrito al pastor and the tacos al pastor and they were epic. I was surprised by how few reviews this place has because it is awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent food - green salsa on fresh chips is killer - the carne asada is to die for and the chicken taco was also delish - the shrimp tacos were huge and excellent!  Great friendly service...what a gem in an unlikely location.  No issues finding it with our GPS."}
{"text":"We are just passing through from the East Coast. Charleston, Sc to be exact.   We have some of the best chefs and dining in the country. Looking up something close on Yelp i found this gem. The reviews were excellent. We decided to try it and all i can say is wow.   I had the carne asada plate and  it was outstanding.  The wife had fresco max  taco, a big slice of avocado on it. The chips and salsa were a welcome treat as well.   The owner takes pride in his place and the food he serves. Don't pass this place by."}
{"text":"It was a little hard to find the place, but I'm glad we found it! We got free chips and salsa and it was delicious and fresh!  My boyfriend and got the platter with 3 tacos and rice and beans. The tacos were a little small than I'm used to but words cannot described how well cooked and well seasoned they were! The beans and rice were ok! I highly recommend them! The server (which I think is one of the owners) was a very nice gentlemen! Overall excellent food and service! Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Came here to try some shrimp tacos and it was delicious. The service was also great. The person who served us went out of his way and told us about must see places around the city.   I would definetly come back again and recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"three words....  oohhh myyyy goooooood!!!!!!!!  so amazing! i'm so happy i found this!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here every week!  The food is delicious the owner and chef friendly and fun.  We have tried several items my husband loves the shrimp tacos and the conchita? Pork.  I'm vegetarian and they will always make me something delicious!  The beans are creamy and are not made with lard!  My husband and I are typically not rice eaters however we both like their rice.  (We both usually order all beans no rice but here we get the rice).    Not a fancy place but definitely a must try!!!! The food stands up as better than any Mexican we have had in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"WOW!... This place is amazing... Fish tacos and Shrimp tacos were the best I have ever had (and I'm from southern California). The Kids had burritos and chicken quesadillas and of course I (dad)  had to taste it and agreed with them they were delicious.  Please come try this place it's really one of the best places I have eaten in Las Vegas. It's a bit hard to find and please don't judge the place by its location. It's very clean. A rating."}
{"text":"Staff and ownership very friendly, salsa and guac are really good, good prices, and perfect stop on the way to the airport. The restaurant is pretty new and I'd bet they will be expanding soon because the food is sooo good. Even though LA has great Mexican food, this place is one of the better spots I've been to."}
{"text":"This little spot just opened up and already  is a new vegas gem it's a bit hidden but definitely worth the find, Their cochinita pibil is excellent slow cooked very Tender braised pork ,  they top it off with some really tasty red pickled onions, There deep fried ice cream is a must have, good, excellent, friendly service and for the food/quality very inexpensive. One of the best options in vegas"}
{"text":"Super Fire Mexican food. So glad I stumbled on this gem. I come atleast once a week. You should too..."}
{"text":"In town visiting a friend and had been craving Mexican food all day. Saw this place on Yelp and decided to try it and was beyond happy with my decision! The customer service was excellent! The gentleman working told me about their shrimp tacos that weren't on the menu and I went with that! They were amazing!! I don't normally like spicy things, but for this I dealt with the burn and it was well worth it! I also got a to-go order of chicken nachos for my friend. She didn't want onions and they were even attentive enough to put the guacamole on the side for her because it contained onions. The nachos were also amazing! Overall, great little hole in the wall place and I definitely recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"Most amazing shrimp tacos ever. Off the beaten path but worth the trip. Carne Asada was also yummy. Mahi tacos come highly recommended as well. Fresh tortillas and tortilla chips. Absolutely amazing all around."}
{"text":"Chips were very good. The pastor was amazing (our favorite)!  Definitely a hole in the wall, but the service was very kind and solicitous."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food.  Off the beaten path.  The menu is limited but the food is terrific. Super friendly and worth a little extra effort to find them.   Great authentic tacos with fish tacos off the menu.  Chips and salsa great so was the fried ice cream.."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try it today.  Bomb ass food, can't go wrong with shrimp anything."}
{"text":"This place is one of the newest secrets in Las Vegas and a true hidden gem.  Do not be fooled by its hole-in-the-wall location in an aging business complex near the airport, the small size of the restaurant, or the simple appearance of the interior;  In a city with an abundance of Mexican food, this place truly stands out when it comes to a quality meal at an affordable price.  The service is great.  I work at the ticket office on the other side of the building so my coworkers and I are regular customers.  They even deliver our orders to our office.    The food will definitely fill you up!  I usually get the Super Fresco Max pastor burrito.  It is more than a full meal, as it is loaded with meat, beans, rice, and other goodness.  The torta is very satisfying as well.  All of their meat is high quality and GMO-free.    If you're looking for great fast casual Mexican food, skip the chains and make the trip to El Fresco!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night! The food was good and super fresh!  My husband ordered their burrito and my kids had their cheese quesadilla's.  The loved them and ate off them for two days!! I had the chicken taco's and they did not make them past that night! :). Only thing is the establishment is hard to find and a little risky but definitely good food! I would eat again for sure....."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD AND FRIENDLY SERVICE!!! Love this little shop that is SO close to the airport.   I plan to go there after every airport stop.   Better then tacos el gordo!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best Mexican Food in Las Vegas then you must stop here for lunch or dinner.  Fresh ingredients make their tacos the bomb.  Gotta go with the shrimp or fish taco.  Large pieces of shrimp and mahi-mahi fish.  WOW, will knock your socks off.  Chips and two kinds of salsa are killer.  Served with rice and refried beans with melted mozzarella cheese.  Top it off with a Mexi-Coke and deep fried ice cream and you won't leave hungry.  The two owners are friendly and unassuming but kill it with their taco's and other menu items."}
{"text":"Great local place with fresh shrimp tacos and flavor-packed tacos al pastor (among other things like burritos, fajitas, enchiladas, etc. but I didn't try those). Don't let the exterior fool you; this place is great. Nice people working and it's quick. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Let start off by saying this place is small and location wise is a bit werid place. The food however is off the chain. I don't eat beans but I must say I would eat theirs everyday. Shrimp, chicken and beef fajitas are made to perfection. If you like spicy/ hot salad ask them for the Salsa in the small portion cup. I'll be eating here every trip to Vegas. It's a must."}
{"text":"The food was amazing we pulled up and were a little leary by the location but don't be discouraged go in the food is so worth it. I had the cochinita tacos which had amazing flavors."}
{"text":"Dive location, however the food is awesome. Fish and shrimp tacos too die for!  Great place to grab a meal one way fro airport."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of the restaurant deter you, they have great food in very large portions. Bring friends and share food!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall . I had the shrimp taco. Very fresh and loaded with chopped shrimp. The beans and rice were both marginal.. lacking much flavor or spice. Chips were hot and fresh. The inside of the restaurant is shabby and uninspiring. The area is very close to the airport .. neighborhood is sketchy best not to go alone.  GPS take you to the wrong building.. go one more building over towards the airport.. most likely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We decided to try this Local spot since they received pretty good reviews. My husband and I were on our honeymoon in las Vegas ( we're from Fresno) and we wanted some good Mexican food. Well let me tell.you this place DID NOT disappoint! Its a little hole in the wall restaurant owned by 2 young men. They can Cook! I ordered a gigantic al pastor burrito smothered in cheese. It was huge! It had beans and rice on the inside. My husband had a carne asada torta. Its a little pricier because they use Non GMO meat and believe me you can taste the difference. Everything is made to order even the complimentary tortilla chips which were the perfect amount of crunch. We were very happy with our food. We appreciated the nice conversation we had  with one of the owners. He's a nice man. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is truly a local dive that upon first glance looks like it is converted motel rooms. The shrimp and fish tacos are amazing especially when they are hot off the grill. I'm not a beans person but even enjoyed those as well. Staff was also very hospitable and nice. Plus, they have Mexican Coca-Cola. You can't get any more authentic than that."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the 'hunt' to find location. All of our dishes ordered were great!! Good service, fast, hot and great tasting food!!  It is authentic Mexican Food and a must stop or return visit!"}
{"text":"Simply terrific!  The tacos al pastor and the fried ice cream are beyond delicious!  The cook and the server were delightful.  I was really happy and comfortable eating here.  Yes, it's a dive in a sketchy neighborhood.  Do not let that stop you.  The chips are fried flour tortillas.  They are fresh and delicious, but don't fill up on chips when the food is this good.  I seriously think that the fried ice cream is the best dessert that I have ever had, and I am not really a dessert person.  I also had a carne asada taco which was good, but nowhere near the perfection of the pastor.  I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are from Southern California so we have really high expectations when it comes to Authentic Mexican food. El Frescos meets and exceeds that expectaion! We come to Las Vegas a few times a year on vacation and wanted to try something new. We ordered by phone but when I walked in they were cutting tortillas to fry for fresh chips so I had to get a side of those too! The guacamole is SO fresh and has a good kick at the end of it. We also split a super fresco max burrito and I had a pastor taco. Everything was fresh and great. They also put the enchilada sauce on the side so our burrito would not get soggy by the time I go back to our room!  Very nice people and GREAT food! We will be coming back everytime we are in the city!"}
{"text":"If you are on paradise heading towards the airport cross over Tropicana. There's a Best Western on the left and the turn in for this place is just past that. There's a sign but you really gotta look for it. It looks like a dumpy hole in the wall but the food is really good & very reasonably priced.   We ordered carry out:  Chicken taco: chopped chicken breast & a little onion. It was a little dry but still tasty.   Shrimp taco: sautéed shrimp with avocado, cabbage, cilantro, & chipotle cream. Delicious!!  Chicken burrito max: chopped chicken breast, beans, rice, onion, cheese, topped with red sauce, guacamole & sour cream. Huge & delicious! Could easily be split between 2 people.   Guacamole & chips, hot & mild salsas: fresh, basic guacamole & portion was pretty big. The mild salsa wasn't my favorite...too salty. The hot salsa was good, not too hot. Liked it much better than the mild.   Defiantly will go back."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! My family and I came in after leaving the airport, and I got the three tacos pastor, and they are the BEST pastor tacos I've ever had! And I must say, I'm a little spoiled when it comes to Mexican food after having lived in San Diego for the last 3 years.  This place was a pleasant surprise, and I will definitely be returning and telling my friends about it."}
{"text":"Needed a quick place to stop and have breakfast before flying out. Found this this little gem on Yelp and I understand why all the reviews are so good!  This place is wonderful, with great service!! Perfect place to stop and grab a bite to eat when heading out of Vegas!"}
{"text":"Saw that the place had 5 star so I knew I had to try. I now know why they have 5 stars. Took the wife and kids and my son is disappointed that we only visit Vegas and can't get back often enough. Great tacos including grilled fish.   I only had to go around the block once to find the place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited the other day because of the great reviews.. And they lived up to the hype! I got the shrimp tacos and he got the carne asada burrito which was HUGE. Chips and salsa were great, fresh, and the shrimp tacos were giant. Chipotle mayo was awesome, and we had to get a Mexican coke too. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Excelente Food, valué and Service. We came here for the five star rating in Yelp and it sure did not disappoint us. So delicious and very friendly service. It all came out very fast too. Thank you."}
{"text":"I wish I can give them more stars.  This place is an amazing hidden gem. The guys the work here really go above and beyond customer service. The best Mexican food in town. I could probably eat here everyday. I wish they can get their liquor license soon. Wish you guys the best and thank you again."}
{"text":"The place is a bit away from the strip, but not far. A quick 15min walk will take you to a very cutty spot. Is not big, about 7-8 tables inside but man!! The food was bomb!! I would of posted a pick but we loved it that we left nothing on the plates. The presentation of each plate was very neat and like my mom always says, \"presentation always counts.\"  we had tostadas de pollo, steak fajitas and the shrimp tacos.. We all let eachother try our foods and was great..!"}
{"text":"Omg super delicious Mexican food. Had a bit of a hard time to find this precious little spot but it's definitely worth it. You really need to try their tasty food. I love it!"}
{"text":"If you blink you'll miss this place so Don't blink!! Little hole in the wall with amazing food some of the best I've had and Ive had a lot. Friendly staff good prices right near to the airport really enjoyed this place!!  Had tacos pastor and chicken enchilada everything fresh and hot.. So good coming back for dinner!!"}
{"text":"Yes, the hype on the shrimp tacos is legit. Other tacos not so much. $7 for one shrimp taco or 14 for two, but totally worth it. Loaded with shrimp, perfect sauce-- just amazing!! Chicken, carne asada, and adobada tacos were pretty disappointing, but they are cheap. Would be 5 stars if the tacos were better than Tacos el gordo, but they arent. Wish I tried a burrito instead. Owner is very nice.  This location is horrible in terms of getting to. I'm glad they're moving nearby me on 215 & Rainbow. They should really update their hours and news like people said. Recently drove all they way during lunch at work after looking at their website, got there and said they were closed and moving and this location is being replaced with a different mexican restaurant. Anyways, go here just for the shrimp tacos and you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to this place over a dozen times. This review is long over due. First thing to address is the location. It is on Paradise leading into the airport in a business plaza that looks like homeless people live there. Don't let the exterior fool you.  The inside is clean and nice.    Now on to the food. I agree with many of the other 5 star reviews.  I lived in San Diego for 18 years and in Las Vegas now for 14 years.  It took a long time for me to find Mexican food that tasted as good as what I used to get in San Diego.  I am working my way the menu. So far everything is great, tacos, burritos, tortas, and chilaquiles.  I also like that they care enough to use non-GMO meats.    I also feel the need to give a shout out to the guys working there.  They are very friendly and attentive.   Give this place a try, your stomach will be very happy that you did."}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find but well worth the hunt. They make their corn tortillas in house and they are excellent. Be warned their burritos are large! My husband and I could have split one. They garnish with pickled onions which are tasty if you like onions. The service was super friendly and fast. It is quite small inside only 6 or 7 tables and 2 outside with an eclectic decor. All in all this place was awesome and a welcomed change from the high prices and food quality on the strip."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! Extraordinary flavor, service, and value especially for the price! We had cochinita (pork) and asada (beef) plates, the flavors were yummy and different. Soft flavorful meats. They make their own unique salsas too, a mild green salsa and a super spicy yummy red salsa.   Otherwise it's a cute little hole in the wall place thats clean and run by a really nice couple. About 1 mile from the strip near the airport. In a weird business plaza - building B. Feels sketchy at first but it's clean and well-run.  I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Everything you read about El Fresco's is true plus 5!  If we could give it 10 stars we would. Very reasonable, really friendly staff and CLEAN. Best Mexican food in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Missed it on the first go around as it is hard to find, but well worth the second loop around the airport to find! The shrimp tacos were amazing! The carne asada melted in your mouth. My only regret is that I live 4 hours away! Forget the strip for eating come here."}
{"text":"This place is pricey. Why it only has one $ sign is beyond me. Each platter was about $9.99 so I ended up spending $38 dollars at this place for only 3 people and that didn't include tip. It's $3 a bottle of water or bottle of soda, they have no tap water. Really? I find that hard to believe. The food itself was good. The carne asada was tender and they were generous with their portion sizes, it's just the prices that upset me and the fact that they have a waiter. Why? He was nice and very attentive it just doesn't fit the location at all. Overall a nice place just wasn't expecting to pay that much somewhere off the strip and not even a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"If I'm shelling out $6 for a taco, it better blow my mind. The shrimp tacos here? Yup. Six bucks for a taco with enough shrimp to rival what's usually in a shrimp burrito elsewhere, plus fresh avocado slices and chipotle mayo. Get a couple of tacos and a side of guac, and go to town with their fresh chips- they provide red (hella spicy) and green (mild enough to drink) salsas, too, made fresh in house.  Your GPS may have a hard time finding this place, so perhaps go on a weekend when they're open later. Staff is friendly, checking in with you frequently and making conversation. Please move to the west side!!"}
{"text":"After seeing this place on Yelp with its impressive 5 full stars and seeing it mentioned in a couple articles about must try restaurants, we had to check it out. My husband and I are always in search of great Mexican food. We haven't found anything even close to the  places we frequented in our hometown of San Diego. And we've been here for 15 years! We've found Mexican food here that's good but nothing that screams authenticity. El Fresco's is drowning in authenticity.  Let's start with the fresh made chips & incredible salsa verde that is brought to your table. We've noticed, recently, that free chips & salsa has disappeared at newer Mexican restaurants. Which breaks our hearts. Chips & salsa is like the ultimate precursor to a great Mexican meal. It's like telling your mouth & tastebuds, get ready! We're having a fiesta!  I opted for an al pastor taco & the much written  about shrimp taco. There aren't enough words in all the languages in the entire world that can describe how fresh, flavorful and delicious that shrimp taco is. Literally bursting with juicy, delectable shrimp. Drizzled with a chipotle mayonnaise that packs a punch. The shrimp & the mayo were made for each other.  And the al pastor? I could have eaten those all night long. Cooked to perfection, the flavor was out of this world!  My husband went for the super max burrito with asada. This isn't just a burrito, it's an experience. It's huge. Rice, beans, cheese, pico, asada, guacamole & sour cream served on the side and covered in an enchilada sauce that brings it all together. First of all you would never find this burrito at any Las Vegas Mexican eatery. And if you did, it'd be at least $15-$19. My husband let me try a generous portion of his burrito and I immediately starting hoping he'd be too full to finish it. The asada was mouth watering tender and everything inside complimented each other perfectly. It was easily the best burrito. Ever. Epic.  Service was excellent. The chef who is also the owner was super nice, gracious and modest. Our waitress recommended the perfect items and was very attentive.  We can't wait to go back. We will have to wait as we only have Sunday's off together and El Fesco's is closed on Sunday's. But the first chance we get, we will be there!"}
{"text":"We wanted to eat someplace before heading to the airport, and this place had a solid five stars, so thought it was worth checking out. A bit hard to find, but once you find it, totally worth it. Small, a bit funky, but, as others have said, solid food, and really welcome in a place like Las Vegas, so near the strip."}
{"text":"The shrimp tacos are the best I've had! The food the service and the vibe are perfect HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"You would never find this place by just driving by. In fact you will probably have a hard time finding it if you are trying to go there. It is in what looks like an old abandoned motel or strip mall. The food lives up to the hype though. I tried all the different tacos and they were great. My wife had the shrimp tacos and she can't stop raving about them. She is already planning on eating there on the next trip to Vegas. That is saying a lot given the number of places you can eat in Vegas with more attractive ambiance. The service was great too."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said. Amazing salsa. Homemade chips. Decent but not overwhelming portions. Ordered a quesadilla, taco salad, and fish tacos plate.  In the words of my 4-year old \"This is the best quesadilla I've had in my entire life.\" Same goes for the pastor taco salad. Fish tacos were good, but not as outstanding as everything else. And the service was attentive without being annoying.  One thing to note before you go, they don't serve free water. So be prepared to pay a couple dollars for a Smart Water, buy a coke instead, or just go without. But it was a minor inconvenience I'm certainly willing to overlook.   Lastly, I wish I had eaten a smaller breakfast so that I could have had room for the fried ice cream. Definitely going back again soon."}
{"text":"OMG!!  I discovered this place on Yelp and the five-star reviews have been confirmed.  Forget what you heard about other Mexican restaurants, this establishment is what's hot in the streets!!  Get yourself over there because the food is outstanding.    I had the Carne Asada Plate - fannntastic - the beef was well seasoned and tender, the refried beans were flavorful, the tortilla chips had the perfect amount of salt, and the guacamole was freshly made. The Super Fresco Chicken Burrito was massive, with enough left over for dinner.  I LOVE that they use Non-GMO fed beef and chicken and one of the owners, John, is very passionate about keeping it that way!  Don't sleep on this restaurant, consuming this food will cause joy.  (Make a left at the fire hydrant and the restaurant is ground-level on the left-hand side.)"}
{"text":"Um es kurz zu machen  Essen war fabelhaft. Wir hatten zuerst sorge das es nicht so lecker ist weil Andere Gäste die fertig waren nach volle Teller hatten. Das lag aber nur daran das die Portionen riesig sind sehr guter TexMex laden."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Mexican as you may be able to see with my reviews. I went with the street tacos and they were the best I've ever had, anywhere, period. I got 4 total- chicken, chocita, pastor, and asada. The chicken tasted like really good chicken. The other 3 were heavenly versions of themselves.   The place is located in the most unassuming of locations. I pulled up and really didn't think I was at the right place. It's nothing fancy on the outside. Went in and was greeted by who I think was the owner. I believe he goes by Sosa. The customer service was a 10/10- he was super friendly and super personable. He asked me how I found the restaurant and i told him I saw them on Yelp. He joked 'you can't believe everything you read, my friends wrote all of those reviews.' Haha.   The food was a good as it gets, the prices were very reasonable.   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome service! The food is so amazing and definitely worth the price. My daughters love coming here. Everything on the menu is delicious! One of my favorite spots in town. And Non-GMO!!"}
{"text":"Perfect little spot for a bite to eat!!! Food was amazing I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was fantastic!!!!! Service was awesome!!! The shrimp fajitas cooked to perfection!!"}
{"text":"You will get nothing in the way of glitz and glamour here. It feels like it's a used car lot and you might doubt your decision to eat here. Don't doubt. Just do it.   I've had a lot of chips in my day and these are the BEST chips I've ever had. If the chips were this good, it's safe to assume I was excited for the main attraction! The owner recommended the shrimp tacos and he did not steer us wrong! They were \"Stuff Your Face\" Delicious! I washed it all down with a pineapple soda and my husband rolled me out to the car.    It's a little joint. Only a few tables and there's seriously nothing in the way of ambiance, but it's some of the best Mexican I've had and the owner could not have been nicer. Get off the strip, people!"}
{"text":"It was kismet.  A few weeks before heading out to Vegas for a conference, BuzzFeed ran a piece on best or most visited taco joints in each state.  El Frescos was listed for Nevada so I book marked it in Yelp for my upcoming trip.    After tiring of the strip I hailed an Uber with my sights set on El Frescos.  Like all the other reviews state, it's not easy to find but well worth the search.  It's located in what appears to be a car processing center for the airport rental services.  There are 3 parallel, nondescript, two story strip buildings perpendicular to Paradise Rd.  El Frescos is on the first floor of the second building. You could easily drive in and out and miss it.  Someone wrote that it has a \"hole-in-the-wall\" feel.  It is though, truly, a hole in the wall.  Seating consists of perhaps 6 tables and a couple of hi-tops on the sidewalk outside.  The kitchen is easily visible and appears immaculate.  It is family-run, giving it a completely relaxed, homey feel.  It's table service so I picked a seat and was quickly provided a basket of chips and salsa verde.  Both good but nothing to write home about.    I had read about the shrimp tacos so I was bummed to not see it on their menu.  Fortunately, it, along with fish, seem to be regular specials of the day.  I opted for the fish tacos on the recommendation on the hostess and the fact that they use Mahi for the fish.  Amazing.  Absolutely top notch.  I saw the fish being prepared and was blown away by the portion.  What arrived were two stuffed fish tacos.  On a base of cheesy corn tortillas, they piled the most tender and richly flavorful nuggets of heaven I've had.  You would think they were poached in butter.  They were topped with a slaw and creamy sauce as well as a slice of avocado.  The plate was complimented by equally tasty rice and refried beans.  I couldn't finish the entire thing and took home a taco and some beans and rice for another meal.  I also opted for a side of guacamole for my chips.  This was solid.  I was a little surprised when they mentioned that they didn't have much guac left for the day considering I went at about 4pm and I believe they were open until 9.  I would worry about them killing a good thing if they start running out of basic food-stuffs before dinner.  That's the quickest way to lose customer loyalty.     My entire meal, with a bottle of water came to ~$19, so this isn't cheap street fare.  But I would have no problem spending that again for the same meal and hospitality.  Highly recommend this place and plan on letting anyone I know visiting Vegas to make the trek."}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall place serving authentic Mexican food with a smile.  You can watch your food being prepared with care!  He makes the taco salad shell fresh, and the chips are also made on premises - the best I've had.  Not many choices on salsa, that's the only complaint I would have.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Idk if i was really hungry or what but that first Asada taco melted in my mouth. quality meat and good preparation. Super small place and I drove past it last time I saw it so I'm glad I made the trip to come. The light green sauce is damn good too. Chicken tacos are cut up into chunks and not shredded.  Will absolutely be back"}
{"text":"Amazing delicious food for a low price !!! Carne asada tortas are so good ! Everything here is very good tasting"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, don't be surprised by hole in the wall feel. Food was amazing, had the beef quesadilla, mahi and shrimp tacos. Best I've had in a really long time."}
{"text":"Food was great! The service was great. Had the shrimp tacos and shrimp burrito, neither were on the menu but we asked if they had them (seen them on previous Yelp review) the food was fresh and loaded with shrimp. Great spot to grab some Mexican food."}
{"text":"Yep not only good but authentic. The shrimp tacos are as stated in previous reviews- just delicious. Good sized shrimp and they don't skimp with the Number of them  either.  The chips and salsa come with meals and are wonderful. Not too spicy but with some good flavor. The mega burrito is more than that-- it is truly the biggest burrito I have seen. Loaded with cochinita which I have never tasted before. Slow roasted pork-  Friendly, warm server.  They don't serve alcohol but apparently you can bring your own-  Make the stop- worth it"}
{"text":"Some of the best places ive ever eaten at have been \"hole in the wall\" style places, this one is one of those places. The gentleman in the front was very helpful in taking our order and even brought extra plates for my kids without us asking for them. The food was amazing. I ordered the torta pastor and modified it to my liking (grilled onions and melted cheese) and they made it perfect. Came from out of town and found this place becausw of yelp, the 5 star reviews never lie. Will definetly be back"}
{"text":"Found this place by reading Yelp reviews. Saw all 5 stars, so had to try it!  The location is less than desirable, but the food and service... 5 Stars!! I ordered 1 Shrimp taco and a Pastor Torta to share w/my husband. We had to take the Torta to go, as we were too full to eat it.  Granted I ate chips and Guacamole before my food came, but I can usually manage a taco and 1/2 a Torta!  Taco was so full of shrimp!  Delicious! We will be back next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The best chilaquiles I have ever tasted, i requested to have carne asada added and omg it was bomb totally recommend this place if you are in town and a plus is that is totally afforadable not like the restaurants on the strip such a rip off so expensive and nasty"}
{"text":"If you like good authentic Mexican food, look no further.  I happened to see this place driving by, stopped in.  and hmmmm hmmm was it good.  I will repeat"}
{"text":"I was impressed to see 120 solid 5-star reviews for this tiny tiny Mexican restaurant. We sampled few different tacos and they were all AMAZING!   Xiomare is the sweetest and cooler server I ever met!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's hard to find but it's 100% worth the visit. I've been continually disappointed with Mexican restaurants that have good ratings on yelp in Vegas, it's like no one here actually knows good food?? This is the one place that doesn't disappoint. So good, so fresh. While I am not latina, my girlfriend is Mexican and swears by their food, which says a lot."}
{"text":"Tried this out because of everyone's reviews. Great service. Simple restaurant. Delicious food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazing food at this little hole in the wall!  We ordered a taco combo plate, shrimp quesadilla and shrimp taco.  Oh my god.  So delish!  The prices can seem a little expensive a first but the portions are huge.  My shrimp quesadilla was massive.  Had to weigh at least a couple pounds.  Service was great.  It's a two man show and they made sure we were taken care of.  I'm dying to try their breakfast burritos but they open a little late to have breakfast for me."}
{"text":"awesome shrimp burritos, made by guys that really care about quality and flavor"}
{"text":"On a scale of 1 to 10, how would I rate El Frescos' Shrimp Tacos?   20.  My first bite into one of these had me thinking out loud, \"Holy sh*t, that's good!\"  Without a doubt, the best shrimp taco I've ever had.   The shrimp seasoned and cooked to perfection, the avocado and chipotle mayo on top, all of these contents lay atop  a flour tortilla with a side of chips.  My fellow Yelpers and I can't all be wrong with this... I'm coming back for the shrimp tacos alone!  I also ordered the three taco combination (chicken, pastor, and cochinita) and a chicken quesadilla to go while my daughter had the deep fried ice cream before we left.  The tacos were scrumptious and came with beans and delicious rice.  The quesadilla was large and we ate it over lunch and dinner.  My daughter very much so enjoyed her dessert.  The fried ice cream is essentially vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and a cherry over a bowl seemingly made out of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.   Yummy.  Locating this place can be difficult at first.  Driving towards the airport on Paradise road you'll want to turn left on the second left turn possible after passing the Best Western on your left side.    My only irk about this place is their store hours.  Twice, I've come here at their listed opening time of 10 AM.  Both times, the restaurant was closed.  This second visit, a clock sign on the window states \"Be back at 11:00\".  Of course, I returned to the now open restaurant at 11 and when I asked the staff what their store hours were, they told me they normally open at 10:00.   On the one hand, I would love to come here the moment it opens so I can get my hands on another one of their glorious shrimp tacos ($6 btw).  On the other hand, I'll probably wait an hour until 11 to make sure I don't arrive disappointed.  This is a very good spot to stop by at if you're heading to or through the airport.  You won't get any fine dining experience at this little hidden treasure but you'll get some seriously great authentic Mexican food.  Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 31/100"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! I tried the cheese enchiladas, as well as the Pastor and Cochinita tacos and they were legit!  Everything was delicious and the owner was extremely friendly. I don't think you could go wrong at this place.  I will be headed back in to explore the rest of the menu for sure. Glad I found a joint that will satisfy my cravings for Mex while I'm in town on extended stays."}
{"text":"I tried this place last night and would have to say it was awesome!  It's a little hard to find, but it's worth it.  When you cross Tropicana heading south on Paradise watch out for it on the left hand side.  It's tucked away inside a hotel-ie thing, but it gives you that hole in the wall, awesomeness feel when you step inside.  Food is amazing, amazing, amazing.  We had a group order a bunch of dishes and everything was good.  I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Me and a friend came here after class at UNLV and saw the review on Yelp. It's a little hidden in a business park next to McCarran airport.  The waiter,and I assume owner as well, was extremely friendly. The tomatillo salsa was amazing. I ordered a chicken enchilada combo and shrimp taco. Both were amazing. The food came out hot and fresh. I loved the sauce that they put on their shrimp taco. I haven't tasted anything like it before. I will definitely be back. The seating area is very small. It's one of those whole in the wall places that you just know has amazing food. I can't wait for them to start selling beer next month! Lol"}
{"text":"Too disorganized and unreliable here.  Called on a Monday and they didn't answer the phone. Okay, closed because it's Labor Day weekend? Came by on Tuesday at 11:15. No one is there. Tried calling, no one picks up. No signage on the windows indicating unusual closure.  Two regulars come by and ask if they're open. One said he called 15 minutes prior (11:00) and they answered for him saying they're open. Okay, so they pick up the phone for him but not us?  We're on a tight schedule, have to be at the airport in 2 hours after lunch, redeeming tickets to the Eiffel tower, getting gas and dropping off the rental car. Can't wait for people who don't have their act together."}
{"text":"I am down in Vegas all the time for work. I mean, like 15 days out of the month of July this year.  You know what gets really freaking old in Las Vegas?  Eating $15  mediocre burgers and fries, or crappy $25 small pizzas up and down the strip?  What do you want?  You want a great burrito, solid salsa and guacamole, a hole in the wall feel, and some quiet.  Essentially, you want El Frescos.  Four of us (all down the same length of time) sat down miserable, defeated, and hating humanity after that much time in Las Vegas.  Every single one of us feels that this was top 5 mexican places we have been to, and the best Mexican establishment in Las Vegas.    El Frescos, I joke not when I tell you that you pulled me back from the abyss of never ending despair."}
{"text":"Woke up hungover. Husband (like, brand new, just married him the day before) made me walk a mile from our hotel so we could get some cheesy, beany, ricey goodness before our flight back home to Phoenix. Holy crap, I'm so glad he made me walk instead of eating sh*tty Hard Rock food. This place was so good. Thick, salty, just-fried tortilla chips with some really, really tasty tangy green salsa. I was already impressed. Then came my three taco plate (chicken, cochinita, and al pastor) with super tasty rice and beans. Each taco was made with two tortillas that were ever so slightly fried but still soft. The meats were super flavorful. My husband's off the menu shrimp tacos were huge and came with avocado and some yummy sauce. John, the owner, brought us some habanero salsa that was pretty bomb too. Speaking of John, what a nice guy. He and the chef were so freakin' nice and friendly! John even offered to take us to the airport, and we took him up on it. Thank you John, we appreciate you and we will be sure to come see you guys next time we are here! Come open a place in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Guys... seriously.  Located in the sketchy buildings right off Paradise and just before the airport exit, you'll find some of the best tacos to hit Vegas. El Frescoes keeps it simple with classic \"abuelita\" styled entrees and insanely fresh pickled veggies and soft tortillas. The menu, located on the wall is loaded with classics like tortas, burritos, tacos, and chilaquiles. I went with the tacos, three different ways, cochinitas, el pastor, and a shrimp taco. All of them, I mean all of them were delicious.   The Cochinitas, were so tender it was a magical. Literally, the kind of tender pork where you start to wonder, bite after bite, if the pig that gave his life for this meal came from a, \"Swine Spa\" where he was massaged for hours on end and only fed the finest pig slop.   The El Pastor. The other magical white meat was just as good, tender and crispy on the ends with a perfect amount of raw onions and cilantro. El Frescos pork game is strong and just note, but el pastor tacos should be eaten in pairs, just sayin'.  Shrimp Tacos, I salute thee. The shrimp used in these refreshing little pockets of heaven is actually a full sized shrimp that are seared and chopped up on a hot surface and placed in a flour tortilla, unlike the two porky predecessors that came in a corn tortilla. These shrimp tacos come covered in a cool zesty cilantro sauce with just a hint of heat. Who knew eating tacos could make you feel so good!   EL Frescos also makes their own chips and salsas. The habanero is very good, but a total creeper. Eat this one slowly, you've been warned!   For those of you who are used to the typical spacious Vegas chain restaurant seating you'll get a rude awaking here. This spot holds about fifteen maybe twenty people on a good day, but the tight seating stays inline with the, \"hole in the wall\" vibe.   El Frescoes will soon be that hidden gem hot foodie spot. So get here before there's no else to sit!"}
{"text":"This is one of those dive restaurants you must try! I've taken my friends here and I've taken my family. Everyone LOVED the food! The meats have so much flavor and you can taste the quality. The meat is actually meat, not fat, and the food isn't drenched in grease. The rice and beans were delicious too.  They also have real Mexican Coke in a glass bottle!"}
{"text":"You know the saying 'Where do the chef's eat?' This, this is where they eat. The 2 owners started this place 10 months ago (both have been in the restaurant game, for years) and mark my words they will be expanding next year. Their menu is comprised of things that they like to eat. I'm not a beans and rice person at all and both were great-seriously I ate all of it (I'm usually there for the protein and seafood)! The tortilla chips that he brings to the table are fresh served (lightly salted) with mild spicy fresh green salsa.   Best ceviche in town (we hunt for good ceviche). Fresh, clean sharp flavors and GOOD size pieces of shrimp and fresh fish not soupy like others we have tried in the past. Tortillas made fresh daily by a company down the street.   Everything was delicious and reasonably priced. 2 people we got out of there for $40 The only downside is no beer and wine. The owner mentioned that they will have their beer and wine license in the next few months.   The place only has 10 tables but, who cares!   ***The building looks like an apartment complex but, don't let that fool you. Look for the white Christmas lights that is the entrance."}
{"text":"Our clan cruised in here for lunch on a Thursday and was not disappointed. The restaurant is not much to look at inside, but the food was excellent. We especially enjoyed the guacamole and pastor tacos. The gentlemen running the place were especially friendly and restocked our chips, salsa and drinks when needed. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Hidden off in the random buildings by the airport is this little gem. The food was what brought me here not the location tho, after reading a few reviews and craving some tacos I felt I'd give it a try..and I don't regret it at all! The food is priced very well and the service was helpful, I ordered a carne asada burrito and some mixed tacos. The meat on all of them was flavored well and the fresh chips and salsa went great with my meal. I recommend trying a little bit of everything. The chicken taco was a bit dry but the flavor was good enough to save it in my opinion. Not your authentic street taco type joint but even the lack of langua and lard dipped tortas was made up for by the overall flavors and freshness of the food. I will be a repeat customer with the great experience I had."}
{"text":"This place is easy to miss!!! But it is soooooo unbelievably good. My friend got the shrimp tacos and they were the best shrimp tacos I've ever tried. I will definitely be coming back. Great street tacos. Great prices. Quick service. Such an awesome little dive that looks like it's in a motel."}
{"text":"So. Good.   It's in an unexpected parking lot, but it's in a great location centrally in Vegas. Skipping class at UNLV? Tacos. Driving a cheap person who doesn't want to Uber to the airport? Tacos. Going to the strip to play tourist but don't want to eat on the strip? These tacos.   Got to sample two of each of their street tacos. The asada, pastor, chicken, and carnitas. All of them had a bold flavors and were perfectly seasoned. I'm not a fan of salsa but can tell you it was petty spicy from \"pinky testing\" it. I wanted to try other things, but was full after inhaling 5 tacos. My second stomach reserved for dessert didn't let me down, and their deep fried ice cream coated in Cinnamon Toast Crunch was fantastic.   It's a little more pricey than your average taco joint, but well worth it as their products are non-GMO which I am a nutcase about. I can't wait to come back to try the shrimp tacos everyone is raving about. This is my new to-go place for Mexican!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Google, looked up reviews and nothing but great reviews. We went today for lunch and were not disappointed I had the chilaquiles and my mom had the steak Ranchero both dishes were excellent and we even had leftovers. The beans which we found out from one of the owners are Peruvian not pinto they were very creamy with lots of cheese, yum. We will definitely be back to try different items we saw. It is  a little out of the way and if you miss the entrance you have to circle around again since it's on a way one street but we'll worth the trip. One of the owners talked to us for a bit and was very nice, service was great and quick. The place is small and once word gets out I'm sure they'll have a line out the door?"}
{"text":"My father and I just had lunch and it was DELICIOUS!! He had the shrimp tacos and he said they were \"THE BEST HE'S EVER HAD\".. and this guy is a total foodie. I had the braised pork torta. The pork was absolutely amazing.. lean,tender and falling apart. The flavors were on point and washed it all down with a Mexican bottled coke   Definitely a hidden gem.. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Service is awesome, they make you feel so welcome, Food is absolutely the best Mexican food I have ever had,I had cochinta and carne asada nachos and tacos both amazing, that cochinita meat is so flavorful, goes with anything!! Will be returning soon!!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos. Highly recommend. Flew n from PA and needed some food. Close to the airport. Will come back every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Really good food, I ordered shrimp tacos and they were very filling and delicious just like the burrito and quesadillas my friends ordered. Very friendly service, too."}
{"text":"Very small place off the strip with amazing food. We had the shrimp taco special and the 3-taco special. So good! These guys know what they are doing."}
{"text":"This place without a doubt makes THE best Carne Asada Taco. I have taken maybe a 1/2 a dozen people to this place and they all agreed. Super nice guys too."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food was amazing; I had a shrimp and pastor taco and carne asada quesadilla. The quesadilla is BIG, trust (had to doggie bag it & I usually munch out) and the shrimp taco is their specialty - so good, 10/10 A+ would eat again."}
{"text":"Get the Max Tacos!  they are Mulas style with the grilled cheese! The quality is superb and the service is great.... like they actually want you there and are very hospitable! I am glad I found this spot!!! Great Mexican food"}
{"text":"Hidden gem to say the least!!! If you're staying at the Hard Rock it's only like a $6 cab ride from the hotel and well worth it! So much better than the over priced Pink Taco at the hotel and talk about cheap you've got to check this place out! Super cheap, large portions and very very clean. Don't let the outside scare you off give it a chance, step inside and let yourself be impressed!!"}
{"text":"It was somewhat difficult to find the restaurant, but I'm really glad we did. I read all the great reviews about the off-menu shrimp taco so I had to order one along with some cochinita tacos.  I came in with high expectations for the shrimp taco, and I still loved it. The shrimp taco was so good and really big so it was definitely worth $6. It had tons of shrimp and the shrimp had such a nice grilled flavor. And the creamy chipotle mayo sauce was great. Also, the melted cheese went well with it and I really like how they grilled the tortilla too.   The cochinita tacos were great, as well. It seemed like they did a great job of slow cooking the pork, so the meat was extremely juicy (maybe too juicy making it a little watery), tender, and tasty.   Overall, the tacos cost more than others but they taste amazing."}
{"text":"1st time here, decided to check it out after read yelp and TripAdvisor reviews.  Ordered shrimp special, it was really good.  Almost didn't get to eat since we couldn't find the place, drove pass it 3 times."}
{"text":"Here for a conference and needed to get away from both the strip and rubber chicken. Yelp lead me here - earlier reviewers nailed it.  Great place for a solid, fresh, and tasty meal. I had the guac, and 3 tacos (chicken, asada, pastor).  Sooo gooood!!  Do yourself a favor, make the short trip."}
{"text":"My family and I came here after seeing all the rave reviews. It was an awesome experience. Ordered the taco salad (grilled chicken) and shrimp tacos...chips and salsa verde were brought to the table. Everything was delicious. The staff was incredibly friendly. We'll definitely add this place to our regular spots.   The only drawback is that it's a bit difficult to find. Don't let that stop you! It's worth the search!!!"}
{"text":"I had the carne asada and it was awesome my girlfriend had the cochinita that was great too. If you like Mexican food give this place a try you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Located in a sketchy area near the airport.  The place is small (7 tables) located downstairs from a hotel.  Staff were nice and service was quick.  Ordered a Torta, mini chicken quesadilla, and chicken taco.  We munched on free chips and salsa verde whole waiting for the food.  All were fresh and tasty.  The place is clean and prices were low.  Don't give up trying to find this hidden gem, the food is worth it."}
{"text":"What a great little spot! It doesn't look like a typical restaurant from the outside so this place is one that you cannot judge a book by its' cover. It looks like an old apartment complex so we thought we entered the address in wrong or that it was a hoax and didn't exist, lol. But just look for the little Christmas lights and you found it! My husband and I went in tonight for some tacos. I had seen this place mentioned on Buzzfeed as Nevada's best tacos so we decided to try it out.  I ordered 2 asada tacos and a shrimp taco. The asada tacos are a little smaller than the norm but they had excellent flavor! The shrimp taco was much bigger and the shrimp is so fresh! I couldn't quite tell what kind of sauce it was but it was like creamy with a kick to it. It was topped with some cabbage and avocado. I would definitely stick with shrimp tacos if you're planning on visiting. They're so good!  It was a bit of a slow night so the owner/manager talked to us quite a bit and is such a friendly person. He was on top of everything and was just very genuinely social and likeable. At the end of our meal, he surprised us with an ice cream just to thank us for coming in! We were totally not expecting that! It was such a sweet gesture and we really felt like valued customers. Of course, don't go in there demanding free stuff just because you read it here lol.  All in all, it was a really nice experience. Staff was amazingly friendly, food was great, and the place is small but very welcoming. We live up near Aliante so we aren't around the area too often but if we ever are, I would go back.  PS I love the music they play!"}
{"text":"We were up here visiting from the bay area and I found this place on yelp because my child demanded rice and beans. The journey to this place was well worth the drive.   Everything was amazing and the garlic house salsa is like crack.  Best tacos I've had hands down."}
{"text":"Love El Fresco's...I go there at least 2 to 3 times a week...the Cochinita super taco is the bomb...love the carne asada tostada...with the Peruvian beans...OMG...but the best are the shrimp tacos...best shrimp tacos I've ever had...and they are the king sized shrimp! Great little place...somewhat strange location, but hey, it's the food that counts...the chips and green salsa are the bomb..."}
{"text":"5-Star Yelp reviews meant I had to stop in here and try for myself.  Total hole in the wall - in an somewhat odd location.  But worth the trek!  Tried chips/salsa - red is hot, good... green is very tasty - tangy even.  I could eat that all day.  Fresh fried chips were spot-on too.  Created own Tres Taco plate with Pastor, Shrimp & Cochinita.  All were quite delicious!  Next time I will be ordering the Pastor and Cochinita again - they were awesome.  Nice presentation & great personal service too!  Try it for yourself if near the airport or south Strip."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, excellent service and very reasonable prices. We've lived in Vegas for a year and a half, and until we came here, had not found any good Mexican. We'll definitely make the drive from southeast Henderson again!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I ate here after our Uber driver suggested it. It looks a little shady when you first see it but don't let outward appearances scare you away. I got 3 chicken tacos with rice and beans, he got chicken fajitas. This was the BEST Mexican food I have ever eaten and we have traveled (and eaten) all over the South West. It came with home made chips and the most delicious salsa verde. The owner was super friendly when he took our orders and made light conversation with us. And cheap! All of that plus drinks was less than 30 dollars. We will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"If you want to talk about a hole in the wall, then this place is it. It is one step above a taco truck, or better yet one step below one. when I walk in this place it even feels like I am in a third world country and im not drinking the water just in case. But even though this place is where it is (not easy to find) and looks like what it looks like inside (little bit scary) if all you care about is great tacos, then this place blows the roofs off most taco joints (and taco trucks). Hillary Clinton promises a taco stand on every corner if elected, and if they are as good as El Frescos, I would even vote for her. the salsa is excellent and im usually not a shrimp Taco guy but after reading reviews I tried them and they are wonderful."}
{"text":"How to sum up this place with one word \"Delicious\". I've tried almost everything on there menu and haven't had any complaints so far. Food is great and very inexpensive. Best by far is there cochinita pibil and there tacos de canasta.I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Reviews were on the nose with this place. The tacos were bomb and the service was great. If I lived out here I would come more often!"}
{"text":"Off the beaten path we go.....wooooow was this place worth the drive from the strip!  The two owners who are brothers, are out of this world hospitable!  I can't decide what I love more, so I'll recommend everything!  You won't be disappointed, and more importantly pleasantly surprised:-)  I love the fact you can see everything cooking, and the flavors will delight your heart and soul.  I am super impressed!  As a Chicago native, I've been exposed to some pretty delicious authentic food, and these boys just nailed it!  NON GMO beef, pork, and chicken!!!!  Love love love this place.    Helpful hint...it is in an office suite so don't leave without snagging a little nugget from this place.   Yummmmm!!:-)"}
{"text":"Literally some of the best Mexican food I've had in Vegas! Green salsa was delicious, portions were very generous, and the food was super flavorful. Definitely would go back again."}
{"text":"Solid 5 star customer service and 4.5 star food.  We ordered burritos but were struck with Taco Envy when I eyed my neighbors taco orders!  Not the easiest place to find tucked away in an older shopping area but the yelp pictures helped me locate the storefront."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and had to check it out. At first a little concerned about the location buts it's in a good place just looks odd from the pics. Owners extremely friendly,  tiny spot but does the trick. Had there tomotillo salsa for the first time and loved it! Everything was so fresh and tasty and a great price. This is a must if you like Mexican food"}
{"text":"With all of the great reviews, we decided to check this place out Saturday. As we approached the address, we slowed down so that we would not miss the driveway. There was a sign, so we knew we had finally found it. As we pulled in we noticed a lot of rental cars. These cars were of various makes and years, all parked around the entire lot. There were people in the back part of the lot working on even more cars. It was a bit unsettling, but we parked in front of the restaurant so that we could see our own car.  The restaurant is fairly small, but very clean. You are able to see the kitchen, and watch the food being prepared. We were given the opportunity to choose our own canned or bottled beverage that was in a cooler, and chips with green salsa were brought to our table. The chips and salsa were very good. Fresh and flavorful.   We ordered the Shrimp Taco plate that came with rice and beans, along with tacos al pastor. We could hear the food sizzling as they placed it on the grill, so that was really nice. We also ordered guacamole, which came out right after we placed our order. It was fresh, bright green and tasted wonderful. It had red onion, and a nice lime flavor. Large chucks of avocado really made this a treat.   The tacos pastor was our favorite, besides the guacamole. These were so flavorful with tender meat seasoned just right. We were super excited about the shrimp tacos, but were disappointed. The colors and presentation were really nice. Big pieces of shrimp, and a slice of avocado made these look wonderful. But the sauce was so salty I almost could not eat it. My husband likes salt on pretty much everything, but it was a bit much for him as well. The beans were really good as well, and the rice was a nice addition.   Tacos al pastor 5 Guacamole 5 Beans/Rice 4.5 Chips/Salsa 4.5 Shrimp tacos 3.5 (too salty) Service 5+"}
{"text":"A little off the beaten path, but worth seeking out.. Great stop for a bite for hungry people on their way to the airport!   Really enjoyed the Chiliquiles, which is cheese and egg smothered chips with diced chicken. Also had a fantastic shrimp taco that was special off the menu and had a good spiced cream sauce.   Loved the day of the dead decor too!"}
{"text":"Service is great, food is great, and price is great. Can't go wrong! The asada was a little salty but other than that, simply great! Try their salsa! Definitely has a kick :) location is a little difficult to find. Highly recommend the quesadilla with chicken as well!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit ! I had two chicken soft tacos and they were great ! This is a no frills authentic Mexican concina !  It almost feels like I am ordering from a food truck with tables, and that is totally a compliment.    It sounds like they have been open since October and both owners have other jobs, but you can tell by the tastiness of the food that their passion is to make this business work !  I will definitely be back whenever I am in Vegas !"}
{"text":"Having had my share of Mexican Food being from South East L.A this joint opened up next door to my job...Why did I wait so long??? Food is on point!  A hidden gem I must say only thing that sucks is I live in centennial and haven't had the family try it out yet."}
{"text":"SO DOPE! I work right around the corner from this place and I must say that at first I was not excited about it, but after trying it.... *** MIND BLOWN****!!!!   Holy Sh**T the food is good! You must try their chilaquiles!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!!! Amazing taste....I highly recommend this place. Authentic Mexican food. Chilaquiles Rojos are the best. Chorizo con huevo on point. I will be definitely coming back!!!! Gracias por todo El Fresco's......:)"}
{"text":"OK WOW there's a reason this restaurant has 5 stars the food is excellent it is a small hole in the wall place not easy to find behind some Vegas ticket office but wow the shrimp tacos are the best ever! and everything is fresh and taste amazing !! I would highly recommend trying it! You will LOVE it!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to El Fresco's on a friend's recommendation, it was great!!! I had the carne asada torta, excellent I'm not really sold on GMO free meat but their meat is fantastic, everything else was great too, the chips, the house pickled condiments, even the plates, yes they have actual plates to eat on and silverware. Great little place a little hard to find but worth looking."}
{"text":"OMG!  Came here because the reviews were so good and I like trying hole in the walls..  You Can't GO WRONG!  My daughter had cheese enchiladas and a chicken taco, it was cheesy melt in your mouth perfection, absolutely delicious!  I had the chicken Ranchero and the sauce was spot on,  good rice and beans.  I tried the shrimp taco and it blew me away,  it too was cooked to perfection,  plump,  juicy shrimp,  complemented well with the cabbage,  sauce and avocado.  I couldn't say enough good about the food! Just one drawback,  canned soda no fountain drinks,  but forgiveable with the caliber of food and not to forget great service as well..  Will come back any time I'm in the area for sure!   WOW!"}
{"text":"A real 5 star yelp restaurant.  We were somewhat skeptical before visiting this Mexican restaurant.  We tried fish/shrimp tacos and taco salad ono our first visit.  Wow, those are fresh and delicious.  This is the best CP value Mexican restaurant we ever visited. will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"We found this place from Yelp reviews. We were looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant. Wow, what an awesome place. They have the huge doughy tortillas, the best street tacos I have ever eaten, and a burrito to die for. Not the fanciest place to eat, but absolutely delicious. I cannot wait to go back when we visit Las Vegas. They were amazingly nice and food was cooked fresh."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!! The salsa itself is incredible and the service is awesome! Definitely going to come back when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! If you are near the strip or the airport- please take a short drive over to el fresco. You won't regret it. I got a shrimp taco, an el pastor taco, and a cochinitas taco. My husband got a burrito and it was huge. He said it was perfect but I was too full to try it. Oh and get the side of guacamole to go with your chips & salsa! If I had to make one suggestion, it would be that the el pastor taco needed a little queso fresco and maybe a tomato slice."}
{"text":"This place is great. Incredible quesadillas and the tacos I had were great too. Top it off with some of their delicious green salsa and you have found heaven."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had!!!! The chips are fresh and the salsa homemade and delicious. My wife ordered the chiliquiles and I ordered the three taco plate. The chiliquiles were very good, great flavor and still the crunch from the chips. The three taco plate, I ordered 1 chicken, 1 el pastor, and 1 cochinito. The chicken and el pastor were very good. The cochinito, which I have not heard of before, was one of the best tacos I have ever eaten!!!! The flavor of the pork and sweetness of the pickled onion, not really fond of onions but these are great, was absolutely delicious. I fully expect these guys to be in a bigger place in the not to distant future!!! Will definitely be eating here every time I am in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"The simplicity of this place is what makes it so special. Everything from the decor to the menu to the ingredients is lacking in style but is made up for it with substance. I ordered 3 tacos (shrimp, asada, and pork) and my son ordered 2 chicken tacos. You know the food is good when after the first bite you're already searching the menu for something else to sample on your next visit!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm spoiled coming from Cali where competition is ultra fierce with so many Mexican eateries. But Vegas is no slouch, so I'm a little shocked at all the 5 star ratings. Way over priced tacos in this hard to find joint tucked in a run down business park. Subpar tacos at any price, but at this price I would rather be at the much nicer Olivia's Latin Cuisine that just opened on Maryland Pkwy."}
{"text":".. i really like this spot ... good vibes ... the guys who work here are super cool ... its got a very down to earth vibe ... makes ya feel at home ... how can u not like this place :D"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall gem!!!! Don't let the outside fool you. This place is delicious with quality food. The carne asada whether in tacos, torta, or just carne asada plate the meat is tender and flavorful. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"OMG...best food this trip.  These guys do it right! Had the chicken/shrimp fajitas and am so sold.   From the very flavorful fresh homemade salsa Verde and chips  to the artfully plated food with some of the best flavor ever.  Get in here and get some of this"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the chicken taco, but wasn't a fan of the pork one with the pickled onions..... chips and salsa are bomb.  I was only charged $2.50.... totally worth it.  I will be back"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and even better service. You have to go here if you want satisfying Mexican food. You'll be coming back for more and more."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican food and great service!!!!! I had the steak fajitas my sister has a chicken quesadilla and my niece loved her breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, and saw reviews that the shop is located in a somewhat shady location, but it's just basically in an expected area, in a rather isolated corner.  It's quite a small joint, with a capacity of maybe 15-20 people max? My boyfriend and I were the only customers at that time, so the employees were very attentive to us.   I ordered a Steak Ranchero combination plate ($9.99) and my boyfriend got the Chicken Fajita plate ($8.79). They were freshly grilled and came with nachos and tortillas. The chicken was a little dry but still fragrant. The steak on the other hand, was really juicy and flavorful! It came with the house sauce, which might be a little salty on its own, but amazing with rice and beans. Both my boyfriend and I loved it so much we cleaned the plate entirely!!!   Prices are also pretty affordable seeing as how it's in Vegas. Mexican food is always good! Would totally recommend this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The food was fresh, delicious and hit the spot. I ordered the off menu mahi mahi taco plate.  It melted in my mouth.  John is great!"}
{"text":"Ok so I want to be fair about this and upfront the two owners are very pleasant young men and they have a fantastic product. But,there are a few things people need to understand going in. The first thing is the location..I thought I was going to a massage parlor..I get it they are starting up and I'm sure the rent is REALLY CHEAP...but the location is not good..if I didn't do a yelp search of the area for restaurants there is no way I would even know this place is here. Next,the inside is minimalist with a capitol M...I mean really simple...the next issue is that I was asked to sit and be serviced which is not necessary but I also felt obligated to tip them because they were pleasant and I was served..when you get there you will understand what I mean. Now to the food..I had two shrimp tacos rice and beans and a mexican coke. Total with tip was 21.50....holy refried beans batman! That was a seriously expensive meal..and I will say it was excellent but if this is the cost of this caliber of food I would like to be in an equally excellent area and environment..these prices rival top restaurants and I can say for sure that I have eaten this caliber of food before but it is usually much less...it is good..but not 21+ dollars good...it could see shelling out about 13/14...in any event you are paying for very good food and good food costs money to make I would just like them to find a way to reel in that pricing it's gonna kill them...but if money is no object and you don't mind a bit of a sketchy area then you will not be disappointed.."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I saw this rated good here on Yelp and decided to give it a try. When we showed up it was a little hard to find hidden in this little shopping center, and it's appearance didn't make it looks too good, but the food was amazing. The service was so nice. The guys running it were helpful, kind, and enjoyed small talk. It was a great place to grab something quick to fill you up for days lol. Highly recommend If your looking for something quick and tasty!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing!!!  Fresh, good portions, no skimping,great prices !!  It looks like a hotel room turned into a restaurant...  The perfect \"hole in the wall\".  We had the enchiladas, taco salad , and a taco .  FRESH food , watch them use real meat and make there own beans !!  Only negative... They were so busy they had not had time to make more red salsa ."}
{"text":"Very small hole in the wall..  Food was good but not memorable."}
{"text":"This restaurant was great. The food was delicious and well made.  The presentation equals other top Mexican restaurants and the food excels. We had the taco salad and the enchilada combo with a soft taco with chicken.  Not what you would expect from the small strip mall exterior. Service was excellent and price was moderate. Lots of value for the food and service."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with a great selection of Mexican dishes. Portions are generous, and well priced. The quesadillas were wonderful as were the pork dishes. Couldn't fit any more food, so we didn't get to try dessert. The only negative is that it does not have alcohol."}
{"text":"El Fresco had great hospitality and felt very friendly. I got their Taco Salad and it looked better in person than the picture they have on their menu. It was super delicious. I would definitely come here again next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I am so grateful for yelp and the ratings. We went to this restaurant based off of the rating on yelp and were pleasantly surprised. The place is a little hole in the wall. However, it was worth it and authentic."}
{"text":"Best Burrito places, its a unda spot u don't really know its there..but its sooo good!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Charming hole in the wall with delicious food. Loved the shrimp tacos, the rice & the chips! The staff is great too. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Closed!  Ubered there to find it boarded up.........................................................................................................................................................................................CLOSED..... Sign in window says a new place is coming soon."}
{"text":"Seriously though, no joke about the shrimp tacos, they're THAT good! Ordered pickup on a Saturday afternoon, ordering was easy and accurately taken. Other items ordered other than the shrimp tacos, were al pastor tacos, carne asada tacos, cochinita tacos and chicken enchiladas. The enchiladas are only offered with red sauce (wanted verde) and they were a bit on the salty side. The salsa verde had way too much garlic, and from what my kids told me, the al pastor did, too. My husband got lost finding the place, but he wouldn't be my husband if he didn't. The total takeout bill was a few cents shy of $83...pricey, but we came away with a lot of food. Go for the shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"I'm from eastern Washington and can't get any authentic Mexican food there. I stayed close by and decided to try the soft chicken taco and it was awesome. Very simple, chicken, onions and cilantro but the seasoning was perfect, chips are homemade and the green salsa rocked. Will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food and restaurant in Las Vegas. The two dudes that run this place are friendly and know how to treat customers And the pastor is the best I've had anywhere! There is a reason it has 5 stars even after 49 reviews!  Give it a try, it won't disappoint"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp! And thought, why not let's try this place! My daughter and I came here after riding the New York New York rollercoaster and it is safe to say that is my new favorite restaurant! The manager was so polite and catered to our requests! My daughter ordered the quesadilla and I had 4 carne Asada tacos with sour cream and cheese! BEST TACOS I HAVE EVER HAD! A couple weeks later I came back with my sister and was definitely not disappointed! Food was absolutely delicious! If you haven't tried this place, you're missing out! This place deserves more than 5 stars! It deserves 10!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service! We were in vegas for the weekend and found this little place with the help of Yelp. Everything was delicious and the food was legit. Definitely a must for everyone looking for good Mexican food"}
{"text":"Love it !! Probable mente uno de los mejores lugares mexicanos en los que he comido en USA, comida auténtica Mexicana, aguachirle de camarón y camarones tecolote  para chuparse los dedos !!  el local se parece a los locales de México, te ase sentir como si estuvieras en México 5  para este local"}
{"text":"Love that our Uber driver was scared and confused on the location! It's in a tiny strip mall, if you can even call it that. They seemed surprised to see us announcing our arrival to the staff on a Friday night. But great service, clean, and the food was amazing! BEST SHRIMP TACOS we have ever had. And we are from San Diego! The guacamole, salsa and fresh warm chips started off a delicious dinner. One problem was that they don't have a liquor license yet. Not even for beer and wine. They've only been open for 7 months. This will be our new go to place off the strip for Mexican. Just wish we could've had a corona or Margarita with our awesome food."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Mexican food, look no more. This location has what you may be craving. The theme is really nice and I like the location. Is small yet good. I recommend this place to you. The employees are fast working and helpful. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nice surprise! Simple hole in the wall with tasty food, great ingredients well prepared and engaging host. Be warned the habanero sauce is no joke. We had shrimp fajitas (huge u8 shrimp lightly cooked) shrimp ceviche and some tacos.  The chips are freshly fried and warm with salsa verde.  Recommended."}
{"text":"everything was fresh, tasted amazing.  the max burrito is like 2.5lbs of pure awesome. the Carne asada was so tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"I went out of my way to eat here after class (UNLV) and I got 2 shrimp tacos and the shrimp quesadilla to go. The total came to just over $25, so it was a bit on the spendy side, but as a once in awhile splurge I would come back for that Shrimp quesadilla, it was loaded with fat shrimp and flavor and I savored every single bite. The service was brilliant, the location...meh, a bit on the tricky side, but overall...20 stars."}
{"text":"Good Food. Small spot but very friendly and quality food. No alcohol but the employee said we can go get some and bring it in if we wanted to! Also we told him we were here for our bachelor/bachelorette weekend and he gave us free dessert which was bomb! Deep fried ice cream!"}
{"text":"Super good tacos!!! Yummy!!! Friendly servers!! Fish taco is a must try! Not fried, super healthy! I cannot wait to come back again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"While on vacation a couple of weeks ago, my wife and I found this amazing place.  It is a little tricky to find, but don't give up...it is well worth the effort!  We started with the shrimp tacos, which are absolutely the most incredible that I have ever had.  We then enjoyed the Al Pastor tacos, followed by the carne asada plate.  This meat...I mean, I don't understand how it can have such amazing flavor.  So I ask John and David, the owners (and lifelong friends, it turns out), and they tell me that they are obsessed with finding the best beef, and that the carne asada is so amazing because it came from a cow that had been raised on a farm in Cali, grass fed only, and butchered within a few days of me having it served to me.  Unbelievable.  Seriously!  The crazy part is, I hadn't even tasted the most delicious thing on the menu, the Cochinita Plate. Braised pork covered in red onions.  When I got it, I started removing what I perceived to be too many onions.  John, the owner, watches me do this and politely says, \"You're going to want to eat ALL OF THOSE\".  Haha...I thought wow, he thinks he knows me...and I tell him that I like onions okay, but not that much...and then I tasted them.  Holy Moses!!!!  Probably the best thing I have ever eaten in my entire life!!!  As I'm piling the onions back on, he just smiles...and I realize that he's just happy to share some of his favorites with others.  I asked for 2 more plates to go...knowing I would start craving it later, and left perfectly satisfied.  I happened to be in Vegas with my brother again yesterday, and so if course I had to take him...and he, of course, is now addicted as well.  Nice job, gentleman...you free me away from the buffets on the strip, and I may never go back.  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Mexican food in the southwest is like trying to find a McDonald's. They are on every street corner. El Fresco's is about as authentic as it gets Eland not your run of the mill Tex Mex. Short of the UEFA Euro being in English it felt like the restaurant I ate at in Mexico a few months back. The carne asada plate was ridiculously good and I left thoughtfully satisfied. I am not a fan of salsa verde normally. The salsa verde they give you with the chips was so good it has changed my opinion. Only drawback is you have to keep your eyes open once on Paradise. If you miss it you will be taking the airport return to try to get into their parking lot on the 2nd go round. I will easily go back there."}
{"text":"a little tiny spot coming into the airport ran by 2 friends. with great Mexican food. I've been there quite a few time already having tried their fresco torta both asada and al pastor both pretty damm good. ive had the super max burrito and let me say if you can finish that beast your a true champ. i could barley eat half the burrito and let me say that burrito was one damm good burrito. its very convenient place to stop by and grab food right before i head into work as i work at the airport i give them a call and they have it ready for me when i get there. great customer service and of course great delicious food so if you have some time to spare whether you work near the airport or at the airport trying to catch a flight this place always hits the spot. definitely a hole in the wall no doubt about that."}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant in town. Shrimp tacos were amazing and the owners are great guys. I will surely be coming back."}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers for a great advise for this place. I love burritos and this place makes some great burritos. Plus everyone is super friend, the place is clean and they provide great service."}
{"text":"This place was off the beaten path and a little tricky to find but I'm glad we made the trip. The food is fresh, the portions are large and the prices are fantastic. We talked with one of the owners for a little while and he was super friendly. It was a great break from what the strip offers. Will definitely go back when in Vegas."}
{"text":"As is well stated on other reviews, the shrimp tacos are the best I've ever had!  Service was very friendly and attentive.  The place is hard to find, but so worth it.  Would recommend for sure."}
{"text":"Look, there's no getting around the fact that Vegas is expensive. EXPENSIVE AS FUCK. However, if you do a little yelp searching you can always find hidden gems and this is exactly what EFCM is. This is your standard, order a taco or burrito and be happy, Mexican joint. The food is the kind that hits the spot from the chips and salsa to the enchiladas. The staff that work there are extremely friendly and since we were lucky to get there at the beginning of the lunch hour, it wasn't packed at all.  The location is a little off the beaten path but you won't regret going here. DO IT!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, prices should be higher then $. Wasn't a big fan of the location."}
