{"text":"Ordered for pick up because we read the comment.  Everything was on time when we arrived.  Very small location would not recommend eating there--take out only.  Food was very good.  Salad was fresh and ranch dressing was tasty, but if you like thick ranch it isn't for you.  Pizza was very good and thin for the most part, but the outside crust wasn't as thin as we were imagining.  Still very tasty.  Wings were good too.  Not too saucy.  Would say it was good overall."}
{"text":"This place easily has the best New York Style pizza in the Cleveland area. It's pricey, but given the scarecity of authentic NY style pizza around town, it's worth it.   Make no mistake. This is not the average Clevelander pizza perspective on what NY/NJ pizza is. This isn't some thicker interpretation of what thin crust is which most of the local pizza joints do though labeling them NY style. This is the legit crust, sweeter sauce, ovens."}
{"text":"Seriously when you call and offer free soda for being 30 min late and show up an hour and half late, I have no words. The food is great but the kids making and delivering need a little work ethic shot to fix this flaw in the business.    Please do not let this business go to the wayside.  Just provide quality service that patrons can rely on.  The only thing that saved this was the fantastic pizza and free cannollis."}
{"text":"Good pizza! Great chicken parm and garlic knots. My favorite menu item, the Cuban Sandwich, phenomenal!"}
