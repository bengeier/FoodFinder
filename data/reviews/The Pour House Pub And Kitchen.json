{"text":"Favourite local bar! They've got great drink specials all day every day. ($5 pour of the day & $3.50 select shots) the staff are beyond friendly, and always willing to engage in a conversation. Brunch & build your own caesar bar on the weekends!"}
{"text":"This place was really great. I originally went there with my boyfriend since it was our anniversary, but once I got there, I thought our friends would really like the place, and we invited them to come by as well! I had the Irish Stew, and it was delicious. It really hit the spot. Their drink prices were very reasonable and service was good. The location had good music (if you like classic or alt-rock with a few Irish songs thrown in), and it wasn't played so loud that we couldn't talk. We went in the fall, so it was too cold and wet to see the patio, but the interior is very spacious and nice."}
{"text":"I love this place. Okay, it might be because it's less than a 5-minute walk from my house, but nonetheless - it's a super cozy place to be during the winter, and it's even better during the summer because their patio is THE BEST. The only thing that sucks about it is the trains passing by once and a while, but I can deal with that to enjoy the sunshine and shade on a nice day.
The food is also pretty good - I've tried the salads, the burgers, the beef dip and have no complaints! My boyfriend loves half-priced wing day. The service is good and all in all, I would say Pour House is a great place to go to have a couple of beers (or wine!) and a bite!"}
{"text":"I am completely shocked that this place has not been reviewed by more people.  Then again, based on the amount of patrons that are there, I probably shouldn't be that surprised.

I have been coming here since I was an undergrad (sometime in the last century) and while it is conveniently located, have rarely seen it packed.  With the exception of St. Patrick's Day, around New Years or any significant \"football\" matches.

The indoor space is really, really big and has that dark wood, Irish pub decor.  Head to the back and there are two patios on different levels that back on the rail road tracks.  You hear the trains less and less every time they go by...

I have eaten many items off this menu, but more recently my friends and I have had the Fish and Chips, Angus Beef Burger, Macaroni and Cheese (sans bacon) and the sweet potato fries.  None have been out of this world, and I did not finish my burger last week because it kept crumbling out of the bun and I gave up on it.  The beer was more important anyway.

The beer selection is large enough and I admit that I come here more for that than the food, which has definitely gone up in price but not in quality.  It is in my area, so it has always been a perfect meeting spot with my friends for birthdays, a drink after work, or a lazy Sunday.  

I think the server outfits are ridiculous - short green kilts, tight black t-shirts and knee-high socks - looks like me and my friends in the '90's.

It has been more than half empty every time I have been in the last year, so I do recommend it if you are in the area and looking for a pub, but do not expect a large crowd."}
{"text":"This is a nice place for a drink, though we go mostly because it is close to home.  Good bar food.  The \"Award Winning Cottage Pie\" is quite good, though not spectacular.  Would have given it a 4, but the service is often a bit slow (not the server's fault, just never seems to be as many of them as is needed)."}
{"text":"Cool ambience. Good for a drink. Food is not good (at least the pork tacos weren't). Very mayonnaise-y and heavy tasting."}
{"text":"So conflicted about this spot. There are certain things I love and others that are unforgivable.

Lets start with the good - great location, generally a great vibe for both hanging out and watching sports (Raptors playoff games) They have a pretty great beer selection as well.

The bad comes down to one thing. The FOOD is horrible. It is horrible and over priced. I have had probably more than 50% of the items on this menu and nothing was ever good. To add insult to injury, the prices on the food are a bit high which makes it super frustrating. Simple things like nacho's and burgers should be pretty straightforward but somehow they manage to make them sucky.

Dear Pourhouse, we love you and don't want to give up but you gotta improve on the food!"}
{"text":"This place has two awesome patios, one on the second floor and one up in the tree tops by the third.  The inside is all dark wood and old fashioned - very very nice!

As for the food, I would say it is good but not great.  On Tuesdays they have a list of 5$ appetizers which is a pretty great deal, especially the shrimp and lime tacos MM!  Off the regular menu, I've had the calimari (TERRIBLE) and the fish and chips which were very good.  I asked for the chips well done and they were perfectly brown and delicious.

The downside to all this is that it's a little pricey, we had a pitcher of schocktap last night that wound up costing 18$ and food items (besides on Tuesdays) are mostly over 10$.  

Despite all this I still love coming here for the ambience, good beer selection and cheap appetizer Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"This place should not even hand out food menus for people to order from- everything that I ordered was inedible.  Even worse, though, is that the waitress didn't even ASK if there was something wrong with my food when she came to clear my (full) plate. That 70 dollar bill was very painful to pay.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Went on Friday Oct 28.   Had the Thai Curry Chicken and Rolling Rock lager.  Chicken was very well prepared except the portions were not generous.  Good service, decent food and large selection of beers for beer lovers."}
{"text":"The not so recent renovation is great. Service is always good to great. But I've found the portion sizes lately disappointing. Pre-reno they had some of the best wings in town. We had them a few weeks ago and they were different altogether, smaller and less generous in proportion. Had a burger last night and found it somewhat on the small side and the fries were a bit stingy. Prices are up, portions are down. Still a fan but used to feel like we were getting better value. Would like to see some adjustments to feel that way again. 

JK"}
{"text":"First time with close group of friends (six in party for a 7:30pm sitting on 12/6) and good thing we had a reservation.  Service from our waiter was spot on with full marks and his added humour topped off a great evening.  When you have a wait staff that moves in and out without hardly noticing...keep them and pay them well!  Now for the food, we could have gotten by on appetizers alone and what an explosion of flavours in every bite.  The eggplant parmesan...damn!  Main course was very good all around with the exception of my ten ounce steak looking more like 6-8 with no thickness (still delicious) and one party member with a pork chop that was a tad dry.  Hogarden beer in that massive glass made me happy that I was not the designated driver for the night. Costs ranged per couple with deserts, tea/coffee and including a healthy tip at $150 or $75/person.  Well worth a great night out in an atmosphere that was hospitable, unrushed and allowed for six friends to live, love & laugh.  See you soon Mr. Shelagh!"}
{"text":"My go-to place for a pint and sports. Weekends brunches are decent, and $3 Caesars on weekends are not to be sniffed at ;)"}
{"text":"The breakfast was not very good. I got tomotoes instead of home fries they were completely uneatable. I got the veggie omelette, I substituted the sundried tomatoes for regular tomatoes but the waitress did not make the switch. The ceasar bar has shriveled lemons. I wouldnt go back. The toast was also stale."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years  
However since the renovations -- 

Inconsistent service. Inconsistent food. But what does one expect from a bar. 

Make sure you sit in a brightly lit corner otherwise the server's will ignore you."}
{"text":"The Pour House has become a summer establishment for me.  My friends and I drive all the way from Dufferin and the 401 every Wednesday after softball to unwind here.  Why do we come all the way? Part tradition, part $0.50 wings, part FREE team pizza.  You read at right.  Free team pizza!  If you go to The Pour House with your team (minimum 6 people) you can get a free meat or veggie pizza.  If you have 12 players, you get 2.  It's not the biggest pizza, but enough for everyone to have a small slice.  The wings are also pretty good, but their seasoning isn't that consistent.  Medium one week is hot the next, but can you complain that much at that price?

They're great for group outings with TVs to catch the game, \"brewtender\"  kegs and a great patio.  The patio is a nice escape from the city without leaving the city... Until you hear the train, but they don't come around that often.

Basically it's everything you're looking for in a pub.  Decent, well priced food, beers, sports and friends. Can't wait until next Wednesday."}
{"text":"The staff were very nice...  But the food was terrible.  The chicken pie was like prison food from the third world.  It was cold the first time it was delivered, the replacement actually had some bone in it.  I think this place was somewhat better before the renovations.

The Guinness was not up to standard either."}
{"text":"Food is great....but don't think you will get the sound to live sports even though you're surrounded by TV screens. I was told sound is on for \"super special\" sporting events. The final game of the most exciting World Series ever is not seemed special?!?!"}
{"text":"I was at this place before the renovations but now that the renos are done, Wow. 
Was greeted and sat immediately by what I assume was the Manager. Opted for the bar being by myself. Bserversartender always had a smile on and was a pretty good seller. Took pic of the jalapeño chicken. It was not KFC ; it was better. The way mama made it. 
Over 20 beers on tap woth non of them being the normal buds and coors thank god. Quite the variety. Would definitely return with friends being there are larger areas for groups"}
{"text":"Had a group of about 15 go here last night. Took forever for someone to take out drink order and they didn't seem too eager to serve considering the pub wasn't busy. The service as a whole was unimpressive and unfriendly. Food was sub-par as well. $18 for a chimichanga with cold, uncooked rice. Our 10% discount for doing an escape room at Casa Loma was also ignored despite stating at the start of our order. Overall, this chain is not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"Food is bad and overpriced, service is awful. Honestly, why bother? 

I can't count the number of times I've had awful service here. It's bad enough to ruin your night. 

We walked in, seated ourselves, got sick of waiting so we grabbed our own menus. Server begrudgingly came by, despite visibly not working for a while after we came in. 

Food was bad too. I got a Straight-Up Burger and my partner got a Fried Chicken sandwich. My burger was SUPER dry, over-done, flavourless (except for the last two bites that had ALL of the salt! Gag). Plus the bun was the same as the big mac bun. My fries were more than 90% burnt shriveled up skins. Realizing I'll need more than my teeny tiny mouse sized portion of ketchup to down this food, i asked the server for \"more ketchup please\", to which she hastily responded while walking away: \"you've already got some\". What was she rushing to, you ask? Nothing. The place was quite empty. 

My partner's chicken sandwich looked horrid. Menu said it comes with coleslaw - surprise! Your flavourless coleslaw will be in your burger. The chicken was visibly burnt, dry and flavourless. Why...just why? If you can't make a basic burger, just close up shop and go home. Clearly that's where our server would rather be. 

She ignored us the whole night, FINALLY brought me another mouse sized ketchup portion. I hate her and this place so much. I suggest you ALL visit, only to dine and dash. 

Hard pass."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's our neighborhood bar and I always get exactly what I expect. I disagree with what people say about the food. I LOVE the apple-jack quesadilla as well as the pizzas. The bar has an excellent selection of drinks and the patio is amazing!!! I am happy we have this option in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I love this place, and always have fantastic service. Jennifer the bartender is friendly, and goes above and beyond to make our nights great. Will def be back very soon!"}
{"text":"When I went to England a few years back, I was introduced to the concept of a local - a place where you can go when you want a drink without pretension and is close enough to your house that you can stumble home at the end of the night. I always found that concept charming and I'm glad I've found my own. 

For a standard pub, this place is perfect. It has my favorite beer on tap (Tankhouse) at reasonable prices and the food is passable too. It is large enough that it rarely fills up but always seems to have enough people inside (even on a Monday or Tuesday) to have a good atmosphere. There are TVs throughout the back that are a great place to watch an important hockey game. I saw Crosby score the winning goal here in the 2010 Olympics and it was a very fun time. Finally, the patio in the back, while next to a train track, is a great place to sit in the summer and have a few beers. I'm excited for it to warm up so I can get out there again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately it would appear that The Pour House is going down the same negative and self-destructive path as oh so many pubs we have frequented over the years. We were there tonight, Wednesday Aug 10 2011 after having not been in several months. The service was awful, our waitress forgot to order our appetizer and even after she acknowledged that fact it still took 20 minutes to show up. For onion rings no less! My g/f was already done her veggie burger by the time the rings showed up. Speaking of the veggie burger, it was a sub par effort not even in the class of a Lick's veggie burger and the accompanying fries were soggy. $12.99 for the veggie burger and quality at that level is embarrassing for the venue to say the least. I ordered wings as they were on special at 40 cents each and when I tried to order a dozen was told they have to be ordered in multiples of 5. Well now, that's not 40 cents each now is it? That's 5 for $2. The wings were badly overcooked and whomever prepared them couldn't even be bothered to toss them properly in what was the poorest excuse for hot wing sauce I have ever tasted. There was more of the bland, runny sauce in the bottom of the basket than there was on the wings. For drinks I tried to order a pitcher of Rolling Rock and was told nope, it only comes by the pint. WTF? I'm quite familiar with Rolling Rock and except for the fact that it wasn't particularly cold it was what it was supposed to be. Given the drop in the quality of service and food and the increase in prices from the last time we were there it's a safe bet that we will not be returning and I would hazard a guess that The Pour House will not be open that much longer with things at this level. Unfortunately, I could write an almost identical review of one of our other former fav spots, The Jersey Giant, from a couple of weeks ago. What is wrong with these people? Jack up your prices and let the quality of the food and service slide, yup. That's definitely the best way to stay in business. Sad and if I could I would rate less than 1 star..."}
{"text":"A solid three in my books.
Arrived around eleven with some girls from work and the entire interior was completely empty. We knew we were meeting people on the patio so we marched on, undaunted. We got outside and didn't see our group, but we saw a big staircase.
That's when the magic happens. The upper patio area feels like a tree-house, and it's lovely. 
Crowd somewhat mixed, our group in our mid-twenties, a sketchy 40ish couple, couple groups of suits. 
Service wise, again, A-OK. Our server was friendly, though when one of us wanted to change a drink order about ten seconds after telling her she had already \"sent it down\" via the computer and couldn't make a change.

I'd be back for the patio, can't speak for the food or even the bar-tending skills, cause how do you mess up a vodka soda?"}
{"text":"A good neighbourhood spot for the spontaneous drink you want to have with your Annex buddies. A friend of mine recently moved down the street, and we found ourselves taking in this scene on a Wednesday night. Lucky us, every day there are different specials and on this particular day the special was half-price wine. Our bill was tiny! 

This is not a busy or fancy place. It's a very deep room, so keep going and going if you still can't find your friends. My friend ordered the nuts and thought they tasted a little stale. Just reporting here- I'd like to try the food and judge for myself one day. The selection within the drink menu covered a lot of ground and impressed the beer-lovers at the table. 

Fortunately or unfortunately, there's not much to love or hate about this spot. But that's probably part of it's charm! Ye old faithful."}
{"text":"This place is amazing because it: 1. is close to home! 2. has a great two level patio and 3. makes amazing chicken wings!

The deals are also good. Wednesdays are 40 cent wings! You can get a couple pounds for a full dinner without breaking the bank!  They are just crispy enough, just enough sauce, not to fatty! Perfect! I would even say the best in the city, as I try new wings any place I go. Pour house wins.

The staff are very nice, super helpful, and attentive. I have only had one instance in 5 years in which the girl was really not on the ball, and I had to actually struggle to get her attention.

The one thing different is that the beer is not your typical bar beer. I like, and dislike it. Sometimes I go feeling like a very generic blah brand after a hard day's work. But the staff are normally very good in recommending a type similar to what I crave.

The few things that have changed in the past few years; the pub front.  It used to be old and real irish looking. It was revamped, and I miss the old look! The sweet potato fries. Though, I doubt sweet potato fries could ever be bad, they changed the way they make them now. They are much thinner, and less hearty it seems. They taste the same though.

Anyway, hands down this has been my go to spot in the city.  Not just because it is close to home. That is a bonus. But my sister and I would definitely drag our asses up here from wherever we are, even if not close by in the future!"}
{"text":"This place is great. They used to have $5 appetizers on Tuesday nights (including their chili lime tacos, which are awesome), but I haven't seen them advertised lately.

One of the best patios in Toronto, welcoming place, leaves you feeling wicked. Get a little keg or team pitcher or whatever the hell they're offering these days, and just hang out for a bit. Summers in Toronto is pretty great, but patios like this that you don't expect are the main reason that they're awesome."}
{"text":"This place will do in a pinch, but it's nothing special.

Service is so-so.  They don't really seem to have a good system for greeting / seating / taking orders.  We had three people for the three steps and they didn't appear to communicate with each other.   Our waitress didn't come to help us - she was just passing through our section 10 minutes after we sat down and did a double take - oops, customers!  Guess I'd better talk to them!

The food is not really good.  It's one of those places where if you order the basics (like a burger and fries) you'll be fine.  Everything else is bound to be disappointing.

Beer selection is poor.  Nothing local and of reasonable quality other than Mill St., which is fine but not inspiring beer.

Finally, they cater to students there to drink a lot.  So, if you don't want to share a space with young people drinking pitchers then this isn't for you."}
{"text":"Fair pricing, for decent food. Had the simple burger and a few beers. The live music was great, and the atmosphere was charming. Service was a bit slow to begin with, but picked up very fast, so I cant complain much."}
{"text":"I've been a few times.  Consistently high quality pub food, excellent service, friendly atmosphere.  But tonight blew me away.  I was with a larger group of friends celebrating a birthday.  There was a very minor delay in my order being placed.  It was quickly caught and corrected - no big deal. I was surprised that they not only came back and apologized and gave me my meal for free, they also paid for my soft drinks. Completely unprompted. I was blown away at the level of customer service.  Just as outstanding as the food.  Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"The female bartender, refused to serve me a drink, even though I never asked for one. She indicated I had too much to drink, even though she had just arrived to her shift, nor to mention, if had stayed at the table I was sitting at, her colleague would have continued to serve me alcohol.
1. I, wasn't drunk
2. I never asked her to serve me alcohol.

It was incredibly rude of her to announce that in front of other patrons. I will never come back to this pub, a place that used to be my neighbourhood bar."}
{"text":"Me and my partner had been coming to the Pour House for over 5 years, it was always one of our favourite spots for yummy comfort food, fantastic old world atmosphere, beautiful decor, great music and great service...  Alas they decided to renovate.... and they completely ruined it...  The decor is completely changed, now there's nothing special about it, it looks just the same as any other restaurant downtown.  They used to have dark wood benches, with high backs and mini stained glass accents (gorgeous!  and what made us try it in the first place)  fireplaces, decorative books, as well as lots of Celtic / Irish details.  The music selection was awful (they used to play Classic Rock and Alternative).    It is all gone... in fact you don't feel you are in an Irish Pub at all anymore....

THE SERVICE:  We were greeted fast, but our hostesses weren't  nice or friendly, just a pair of pretentious young girls who showed us to a table... (you used to be able to choose where to sit); our table was nice but the AC was blowing right over our heads and we were freezing pretty much the whole time.... (on a warm day!)    Our server was much nicer but looked stressed... They also got rid of the kilts for the servers which was always a nice touch and added to the atmosphere of the Irish Pub.  

THE MENUS:  are all changed.... they used to have an award winning Cottage pie which was very delicious (the kind that your grandmother would make),  and mushroom and steak pie also amazing, a killer meatloaf (a favourite!), awesome potato skins, and a wide selection of delectable burgers, just to name a few items... Not anymore, none of them.  When we looked at the menu we were not excited about any item in the menu, but were already there, we were starving and we had ordered drinks... so had to order something.   My partner had the Chicken pot pie, which was the closest to what she would have ordered before, it was fine, but not as good....  I had the Chicken Curry, also good.  No complaints about the taste of the food per se.  
Other than those, there was no much we would have wanted.  Also they only have one type of burger now (+ a veggie option).    Coffee was ok.   Water was better than before, I'll give them that.

THE RENOVATIONS:  The bathrooms were in need of renovation for sure... the doors of the stalls and the stalls themselves  needed to be changed, however even with all the \"fancy\" renovations, the bathrooms were barely touched, and the stalls are still the old barely functioning ones.... if they were spending so much on renovations they should have applied the money where it is needed....... As said above they \"modernized\" their look, the beauty of the what the Pour House was is gone, when entering it use to feel as if you were stepping into an Irish Pub in Ireland, it was so inviting.  Now it is just one more restaurant.    We used to come here all the time, as a couple for date night, with our son - they used to have a nice kids menu-, for brunch with friends and for many birthday parties at night....  We won't be coming back, and we need to find a new Irish Pub... So disappointed!"}
{"text":"I basically only come here for the patio(s) - it's great. It's still great after the reno. I actually think the food is decent for typical pub grub. We shared a bunch of apps with no complaints. The service is still friendly and the drinks are tasty. It's a better atmosphere than some of the other overhyped resos on the street."}
{"text":"Pour House is great. What many people don't realize is that there is a giant two level outdoor patio in the back. 

Another tip is that the sweet potato fries are awesome - but if you eat too many you may get sick."}
{"text":"I have always been happy with the food at the Pour house, however, lately i noticed the service going down hill, just a little bit slow to say the least.  My most recent visit really left a bitter taste in my mouth.  
I went for Brunch and ordered the Irish Fry as i always do for brunch when i visit, and as always i ask to substitute the eggs for bacon as i do not eat eggs.  The waitress said no problem.  When my food came i noticed there were no home fries, i told the waitress and she brought them out immediately. No major deal, i just enjoyed my meal.  

When my bill came i noticed an extra $3 charge for a side of peameal bacon. I never asked for additional bacon just a substitute as i have done in the past without a problem.  I was never informed by the waitress that there would be an extra charge either.  I told the waitress about it and she said they cant do substitutions, she brought her manager over to me who was pretty rude and gave me a lecture about that they dont substitute, bacon costs more than eggs etc...i told him i have done this many times in the past without issue, he was very hesitant to believe me.,,also i told him i wasnt informed about it when i ordered..he said he would change it this once, he did so hesitantly.  Its been a long time since i received attitude and rudeness in any type of restaurant or bar.  Common sense would tell you to treat your regular customers nicely but my last visit i felt very belittled and my business unappreciated.

Therefore i will not set foot inside the pour house again nor would i recommend it to anyone.  i'll take my business somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is my neighbourhood pub and while it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of atmosphere - the various food specials are excellent (i.e. half-priced apps on Tuesday, $10 pizza on Wednesday) and the draft beer selection is pretty impressive. 

(Sidenote: it always disappoints me when bars don't use the appropriate the glass or lemon wedge -- my Hoegaarden was served in a regular pint glass without lemon last visit, super disappointing). 

The food will not blow you away (yet it is tasty!) and the service can be ho-hum depending on who you get at your table (but the food does come quickly once you place your order) but it's a great weeknight standby when you are looking for a chill night out with a couple of pals."}
{"text":"I've been here lots but this was my first time since the extensive remodelling and menu revamp. I think they may be piping in the smell of hops because it smells like a microbrewery in here except they don't brew their own beer. Smart idea. 


Very friendly service and a decent selection of beers on tap. I had the burger which was decent but a little on the small side. My buddy has the chicken special and said the same thing. So in conclusion , decent ambiance and beer selection but meh food."}
{"text":"I'm reading through some of these reviews and people point out two major flaws of this restaurant: bad service and mediocre food. I'm my opinion that makes a restaurant 2 stars maximum. How can a restaurant still be considered good with crappy service and food? That is exactly why I give this place 2 stars. 

I'm new to the Avenue/Dupont area and I thought this might be a nice pub to try. When you enter the place it has traditional Irish decor; church-pew-type-wood furnishings, stain glass windows, and Guinness beer accents throughout. I helped myself to a seat as no staff were in sight. I waited 10 minutes or so for service but grew tired and stole a menu from the bar, at which point the bartender must have alerted the waitress. The restaurant is fairly small, so for no one to hear a customer come in must mean no one is really paying attention.  

I ordered a favorite traditional dish, Shepherd's pie. When the dish arrived it had no appeal whatsoever. It was literally a liter of gravy drowning anything within the dish. I couldn't manage to get to the pie without having it slathered in a sea of salty, murky brown gravy. Traditionally the gravy is supposed to be blended with the meat and veg, then covered in potatoes. However this restaurant thought gravy was the main attraction. 

I was sold on Avenue and Dupont having amazing restaurants, but this first time experience was nothing to be desired."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place doesn't have a higher rating. Food was spectacular. Service friendly and prompt. Ambience great... I'd come back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"The Pour House is newly renovated and looks fantastic. The backyard patio is THE place to grab a summer drink so don't miss out. I was here for a late night bite with some friends and ordered the lamb burger with a side of fries.  The housemade pattie was topped with goat cheese and roasted red pepper - delicious! They've really upped their food game.  The burger was $15-16 so pretty on par with other places I've order lamb burgers. I didn't have much to drink but they do have a good selection of beers. My friends went nuts over it and order pitchers of a couple interesting sounding beers. 

If you're in the area, pop in for a drink or a quick bite and check out their new place."}
{"text":"A solid pub for any occasion. The patio is really nice and perfect for hanging with friends or even a date.

The food is definitely 'pub food' but if that's what you're looking for they do a great job.  Nachos are aces and the wings are pretty decent. Service is fast and efficient most of the time, although they do get a bit in the weeds before big games when everyone wants to order and after when everyone is ready to leave. But you can avoid this by not being the twat who arrives and orders right before the game and feels the dire need to leave abruptly afterwards.

Many reasons to return!!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time visiting this pub.  Very nice atmosphere, good beer selection. I ordered a fried chicken sandwich this time, it's not bad! Not as good as the chicken pot pie I ordered last time. Definitely would like to come back."}
{"text":"Great service made for an enjoyable experience!

I must say, when I went to write this review, I was shocked at the overall rating for Pour House. We were there on Friday night, a pretty busy night, and we were a group of 12. In my experience, as soon as you're a group over 6, good service is pretty much is optional, and not to be expected. So, much to our delight, we had outstanding service from Josee, from the moment we arrived until the moment we departed, and everything in between. I mean, off the hook excellent. She was more than pleasant and helpful the entire time, 12 orders all coming out of the kitchen at the same time. Looking after any request without hesitation, and never forgetting. Again, unusually awesome for a large group. And frankly, better service than I'm accustomed to in most higher-end restaurants in Toronto. 

The drinks were terrific as was the food we had. I can't speak for all the food around the table. I had the fish n chips, just the standard fish, and it was excellent. Everything around the table seemed to get consumed pretty readily, so I'm assuming everyone else enjoyed their meal. 

Thank you again for making the end of our day a thoroughly enjoyable one!s"}
{"text":"We had a standing reservation. They knew our group was coming. We have been waiting over 45 min just to order. Our sever had our table and what appears to be the entire patio to cover. Can't blame her. 

By the time our orders were taken they were out of the special, very disappointing. 

When our food arrived, the first person to get their food to the last was a difference of 25 min. 

Our one hour lunch took over 2 hours, if you come here with a group either book off a long time for lunch or just go somewhere else. 

Having said all that the manager on duty compensated us by comping the last meal to come out and gave everyone $10 off when you spend $30."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying that I used to love this place when it was the original unpretentious Dupont pub with the amazing hidden gem of a patio. With the recent renos, this place is now just trying to be something it's not. The ambience is admittedly much nicer, if not a little cliche. However, the menu is overpriced and doesn't live up to expectations. 

We came here for weekend brunch. My friends had the classic breakfast while I got the burger. The breakfast was pretty appalling in terms of portion sizes. What got to me most was the one piece of toast that they serve with it. Never in all my years have I seen a breakfast served with one piece of toast. Very very stingy. The burger was pretty shitty. The bun was so thick you could barely taste what was inside. The prices are also pretty steep for what you receive. 

The only saving grace was the $4 build-your-own Caesar bar which has been in existence since pre-reno days. One of the few remnants of what was once good about this bar. 

Good drink deals, but bad and expensive food. I guess I might check out the patio in the summer for a few drinks but don't even get me started on that breakfast..."}
{"text":"What to say about the Pour House? It's reliable. It's a decent neighborhood place that is also good for bringing your buddies from the University. The beer prices are ok, but be warned, they're steadily going up. The food is well priced, but even for pub grub, the quality is lacking. Great when you've had 3-4 pints and desperately want nachos, but don't order anything sober, that's for sure. The beer choice is also rather lacking, and they have an unhealthy obsession with Keith's and Guinness - the latter actually goes for $8/pint. Ya can't just blame the LLBO for that.

The service is okay. And given that they actively encourage groups, it's funny that they really suck when handling them. They finally started doing individual checks, which is a plus, but it took them literally years to get to this point, and the waitstaff attitude towards groups is obviously negative. You can see them groan when you walk in. 

The last time I went there they started doing live music ... why, G-d, why?! Don't butcher the Beatles, please! And what they did to U2 ... I won't even go there."}
{"text":"The Pour House is basically just your run of the mill vaguely English themed pubs that abound in Toronto.  On that theme, its decent.  Decent choice of beers, decent food, run of the mill decor.  A highlight is their $3 brunch caesars on Sundays.  Other than that, their beer prices are a bit on the pricey side, though not totally ridiculous.

I can definitely see my self coming here if I lived in the area, but won't be making any special trips to visit."}
{"text":"Pour House Pub and Kitchen was really nicely designed inside.  On weekends and holidays, they have a brunch menu which we took advantage of.  Also, the server alerted us to build-your-own Caesars for only $5 which looked really intriguing and fun.  There was a dedicated Caesar counter for this too!

We were seated in a cozy nook in a booth just off the side of their main bar area.  It was a bit warm in there at first but I liked the privacy of the private nook.

I ordered the Smashed Avocado which had two poached eggs, smashed avocado, baby arugula, bacon on a multi-grain toast.  This was a smaller portion than I expected but for the price, it was reasonable.  The 'smashed avocado' was merely avocado spread on the multi-grain toast.  Nevertheless, avocado in any form is ridiculously delicious and this definitely was another example of that.  The two poached eggs were perfectly poached and so soft.  Upon breaking apart the outer layer of the egg, the yolk was still perfectly intact.  The bacon was such a nice touch to the avocado and poached egg toast -- it added a meaty layer of deliciousness to it.  The baby arugula was fresh.

K ordered the Huevos Divorciados which were flour tortillas with sunny side up eggs with spicy black beans, salsa roja, salsa verde, and smashed avocado.  It was served with multi-grain toast, habanero preserves, and farmhouse potatoes.  I tried it and thought it was delicious.  I thought that this could have been a bigger portion too.

Our server was very friendly and chatty and asked us how the rest of our weekend would be spent."}
{"text":"Visited Sat Oct 22 for dinner ( 2 people)

We were very lucky to walk in and get a table, the rest of the tables were reserved. By 8pm the place was packed. Never would have thought a bar in this area would be busy since it's dead outside. 

Pros
Nachos - wow this was the real deal. Tons of cheese and sauce in a rectangular plate. Side of salad included beets and feta cheese. Guac was freshly made in the centre. 

Chicken pot pie - Amazing as well, the crust was a bit thick. The broth was very flavourful and fresh, they really do make it daily.
 
Interesting decor eg edison bulbs over the bar

About 10 beers on tap prominently displayed. 

They were playing baseball and hockey games on the TV's. Jays eliminated for the season already :(


Cons 
Loud and noisy, hard to hear the person beside you. 

Washrooms are all the way downstairs, at some points there was a lineup for the ladies room. 



Protip - They have a private room that can fit up to 20 people. There was a bday inside that day with a giant 25 helium balloon lol
Make reservations in advance!

Damage $35 pre-tax"}
{"text":"Cute little spot in the annex that's great for beer & eats. Came here to grab food before a visit to Casa Loma, and we enjoyed it. It's actually bigger than I expected, it extends quite far in the back. I ordered the black bean burger with fries & the buffalo cauliflower bites. Unfortunately they were out of cauliflower, so that wasn't an option, but the burger was great. It was my first time having a black bean burger, but I've wanted to try it for a while! 
My sister got the fish & chips which looked really delicious, and a bit bigger than your average piece of fish. 
The prices were also very reasonable! Definitely not hard on the wallet. Would return if in the area."}
{"text":"The lamb burger... OMDG!!!!

I liked the set up, decoration, ambience, furniture, service, the pick your area and sit yourself concept, the lighting, the amount of people in the premises, but the best part was the food!

We ordered the Australian Shiraz, and a pear with spinach salad as appetitive. Crunchy spinach accompanied with goat cheese, pear cubes, pomegranate, and a delicate vinaigrette.

Writing about that lamb burger makes me want to go back. The bread was shinny, consistent, resistant and looked like a food prop. The first bite made my eyes big, lifted my eyebrows, made me node in approbation, and sent me to a food nirvana! It was really juicy, tasty would lake meaningfulness... That burger changed my life hahaha, ok no, but it created a memorable experience."}
{"text":"This place is bumping on a Saturday evening with a DJ playing live music. The place is nicely decorating and has a good lively ambiance. The place is actually much bigger than I expected so there was only a slight wait for a table. In terms of drinks, they have a great cocktail menu, but the beer selection is underwhelming and a bit too geriatric hipster for my liking. They have a unique take on a lot of classic cocktails, and they are made well which is a plus. The beer selection is the embodiment of a hipster with a beard that uses his bike to get around the city. It didn't make sense to me at all. 

I had the chicken pot pie, and it was very disappointing. My pie was quite literally black because it was burnt and eating the crust honestly felt like chewing on chalk. Additionally, there were only a few pieces of chicken in the actual pie, and it was mostly broth and vegetables. The side salad that came with the pie was very good though, and the greens were fresh. Overall, the service and the cocktails were great, but I don't think I'll be coming back here because of the disappointing food."}
{"text":"Food wasn't great, slow service and when we were served it seemed as though we were being rushed through our meal to get the next customers in... Beer selection was great though and that's the only reason for the stars!"}
{"text":"Great tavern, with excellent food, service and plenty of tables.
You must try the sweet potato fries and Guinness Steak & kidney stew."}
{"text":"Food was quite good however I found the portions were small for the price. The service was great though! Also you cannot go wrong with the daily drink deals- great prices there! Will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good pub. The dark wood makes it feel authentic and cozy. Food is decent enough. Hidden patio is great in the summer. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Ok. They got a crappy review previously but their sweet potato fries (served with a spicy-chipotle sauce) are TOO GOOD to ignore. I went back and had a huge plate.
The Big Smoky burger was decent but it didn't really taste all that different - despite the specialty toppings - from a regular bacon cheeseburger. On the whole, a solid meal."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place and the food is not bad.  I like the atmosphere inside, as well as the patio in the summer.  The patio is awesome.  But I had a bad experience there a few nights ago.  My boyfriend and I went to eat and halfway through eating his hamburger, he realized the inside was pink and uncooked.  He returned it and they gave him back his burger (still with bite marks) cooked fully this time.  He continued to eat his burger and within an hour he was sick at home.  I don't think I'll be eating here again in the future."}
{"text":"A REALLY COOL industrial warehouse type Irish pub. Was surprised by how sleek and modern all the design was. Beautiful bar. Stellar brunch with a great bloody mary bar. They show English Premier League. Really friendly bartender who made us feel at home. A decent selection of taps and live music several nights of the week. Worth checking out. Not a traditional Irish pub, but still had decent Guinness."}
{"text":"Huge menu, lots available. I have been there twice in the last week simply because I was stuck in that area, and the food and service were fine.
What did we have? Onion rings - delicious, and they give you a lot
Ceasar salad - this was a very acceptable ceasar according to the standard recipe. very good
Curry chicken - not spicy but still good, and they give you lots of food!
I wouldn't make a point to go out of my way to go there, but if I'm in the hood, I'll head back. I am especially interested in the weekend brunch bloody mary bar!"}
{"text":"A GEM OF A PATIO!

A few blocks North of it's Pubby/Patio cousins, The Pour House is a great meeting place for after-work, late-night or Happy Hour libations and eats.

Whilst most Torontonians frequent Pauper's, The Brunswick House or The Madison when in The Annex, if you just go a bit further North to Dupont, you'll be pleasantly surprised.

As my fellow Yelpers have written, there are great Specials each day of the week, but where I'll wholeheartedly differ is in my opinion of the décor. I think it's got great character and nooks all throughout it's main level in the classic Irish Pub style, and the patio is superb. I will agree that the service could be improved, but like most pubs, you get what you pay for.

The beauty of The Pour House is that it's great come summer, or come winter. You'll be cosy on the patio, or cosy in the Pub. Slainte!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little pub in the north of the Annex that has been here for many years. Nice large patio in the back for the warmer months, and an excellent winter time hangout as well. Good selection of draughts and spirits, and a well rounded menu as well"}
{"text":"Ce to this place a few times before the refurb , I'm Irish I know the Craic! ..... A really good spot. Got on it"}
{"text":"Came here after a friend's birthday dodgeball tournament event to watch the Final Four. The interior is really cool with the hanging lights and ropes - kind of reminds me of something pirate-themed.

Glad they were able to make reservations the day-of, on such short notice, but the conversation was a little bit weird. We had a group of around 10, and we wanted to call ahead to ensure we could get a spot, but the person on the other end of the phone was a little wishy-washy (\"Well I don't know what it's going to be like then... Not sure if we're going to have spot... You can just come in and see... Actually, just come in I'm sure we'll figure something out...\"). 

Any way, we managed to get a table and it was right by the TV, which was fantastic. The drinks were a great price and the extra spicy Caesar I got was really, indeed spicy! It was great. We also ordered some appies; nachos for the table (which were a decent portion), a side of tater tots that were alright, some friends ordered the smashed avocado and bean burger which looked good. There was one curry dish on the menu that was also ordered, and that was an extremely small portion.. and barely any chicken too! This was a let-down. He ended up having to order another main (and it wasn't cheap).

It was quite packed by the time we left around 8 or 9. I'd say if you're coming in just for drinks then it's a great spot, but the food can be a hit or miss!"}
{"text":"This bar has become a regular spot for me and my softball mates during the spring and summer months and last night, on a cold winter night, I was reminded of why it continues to be our after-game meal year after year. You can't go wrong with 50-cent wings nearly the size of chicken drumsticks. I struggled to eat five. Try the honey hot flavour. You won't regret it. I also really love their fries. Pizza is delicious on an empty stomach. Would've given this review a four if we were sitting on the patio. Love the lighting out there and the relaxed atmosphere. Inside always feels a tad cramped."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday night and had shrimp pitas. It was decent. They have a nice patio which was pretty full that night. I enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"You know, I could live in the Annex mainly because of the Pour House.  While it's not the greatest of Gastropubs (well, it's not even a gastropub at all, of course, whatever those are anyhow), it's just a great little place to unwind over a few pints... and they have an alright menu - at least of appetizers/finger foods that complement libations.  I was introduced to this place by a friend of mine who lives in the neighbourhood and wasn't disappointed, it just feels like a good spot.

I don't get the service issues some people raise - I've never seen anything about the service that disappointed me personally - quick and friendly every time I've been."}
{"text":"Another in the chain of Irish-style pubs, the Pour House stands virtually alone as the sole pub in the surrounding neighbourhood.  It's one of the other franchises of pubs such as the Foggy Dew (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/foggy-dew-irish-pub-toronto), the Pogue Mahone (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pogue-mahone-irish-pub-toronto) and Murphy's Law (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/murphys-law-irish-pub-toronto), so it's easy to settle in as you've most probably seen this before.

The menu is consistent, the servers are garbed in the schoolgirl tartan synonymous with the chain, you can get a Guinness, and the food comes hot (unless it's a salad) and as good as any other of the franchised pubs.  It's consistent with the theme and that's fine. It's got WiFi available and an outside patio that has a fantastic view of the city.

If you lived in the neighbourhood or happened to be passing through nearby, I'd totally recommend this place.  If not, there's nothing here that you can't find elsewhere in the city.  Most likely you'll find it at one of the other franchises."}
{"text":"In one word? Basic. Replacement words: Mediocre. Overpriced. Pretentious. Walk further. Go to Rose and Sons. Big Crow. Heck...even Subway sandwiches."}
{"text":"The Pour House Irish Pub is a classic place for beers and food.

The interior is dark, and the decor somewhat tired. There is a variety of seating- high/low, benches/bar stools, and inside/patio. The patio is nice during the 3 months a year when it is warm enough to sit out there.

The food here is standard, solid pub food. The burgers are good, and while most things probably come off a truck, they are not that bad. The cheesecake, while straight from a box, is actually quite good.

While there are similar places all around town, this pub fills a niche in the neighbourhood where you can feel comfortable meeting friends after work for a beer or meal without spending a fortune.

Service here is average. The servers seem well prepared to not take any shit from anyone, but do a decent job."}
{"text":"Really bad service -  slow and unattentive. 
Bad food - not much flavour and when we got our food it was cold
Rip off - bought the Friday special. Fish and chips. Bill came back and they charged us regular price. Asked them to fix it and they said ok but came back and gave us the wrong amount still. Didn't bother arguing it anymore and instead will give them this bad review."}
{"text":"Love this joint!

In April I celebrated my birthday here for the second year in a row.  So glad I did!  Last year it was a regular neighbourhood Irish Pub and this year it was a beautifully-decorated hipster joint (fan of the interior design not hipsters). 

Everything was perfect which is hard to pull off when you are talking about service for a group of 30 people. The waitress was fantastic  (a bit eager I'd even say) and the food was great. Loved the atmosphere. The DJ who played on the Saturday night in the last weekend of April was dope. 

Everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves! Thanks to the manager who ensured that everything went smoothly.

Will be back for more intimate drinking. This place is a jewel.

P.s. Bring back the Harp beer!"}
{"text":"The venue- clean and comfortable..  The patio is quaint, but a neighbouring place was smoking something/ burning wood and it made it hard to breathe (not the restaurants fault) 

The beer menu was inaccurate- please don't advertise beers if you are going to be carrying them but don't have them yet.  Also the servers should know what they do and don't have before someone places an order-- ours took our beer order and came back with 1 beer, 10 minutes later she came back and said that the beer I ordered is new, and they don't actually have it in their establishment yet... So I ordered a different kind-- another 7-10 minutes passed before she came back with it...    I was really disappointed with that, because it meant that the first beer ordered by my boyfriend was getting warm already...."}
{"text":"Been coming here for brunch for the past few weeks.  Discovered this place after an acting classmate invited us here after class one day.

There is a sign outside advertising build your own caesar bar for $2.99.  Good deal if you like caesars (basically mott's clamato juice with fixings).  I think this is only good on weekends.

We usually get the eggs breakfast or pancakes.  The other day, the waiter allowed us to substitute the home fries and toast from the 'weekend breakfast' for a multi-grain pancake with syrup.  I thought that was really nice of them.  Maybe it helped that my friend was super cute.  Their menu is online on their website.

That day, we sat at a table and chair that was wobbly, but other than that no complaints here.  Recommended for breakfast and amazing pancakes if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We gave Pour House another shot for brunch on a weekend. The place has such potential and friendly staff. 

My friend ordered eggs and the server asked how he would like them cooked. Between the server and my friend, they reaffirmed about 3 different ways that he'd like fried eggs over hard. The eggs that arrived were soooo undercooked that the white was still clear. They were visibly sloshing around the plate. The server didn't seem to notice. 

I'm not one to send things back but these weren't edible. My friend didn't want to cause any issue so he ate them and didn't say anything. 

Come on PH - pay attention and get it right!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out for drinks before dinner with a friend. I was hopeful as it seemed this place had mixed reviews. 

I inquired about the special on the \"family pint\" for Keith's for 5$ on Saturdays and they confirmed they no longer offer this \"special\" when it is on their website and menu. Disappointed to say the least. 

I opted for the Leffe Blonde and again was disappointed. It was flat and not cold at all, they had trouble with foam and took longer than normal to receive my drink. I always have this drink at Bier Markt so I expected the same \"quality\". Also, I had to inquire about my drink more than once because it was sitting at the bar for awhile.

After receiving the bill, we paid in cash and received $3.00 back but not the rest of the change. I haven't been to any restaurant that keeps \"change\" from their customer. I would not come back as the overall environment was not very appealing to be honest. 

I don't recommend coming here and I am thankful I didn't try the food here as I checked out the reviews after and was relieved I didn't waste my money on this place."}
{"text":"Gotta love The Pour House! 

I cannot talk about the food because I have yet to eat there. 

When it comes to drinks, it really hits the spot! The watermelon mojito is absolutely delicious and they have very good speciality cocktails. Would recommend talking to the bartender and let them make you a unique drink based on what you like!

The decor is awesome and the staff is friendly. The Pour House is my favourite pub located in the annex!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and the service was good. Enjoyed my weekend night here with some friends, would definitely return."}
{"text":"tiny portion, worse-than-homemade quality food (too salty, wonderbread quality bread for sandwiches), pricey bill. I would not come back"}
{"text":"We won tickets to their annual Robbie Burns dinner and it was our first visit to The Pour House. I have read other reviews that say they prefer the more traditional Irish Pub feel which they had pre-renovations. I have nothing to compare to, though I have to say the place is BEAUTIFUL!!! Great decor, great vibe, very trendy::))
Because I was there for an event and didnt order off the regular menu, I cant comment on the regular food, though I can say the five course Robbie Burns dinner was DELICIOUS::))!!! We look forward to coming back for some live music, drinks and food, and in the summer to enjoy their patio. The manager and staff were also super friendly and accommodating!! Great place!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"4 Stars for the Patio. 3 stars for everything else. 

VIBE 
Dark and wooden. Very Irish. This may well be akin to what I look for in a man. And yes, a Jon Hamm look-alike came into our presence that very night. I won't go into specifics but it's probably not a good sign when two women are looking at you with jaws dropped giving you the \"Whaaa\" sign because there are not that many men in this city that are *that* good looking. I digress. 

This bar is LONG. Read: it's about 2 km to get to the back patio, which is well worth it. 
The upper patio seems equally as lovely and I'm a big fan of the string of lights and tropical mural on the back wall. Music is blaring but not overbearing (Minus the one Marilyn Manson-esque type song they played). The garbage truck sound didn't help either but a minor note. 

WE DRANK/ATE 
This is the disappointment. No Heineken. Not a lot of imports. 
Bar crawl partner had the Mill Street Tank House Ale --not her style and she realized it too late. 
I decided to try cider and had the Thornburys. It was way too sweet. I think this is the first time I've left a bar not fully drinking a drink! 

The service has a bit of an \"in and out\" attitude to the point that our server almost took my bottle when there was still alcohol in it. Ugh. 

The sweet potato fries were delish and a perfect snack to share. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Great patio. Laid back vibe. Great for groups (there were two big groups next to us).  You may or may not see a Jon Hamm look-a-like. He's out there. Somewhere.  PS Bring cash or credit. Debit machine in the front."}
{"text":"The Pour House is renovated and looks great! Much cleaner and more modern. Menu had been seriously upgraded as has the beer list. I enjoyed my halibut fish and chips and plan to return for some of the other tasty sounding dishes. I often walk over to the area for dinner but it's usually hard to get in to some of the neighbouring spots. The Pour House is definitely now a good alternative to trendier spots especially if you appreciate good beer and a lively clientele."}
{"text":"The ceiling was dripping on my friend. We moved and then the waitress put out a caution sign under where the wet spot was. Shortly after the place got busier and the sign was removed and a new table was seated under the dripping ceiling. There were a series of order mistakes that followed. Not a great value for your money considering the experience."}
{"text":"Rude, rude, rude service! Ugh.

Popped in here on Friday evening for a late drink. The place was EMPTY...maybe 3 tables of patrons in total. 

We ordered a drink each and were finished about 30 mins later. The server asked if we wanted another round and when we declined, she had the audacity to say \"WELL THEN, you are going to have to leave. We don't allow people to stay without ordering more\"

What a beyatch! No one else was even in the pub, I can hardly see the need to be so rude. 

Anyway, what kind of pub is empty at midnight on a Friday night? Pass"}
{"text":"The food was alright. Nothing worth writing about. The service was terrible! I still didn't have my food when most people in my group were finishing their meals. It was only a veggie burger and I wasn't even the only one eating one. I guess they just forgot to make it. Also we were served dirty water glasses - really really dirty."}
{"text":"Local watering hole does a log-cabin, rope lights hipster re-brand with new foodie menu.

Despite my soft spot (patio area is one of my fav summer spots), I have to adjudicate the food fairly. This spot is in tough, neighbouring two of Rose's spots (to be honest we only ended up eating here because of Rose & Sons'/Black Crow's wonky hours). The food game on the Dupont strip is fierce and Pour House doesn't keep up. 

Got the brooklyn hipster style fish tacos and pork taco. Bleh OK. Fish taco was the best thing we had, it was dece (again... we're competing directly with two FIRE Mexican spots down the street). Nice piece of what I think was Talapia some cilantro, avocado, decently fresh tasting... nothing spectacular. Also got the poutine trio, the wild boar was enticing (I've had some really nice boar dishes before) this was totally mediocre. Fries were pretty bland, kinda stale... you can get much better poutine from a truck on front st. 

Service was great and friendly as always... cool hip chairs and they've kept the TVs (I think a smart call). Not sure why every new reno has to be in the spirit of the same lumineers music video, I guess it's aesthetic, it's getting old tho. 

$3 shots for you drinkers, I think this spot is going to stick as more of a bar than a restaurant, which I think will be perfectly fine for us dupont strippers."}
{"text":"What better than having a beer out on a patio on nice evening before dinner??  Pour House Irish Pub is a good choice if you are in the neighbourhood.

I doubt I would have stay if I am going to have a drink inside at the bar or the dining area as it is just so dark, depressing.... but when I walked to the back patio, I know I am staying for a drink.

1/2 pint Guinness $5 tax in for sure is not a deal...but having a drink and enjoying the summer breeze is priceless.. :)

Where is my Yelp Drinking Buddy? He was  just taking his sweet time and missed all the fun!!"}
{"text":"Mostly mill street on draft, but other local crafty options in can/bottle form. 

The service was decent. 

I had the burger and fries. 
The food was okay. 

Should attend on thursday...
 one bourbon, one scotch, one beer = ten bucks. 
woah."}
{"text":"A large open space that is great for groups but feels a little impersonal.  I liked the live music."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, but I have been here a few times and I am never overly impressed with the food. Stick with pub food basics and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's got a nice old churchy feel with lots of dark wood, and it also has the typical trappings we in North America have become accustomed to in the last 10 or so years from a Coprorate Craic House. I have actually taken my mother here on numerous occasions for brunch and typically the food is good and the service isn't bad. The last few times I have been here though I notice that the service is really slipping. As a frequent pub goer perhaps I am spoiled by other neighborhood bars where the server will frequently check on you. This past weekend spent 90 minutes having brunch that should have taken no more than 30 minutes. It was busy and we were on the patio but our order was quite simple, 2 coffees, Scrambled Eggs and Pancakes. It took us 30 minutes just to get coffee. It is comparable in pricing to other franchise pubs and the selection of beer is similar, lots of Diageo group and Labatt and Molson products, very few if any craft beers on tap.I am not quite sure why the service was so bad, perhaps understaffing, perhaps just a screw up or lack of communication between the hostess and our server. I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Live in the area and was excited about renovation. Went to Pourhouse in undergrad and loved it. Good beer, grungy, good live music.

Renovation increased prices, reduced quality and made it very unfriendly to vegetarians. Food was awful. Beer selection was mediocre. Tried an expensive mixed drink that was terrible.

Not worth prices. trying too hard"}
