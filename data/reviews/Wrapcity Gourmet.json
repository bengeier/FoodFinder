{"text":"Wow, $13 for a 'panini' that is just a sub roll. I'd expect a sandwich from a claimed gourmet place to at least know which bread is which. Tastes great but not worth $13 to have lunch and still be hungry. One to avoid"}
{"text":"Not worth the hype! Wraps are tiny and bland! Overpriced cafeteria food. Not \"gourmet\" as it is described."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or relaxing with some coffee. Their is great house music playing and you get a trendy New York feel when you're there. 
The wraps are very good and the prices are very reasonable but don't get the combos cuz they are not worth it. 
I will definitely return here."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Friendly staff, food was well made, and they put it together very quickly after ordering. The lack of english on the menu was a bit of a stumbling block but the cashier was more than happy enough to recommend something. (Edit: I have since discovered that they have an english placemat menu!)

Price is exactly what you would expect for a wrap in this city. I agree that the combo hardly seems worth it, but if you need something clean, healthy, and fast, this is a good option."}
{"text":"I love this place in the morning! They serve delicious breakfast wraps and bagels and probably the best London Fog in town.The staff is very accommodating, if there are certain things you want/don't want in your order, they take the time to listen and explain what other options are available. Finally, the music is wonderful - nothing better than sipping your morning coffee to the tunes of Sinatra."}
{"text":"Straight and to the point--- This place is extremely expensive ($3 for a bagel and cream cheese???), the staff are a bunch of slow moving \"bros\" who got chin strap facial hair and more product in their hair than in their store. We ordered 2 bagels with cream cheese. Waited about 15mins for a cream cheese bagel?????? Skimped on the cheese big time and messed up one of bagels. .....don't go there. It wasn't busy, so NO that isn't an excuse."}
{"text":"Decent cheap fresh wraps with good flavour combinations-def several cuts above subway. They also off 1 veggie wrap, salads, light desserts, coffee, beer and wine. This WOULD be a solid 3-4 stars if it weren't for the weird service and atmosphere. When I went for a quick take out sandwich the place had about 4-5 all male patrons, mostly drinking beer and using the Internet. I ended up waiting about 10 minutes to get my sandwich because the guy at the cash had been calling out to me (an almost 30 year old woman) \"hey sweetie\" and I didn't even realize he was talking to me-this was more patronizing than friendly. I just felt like my entire 10 minute wait I was intruding on the dudes hanging out in there. Plus, my 1 biscotti cost 5$?!?!"}
{"text":"Great wrap, salad and soup selections. The restaurant is also a great place to watch people go by."}
{"text":"Husband and I popped in to Wrapcity twice for breakfast during our trip to Montreal. It was conveniently right down the street from our hotel.

The first visit we both got an iced hazlenut latte and a breakfast sandwich on a bagel. It was the perfect size and the egg was cooked perfectly- a little runny, not overdone. Lattes were tasty.

Our second visit, I ordered a spinach omlette (looked like a limited time special) with another iced hazlenut latte while husband had another breakfast bagel sandwich. My latte was a little bitter- maybe the shot had been pulled too quickly? The fruit that came with the omlette was a little meh. I ate about half.

The guy behind the counter welcomed us back on our second visit- he was great! You order and they bring your food out. The atmosphere was clean and trendy. The English translation is on the printed menu. Our friend behind the counter helped us out there. We'd probably go back if we were in town again!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop in downtown Montreal.

It can be hard to find something inexpensive to eat in the heart of downtown Montreal but luckily I ran into this place for dinner. We tried the Austin wrap and the Cordon Bleu wrap and they were both delicious!  The service was quick and it was nice to see that they also serve alcohol. The next time I come to Montreal I'll definitely come back.

Oh and I realized after I ate here of the name (Wrapcity = Rhapsody)."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here recently.  Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with my experience.

I ordered the WCG Salad ($11.50) and a passion fruit smoothie with milk $5.15 (smoothies are $4.65 but you have to + $0.50 if you want milk in it).  My husband had the Thanksgiving Wrap (regular size $6.50) and a glass of orange juice $3.95.  

Now we ate in, so I was fully expecting them to make my salad fresh. What I got was one of the pre-packaged salads from the takeout fridge.  This left me very disappointed.  The salad was described as \"mixed greens, black forest ham, Canadian maple smoked turkey, Danish blue cheese, grape tomatoes, English cucumbers, and dried cranberries.\"  I expected real turkey, but it was in fact deli-meat turkey and not too much of it for that matter.  The salad dressing was a bag of Renee's balsamic vinaigrette.  Really?  For a place that has the word \"Gourmet\" in its name, I expected better.  The salad itself tasted ok.  The ingredients were fresh.  However, it did not taste like a gourmet salad.  It tasted like something I could make myself very easily and quickly at home. 

The passion fruit smoothie was delicious though.  It had a strong passion fruit flavour and it was blended smoothly (no chunks of ice).  It wasn't too sweet nor too sour.

My husband's wrap was described as \"spinach artichoke sauce, hand made maple smoked turkey breast, asiago cheese, shredded carrots, leaf lettuce, and tomatoes.\"  The turkey, like in my salad was also deli-meat.  He seemed to like his wrap.  He said his orange juice was also good and didn't taste like it was made from concentrate.

The place is nice and clean and service was good.

I don't know, maybe my expectations were too high, but I expected more from this place."}
{"text":"It seems people have very low standards of what a good wrap should be. This place is all flare and presentation without any substance. Cutting corners and skimping in the most important place- the food- does not a successful business make. I have no doubt that the owners know they are getting away with packing their wraps with cheap filler (lettuce, tomato) and putting a minimal amount of meat in there.  

I had the pulled pork wrap and there was barely any pork in it- just a sliver. The volume of the wrap comes from lettuce and the pork is hardly even visible. This is a disgrace regardless of the prices they charge. My friend's chicken wrap was the same. This kind of typical short sighted approach is a cancer for any business. Owners try to save a few dollars by getting away with the minimum. It is cheap and disappointing- furthermore it takes the customer as a fool. Granted, most people are not discerning but those that have been exposed to the many options in North America  and businesses that value their customers are discriminating enough to see immediately that these wraps are a scam. They are unsubstantial and over-priced and worst of all, the owners know it and don't care because as long as people buy they don't have to offer any value. I won't be back and I'll be sure to tell everyone I know not to waste their time and money. Restaurants don't deserve success when they short change their customers and take them for idiots. Put some substance in the wraps and take some pride in your business.  I am sorry to say, places like this are a stain on the Montreal food scene. Get out and travel and you'll see you this kind of product wouldn't be acceptable anywhere else. If the owners know anything about food and have ever left Montreal, they know exactly what I am talking about but are counting on the ignorance of their customers."}
{"text":"I've grown to like this place. It's a decent coffee shop. Plenty of place, pleasant ambiance music, and great service.

Initially, I wasn't that crazy about it. The food seemed a bit expensive for the portions and nothing jumped out at me when looking at the menu. 

Now that I've tried a bit more of their food and drinks, I'm a total fan of this place!"}
{"text":"Wrapcity is the first restaurent I went to when I moved to Montreal, so there is no doubt that it has a emotional impact on me :p, nevertheless they serve really good wraps that are made and ready to eat very quickly. Ideal to grab a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great wraps, salads, soups and smoothies! This place is perfect to enjoy a quick lunch between classes (it's close to both Concordia and McGill) or to study while sipping on a cup of coffee or tea. The wi-fi is faster and the food is healthier than in the closest Starbucks, the staff is very accommodating (I asked if they could change the ingredients of one of the wraps to make it vegan) and the place is never too crowded or too noisy. I definitely recommend their drinks, the Blueberry Açai smoothie is the best one I've had in a while and the price was definitely more than reasonable."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's near my place which is convenient. I find the staff friendly and the food to be good. I always like the soup selections at lunch time and the wraps are good. The place also has a nice view and some cozy chairs inside which is good for relaxing. There's also a nice relaxing atmosphere inside with the jazzy ambient music in the background. 

This coffee shop is one of my faves for snacking and reading a nice book. There's also free WiFi here if you wanna browse on the internet. If you check in on their facebook page with your account, you can get a free cup of coffee which is great. 

Some come check out this place!"}
{"text":"Un peu déçu. 14$ pour un wrap, une bouteille d'eau et un muffin, c'est assez cher. 

Le wrap Kansas City était bon mais rien ne venait avec, même pas une petite salade. Le muffin était sec et peu coûteux."}
{"text":"Had lunch here twice...the wraps are great. Good coffee and desserts, but most of all I'm about service and the service is excellent. Until next time!"}
{"text":"Comfortable urban setting, but you might share a long table with an elongated single cushion.

Friendly service.

The wraps are delicious, and filling for most people. But the combo ($2.99 for coffee and tiny salad) does not seem worth the upgrade.

Decent ambience, if the university crowd is being considerate."}
{"text":"Yummy and reasonably priced. This place is also very modern inside, so although it is cheap, it can still serve as the setting of a very pleasant dinner. I got the Chicken Cordon Bleu wrap which was juicy, flavorful, and perfectly toasted! They even brand the wraps with their logo - cute!"}
{"text":"OK ... sorry to hear that Tony's review down below, who has some sort of issue with \"bros\", and thinks that $3 is expensive to be served a bagel and cream cheese in a classy environment, while watching flat screen TVs in the heart of a metropolitan city . . . . get a grip man.  I've been to place at least 5 times and tried several of the wraps ... all excellent.  The soups are also good.  The coffee is only \"OK\" but if you like the flavoured syrup - you're in heaven.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover it is licensed for booze - another plus.
I just tee'd up a first date, and am on my way there now.  
Nice and flexible if we want to snack, eat, just coffee or grab a drink.  Msg me if you're curious how this one went lol.
Cheers!
Rob"}
{"text":"Open late, and a nice place to just chill by the window (overlooking from a second floor from the street), and enjoy a great cup of tea and a biscotti.  

I came in here after strolling around near my hotel and wanting to relax, but not stay in my hotel room doing so.  The service is extraordinarily friendly and kind. 

The biscottis are gigantic!  And they heat them up before they bring them to you.  I got the pistachio one  and it was ok.  Too much white chocolate, which I have taken a liking to recently, but was wanting something more nutty.  It's not to say it was bad, but just not what I was craving for the moment.  They also have a cappuccino one and a double chocolate one that both looked yummy if you're itching for a chocolate fix.

The seats are comfortable, and I spent around an hour here.. through about 11:30pm.  It's not loud, even though they have TVs on with it turned to the sports channel.  It's mostly people who are on their own studying, or working.  It's close enough to McGill University, too - and nice that it's open late for being in the downtown area.  I think midnight?"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the view of the street from a comfy pea-green chair while munching on a delightful cordon bleu wrap.  I guess they use some sort of panini grill to seal these wraps tight, and said grill has a \"wrap city\" logo on it!  Cute."}
