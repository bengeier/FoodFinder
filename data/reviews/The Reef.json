{"text":"What a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon belly up to the bar.

Wings are amazing....you can mix wings and drums or just wings or just drums....then there is a smorgasboard of flavors!

Two thumbs up for Spricy Ranch!

Kudos to Shelly the local mixologist - we shall return."}
{"text":"This is a dive bar people!
If you consider yourself a respectable human being, you may not enjoy this place.
Get over it, its a dive bar.
The wings are great, they serve cheap shitty beer, and unless you want to wake up with a splitting headache, don't drink from the taps.
If you love wings, and are picky, order them to go, because you will not enjoy the 'ambiance'.
ITS A DIVE BAR!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Reef since 2008(The Drafthouse). Love the food and the drinks are bomb. I do not like partying in Scottsdale because of the fake, I am too stuck up to talk to you people. This is a down home place that you can chill, eat, watch a game, and even party if that is your thing.  My recommendation is the Spicy Ranch Wings..........followed by an amf (aLCOHOLIC BEVERAGE)."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night to celebrate my bday with some friends. I couldn't beat the cheap well drinks for happy hour 9-11pm ($3). The Dj played every song asked (hip hop music). 

If you know how to have a good time and like hip hop go out on a Saturday, save money by buying well drinks. If you want others to have fun for you, go somewhere where there's a huge crowd and possibly a cover charge. Just saying, you are what you make of your own experience. ;)"}
{"text":"I'm giving three stars because the place has AWESOME wings. I won't lie. That's all I go here for. 
I came in tonight to have wings and fries. Simple order. We ordered within 10 minutes of walking in, got our drinks, and waited for our order. The waitress should probably write things down because she immediately forgot what kind of sauce we wanted on our wings and had to come back to ask. 
 45 MINUTES later and it still wasn't ready to come out. Our waitress checked up on us twice asking \"how's it going?\" CLEARLY it would be a lot better if we had gotten our food. We are just sitting there... Waiting. 
Waited another 5 minutes, now 50 minutes in total and just decided to leave because it was a ridiculous amount of wait time. 
Go when it's not busy. Otherwise you'll be waiting over an hour for 12 wings."}
{"text":"Maybe because it's a Sunday or a brand new menu but service was extremely slow!  Server was a nice lady. However there were literally 3 other customers in the bar.   Food is average. Your typical bar food.  Very selected ( burger, grilled ham and cheese) however beer is cheap and cold!!!! Just order 2 at time cause it may take a while to get that second drink!"}
{"text":"Used to be great food and service. Beer bottle smelled like fish, wasn't cold. Food was terrible and waitress was high or drunk. Not surprising place only had 5 other people there and the bar/restaurant across Warner was packed.

You were not packed when we were there. I definitely do not work in a bar. Anything kept in a dirty, warm cooler will have a bad smell."}
{"text":"The food is good and wings are excellent. Tuesday is discount wing day and you can get rubs and sauces. For example garlic, lime and coconut, flavored wings. There is also a sandwich on special six days a week, I really like the turkey, bacon and chedder sandwich. Service is not great as is usually the case with small sports bars. They often play the music way to loud. I believe music in a sports bar should never impede conversation. I am there for the bar poker, which is usually more like bingo. I live a few minutes away and they pay $50 for first and give electronic gift cards for 2nd and third. They have bar bingo (poker) there six days a week. They have raised there beer prices to help cover their cost of bringing in poker. I like AmberBock and they charge the same price as if you were buying a kilt lifter.....$7.95 regular price for 28oz  large mug. About three months ago I could get a large mug of Amber on happy hour for $4 bucks and now it is $5.75 needless to say I don't buy beer there anymore. They have four pool tables and room to use them. They have OTB and fri and sat night dancing."}
{"text":"New owners took over this place a little over a week ago and they know what customer service is all about..it's refreshing to stop in and find the owner mingling with their customers and making sure they are enjoying themselves and asking for suggestions on how to make the place a better experience.
The food is amazing,especially the wings..
If you haven't been there lately it deserves another look, with the new owners you will be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I go to The reef two times a month on Friday nights. The parmesan garlic wings are my favorite and the fish fry is a good choice as well. The staff is always friendly and on top of things. The live music on Friday nights is real good too. Not too loud and a fun mix of old & new rock blues & Motown."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to go there all the time in the early afternoon when it was the Draft House, always got great service.  Then it really went hip hop and ghetto.   Would never think of going at night.   Even in the day we had to sit and listen to the Juke box play itself every 5 minutes with hip hop trash.
Got so we couldn't take it so we stopped going,  even though the bartender mgr  if she is still there is very special to us.  Have not been there in some time.    Hip hop ruined what was supposed to be a sports bar.
The wings were great, and the fish tacos, thus the 2 stars."}
{"text":"Great prices on food and drinks.  Great live music.  No Cab, only Merlot."}
{"text":"Large sports bar with great bar food. TV's galore and friendly tenders. Great selection of beer on tap and of course mixed drinks. Best part it's well    AIR CONDITIONED !"}
{"text":"So came here one Friday evening and found out they had \"the hottest wings in Arizona\" according to their menu. That was what they said about their \"donkey hot\" wings. Not sure what the waitress was referring to when she said that the statement referred to the \"competition version\" of the sauce. Whatever the case I tried the wings - they went down ok but I felt the burn in my stomach as it churned hours later. I wanna say it's at the level of Teakwoods but I had lunch at an Asian place earlier that already gave me a kick in the gut (so to speak) so maybe it was the wrong night to do a challenge like that anyway. Came again for their Monday Night Karaoke. I saw the sign advertising it in the bar on Friday and it sounded like a blast. Not many places around here do an actual Karaoke show on Monday and this one was lots of fun - an energetic crowd clapping along. Had the Monday Night special which was the French Dip sandwich - it was good. Some folks I was with swear by the garlic fries - will have to investigate in the future. They have both Summer Shandy and Blue Moon on tap so they have that going for them. Place also has Off Track Betting, darts, a bunch of pool tables, and poker. On the weekends they sometimes have live bands and it becomes a hip hop club after 9pm. A little something for everyone. A little divey but that's part of the charm. Will definitely return. Lots of parking as it shares the retro 70's Vegas cheesy neon light looking Palm Court Centre with a number of other businesses like Hoosier Cafe, International Minute Press, Pho VIetnam, Hookah Lounge, Farmer's Insurance, Jimmy Nails Spa, Drastic Changes Tattoo Studio, Massage 90210, Up In Smoke Shop, Papa Joe's Barber Shop, Desert Spinal Care, and Cuts For Pups."}
{"text":"I went to see my friend's band play - Bench Warrant.  I used to go to the draft house a lot after work, and always liked it.  I walked in, found a seat, and was promptly greeted and had a delicious beer in my hand within a few short minutes.  I decided to order a snack, and ordered the mix of onion rings, carrots, cheese sticks, etc.  It was delicious - especially the onion rings!  I do miss the beef tacos they used to have on the menu - with homemade salsa.  Maybe the new owners will bring those back.  This is still a great place to hear music and sit with friends."}
{"text":"This place is a dive, and it's dank, and it's dark, and I don't care.  It's called The Reef and I'm glad they changed the name because \"Draft House\" would imply that they had a great selection of draft beers (they don't).

All of that, and still 4 stars?  Well you see, their wings are stellar.  This isn't a recommendation from some schlub who thinks all wings are just the best...you all know that guy....he eats a dozen wings that look cold and slimy and says \"They're not bad!\".  No, I'm a wing connoisseur, having traveled far and wide to find the best wings in the city, and I can safely say these are Top 3 Wings.

Better than Native's mediocre dreck.  Better than Buffalo Wild Wing's garbage.  Better than most of your sports bars that have won awards (looking at you, Half Moon).  Better than ATL Wings across the street? ....ehhhh probably not.  But still, stellar, big, well-cooked wings with a GREAT hot sauce.  And try the Donkey Sauce, it'll kick the shit out of you."}
{"text":"I wish they had a zero star option. I've been out to Arizona, from California, a few times now. Last month I went to Mill Ave and had an awesome time... but last night I went to this place and wow. Apparently looking Caucasian and classy gets you treated horribly by the other patrons. I can't even describe the amount of ghettoness that surrounded me. A girl tried to fight me over holding a seat while my friend stepped away for 3 minutes, people were openly smoking weed on the patio, and I saw 2 fights almost happen in the bathroom. On top of that, when you try to strike up casual conversation with men or women, you get either crazy looks or attitudes. I think the only reason people don't get stabbed or shot in here is because they use the metal detector wand at the door, and obviously for a reason considering their type of customers. Oh, and one of the bartenders was rude... an old white guy. Side note, I helped my boyfriend run a business for quite a few years and I'm pretty shocked that the yelp owner for this business left a sarcastic comment in response to someone's review here. First, I'm seriously confused that so many people give this place a good review, and second, as a business owner, you should never respond to customers like that. Very immature and definitely indicative of why your business is the second most ghetto place I've ever walked in to. Considering I spent quite a bit of time in South Central LA, that says something about your establishment and customers."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after seeing coupons come in the mail and driving by.

When we first walked in, no one acknowledged us we wondered if we seat ourselves or what. Finally we went up to the bar and they said sit wherever after we asked. So sit wherever. Out sever was great!! Very nice girl with good pointers on the menu.

We got the wings, spicy ranch and honest mustard. Ok the wings have awesome crispness and are so tender on the inside. The honest mustard was great. The spicy ranch I was sooo excited for but I couldn't get past the fishy taste since they fry them in the same as fish. I do not like fish so it was hard to enjoy them. Totally separate fryers that would be awesome. And the honest mustard make a spicy version :) please! We will be back. So happy we found the place. Very diverse crowd too. It's a place for all."}
{"text":"Disgusting food.. poor customer service...  they gave me the wrong take out order... when I called bartender was rude and unhelpful... this place needs to go outta business.... I will never go back"}
{"text":"They are NOT closed they have MOVED. See address above on Warner road now."}
{"text":"Chicken wings were pretty bad! I know surprising since this is supposed to be their thing!!! Great bartender I wish the food had matched his outstanding service and follow-thru....I may give it another try but damn those wings were served in old grease and were not very meaty....too bad!"}
{"text":"Oh how I long for the old days, when you could walk into the Draft....aka The Reef and just get it Poppin and Wings.  I would start dancing immediately.  It was THE spot to go....I knew Everyone.  The staff was Boss and KNEW everyone too.  Now, its just a shadow of itself....boring.  Ive also gone to check it out on their so called 80's night.  Boring as well... Come On.... Let get it Poppin again......PLEASE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great hh prices. Like to go and unwind. Definetly give it a try"}
{"text":"I like this place! Drinks are decently priced, DJ was good and the atmosphere was fun, always consider this place when we think about where to go get drinks."}
{"text":"New owners are very nice cleaned up the place really well david d and gina are great bartenders"}
{"text":"This is an ok little spot on the weekends if u like hip hop. Reminds me of bars back in my hometown of Cleveland. Very laid back and casual. People from AZ might call it hood.... But I have no issues with it:)  I can have a good time anywhere I go. I will be going there again soon:)"}
{"text":"its very divey, and service was kind of so-so.  but the beer is cold and cheap.  the wings on tuesdays are 60 cents each :)  very good wings, I had mine extra crispy and they were all very tasty !"}
{"text":"Hung out at The Reef!! Enjoyed awesome Coconut Lime wings with a side of veggie sticks!! Yum Yum! Friendly staff and service!! Go in and try some grub!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late night dinner on a Friday night. The place was hype! Their drink specials were great ($3.00 well drinks), the food was good, the staff were friendly and the place had a lot of energy. My only negative about this establishment was that the music was TOO LOUD. My table bad to yell at each other to have a conversation. I mean, it wasn't a night club you know? The tables should be rearranged or speakers should be reconfigured to point at the dance floor so that those eating at the tables don't receive all the volume from the music but can still hear it. Just a suggestion. Great wings by the way."}
{"text":"I go here all the time. The place has a really good atmosphere and great wings, even though, like a lot of reviewers have mentioned, it is a dive bar. The prices are good. There's a good selection on the jux box and it plays loud. Its a good place to have a drink and unwind without having to worry about what your wearing. Only thing is that I don't drink draft beer here. Something about it always gives me a hangover. None of my friends have that problem though."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are so many huge ratings for this place. Let me sum it up for y'all. 

Atmosphere - I came here on a Sunday to watch the Packers and Seahawks in the NFC Championship. I sit at the bar and some dbag is screaming at the tv and talking loud as shit about the Undertaker. This was 2 minutes into the 1st quarter. Then, I saw him walk into the kitchen. Apparently he works here. In fact, most of the patrons to this place were employees. All trash. 

Food - I got a plate of wings and garlic parm fries. Not bad, but the wings were not 5 star worthy. The sauce was good and the wings were big, but the damn bones were breaking in my mouth. Again, the sauce was great. The fries were Ok. I was starving so I ate it all. Filled me up. 

Staff - I sat at the bar. The bartender was not particularly friendly. And why the hell is the phone ringer so loud? Unreal. Sounds like a fire alarm. 

The tv situation is OK. Again, not great. 

Prices were cheap, especially the wings. I'm sure that's why the clientele was so sketchy. 

Bottom line, don't think I'll be back, especially not for football games."}
{"text":"I had been here last year during football and vowed not to return after seeing the state of the bathrooms. Heard there were new owners and the first thing they did was fix them. Saw the Yelp coupon and decided to give them another try. Met the new owner who was really nice. They are trying new things including a country night on Fridays which I will definitely check out. Service was great and plenty of wing flavors to choose from. Onion rings were awesome."}
{"text":"Glad this place has new ownership... I should probably remove the review below, Its really harsh and doesn't apply to the NEW establishment.  You have been warned ;)

Short Review:

THIS PLACE SUCKS BALLS

Long Review:
We were supposed to meet a friend here at Draft House on Saturday night. We were excited to be out on a date-like experience cuz its been a while. We went to my in-laws for dinner and then headed to Draft... I knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall. 

The music: Good music, probably the only good thing about this place - if you're a hip-hop fan. All hip-hop, all night. 

The crowd: Ghetto fab all the way! Seems like everyone there is late 20's - early 30's (and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd) and none realize its not 1996 anymore. Expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la Da Bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms. It was entertaining until it became annoying. Oh and people WILL steal your seats or tell you they are saved - ugh!

The atmosphere: small, crowded...  Small dance floor.  A couple pool tables, but don't expect to get one. Some TVs playing various sports, which I guess qualifies this place as a \"sports cafe\"?? 

The service: OMG, we had one beer each and the \"line\" was retarded, over 30 minutes to tab out. No line in sight, just people crowding together, trying to get to the front of the line.  Oh! and LOL.. the bar tenders are total morons, one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka.  The guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that HE got it wrong.  Weirdos!

If any of this appeals to you this is your place! 

BTW her friend didn't show and we ended up going to Skip n Jan's to play some pool :o)  We had a great time there :o)"}
{"text":"Amazing wings and their Tuesday night wing specials are 50 cents a piece. Saturday's there is a DJ. This place overall comes off a bit shady to me... The customers... I don't let that stop me from enjoying good food!"}
{"text":"This place was the best dive to go to when I lived down the street.  The Draft House was never the place I wanted to frequent on the weekends.  Later at night and on the weekends is certainly when you'll be patted down.  That's the universal sign for u-turn and leave.  

If you're looking for a place to hang out after work and during football, it fits the bill.  Try the wings.  They are excellent.  I haven't had better wings ANYWHERE.  They are meaty, not breaded with many flavors to choose from.  The Draft House makes a decent pizza also.  

Do not go here for music/dancing (late night and weekends) unless you're into the cougars.  If you are into that, this is where you need to be.  After the pat-down from the bouncers, you'll get a different style of pat-down from the cougars."}
{"text":"A friend suggested this place. I need to call him back and ask WHY!?! They actually patted my husband down! Now, admittedly, he is a little intimidating looking, but wth? The \"sports bar: name is misleading, it was not really geared towards the sports fan. Anyway, it was definitely wasn't for me. I gave it the extra star because signs in the place said there was a hip hop DJ and dancing on weekend nights, so I suppose if that's what you were looking for it would be an OK place..."}
{"text":"I love dive bars, and when I walked into the Draft House, I knew I found my new spot! By far the best wings in the East Valley. I recommend the Lemon Pepper Medium. They have a massive amount of flavors, all of which can be mixed. The wings are nice and meaty, and always crisp to perfection. 

Great drink and beer selection. Always a nice PBR special! Ermahgerd!!!

They have pub style poker there with a huge group of people that play. Lots of tvs, not all updated, but it is a dive bar as I mentioned, so they keep it classy and old school. 

One of the cooler features that is new is being able to control the jukebox from your smartphone, so you can discreetly throw on your favorite Justin Bieber hit from the comfort of your barstool. (I saw you singing though, I know who you are.)

Make sure you check em out soon. Eat wings, drink PBR, and throw on some guilty pleasure music from your smartphone."}
{"text":"Great environment for Sunday football. Wings are delicious. Avoid the garlic parmasean fries. They are hyped up but have no real flavor"}
{"text":"This evening the DJ. was awful!!! No one was dancing to his hip hop mix. You would think he would change but nope stuck with it and at 11 still no one dancing and it's loud and awful. Don't think I'll be back"}
{"text":"Really simple order and they were way off simple fries w/ garlic Parmesan missed by a mile!!! To little to say about a bad thing!!  Beer taste old!!!!!! Wow people rate this bar way to high
Less really if you want to know overall my true experience you should call me! I've reviewed many restaurants and bars and my reviews always start with \"I'm looking for success!\" My experience doesn't bias me it actually the honest feed back that you get from me that the CUSTOMERS THAT WALK OUT TO NEVER COME BACK!!"}
{"text":"I walked through the door at The Reef last night and felt it instantly. You know what I mean. That thing that a lot of bars don't have. And it's all quite simple, my friends. The staff at The Reef LIKE their customers. Hell, they might even LOVE their customers. 

L & I met L's cuz at The Reef for a little poker fun and loved how we were made to feel part of the family. Free Texas Hold 'Em tournaments were taking place at most of the tables and yes, I said free. No cover charge, no minimum required purchase, just lots of fun. L was quickly welcomed in to the game while I played spectator/fan/cheering squad/student.

Shot specials abound and the wings are killer. We tried the Hot and I believe the Spicy Ranch (dry rub?). After finishing off a dozen of the Hot L and I said to each other, \"Great but could be hotter. Let's try Donkey Hot.\" Stupider words were never spoken! Actually, the Donkey Hot is really tasty but really hot. L only managed to get one down before breaking out in a sweat. Cuz had to beat that and eat two. Guess who smoked them both? That's right...this girl!! I ate six before calling it quits but only because I was full. Seriously. For reals. Um, actually going back to the stupider words were never spoken comment....be careful the next day because that donkey will kick you in the ass!

As for the staff at The Reef, those girls are amazing. They are on top of things, they run their butts off, they joke with customers, they keep orders straight and all while seemingly enjoying their job! Thanks for a fun night, guys!"}
{"text":"My father (who is 91 yrs old) and my Uncle have been going here for lunch once a week for the past 15+ years.  Never had an issue.  They always enjoyed their time and the wait staff was great with them.  Over the past few weeks there has been a new daytime waitress who has been rude and argumentative.  Since this new waitress started their service has been very bad.  Telling my Uncle that he is rude when he was trying to explain that my dad was to get free wings that week.  Needless to say because of the past few weeks of bad service they have decided to pick somewhere else for their weekly lunch.  It's probably not a big deal to the owner/manager but to a 91 yr old man it is."}
{"text":"I took my other half here for fathers day to try the wings, I ordered a grilled chicken salad. It was the worst salad EVER! I couldn't even eat the chicken on it. If thats what it was. It had grill marks on it but tasted boiled, microwaved, dry, and absolutely no taste for $8 bucks. I let the waitress know that the chicken needed improvement as she took my full un-eaten plate away. She laughed and said that's why she orders the breaded.  Really?  Won't go outta my way to eat there again.  BTW the wings were about a 7/10. Since we had other plans, I went hungry the rest of the afternoon."}
{"text":"Best wings in the east valley.... hands down. Dingy sports bar and you won't be disappointed with the WINGSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!"}
{"text":"Update 2/2016 - added TVs and OTB. 

$.60 wings on Tuesdays - amazing deal for amazing wings. $1 Taco Thursdays are also great. Daily food specials for $6.95 are good. Happy Hour 11-7pm (well and domestics) is now just M-F - they need to bring weekend HH back!

The Donkey Hot wings are AMAZING. Yes they are hot. Yes, every single server will warn you 'do NOT order them.'  But they're worth getting! Hottest sauce I've found but won't kill you. 

Bartenders/servers are very good. 

The wasabi teriyaki wing sauce is good too. They have a lot of good wing sauces.

Other food is good too. Could use more salad options.  Avoid the Ruben. 

Wish they had bigger TVs and better TV sound. But food is good staff is friendly and drinks are strong and cheap!

Bathrooms leave a lot to be desired.

3 pool tables and 2 dart boards. 

Free Poker 6 days a week with $80 in prizes. 

Crowd is varied -- mostly really fun regulars of all types. 

Local dive bar that I hope makes it!

They have a couple great craft beers on tap - Founders, Goose Island plus Guinness."}
{"text":"Met some friends there last week and was very disappointed.  I've been here before, wasn't that impressed either.  It wasn't busy and took 45 minutes for wings and french fries, and it was not busy!  Of course it was cold and the wings were soggy, gross :( 
Also, beer used to be cheap, what happened?"}
{"text":"This place was, what many would describe as being a sports bar dive. I was there for Lunch and ordered the BBQ sandy. It was fairly good. I took part in the Yelp discount coupon for this place, not sure if I would return otherwise."}
{"text":"cheap two for ones every Friday and Saturday.  The Wings are to die for and always playing some good music"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of all the new hires I wish all the old people would or could come back they were way more sociable and fun with regulars, the new staff are uptight and treat you poorly unless you're an old perverted man that's basically tipping them... they have no sense of humor and it's sad to see that its reflecting on some of the old bartenders as well, my husband and I have been coming there for over 12 years on party nights on regular days for lunch etc in the last two years I've been there maybe 3 or 4 times and my husband's gone every few months and we have almost always had an issue with one of the waitresses. I'm drawing the straw I'm never going again since last Friday we went and I was joking with the waitress not to give my husband cheese fries because he's on a diet and she decided to get uptight about it tell the bartender day which then he ended up calling me a b**** and then the next thing I know I'm getting kicked out because she thought I was being rude to her. Last time I checked you're in a bar where people are going to joke and kid around and have fun and maybe you shouldn't hire such sensitive young girls that can't handle it. BTW the waitress was ashley."}
{"text":"On a whim, my buddy from work recommended lunch here awhile back. So I decided to give it a try. Typical bar food, but the special is one dozen wings for 4 bucks. Now let me tell you, I love wings. A lot. Hence the weight problem. Especially when they come Cajun style. So I can be honest and tell you, that the Cajun wings, after being thoroughly tested, are damn good. Haven't tried anything else here in 2 months, so I can't tell you about anything else, but it looks good when other people are eating it. 

So maybe this review has been zero help in choosing whether you visit here.  I'm sorry.  But if you like cajun wings, give this place a try."}
{"text":"**This review is for Saturday nights only. Any other day is like your typical dive bar**

Haven't been here in 2 years. Nothing has really changed. Went last Saturday, the wings were decent not like they use to be though. Maybe because they were overly fried. 

Same Saturday crowd as I remember. If you're uncomfortable around a lot of \"hood\" people I use that term loosely on a Saturday night stay away. 

If you don't like
1. Rap music being played loudly
2. Being at a place with no dress code
3. Around more urban people (being politically correct here) 

Stay away it's pointless for you to come just so you can complain. 

Drinks are cheap they have drink specials all night. Kitchen is open until 1am.

They have a dance floor and people usually dance and have a good time. They don't start charging at the door until 9pm. So if you get there before 9pm no cover and they give you a band so you can leave and then come if you want. 

I don't know what the waitress name was but she's been there since I've first went there 3 years ago. (she's the thicker one w/ brown hair) if you get her please give her a nice tip she's the best one there. 


Otherwise I already know I'll be back no time soon though lol I might see how it is during football season on a Sunday they have plenty tv's there."}
{"text":"One of my fav dive bars in Chandler. Great place to hang with friends and they have Strongbow on tap!"}
{"text":"We had fun at this place! We weren't sure what to expect, but when we realized it was a sports pub, my husband was excited because it was a Saturday...lots of TVs and college football was on. We ate bar food, had some drinks, I played MegaTouch, and he watched football. We hung out for about 5 hours until the place was turning into the club portion for the night. Nice, chill place around the corner from our house with nice servers and attentive bartenders. We will definitely be back there again!"}
{"text":"My last comments Were Removed
I have Been to this Business
It's run Down Loud
The food might be Good
But Unsafe!
The management is Rude!"}
{"text":"Holy crap. From all the reviews I read I thought I was headed to real hole. But there was a live band at 2 in the afternoon on Saturday (fourth of July), and some food and drink specials, so I thought I'd wander over. 
The  beer came in a mug the size of a pitcher, with a couple limes, and ice sliding down the side as I drank. A welcome treat on this hot day. The a/c is nice and cool, and the room is huge. There's upwards of 20 tvs, off track betting, and the cute as a button waitress was handling her business with the 40 or so patrons there at the time. 
The wings were good, so was the burger.
So here's a bar that has good food, ice cold beer, friendly and adorable staff, and a live blues jam with a coordinator smart enough to promote it. 
If that doesn't do it for ya, go fight the crowds and overpriced drinks in old town Scottsdale, I heard they've got some fancy places up there."}
