{"text":"Really cool hotel and casino. For the money and what it is, it's a cool spot. Very clean for a hotel being so old."}
{"text":"I took my out of state friends here for a Sunday brunch on our way to tour the Dam.  We almost went for the typical brunch. But then we were told about the breakfast bar in the next room. You can order made to order omelettes, Waffles, pancakes and they had a buffet bar as well.  My eyes were much bigger than my stomach, the omelette was very good, waffle with fresh berries was great, everything I tasted was very good. The service was good as well."}
{"text":"This is another old school casino. I like to stop here from time to time just for breakfast. Good food, Large portions, low prices,and very friendly waitresses..You can't go wrong !"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars and still write this review I would.  However, sadly that is not an option. If you would like to stay at a place that treats you well and has timely service this is not the place for you.   I booked a room here for 3 nights for my dad while he is working in Las Vegas on hotels.com. He was able to check in on time but that was the only upside to the entire stay. The whole 2 days that he stayed there his room was not cleaned once, his beds were never made, and he was never given any towels. This is not the worst part about the situation as you will see. Around 9 pm my parents decided to go to the steak house there in the casino. They had both had a long day and just wanted to get some dinner and relax. My dad ordered a steak which never came. After an hr of waiting my father got frustrated and him and my mother left the restaurant without eating. Shortly after this security arrived at their hotel room and informed them that they were being escorted off of the property and that they would not be receiving a refund for the night they wouldn't be staying. It seems because they had the good since to leave the restaurant and go to bed instead of waiting however long it would take to actually get their food  the casino decided this was not OK and therefore they were no longer welcome at the hotel. My parents had to pack up all their stuff in the presents of security guards and then they were walked to the front doors and escorted out like some kind of criminals. All because they didn't put up with horrible service at the restaurant. I'm sorry to say that when its 9 at night and this casino/ hotel is older and not very occupied the restaurant isn't so busy that it takes an hr to cook a meal. They were treated very poorly and with very little respect.  THAT IS NOT OK!!"}
{"text":"Coming back from Boulder City we decided to stop for a late lunch.  I ordered ministrone soup which was not edible.  Looked like stew with tomato sauce dumped over it.  The waitress was very kind and took it back and I re-ordered breakfast, it was OK, but far from being the best I've ever had even at an inexpensive price.   I wanted strawberry shortcake.  No whip creme. When the waitress brought it, I knew I was in trouble,  a peice of cake with squased frozen (thawed out) strawberries.  Two bites, I was done.  If you don't have fresh berries, don't put it on the menu.   I was disappointed with the whole process and will not be returning and certainly wouldn't recommend it.   I will commend the waitress (sorry forgot your name) but she handled everything in a professional manerr.  Thank you."}
{"text":"This is for the casino tournament last Wednesday 12/27/2017.  I was at the top of the list waiting to play with people behind me, and I had been waiting for a long time.  A man came in and the elderly white hair woman let him cut in front of me because she said he was on the list but wasn't there when she called his name.  This practice was unfair for the people who have been waiting there because if a person was not there when called, then when he came back, he should be placed at the end of the line.  And this man was the third man she did that for.  If this is a casino's rule, then it should be changed because fair is fair."}
{"text":"Don't understand the bad reviews. Had an awesome time. We were greeted at the front door, had a charming conversation with the ladies at the gift shop. We were directed to the players club booth where a lovely lady made up our cards and gave us a souvenir. The slots were loose and the casino is like a throwback to the old days of Las Vegas. Totally charming and clean. We were never without a bottle of water and though the cafe and buffet looked good, we had to get back to the city. Next time we will will have a steak and enjoy the lovely view from the bar. We had a great time while we were here. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I stayed here after a long drive from Portland, OR on my way to Phoenix. I wanted something closer to home than the strip, but after midnight, there weren't a lot of options for your regular hotels. I was exhausted and starving. After getting my room key from a very friendly and personable staff member, I dropped off my stuff in my room, and went to the cafe for food. I'm sure the fact that I had eaten nothing more than a small bag of pretzels all day influenced me, but the food was soooooo good. I got eggs, bacon, and french toast for less than $6 with tax. My eggs were perfect. Perfect. Seriously! Whoever their overnight cook is, he/she did an excellent job. When I was done eating, I headed towards my room. Unfortunately, it cost me $60 just to get there (the call of the 1 armed bandit was just too strong). The bed was really comfortable. As someone who usually suffers from \"not my bed\" syndrome, I was pleasantly surprised at how well I slept. I got up and out the door with no fuss the next day. Very pleased with my overall stay."}
{"text":"So, I took my wife in for her birthday steak and eggs at Railroad Pass Cafe. We went to a killer concert downtown, and went and played $300 before we ate. We ordered our steaks both medium. We received our dinner, wife's steak was well done. Mine looked like it was boiled(gray) on the outside, but was cold and purple on the inside. Asked if they could cook me a new steak. I was brought the potatoes and eggs, which were so salty. At this point, we wete so dissapointed, we paid for one meal, just because we are in the business. Wife is a server, and I a chef. We didn't finish our meal, I didn't even get my steak. Horrible!!"}
{"text":"Rooms where clean but way outta date, perfect for truck drivers, over priced for age of hotel, restaurant employees not very kind, none responsive, not much of a sense of humor, beds where very uncomfortable, very hard mattresses. AC units where very noisy, hard to sleep with them running."}
{"text":"I love all you can eat buffet and the stake house the cafe restraunt I eat slots of food and I am still skinny I love that ever play machines there and sports tickets"}
{"text":"We ordered the rib eye special... It was the worst dinner I have had in years! The \"steak\" was 1/4 inch thick at the most, tasted awful. and I had to trim so much fat from it there wasn't much left. I had ordered medium rare, and it looked the same as the medium well-done my friend ordered. The \"mashed\" potatoes were gummy and strange tasting. The luke-warm microwaved peas were sadly the best part of the meal. On the good side, the staff were friendly. The cashier tried to find the manager when I told her how awful the dinner was, but the manager was nowhere to be found."}
{"text":"It had nice clean sheets and the mattress  was plastic wrapped ... Positives The smokey smell is pretty bad . Very old fashioned , like a step back in time .  Unique place .... Not really my normal place I would stay , but the price is so low it's almost unheard of . Also the cafe had very low prices for big portions. Just know that you will not be getting the Ritz but I don't think the Ritz charges $45.00"}
{"text":"Yes, it's an older place. But that's why we like it so much! Lots of games and 3 different restaurants. Oh, big rig parking is a plus. Nice people work here, too. :)"}
{"text":"The Steakhouse at Railroad Pass is absolutely by far THE BEST!  Living in Las Vegas for several years,  I have been to several different steakhouses, but this one is the very best!  The food is incredible!  The service was outstanding!  Pricing were beyond fair!  Huge portions too!  I got 3 meals out of mine!  Absolutely The Best Steakhouse around!"}
{"text":"Stopped on Tuesday with the son in law and had Mac & Cheese. Took the wife there for the 1st time and in front of the head cook she said \" I'm going to shoot you these no Mac & Cheese.\" The head cook said \"Don't worry I'll make some just for you.\" and he did. It's a much smaller buffet than say the Station Casinos, but everything that Railroad Pass puts out is good to excellent. No pig food here. Today was Friday with fried clam necks, fried fish, broiled salmon, BBQ ribs, baked potatoes etc. Needless to say we'll be back."}
{"text":"Wow...reminds me of National lampoon vacation..the buffet was the worst..not one person asked us for sevice..we had to go get our own drinks and then they was rude..that place will never see my money again"}
{"text":"Horrible paying machines, they tighten there machines since there the only place in Boulder city and can take advantage of the the locals not to mention the truck drivers who stop here! I play everywhere up and down Boulder highway from Boulder station to here for variety butt from now on this one will be scratched off my list! Only one worse is fiesta I can guarantee you that place is not on the up and up, rigged machines at fiesta"}
{"text":"We stayed there one night to enjoy canoeing on Lake Mead and a helicopter ride from the local airport to the Grand Canyon. It's a place mostly attended by the locals. We were first assigned a one-bed room, which didn't work for us and the kids, but it was no problem to change it to a two-bed room. We also appreciated the pool where we were by ourselves. The buffet was closed for breakfast and dinner, but we ate at the cafe which had lots of good food and is quite cheap; you just have to wait quite long to get your order, it seems the kitchen is a bit slow.  So it's not a four-star hotel but a comfortable place to stay close to Lake Mead and Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"This review is for the players club staff and the buffet. Went to Boulder City to visit the Big Horn sheep herd at the park. On the way back stopped for lunch at railroad pass. Got a players card from a very friendly employee.  Went to the buffet. It was half price day. The buffet was small but mighty---as in tasty! Salad area had crisp greens and lots of fresh vegetables. There were breakfast items and lunch items. Hubby sampled breakfast with different sausages and biscuits and gravy. He gave them 2 thumbs up. Besides salad I had steamed green beans which were steamed just right firm and not soggy. I also had Chuck steak tenders. They were med rare and so tender I cut it with a butter knife. The dessert section had a nice variety but I didn't partake.  For less than $12 for both of us we will be stopping here to try the cafe and steakhouse on future visits."}
{"text":"I love this place.you walk on in and see you can go in a buffet or a fancy room or a little diner and the food is great and for a good price. Then once you are done you get to have the best desert of you ever had in your life.  You get to gamble at the end of the day and have some fun at the museum and the gift shop. So one day i would like you to go there."}
{"text":"Only Eat At The Buffet If You Want To Get Sick! My husband and I had eaten at the buffet when hotel was still owned by MGM and thought it was pretty bad. Food was tasteless and service was deplorable. Last night we decided to give it another try to see if the new owner had improved anything. Big mistake! The food was worse, things had not been replenished and hot food was cold or lukewarm. Baked salmon looked like a folded over paper towel burnt around the edges. Fortunately neither of us could cut through what felt like hard plastic with knife or stab with a fork, so we didn't find out how bad it tasted. The pasta dish was lukewarm mush, everything my husband had was cold, tasteless and couldn't be identified.  We went directly to our car and we were both sick before we left the parking lot. Both of us were up half the night sick.  The only reason I gave it one star was because the waitress was nice. I'm surprised the Health Department hasn't closed them down."}
{"text":"I was curious about Railroad Pass Casino, since  a tour guide on a prior visit noted their long-running gaming license.  I didn't want to stay there.  I just wanted to see it.  So we did.  I am going to sound like a total snoot -- but if you're the Bellagio or Caesar's Palace type, you'll hate it here.  Old, dingy, smoky ... (wait!  all these casinos are smoky!!)  Many truck drivers.  (Probably cause there's ample parking for one's rig.)  What we liked: -- they have an old fashioned one-armed bandit that releases quarters when you win. (I didn't see that elsewhere.) -- frequent low pay-outs at the slots.  (I'm no gambler.  I don't expect to make money.  I get excited winning even a couple of cents!) -- decent drinks -- they have a room, which probably nobody visits, with old articles, menus and such from the casino's early days.  Oh, and an old safe!  If you're a little curious, stop by on your way back from Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"Only for the buffet, I live close by and thought I would try it, since my friend has wanted to go there forever. We went and it is highly disappointing. Do not recommend.  The service sucks huge donkey dick. I finished my first plate before the server even came over to greet us and take our drink order. The buffet line is only about 30 feet of food.  Every single piece of food is dry and has been sitting out, and it looks that way as well probably should be thrown away from sitting out longer than the health code recommended time. I'm sure many people have gotten sick from this place. Do not eat here. Then the server takes forever to pick up dirty plates. The moist towelettes are not moist at all, I don't even know how that happens."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch on our way to Kingman. Service wad excellent. I shared a French dip sandwich with onion rings with my mom. The sandwich was huge and exceptionally good. The prime rib WAS piled high and the aujuce dip was full of flavor. The onion rings are homemade! Really crispy! My husband had a prime rib specia,l.over an 8 in size. What a full plate! Only one complaint. I have PTSD and have a service dog who sits next to me so she can sense whpen I'm having an attack. I was informed that all animals needed to be kept on the floor. That doesn't do me any good. By the time she would normally sense an attack coming on she pushed me down so I'm sitting. Finally arranged to let her sit in my lapj I think they should review their plan for service animals. It's not that hard to sanitize their booths when we leave."}
{"text":"RPH&C not counting the hi-tech video poker and slot machines this place is very old school Vegas.  It's smoky, the lights are turned down low and it's a people watching (visitors and employees) paradise.  RPH&C retains the oldest gambling license in the state.  There is a \"Heritage Room\" that is fun to make a short walk through talking about the history of the casino and surrounding area.  The Iron Rail Cafe was awesome!  I could not smell smoke from the casino but perhaps the sense of smell may have already trashed walking to the cafe.  While sitting down in the very comfortable booths a smile crept onto my face looking around at the place.  Fresh pies displayed, a counter top with an old timer chilling out reading his paper in the glow of the dim hanging lights, bikers, out of towner's enjoying a cheap meal....All of this reminded me of some non psychedelic scene from \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.\"  The food was cheap and awesome.  Read my quick tip!  My coffee cup was always filled when it ran empty by my waiter who closely resembled Paul Giamatti.  I wanted badly to ask this doppelganger if he had ever heard that before...but at the risk of sounding stupid or possibly insulting the the man.....I did not."}
{"text":"Someone needs new cocktail waitresses played 300 $ at a machine not once asked for a beer or even came by you have to squeeze your way up to the bar and hopefully get some help your staff is to comfortable and ignorant ill be back but I'm bringing my cooler"}
{"text":"So disappointed. This is our third visit, as we are fairly close, but we give up. Service is poor and never an apology, just like this is our best so live with it. Touted as a steak place we brought new guests this time, between poor service and overcooked steaks and fish we were embarrassed. And what happened to the live dinner music that used to be provided? Not only is the service poor, food is poor and no longer the amibiance,  I just don't think we will be back anytime soon. We are very sad, as we keep thinking that it will be better. NOT!"}
{"text":"Worst costumer service at front desk ever! at about 10 in the morning we heard people from upstairs walking and banging stuff on the floor. Couldnt go back to sleep so we decided to call front desk to complain. The general manager just told us to switch rooms because they have construction going on upstairs. I got a little upset because obviously my point was, we couldnt go back to sleep! Now were supposed to pack all our things and transfer? To make the long story short, the GM just said, \"we will refund your money if you leave\" RUDE AND SO NOT HELPFUL AT ALL! It was my husband talking to them on the phone, being cranky cursed at them ONE TIME for having bad service. 5 minutes later, the security BANGS on our door repeatedly, saying we said all kinds of curse words to the front desk(which was a big fat lie) and asked us to leave. they returned all of our money(still not the point) apparently they dont need costumers and it looks like thats how they handle costumers that they dont want, just send them packing."}
{"text":"Did the Gray Line Tour to Hoover Dam. Our lunch stop was here after the tour. It was part of a \"Deluxe Package\". Food was scary. How do you mess up hot dogs? They were burnt soaking in water. If you're interested in mushy pork, styrofoam tilapia, frozen french fries this is your spot. A steel gut is required to ingest any of this food.  Someone else said it perfect Golden Coral is 5 stars compared to this establishment. If you do the Gray Line Tour to Hoover Dam no need to do the deluxe package."}
{"text":"I'm leaving 4 starts, because nothing is perfect. My husband and I are locals. We like the gaming there. It's nice, everyone is friendly, and doesn't seem as 'showboatie' as some of the other places. It is never empty, but never over crowded. We had to Sunday brunch buffet, this past Sunday. It was not generic. They had the usual breakfast items and some lunch items. My husband got sunny eggs. He is very pick and said they were just the way he liked them. I had a waffle, which was cooked right in front of me. It was hot, crispy on the outside and  soft on the inside. Like a waffle should be. Our server was friendly. It is my understanding they have changed owners and are working on the crippy crap things that need immediate help. Recovering from mismanagement is a slow process. There are so many things it involves. But I digress. I will continue to visit for the gaming, if for no other reason."}
{"text":"I'll give them credit for reaching out after the review and offering a second chance on them. So here is the second chance review:  They changed their advertising on the \"Giant salad bar\" which I didn't expect and a nice gesture to those who are vegetarian.   This time it was a Sunday brunch, the omelet bar was nice, but items for the omelet could have been displayed as the cook seemed a bit bothered to tell them to me since I could not see them all behind the glass.  Food taste was better and deserts were good. Table service was also better. Restaurant was still a bit dark and obviously they aren't going to update the interior anytime soon.  Janitor used way too many chemicals in the bathroom that you could smell down the hall.  In all it's not my top choice, I may revisit, but probably not."}
{"text":"No frills casino, so don't expect it.   It could be more dedicated to it's history.... Besides the coin slots and the \"museum\" that they have.   Dark and smoke filled.   Some nice employees, some.... Not so much.  Don't dare come when it rains. There will be employees shuffling around buckets to try and collect the water. MGM owns this casino and you would think that they would pay some money to have the roof/ceiling repaired.... Ceiling tiles will be missing, yellow caution tape will be up, machines, tables and other various items will be covered with plastic to keep them from getting wet."}
{"text":"The casino itself is ok, had much better games then Green Valley, well, at least they had the ones I like to play... Ghost Busters, Hillbillies, Wizard....   Now... to the BAD part...  THE BUFFET IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!!  everything was cold and gross! I felt like i was in the scene of Vegas Vacation with Clark and Cousin Eddy when they are at the buffet and Eddy goes, \"Ill try some of the yella', gimme some of the blue...\" It was so bad!  My dad basically just ate cold potatoes and ice cream.  The ONLY saving grace of that dinner was the guy making the cheese steaks!  BUT... they only serve those ONE night a week!"}
{"text":"Great Saturday buffet.  We go there almost every Saturday to the buffet all you can eat prime rib.  The prime rib is almost always incredible and would put it up there with the best steak houses throughout Las Vegas.  The staff could tend to the buffet items a bit better but probably the best food for a prime rib buffet in town.  The place just sold and we hope they keep the menu the same.  We love to go there during the week sometimes and eat at the coffee shop as they have great food at great prices plus the gaming is pretty good there too.  A must try on the sat night prime rib.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A very nice Casino as your entering Nevada from Arizona, they have a great selection of slot games and table games We didnt go to any of their restaurant options here, but the staff was very friendly and helpful. Its a nice place to stretch out your legs if your coming from Phoenix, and has some great scenery here!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible in so many ways. And not in the so terrible it's good way. It's on the way to Boulder City and can be a decent pit stop. But don't expect anything good here. Good food is a no. Good beer is a no. Good gaming is a no. Good anything - or even interesting anything - is a no. It's old. It's smokey. It's a rundown run-of-the-mill casino."}
{"text":"The hotel rooms are very dirty and rundown we got smoke free rooms but they smell bad and plus they wer fles it's the worst hotel  the coffe shop is good the casino mmmm is tied up las time I went I won at least 100 dalers this. Time I los  and did not see any body like turist only local peple and the slots are old new. Lots"}
{"text":"This is about the steakhouse in Railroad pass casino. First off the water. Terrible after taste tap water. Then the bread. Hard and cold and the butter is too cold to spread. So by now I'm not having a good feeling about the food. I ordered the 12 oz filet mignon and the \"loaded\" baked potato. Of course loaded means butter and sour cream. Well the bottom line is all my fears about the steak vanished when I took my first bite. The steak was exactly what I wanted. It was cooked perfectly and extremely tender. I loved the steak. It compares to the steak I had at Flemmings except it's $28 compared to Flemmings $49. So everything considered, I would travel back to Railroad pass casino just to have that steak again. But the steakhouse does need to work on the other amenities."}
{"text":"Ok so i secretly like this place. I usually come here for the lunch buffet. The buffet is really small and also serves as an \"EDR\" for the employees. The food in this very small selection is usually well prepared. The casino is standard and bar is always full. The rooms here are meant to rest your head in, that's it. I found the bed to be a little uncomfortable and you CAN hear whoever is walking on the floor above you. The hotel hallways and room all have this eerie feel to them but hey the place opened in 1931!"}
{"text":"We were here only one night (for a family event) but were very pleased. It was a 3-day holiday weekend and we were lucky to find a room at such a great price. Our room was neat and adequately outfitted. The hotel permits pets (for a fee) and we had two small dogs in neighboring room that had been left to bark incessantly. Security tried to resolve the situation for the sake of the neglected dogs, that were clearly unhappy. They quickly moved us to another room and were very courteous and kind about the situation. Staff throughout was very pleasant and efficient. We ate in the coffee shop (cafe) once, where the food was decent. Prices were very reasonable. Our room was comfortable and quiet. History of this place is pretty interesting too, as I later learned."}
{"text":"Super cheap drinks.  Dollar bud at bar! Come on man,dollar craps, two bit roulette, a player's dream. Will def come back next trip. One bus from downtown took an hour tho.   Def take the hdx.  Much faster. Wonderful walking trails to walk off those beer. Geocaches available in the area."}
{"text":"If you enjoy Hiking this is a must, its a easy walk around 7 miles round trip and goes from Lake Mead to Hoover Dam on the old rail road where the men would move tons of cement and rock and wood along the rail road to build the rail track, the views are amazing, the plants and animals you will see are beautiful, take your camera as you will need it, its also a great place to ride ride you mountain bikes and joggers also run this route, there is plenty to look at and so the whole family big or small and even 4 legged members of the family are welcome, but please take your trash home, we picked up other peoples trash to try and keep the place clean as some people do not know what take your trash home means, there is even toilets on the route with bins and water fountains even a doggie bag area so pick it up and put in the bin or take it home, but this is a must see and its FREE! even Parking is free in the car park!"}
{"text":"OK. For $80 a night this place works.  I'm riding a motorcycle and they said I could park it right out front and I could see it from my room.  I won $100 on roulette which paid for my room and dinner.   Best of all is that this place is totally old school.  Big tube TVs and push button phones.  It feels like you're in the past.  Cool place."}
{"text":"A while back after a trip to see the Hoover Dam (which, if you haven't been, you really should at least once in your life), I saw this place off the side of the road.  It doesn't look like much, in fact, it looks down right awful.  But that's the reason it intrigued me so much I guess and the reason I stopped by on my way to the strip.  I'm not going to give you a detailed review of just how bad it was (heck, just look at how badly maintained the property is when you park), because just walking up to the door will give you an idea of what to expect.  Would I stay there?  Are you crazy?  Not even if they comp'd me would I do that.  No, the reason sane people visit this spot it check out the local wildlife (and by that I mean: truckers, people who really shouldn't be gambling, vagrants living out of their cars and the occasional serial killer making his trip across the country.  My recommendation?  Stop in for the laughs then head on over to a nicer casino."}
{"text":"Excellent food, not nearly as smoky as other casinos. The staff is very friendly and courteous. When they moved 95 to the west, the owner built a huge lot for truckers. And they will come get you and take you to the casino. I'm very impressed with it as a whole. I've always passed here on the freeway but never stopped in. Very clean and decently priced. I will be returning to rent a room soon."}
{"text":"Got to the buffet at 8:02pm. Went and looked at the food, looked pretty good and a guest said the just brought out a new tray of beef. We went back to the cashier and she told us the biffet was clisef. We were then seated in the restaurant. My wife ordeted a patty melt. The burger smelled bad. Or daughter ordered a steak and it was really tough. The fried chicken was really fried and over cooked. My chicken fried steak was the smallest chicken fried steak I have ever seen, jad no taste and was very bland.  Obviously processed and frozen. The staff was apologetic and took the patty melt off the ticket. Will not eat there again."}
{"text":"This hotel is so great!! They are celebrating their 80th anniversary in August and I'm so excited for them! Everyone here is so nice so fun and generally caring for their guests!! I couldn't be more pleased with my stay here! The room have been updated with big tv's and their actually very roomy! The price is unbeatable! Granted I'm far from town but that's the point!! I love feeling like I'm not in Vegas.. The view of the desert landscape is breathtaking and just minutes from the Hoover Dam you just can't beat!  Thank you everyone here for taking such good care of me and my pup Bear, he's having a blast being lovingly greeted on every walk we take!!"}
{"text":"Date of my visit: 24-October-2017 Time of my visit: Mid-afternoon Total bill (with tax, but not including tip): $7.47  On my way back from Hoover Dam, I was starving, so I made a stop at this Resort and Casino for some lunch buffet.  It was very cheap and the buffet seemed to have options, so I figured why not!  My first plate was so veggies and hot dogs.  Veggies were so so, hot dogs were a little bland.  The bun tasted a bit stale.  My second plate was some chicken and meat (steak, I assume).  Well, both were uneatable...  My final plate was desert and it was by far the best thing at the buffet!  Service was horribly slow and I could not understand why, there were literary 6 people in the joint...  Overall a D experience.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"The.Worst.Buffet.Ever. Congealed gravies near the carving station, poor quality entrees and sides, dried up spaghetti. Giving it one star because the only edible item was the chicken wings which were actually good. Come on people, take some sort of pride in the food you are putting out. Would not even think of going here again."}
{"text":"Breakfast on a Sunday morning - The Buffet at Railroad Pass isn't bad.  They have a great selection of foods, and also have an omelet and French toast station - cook to order.  The parking lot is currently torn up and under construction as I-11 and the new truck stop get finished."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst service I've experienced while dining out. My family and I dined at the coffee shop today, we were at sat at about 3pm. It took nearly 15 minutes before any one came up and acknowledged our table. No one came and even took our drink order. When the server finally decided to come to our table there was no introduction he just stood there and after an awkward moment of silence just asked us if we're ready. So we give him our drink order as well as food. We order the triple duece for my daughter I ordered the memorial day special cheese burger (which was supposed to be free but wasn't) I was told I needed ID not asked so I showed it. The wife ordered the spaghetti. Meanwhile trip other tables that were close to us ordered the same special they were never asked for ID one lady showed it he just brushed it off like it was no big deal. The server never returned to our table, not to see how things are and drinks were never refilled I never received the pie that came with it the other two tables did. The only time the server came back to the table was to drop off the bill. And I was still charged for the memorial day special even after showing proper ID. Food was good service was dismal."}
{"text":"The steak house is good . No res and still got us in and out in one hour. French onion soup was good . Sea bass not bad . Dinner for two with drinks OTD 90 will go back"}
{"text":"This is the oldest running casino in the nation!  That said it is Boulder City's first and only little attempt at a gaming resort.  Not much to see here.  Move along.  It is a bit dingy and old but the historical aspect is quite interesting.  Its casino license issued no. is #4.  The first 2 casino closed long long ago and the 3rd casino license is unknown.  It was built to cash in on the hard workers building the Hoover Dam back in 1931.  It was advertised that they had 25 Electric Fans to cool its patrons\" back then, lol!   There's a cafe, buffet and steakhouse.  All 3 serve the same giant fatty rough looking prime rib.  The only differences are they are cheaper at the cafe, thick as Hell in the steakhouse and only served on Saturdays in the buffet.  Not a great entree in comparison but it brings me back.  My parents loved to buy us the cheap special rib-eyes and I can give you a virtual tour of all the old cheapskate cheap steak spots, haha.  Nothing else makes up stop here on our way to Boulder city or Dam other than empty pockets.  There is a tiny museum room that has a wealth of info on the history of the dam that is worth the 10 minutes to read and inspect it all.  Thats all I got on this."}
{"text":"Okay, Okay....before you start bashing my review of this old gal, I found the perfect video poker machine in this casino, and hit a couple of Royals, 5 four of kinds, a few full houses, and did it in only two trips going there.    I'm not telling what machine, because I don't want them to change up the joint, because it's so easy to find.   On my way back from buying lottery tickets in Arizona, I usually just pass this place but something told me to stop at this place or maybe it was that big sign that was telling everyone about the 7.99 T-bone or Prime Rib special.    I was feeling lazy, and didn't want to cook when I got home, so I pulled off the 95, and walked in.      Railroad Pass casino has very old school feel about, and still have a few slot machines that pays out heavy silver dollars.   I love the sound of coins falling out of machines,    I don't drink too much, but the cocktail girls are on it big time on the casino floor, and the lady next to me was having a great time pounding screwdrivers.    Railroad pass cafe is a pretty good cafe for the price, and I was very surprised that the smokey smell the casino floor, doesn't really enter the cafe area.  The wait help is good, and they won't let your drink get down half way. What got me there today, they mailed out a coupon of a free buffet, if I earned 10 more points on my players card, thereby giving me a 30.00 comp for the steak house.    Well, earning 10 points was a snap, and I even won a few more dollars in doing it, but what stunned me was the buffet.....it was actually pretty good!    The selections were smaller than most buffets, but the dishes were taster than most Station casino.    I really enjoyed their fried chicken,  minestrone soup. and make your own club sandwich, but what blew me away was the their ice milk Sundae area.    If you give me dried Coconut, pineapple, peanuts, strawberries, cherries. and chocolate....I'm making myself a Blizzard for dessert!     For 6.99, I would come back just for those things.  Railroad casino keep on sending me those comps, and I'll keep come back..   Well, I come back anyway."}
{"text":"Website says nothing about being under construction.   Very difficult to park and get in and out.  Definately not ada friendly.   Accept pets but not until you get all the way checked in do they tell you it is a $20 fee.  Tv remote poor even after maintenance fixed it.     Hard Pass.  Not worth the affordable price."}
{"text":"My husband and I were surprised to read the negative reviews about this casino as our experiences there were all positive.  We found this little gem on the way back from visiting Hoover Dam 2 weeks ago on our vacation in Vegas and decided to check it out.  It was cold and windy outside of the casino somewhere in the low 40's.  For 2 Hawaii people that is frigid.  Walking into the casino to the welcoming warmth was wonderful.   Since we never went to Railroad Pass during the morning hours I can't comment on their breakfast or lunch or the crew who work the early shifts.  Our visits were always after 5:00 p.m. through about midnight.  Our focus when we travel to Vegas is craps and we headed to the crap table delighted to see the table minimum was only $1.  The crew there  is absolutely the best.  They  were warm and friendly and we can't say enough about the pit boss \"Monte\" who is by far the nicest pit boss we have met in all of Vegas.  We could tell he genuinely likes people and we felt welcomed by him and his crew.  After shooting craps we headed to the rear of the cozy casino the the Iron Rail Cafe.  The hostess, Darla, was warm and pleasant just like the rest of the employees there.  Our waitress, Cheryl, was also very efficient and nice.  I had the salmon and my husband had steak.   The fish was moist and flaky meaning it was fresh and cooked perfectly.  My husband's steak was cooked medium rare, the way he ordered it.  The second time we both had steak and shrimp and that was cooked well too.   I didn't care much for the chicken breast appetizers because they were dry and overcooked, but the potato skins, buffalo wings and fried mozzarella were good.  The vegetables that come with the entrees are canned instead of fresh or frozen.   Probably the best surprise was their banana cream pie!  It is deliciously fresh and creamy and sinful.  We had to eat it again the next time we visited there because it surpasses any banana cream pie we have eaten.  Yes, we even chose it over the strawberry shortcake which I hear is awesome.    Food aside, we drove all the way out to Henderson 4  times during our trip mainly to spend time with the crew and gamble.  If we had discovered Railroad Pass the first week of our vacation we would have gone there even more often.  It was out of our way really but that is how much we like it there.   You can't beat a $1 minimum crap table with an awesome crew.  By the way, the slot machines we played seemed to be a bit looser than other casinos so I actually made some money a couple of times and didn't lose as much as I normally do at other casinos.  We feel at home at Railroad Pass and would like to experience staying there for a couple of nights to see what that is like.  The only reason I didn't mark this casino at 5 stars is because we haven't spent  any time lodging there.  If we do I will write another review about our experiences."}
{"text":"I was in the casino about 1 month ago. I will never go back!!  I wanted to play 21, there was two empty seats so I went over to one of them and the dealer told me someone was seating there so I went to the other one and the person next to that seat told me someone was seating there also. I was there with three other people who saw what was going on. The dealer saw I was not alone so she then said the seat was avelable.  I don't know what the dealer problem was but I will never be back the that casino. We were hoping with the the new ownership things would be better, I guss not.  Mary Eugenio"}
{"text":"So yes everything everyone has said about it being old and smoky. But very cheap drinks. Like $3.50 for draft beer. $1 Budweiser if you're into that. I would like to mention that they have started to do some live music and events like karaoke about once a week. I went there for St. Patrick's day and they had a band playing. Really awesome band, but not sure if everyone knows about their events because people seemed reluctant to enter the room. Kind of strange since it is in a separate ballroom off the casino floor but it was fun!   One thing I asked about since this casino does have some history was t-shirts or memorabilia that includes Railroad Pass or something that says longest running casino. They pointed me to the gift shop which was closed at the time but everything inside looked like typical Vegas gift shop stuff. When I have a few drinks and I'm in a cute little historic place like that I like buying things. But nothing was there to buy. Oh well. Check it out."}
{"text":"My father lives in Boulder City and we have gone to the Railroad Pass Hotel for almost 25 years.  The rooms were reasonably priced and we were able to stay out of downtown Vegas.  We went there this past weekend and my father had paid for our two rooms in advance.  When I checked in they required my card.  They did NOT show me any information about the rooms.  A few days after we returned home, there was a $550 charge on my card from the hotel.  I thought I had been double charged because rooms used to be between $40 and $60/a night, weekday vs. weekend.  In addition, they were NOT supposed to charge my card at all as my father had pre-paid for the rooms.    Well, it turns out that they are under new management.  They have doubled their rates, so a room on a weekend is now $116/night!  I was not notified of that at all and yet was charged for it.  My father--who is elderly--had to go to the hotel to deal with the issues in person and was finally able to get it straightened out, despite the staff being less-than-friendly to him.    This is most disturbing because well, we have patroned there several times a year over the past 23 years.  We have already researched and found a new place to call 'home' for our visits.   I do not recommend using this hotel if you are visiting Lake Meade or Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I've visited this place on and off since the 70s. This casino is a throwback to the old casino days when the hotels were smaller and smoke filled.  They've done some remodeling over the years but if ya wanna know what the hotels in Vegas use to be like pay a visit to this place."}
{"text":"I was expecting more Filipino people inside. When you advertise sub $10 buffets, it's like opening the border for all Filipinos to come in on some cheap AYCE. Whatevs, the buffet lights got us to pulling over into the casino.   Bait and switch? Check. No thanks on the food. Now I can throw a couple hundo on the craps table... I saw only one craps table and it was a $1 table. I started off with a few bucks just for shits and giggles and after a while I stepped it up a bit. You can only bet double behind the line. Here you can be more free with your betting since you only have $50 down on everything.   Side note. Lots of old people. Seriously, old mother fuckers rolling around. If you're a young person and your bae is afraid of you going to Vegas and coming back with a STD, go to this casino. There's no chance in hell that you can even pull a semi unless you're into this kind of thing.  Back to reality. I fattened the wallet and peaced out to the airport."}
{"text":"I have to say that I really loved this historic place. We stopped in on a whim and had a blast. They have great gambling, (I won) eats, rooms and super friendly people. There is also a great gift shop with cheap shirts and fun items for everyone on your list. I took off one star as the bathroom really needed some help and had most of it closed off due to leakage."}
{"text":"I enjoy the friendly atmosphere for the casino. Small but nice. Cocktail girls are on it and ask if you need a drink. The cafe leaves alot to be desired. Service is too slow and don't sit at the counter. It seems your invisible. Food is fair. Need to update some machines but for the most part pretty cool."}
{"text":"My wife went on a bus tour which stopped here for lunch and I thought it was a joke when we pulled in, but we figured we could give the buffet a shot.  While waiting in line we noticed two things: 1 was that the buffet was normally $7 and that today happened to be asian theme day.  I got the orange chicken, pot stickers, and pork fried rice...and took one bite from each..and about died from an overdose of sodium.  Overall the food was so salty and mushy it was unedible.  My wife opted to give the salad bar a shot, which was fine till she tried the carrot stick which was mushy on the outside but still frozen rock hard on the inside.  We decided dessert was probably the safest thing to try, so we grabbed a pecan pie, and a brownie...how bad can that be right...Well the pecan pie resembled the carrot, extremely mushy on the outside and frozen solid on the inside.  The brownie was edible, but not by much.  After lunch we still had over an hour to kill at the casino, so my wife and i dropped $5 each into the penny slots and  played for as long as we could while being overwhelmed by cigarette smoke.  We ended up just waiting outside for the last half hour."}
{"text":"It's a locals casino. Very smoky but that is the norm at these Casinos. We go there to eat at their Iron Rail Cafe. Best fried chicken in the area."}
{"text":"The casino is small and reeks of smoke and bengay. Our grandparents stayed here for a night as a pitstop as they drove from southern Arizona to Northern Nevada. The room was decent. I hope they didn't pay more than $50 for it. It had 2 squishy queen beds and outdated furniture. It was at least clean. It was exactly as I expected.  The Steakhouse... What crap. We arrived at 6:20pm without a reservation as this is not a happenin joint, even for a Saturday night. There were 3 tables that had people at them. We waited for a few minutes, no one showed up, we walked in and peaked around, no staff in sight, finally a nice lady appeared and said she would go get the matre d. She walks next door to the cafe and a few minutes later the matre d walks over with to go bags of food... from the cafe. He asked if we had reservations and we said no. He said they were highly suggested, looked in his reservation book as if the place was super booked, but he would go set us up a table. A few minutes later a bus boy asked if we had been helped and if we had reservations. We said someone was setting up our table and no we did not have reservations. He then lectured us in the most rude way about how they are appreciated as they fill up and we should have made them as a courtesy and acted as if we were lucky to be eating there. We also got to hear about how they need to make sure they have enough staff to cover the tables coming in. While hearing this, we see carts of food being wheeled from the cafe over to the diners in the steakhouse. Why am I paying $22 for shrimp scampi and $27 for a NY strip that is coming from the same guy making the burgers and grilled cheese for $6 in the cafe? How is this considered upscale (ya know, for Boulder City...) So 10 minutes after we finally get seated we get our waiter to take drink orders. He was very nice. Our food took 40 minutes to come out. Reminder, there were 3, maybe 4 tables at this point. The place never got busy, we never even had anyone seated near us. The place was a ghost town. The food was meh. It also was what I expected. The shrimp were large and delightful, but accompanied by soggy overcooked pasta, the NY was nothing special and came with what tasted like boxed garlic mashed taters and overcooked cauliflower with cheese sauce, the regular cut prime rib our grandfather had looked freaking amazing and was huge, the halibut grandma got looked decent, but I did not care to taste it. We didn't get out of there for almost 2 hours from the time we walked up, ate and got our check. We didn't have drinks, appetizers, or dessert. Absolutely ridiculous. Don't act as if you are some fancy ass Strip steakhouse. Tourist aren't lining up and neither are the locals. Get a freakin grip. You need to do something about your awful staff. If you are going to act like a snobby steakhouse, then at least be nice to your guests, lower your prices and/or make better food."}
{"text":"Great food & super friendly staff! Older hotel but clean & well kept! A historic gambling site for those who want the old school style treatment."}
{"text":"Wow, so I'm not even the first to review this place. Just got back from four days in Henderson / Vegas and I got a room here that was a comp, so I have no  clue how much it even costs, but here is the low-down. Its obviously a bargain type hotel/ casino. They do have a $1.00 breakfast to bring people in, and its marginal, but as soon as you walk in the doors of the hotel/casino, you instantly get that tobacco smell that seems to linger until you get in your non-smoking room, provided thats where you are. The run down elevators are a microcosm to what kind of place it is, but the rooms are clean and the air works so once inside, its a decent and roomy place. Surprising was the bed I had. Actually a comfortable mattress, so the decent black-out curtains allowed me to sleep in a bit. i can't comment on the gambling there since I don't gamble, but overall, my experience was decent. I advise you to stay away from the lunch buffet. Bland food, orange colored water they pass off as orange juice, and our waitress seemed like she couldn't wait to get home. Can you blame her?   I've always thought, if you want to know how the food is, look around at the people eating it. After looking at the people eating it, I wanted to get the holy H out of there. Then again, that goes for most of the city anyway. I hate Vegas. I only went for a reunion of friends/family. Oh, did I mention it was 104 just about everyday? Ok, now I'm just bitching for the sake of bitching.   My favorite character was the woman that worked in the gift store. She had that 'been there, done that' look about her, and every time I walked by the place, the security guard was watching the counter and she was outside smoking.   Overall, I would stay there again if I'm in a pinch. If you're going to Vegas though, its too far from the strip to be practical. I happen to love the Venetian, if you don't mind shelling out for it."}
{"text":"Stopped by to see the casino. It was 85th anniversary so a small piece of cake, a glass of champagne and a band that was warming up for an hour. I had a few bud lights and left. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This place was great for us,  There were two fights in Vegas and all the rooms were well over a starting price of $100 and basically, you could not find a room. As we drove by we stopped here, they had 11 rooms left and we stayed for about 55 bucks.  The big pluses for us were good food that was well priced and decent rooms. Casino was nice too. Pancakes and eggs (and bacon I think) from late at night till early morning for $3.99. Nice dinners for way less than Vegas where it seems you can't get out of a place without paying $50 for dinner for two. Vegas used to have good food for cheap but not anymore.   This place is a little like a step back in time. Nice staff too, our daughter forgot her pillow and we were going to write it off,  my wife called and Mark in security went and immediately found the pillow as if we had lost something particularly valuable.  He put it in a box and shipped to us, no questions asked and without asking us to pay the shipping which would have been fair. THNAK YOU Mark in security. You made us smile.  It is also close to Hoover Dam (maybe 10 minutes or so) which we visited and was well worth the stop. You can also head to Searchlight and Cottonwood Cove (about 50 minutes) and go to the cove at night. Lay on the beach at the edge of the cove and watch billions of stars and count the falling ones. We counted about 20 in a few hours. Really, you should do this, one of those unplanned things that is magic. So beautiful. An unbelievable evening our family shared."}
{"text":"This smokey old casino has a little to offer. You must like cigarettes because you will breathe smoke and smell like an ols ashtray. You must be careful also because the owner Joe Disimone has his father lingering around will trick you out of your money. $7700 they got me for. Very smooth talker with alot of information on how to pay your creditors and be financially secure. Its untrustworthy information and Joe is a pathological lier. They are professional. Dont fall for the lies. Now he conveniently does not remember me. Crooked low down thiefs."}
{"text":"The front Desk and the housekeepers were amazing as far as the other employees they are very rude, and the people starred at my family the entire time we were there. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone"}
{"text":"I dont understand the horrible reviews....i guess im lucky i didnt go on asian night for the buffet...but i had the lunch buffet here as part of my hoover damn tour and honestly it wasnt bad! they were making fresh omlettes, waffles etc in addition to the normal buffet items...i hate eggs and i devoured the omlette, it was made to perfection...i mean yes it isnt bellagio but come on, dont be surprised at that.."}
{"text":"This is about the Cafe. Don't even think of eating here. Their food is nasty, old, spoiled and tainted with Food Poisoning! It's obvious management has no care over their quality of food, or their crappy service! The only people eating here are 80 something's; and when their all gone this place will be too! Ordered their Tbone special and what a joke, they first made me get a club card to even order it; after doing so I waited an hour for a dried up piece of beef jerky LOL. The place also smells like Mold and Mildew and is in desperate need for a tear down. To top all of that off, they refused to accept an Entertainment Coupon at checkout; stating that they made a mistake and didn't mean to have it printed. I called Entertainment company and they said that the Casino purchased the coupon in their magazine; but when too many people started using them that they wanted to back out. What a total JOKE of a company... Please do us a favor and Close Your Doors Now! Scammers!"}
{"text":"The downside:  The smokiness, and the lack of draw for the under retirement-age crowd.  The upside:  DeSimone's, which is WELL worth the drive.  This was not a restaurant I'd expect to go to, let alone enjoy, being a Vegas native that never has a reason to go out that way. I was so utterly wrong. Chef Robert has done an amazing job with DeSimone's, and it is a place i definitely both will recommend and return to.  The Steak Oscar: Three filet rounds atop mashed potatoes, with asparagus spears and a crab cake. The rounds were not thick, so I was not expecting them to actually BE medium rare inside--and they were so perfectly medium rare and excellently cut that they nearly melted in your mouth. The asparagus was perfectly done, and the crab cake had ZERO filler--it was actual crab, a tiny bit of red onion, a tiny bit of spices, but the taste of the crab came through clean and light (none of those chunky breadcrumbs here!!!). The highlight of this dish, though, were the filet rounds.  Cowboy Steak: Enormous, bone-in, and infused with rosemary and spices. This was requested medium rare, and again, was melt-in-the-mouth worthy. Joe Salad: I don't remember the description, but it's spinach, feta, walnuts or pecans (I can't recall!), a bit of pear, cranberries, and a dressing that has a light, sweet touch in a vinagrette style (I obviously did not read the description, I just know what i ate). VERY good. Vanilla Creme Brulee: Not the heavy kind in the ramakin, but light custard, with a delicate brulee top. Excellent without being heavy or over-filling. The prices are extremely fair, even for mixed drinks.  Service was top notch--Bob and Marife were excellent. I loved the fact that the dishes were wheeled out (on a marble top server no less), as opposed to carried--makes it much easier to manuever around a restaurant when not worried about crashing into a carrying server.  I didn't see the rooms, so can't judge there.  This will definitely be a stopping point en route to Laughlin, Bullhead City, or when in the Henderson area!"}
{"text":"Traveling through on a family road trip we were looking for an affordable room. Not bad but were not looking for a casino. While I like a historic hotel this property has not maintained a historic feel but rather a flash back to the 80's. After walking through the casino to get to the restaurant we decided we will not visit it and ate offsite. Not a bad room just some amenities we weren't interested in."}
{"text":"old landmark still smells kinda funky when you walk in but it has been like that for about the last 20 or so years that i can remember..lots and lots of old peoples with cains and walks and oxgen bottles."}
{"text":"Eh, the buffet is mediocre at best but was plentiful. Nothing special in the offerings but the salad was fresh and a few sides made it a filling meal. Staff very friendly and attentive even with the buffet. Kept the drinks full and the smiles coming."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here for lunch on our way to a hike near Lake Mead.  The lunch buffet was only $6.99, so we said what the heck and did that.  It was surprisingly good and actually had a good selection.  The staff members were really friendly, too.  Didn't stay in the hotel, but did play in the casino for a little bit.  Had fun.  They have a display about the history of the property, which you don't see too in casinos.    All in all, a very enjoyable stop."}
{"text":"Buyer beware!  They took a $50 security deposit, a bit steep and then took 14 days to get around to returning it.  That was after 2 phone calls, the first response being it takes up to 7days and it's only been 6.  The second call 11 days after the transaction I was told it is my banks fault.  I was just about to submit a grievance to my bank when I saw my money was finally returned 14days later.  I stay in hotels quite often, nicer than this place, and I have never seen my money, usually 25 dollars, not returned upon the maid clearing the room.  I will never set foot in this place again for any reason."}
{"text":"I'm from Vegas. My wife and I stayed here to stay close to the Art in the Park show while running our booth. We didn't get to check in till late. My wife was very happy with the check in staff. She said he was at tentative even to her while she was in line. Our hotel was clean. It had a large fridge and microwave which some how worked out nicely for us. She was provided complimented water bottles and they had free snacks in the room. I've paid $200 a night and have never gotten free snacks... Very happy with our quick stay. If we need a place close to Boulder, Lake Mead, or anything else on this side of town this will be our place."}
{"text":"This is a cool spot and a great place to stop and take a break when you are on your way to the Hoover Dam. You will really like something here. I remember the most awesome little gift shop where I got my cactus 10 years ago... I remember killer deals on food... Super low table limits. Maybe you just want to play some blackjack for 1/3 of the price on the strip for some practice. I know when I was 21 that is how I learned.   Sure this is an old smokey casino but it is well worth a break. Just walk through. Don't be afraid of the 60 and 70 year locals amusing themselves on slot machines. They are just finding a way to pass the time during their retirement. Remember they were young one day too."}
{"text":"Located way out in Henderson. I was pleasantly surprised. The casino was clean and well lit. The staff was friendly. They have a nifty little collection of classic gaming relics on display in the lobby. OK so it's not the Bellagio, but they don't pretend to be. If you are in the area, stop in, it was a lot of fun and rather charming in its own way. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"There I was, a BAMF on my motorcycle, hot wind blowin the bottom of my hair, the top covered by my dinged skid lid.   There was a time I was single, had a pocket full of tips and a couple of days every week to take off out of town and leave everything behind. The road was open to me and I was in control of the majority of my life.   I stopped by out of curiosity at first, secondly I wanted to pee because I had no idea on my first time how long a ride out to the dam would take.  Quaint, no big deal. I decided to stop off for lunch, too because I couldn't think of any restaurants at the dam. I figured I would have dinner in Az, since I would continue further down the highway after the dam. It was a great lunch at the Rail, but isn't any lunch on your weekend without a care or obligation in the world? (My cat was fed at home).  The dam is another review, as are my adventures in Boulder, the town I passed the first time I wanted to \"see\" what was in Az. That was a wash except for a roadside bar and diner before my gas ran out with another series of stories.   On the way home from those rides, I decided to stop off at Railroad pass weather I was hungry or not. And on a motorcycle, I could never have a few drinks after some first Friday scares and an accident I hinted about in my Carl's Jr. review.   I just read it's the 80th anniversary. I hope I have my Player's Junction slot club card. It's in a business card book I made with my \"obsolete\" slot cards (before management changes/ closures). I also have a lot of old employee i.d.s and other vital membership/ limited access cards.  The last time we stopped by, I was with my new g/f. We went on our first vacation together in Laughlin. On that trip was the first time we said \"I love you\" to each other, over the best pizza I ever had and a brown jug of microbrew.  We walked around. I loved going out with Lou, we walked all over the place until we \"got our fill,\" we really knew how to explore a place. Vegas is a place where sometimes you travel with a group, others always want to drag you somewhere else before you're ready.   On our Laughlin trip, it took me a long time to loosen up, but when I did I was a person I hadn't been in years. I shed my work issues and defenses, frustration and anger. I loosened up with a few drinks, some long river walks talking about Old Vegas. I'm really glad I got to share that best part of me with her.  Railroad Pass was empty, but there were a couple of felt dealers standing around and I got to talk to a couple of them for a bit, about work and being out there.   It's mostly a truck stop now. It's still a million times better than a Denny's. And it achieved quite a status of being under corporate McCasino chain radar and their hostile generic \"+ 1 star\" redecorating market research BS.   The Pass is legendary for being the first casino out of boulder lines that the dam workers could partake on their way to the far end of Fremont St. It's the earliest Gambling (uh, \"gaming\" hahaha) license continuously active, #4.  I hope that wasn't my last visit there."}
{"text":"Went to the Railroad pass for the St Patrick's Day Buffet was informed that the internet, postcards mailed out and all other advertising was wrong the price advertised for $6.99 was incorrect and they would not honor the advertised price. But the would give us a 15% discount for dessert in the cafe. What a slap in the face, when a person comes in with a paper showing the price you advertise and your told tuff luck for you. No where was there a sign saying there was a marketing error. We are locals and there are more than enough places that want our business, so beware when you are told one thing, because at the Railroad pass it could mean something else."}
{"text":"I am SO impressed with this little hotel.  We came from spending two nights in a lodge inside the Grand Canyon, eating one meal in each of the lodge's restaurants, meeting plenty of park staff, and this hotel/casino, in the middle of the desert, had, by far, the best staff and food of anywhere we'd been.  Everyone, from the front desk staff, to the security guards, to the servers was exceedingly nice and courteous, and always had a smile on their faces.  There are three places to eat, a diner, a buffet and a steakhouse.  I read a review that stated that the steak was the same at each location, so we opted for the diner.  The food was cheap and SO good, I couldn't believe it!  I ordered a patty melt for dinner and eggs, hashbrowns, toast and coffee for breakfast.  Our server was very nice and quick, and everyone in the diner seemed to be helping each other out.  Multiple people asked us if we needed a warm up on our coffee, more napkins, more water, etc.  I cannot praise this hotel enough solely on its staff.  Yes, it is a bit smokey downstairs, but just about as much as any casino on the strip.  The rooms did not smell of smoke or animals (it is a pet friendly hotel) and were a good size (ours had 2 queen sized beds, a table with two chairs, a dresser and a flat screen tv).  The bathroom did not have a tub (only a stand up shower), so if you have little ones that could be an issue, but I am unsure if other rooms do have a bathtub.  Overall, if I needed to stay in this area again, this would be my first choice, if not for anything else then for the food ha ha!! And at $50 a night, you can't beat it!!  Great job to everyone there, keep up the good work, it means a lot to people!"}
{"text":"$40 a night with AARP discount. The price is about the only thing I was happy about.  Front desk staff had zero personality to be honest but it didnt bother me too much, I just wanted to sleep! None of the front desk agents were nice - we interacted with at least 4 on our trip. Destiny was the worst. SO RUDE!!  Our car broke down and we were stranded here. Asked them for late checkout because our car wasn't quite fixed yet and they said they could give us half an hour. It's a bummer that they wouldn't accommodate.  Housekeeping knocked on the door before 8AM -- knocked, and knocked, and knocked. Walls are paper thin, we could hear some guy puking in the hall way, then another guy coughing and gagging for like an hour? I don't even know.   The buffet is the nastiest buffet you will EVER see. The cafe isn't the greatest but definitely safer to eat at.  Everyone in this town was so nice to us, it was offputting that these folks weren't."}
{"text":"We stopped in to play on our way by.  A new interchange has recently been constructed at this location and some were confused with the new route.  Once we got inside, things seemed a bit older than other casinos, but there were still plenty of patrons on site.  Their player's club offered rewards on food at the site.  At first, we misunderstood how the player's points worked, and ultimately found that there are a couple of types of points we were accumulating and we were nowhere close to getting food comps.  We'd have to play for many more hours to reach even one meal option.  The majority of the gaming machines in the casino are video poker.  I like to play the bonus type theme machines, but those are not as prevelant here.  The bar staff was hit and miss on friendliness and they have implemented a minimum dollar amount to play on the bar video poker machines to get free drinks.  There is a bar on the south side of the casino with a great view of the passing highway, valley, and mountains.  They have a cafe, buffet, and a higher end steak house to choose from for food options.  They have a gift shop with good prices on shirts and collectibles.  We will plan to stop back in while we are visiting the area."}
{"text":"The Railroad Pass Hotel has been serving people since 1931. I have been visiting it since 2006. It was a difficult decision whether to give it a 3 star or 4 star rating. The deciding factor was Railroad Pass Casino' s support and connectivity to Southern Nevada's precious River Mountains Loop Trail. Because I adore the River Mountains Loop Trail, I rounded my rating up to 4 stars. I separated my review on Railroad Pass into sections.  The Entrance:    Let me get to the point. Railroad Pass is no Bellagio.. It is an old school casino off US 93 at the Boulder City and Henderson border. It is not aiming for high rollers. Railroad Pass gets people into their property through inexpensive food and beer. When we drive toward Boulder City we have all seen the Railroad Pass sign advertising a rib or buffet special. Hanging from the building is an advertisement for $1 beer.    The parking lot is all surface. Toward the back of the building there is a trailhead parking lot of the River Mountains Loop Trail. There are more mobile homes than Corvettes parked in this parking lot.  The public areas:     The casino is small. Totally old school. Immediately after entering the casino, there is a bar to the left. On Saturday night there is an entertainer performing songs. I assume this is where the $1 beer is. To the right are the restaurants. The buffet looked unappealing. However, the Iron Rail Cafe is a value. This value also influenced my rating. I will be writing a review on it. In this area is the Railroad Bar and a steak house. If you continue straight from the entrance, you will pass computerized and table gaming.    Halfway to the left is the Heritage Room. It is a small museum. It displays newspaper articles on the Hoover Dam and Boulder City. Being in a casino, it is expected that there are antique slot machines.     Further ahead  is the gift shop and hotel registration. There is insufficient literature on the rooms here. The only thing I could write about staying here is that MGM Resorts owns the property.    When I playef Caveman Keno here, it was old school all the way. This was my first gaming experience being served a beer by a man on the staff instead of by a cocktail waitress. The games are modern to the point that it is ticket in ticket out. Their website advertises $1 Craps and $3 Blackjack.   The Exit:    When you walk out of the Mirage you have the volcano. When you walk out of the Bellagio you have the Fountains. But, when you walk out of Railroad Pass Casino you have the River Mountains Loop Trail parking lot. The Railroad Pass Casino supports the River Mountains Loop Trail with a maintained parking lot and trailhead.In my opinion this is a better attraction than the Mirage Volcano. When I exit Railroad Pass Casino in the afternoon, I usually get onto the River Mountains Loop Trail.    Lately I have been visiting the Railroad Pass for dinner. After exiting, I hop on the 95 and Henderson is a few minutes drive away.  The Yelp 100 Challenge Review 34 of 100."}
{"text":"This review is just for the lunch buffet at the Railroad Pass Casino.  We visited today and noticed the signs offering a 2 for 1 special on the lunch buffet.  What a deal we thought!  Well, it was a deal but the food on the buffet was probably the worst I had ever had at a casino buffet.  We've been to quite a few too!  To begin with much of the food was only lukewarm.  The fried chicken was dry and barely warm.  We wondered if any of the cooks (chef?) ever checked the food on the line.  Pizza, meatballs and potatoes were hot.  The other items we tasted were not.  Tried one piece of pie and thought it might be banana but after a bite or two still couldn't determine what it was.  Maybe dinner is better?  Not sure but not willing to give it another try."}
{"text":"First of all, I don't know what the bitchin' is about but you get what you pay for.  I just got back from Vegas.  While there I stayed here.  And it was not bad at all.  First of all, I am not the kind of girl that expects the best of everything.  This place I agree with Ashley G. is no frills.  Besides who's to stay in their room all the time.  I just need a place to crash.  Sure it's off the strip ( believe it or not, it's not that far of a drive) but it's freakin' cheap and away from all the traffic.  If you take the short cut, it's only 10 minutes away from Lake Mead...  Second of all, if you're really hungry, hit the 24 hour cafe and order the chicken fried steak...OM Goodness....it is yeummmy!  Happy Travels!"}
{"text":"Overall, a great deal! It is a small buffet, and obviously some things are better than others. But there is a good selection, and the Philly cheesesteak station was awesome! Great variety on the salad bar. You can make your own sandwich. Plenty of hot dish options, with a lot of variety. Quite a few dessert selections to choose from as well, including sugar-free options. Sunday evening dinner was only $9.18, you can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Use to be a great place, had been going there for over 20 years. Was a dive but had history and great people working there. Now there doing remodeling and you can't even park there, your forced to park a mile away and walk through a dark dirt parking lot just to get in, then deal with the new employees like the security guard with a attitude who looks like they picked him up from star nursery as day labor. Had a good for 20 years but now off to station casinos"}
{"text":"Overall an OK hotel. Stayed here a few times. The prices are usually a lot more fair than hotels closer to Vegas.   Great hotel to stay at when in town for Supercross."}
{"text":"Great old smokey hotel and casino. You never have to wait for a drink, even at nickle poker. The dollar breakfast or whatever the price is these days is good, everything is buttered, just the way I like it. Certainly not a high class joint and I would not want to stay here but for a low key slumming it is a fun place."}
{"text":"The Railroad Pass Hotel and Casino is open! I was just there with my family yesterday. Tried to check in on yelp which wasn't possible since this establishment is erroneously marked \"closed\"."}
{"text":"Aw gee. The massive sign promised a cheap steak and some gambling fun. Sadly there's not a sufficient air system to provide relief from the cigarette smoke, from the moment you walk in the door until you escape into the restaurant. The beverage list is very limited. Hubby likes a good beer, which minimum requires a Sam Adams. In this case nothing more substantial than Corona was available. The steaks are NOT cheap and the prime rib has nothing more than bulk to recommend it. A big flavorless slab of meat doesn't make me happy to part with a C note for the two of us. Do yourself a favor and get a steak from a butcher shop. You can't do worse than this.  My message for the semi-friendly (with a lot of work) wait staff is that you're lucky I'm a generous tipper. You didn't really deserve it but then you don't deserve being screwed over by the IRS either. Be nicer to your future customers."}
{"text":"This was my family's first trip to Vegas and we were flying blind when it came to hotels and restaurants but we felt like we hit the jackpot with staying in this hotel!  The rates were great, the food is great, the service is great! I did not meet one single staff member that was not friendly and happy to see us. I think that says a lot for how they are treated as employees.   I love the history of the hotel and the surrounding area. It was close enough to drive to the strip but far enough away to offer a desert get away feel. We had many options for sight seeing from this location including Hoover Dam, sight shot to connect to the highway for London Bridge, and the strip. If you are traveling with kids, I highly recommend taking a ride on the Nevada State Railroad Museum train which can be seen from the hotel.   If you are looking for glitter covered everything, do not stay here. This place is small compared to what the strip offers and not as showy. I recommend staying at this place for the old country feel and the amazing history that it holds.   The only negative point I have is that the room did not have a bath tub, just a stand alone shower. This I do not hold against the hotel because we failed to inform them we had a toddler with us and needed a bath tub for our stay.  I loved this hotel and will for sure be back."}
{"text":"The cool part is that it has some great history. I wish we would have kept on driving though. We were tired  and in poor judgement stopped without checking out the rooms or the food. We had two beds to choose from. I felt like Goldilocks. Do I choose the bed that sinks to the floor or do I choose the bed that the springs give me free acupuncture?  The next Goldilocks moment came when it came to eating. The restaurant or the buffet.  We looked at the buffet and it looked like it had been sitting out for days. The positive was it had the names above the food so you could identify it. We chose the restaurant and ate the special. Ewwwwww. Seriously there is no other words but ewwwwwww. The steak was nothing but fat. The mashed potatoes tasted better once I added the A-1 sauce and held my nose and then took a big gulp of water afterwards. My friend took a picture of the food and I begged her not to gross people out by making them see it. I was grateful though after going up and down floors we found a vending machine that worked and got a few candy bars. I give Twix a 5 stars rating.  Should have just drove the extra miles to Vegas."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful ever since it was sold to DeSimone the casino is locked down so tight it doesn't pay at all and you can tell by the crowd how few people around here that pretty much everybody already knows that"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and gambled a bit afterwards. Ok atmosphere good for groups, 45+ crowd. Good buffet, great service from the cocktail waitresses. Staff is friendly, check it out."}
{"text":"Very very clean room. People are very nice and someone is always near by to answer any questions. An older building and clearly a few scratches and old furniture, but our room was so clean and the bed is fresh new and so comfortable. Restaurant is simple and food is good. Didn't win as much money as I wanted, but was fun. We will return."}
{"text":"5:00 a.m. was tired and needing to sleep a few hours so I didnt wreck driving being so tired, and as my boyfriend and I walked in Amber gave my boyfriend and I a silent que of disgust and immeadiately refused us service before we even walked up to the sevice desk,due to a personality conflict, in my opinion. Mind you,  the big lit up sign in fact stating that there were \"available rooms.\" We were refused service because we are a interacial couple and it was not accepted in this hotel, I feel. When I called to speak to a supervisor there was a man that had an accent saying he was the supervisor named (Richard). He got on the phone ready to lay in his indirect 3rd world mentality tactics of approach on me in the way he was speaking and threatening me with letting me know that I was on a recorded line. Richard on top of it all started yelling at me, and hung up in my face when I made great efforts in rectifying an obvious ongoing issue. The enviroment is hateful, smells like an ashtray soon as you walk in and the service is the the worse. Don't bother coming to this hotel"}
{"text":"Was on our way back from Willow Beach Az, always see this place with great advertisement, finally made a stop. Will not stop here again. Service from players card desk personnel was horrible. She was not friendly or inviting. I definitely could've deposited her daily wage in a few minutes, chose not to gamble due to this impersonal experience.  The family was hungry went to buffet. One of the WORST buffets ever.  Prime Rib was terrible wasn't slow cooked, chewy. The waitresses didn't speak English. Hello were in America.  The chef was nice, accommodating.  Felt bad bcz it's not his quality of food,  it's the hotel/ casino's in general."}
{"text":"After living about 15 min away for the past couple years, I finally stopped by to check the place out.  If you're familiar with its history or at least into history, you'll be very glad to see that they have a room just inside one of the entrances that has historical photos, artifacts, etc. regarding the place, and the original safe room & safe are also on display.  But other than that, don't expect to bask in any history or track down unique old architecture -- it's just an average, older casino/hotel, albeit a clean & well-maintained one.  Pet-friendly hotel is a plus -- I saw a couple checking in with a nice pit bull.   I opted to have dinner at the buffet.  It was only $9, and for that price, the average person looking for a cheap all you can eat dinner would have done OK -- small salad bar, & then a variety of fish, fowl & meat.      As a vegetarian, all I could find was a salad, rice pilaf, & mashed potatoes.    I can do a lot better at most other buffets.   For the entree selection being somewhat limited, the choice of desserts was relatively large -- various types of pie slices, cookies, apples & oranges, ice cream, etc.    As to be expected, the clientele at the buffet was a typical representation of the demographics in the rest of the casino -- local old-timers from Henderson/Boulder City, some workers from the construction site across the highway, and mostly older people who stay at the hotel for nostalgia (as-in they've been visiting it for decades).   Many 18-wheeled & large motor homes were in the lot, as the Railroad Pass Casino & Hotel is the last place to stop & park before all the Las a vegas area traffic, if you're coming from the South.   This is also a convenient place to stay if you're in the area to see the Hoover Dam.     Just further up the road, there are other, in my opinion better, places to spend the night, especially if you're hungry & want a little more gambling excitement -- both the Fiesta Henderson & Sunset Station are   close to the highway, have more dining & recreation options (swimming pools, movie theaters, video arcade for kids, etc), rooms/rates should be similar, & there's just more of a 'vibe,' but without the loud obnoxiousness of many of the Las Vegas Strip type properties.  If you've had a long drive N on US-95 from Arizona and are dead tired, just wanting a basic meal and a fairly clean place to sleep without paying a lot of $$, this place could work for you, especially if you're in a motor home or towing a big camper & need to get some sleep before dealing with the often unpleasant Las Vegas area traffic.  The place advertises free wifi.  I tried to connect to it several times with my iPhone while in the buffet & despite what looked like a strong signal, the connection never worked."}
{"text":"Was sorely in need of a cool refreshing drink after visiting hoover dam on a very warm afternoon. Decided to stop here at this little casino in the middle of no where Nevada. So glad we did!  This is a very historical place, oldest operating casino in America. You can play forever on some of their older slots (talking max bet 15 cents!) there is a little room in the casino that highlights the history of the casino and the area, which was really informative.  Service was super friendly throughout the casino floor and at the bar. My thirst was quenched with great, comped drinks! This is a must stop in the middle of nowhere coming from, or going to, somewhere!"}
{"text":"From 8/17/2011 I don't know which is worse, the buffet or the casino. Food was horrible. I was on a tour bus from Hoover Dam and this was the buffet. Today was Asian theme - I vomited 30 min after eating."}
{"text":"Made a reservation online for a king size suite non smoking months in advance and when we got there to check in, we walked into our room to an overwhelming smell of smoke and an ashtray on the coffee table. Went back down and talked to manager and she tried to tell me I booked online so it's automatically booked as a smoking room. I brought up my online reservation and in plain site it said king suite non smoking. She said oh well I'm sorry but we have no other rooms available so here is some carpet spray. No other rooms available that weren't over $300 at any other hotels so we had to stay the night. We received no sympathy for the mixup, no comps or any kind of good gesture to try and make it better. Was not happy when we left. Asked for the manager to call us and have not yet had the phone ring!"}
{"text":"Pass the Railroad Pass Casino.  Do not stop, do not slow or some of the mediocre marginal food,  decor and overall theme may get on your shoes.  I made the mistake of stopping here for dinner.  Dinner!  What the hell was I thinking?  What can I say.  I was hungry, it was getting late.  They didn't even have the buffet that they were advertising on the light board!  It was closed...then take it off the freaking sign!  This place is pretty much a truck stop, nothing more.  OK maybe a little something more.  An ashtray.  I'll stop now before it gets ugly."}
{"text":"Review is strictly for the seafood buffet on Fridays featuring King Crab for 17.99 (used to be 15.99 all last year).  It's a bit out of the way but if you want the cheapest king crab in town, here is where to go. They don't have the long king crab legs as all the portions seemed to be of the sectional claw variety (see photo below).   Aside from serving the cheapest king crab in town, they also have a cooking station where they grill up fresh minute steak to your liking along with shrimp scampi sans pasta, quite my style. The steak, although thin, came out quite tender (had it cooked rare).   The dessert bar looked garbage so I went with the ice cream machine. Soft serve was middle of the road quality but they offer hot fudge and hot caramel which was nice since most places think they can get away with \"chocolate sauce\", totally NOT the same...and I went back for seconds.  Expect to dine among a local crowd. Service, while friendly, is hit or miss.   Note: The rest of the buffet looked like a miss but the clam chowder and chicken noodle soup weren't horrible.  Steak+shrimp+king crab+hot fudge sundaes for $17.99? Keep it to that and it's a 3.5 star \"A-OK\"...not rounding up because the drive from Summerlin sucks and they raised the price."}
{"text":"Little casino off the beaten pass.  Cool place to take a risk on gambling.  I played the blackjack table and actually won.  Did okay on roulette, and craps.  Worth checking out."}
{"text":"First of all please know I like dives and old Vtg Vegas era stuff so if you want glamour and all the bells and whistles this place is not for you.  The review is for the casino and food only.  The slots are tight but you can play for a penny and get the free drinks all afternoon if you want to. They do have keno and poker and some of the more modern penny games like Sex & the city and Breakfast at Tiffanys.  The place is small but there are table games and an event room that they have some conventions or craft fairs sometimes.   The staff for the most part are friendly, and their points seem to add up quick, or maybe you just need less points here to actually get something for your play. 8 points gets you a free buffet and they don't play games where they raise the price on holidays points wise. I can still use only 8 points on thanksgiving for an example. Mondays and Tuesdays are best for Seniors as they have specials.  Usually a few days or so you can get 2x or 3x the points the specials change every month.  The café is fine.  Nice cheap deals and cheap strawberry shortcake. Some of the seating is a little small but the seating can be moved around a little if needed.  The Steak house is better than I thought it would be. The steak was well made and the sides were great. The price wasn't too bad considering you can use points ( 50 points here, but worth it). I want to go again. Nice comfortable seating, dark and old school inside.  The Buffet... ah the buffet. Well it all depends on when you go and your luck in general. One day they'll have everything hot and ready and have fresh chicken and tender steaks, thick prime rib and all your faves. The next day one look at the salad bar alone can send you screaming... I have had 4 star experiences and some less than 1 star experiences in this place. I suggest looking before you buy in. And they have a world night or Asian night... I forget which day of the week... RUN! That night is the pits!  All in all a fun little old school shabby chic place to hang in."}
{"text":"Looking for some cheap eats off the strip in nearby Henderson? This is your place. Railroad Pass advertises itself as the \"Nation's longest running casino\", having been established in 1931. That in and of itself is a reason to check this place out.  This restaurant advertises an $8.99 Prime Rib or Rib Eye Steak special, I went for the steak. For the price, you can't ask for much more.   If you're passing by the area and looking for a quick place to grab a bite, you could do a lot worse than Railroad Pass."}
{"text":"Nice hotel to visit with a view of the \"not so full\" Lake Mead\". Very friendly staff, and seems to be full of people"}
{"text":"What a nice little casino!  My dad picked me up at LV airport, and on the way back to Havasu, we stopped here for a very late dinner.  I had the ribeye special.  For $8.99, I got a 10 oz. ribeye, a little side of fresh peas, and out of this world mashed cheesy potatoes, with a side of gravy- of course!  The food was great for the price"}
{"text":"Best to know what you're in for before you get here.  Located in Henderson, NV, Railroad Pass is about half way between Las Vegas and Hoover Dam.  It's a nice stop if you're making that trip.  It's a sparse, older crowed.  Not a very big casino so, depending on the day and time, you may not find the gaming you are looking for.  We go there for the $1 craps tables - typically later in the day as well as weekends.  We got on a table around 4 or 5pm on a Friday and mostly had it to ourselves - very excellent!    While there, we needed to eat, so we tried the buffet.  Not great.  Some of the food was okay, but the steaks were below average (thin - not even sure what cut they were).  You could order the steak however you wanted (and watch them cook it), but it was pretty much random what you got.  Bottom line - don't go there for the ambiance!  Go there for the $1 craps and, when you're done, return to where you were at otherwise and have your fun there."}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed the prime rib in the cafe in the past until tonight!!!  I ordered the 12 oz prime rare and when I got it it looked like it wasn't just freshly cut but exposed to the air for awhile, and it looked awfully small for 12 oz.  I said something to the server and instead of her getting a mgr she just said yea that's the 12 oz.   I will never come here again!!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I were in town for a wedding and stayed at this hotel. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!!! We had to switch rooms twice due to hair in bed and moldy/filthy shower and filthy bathroom. We decided to stay and eat at our hotel buffet. The food was all cold/old with poor quality cuts of meat/chicken and thin dried layer on top of all salads/soups and gravies. We had a shared wall with loud music playing all night long. We woke up early 5:45 am to a loud noise outside our door. We opened our door and saw that the maid was running a pump in the laundry room. We asked her if she could close the door and she refused. We asked to speak to Management and they never came to counter or answered phone call/messages. We tried to save money by staying a little outside of Las Vegas strip hotels...Next time we will pay the extra $$ and stay somewhere else . ."}
{"text":"My family and I were on our way to the Grand Canyon and during our multi-destination road trip and we needed a place to sleep. Apparently there was something going on in Vegas that even Circus Circus' going standard room rate was $300+ for the night. So we kept driving and found this little spot off the fwy. Saw some reviews and was skeptical but it actually wasn't half as bad. Check in was quite quick, plenty of parking available, pets are welcome given they have poopy bags available outside, and kids were welcome too. We paid less than $100 for the night. I did try to use a coupon from yelp with check in but the front desk nor the manager knew what yelp even was lol.   When we got into our room, I realized that the AC wasn't working after waiting for the room to cool so I called the front desk and they sent someone right away. Unable to fix it promptly, they switched us to the next room over.   Overall, service was great, rooms were clean and quiet."}
{"text":"After a trip to Hoover dam, the fam and I were starving, so we decided to check out this lunch buffet at Railroad Pass.  This was probably the worst mistake of the trip.  Yes, the buffet was only, seriously, $7/person, but I now understand why.  Ugh.  The theme of the buffet was \"Asian\" food, so I knew it wouldn't end well.  No one should really cook \"Asian\" food unless they are actually Asian.  (....and I'm pretty sure the chefs were there not of any sort of Asian descent.)  I lightly sampled some of the \"safe\" foods, like orange chicken, beef and broccoli, pot stickers and fried rice.  Mistakes.  All of them.    I then opted for the sandwich bar and scarfed down some roast beef.  I left feeling pretty ill (like, really), so I'm not sure if I can attribute that feeling to the food or to sun poisoning.  Either way, I still can't bring myself to eat a roast beef sandwich without associating it with this buffet.  So, in conclusion, if you are starving and you pass this place, please keeeep on moving and get back to Vegas ASAP to enjoy a GOOD buffet."}
{"text":"How am I ever going to lose weight? The club sandwich has 2 types of animal in it, and not much salad. Everything comes with fries or potato salad. Its delicious, and sits in my stomach like a brick.  We go into the gaming room for some $3 blackjack, and the attendant explains to us when it's good to hit, sit, and double up. Obviously we didn't get it, as we both sit there waiting for her to deal when we haven't got any bets out. Chappy laughs heartily at us gambling novices."}
{"text":"--- Review from www.JerseyGirlinVegas.com ---  The selfish side of me is a bit reluctant in writing this post.   You know when you find one of those places that's a diamond in the rough and you don't want the world to know about it? Well that my friends is the Railroad Pass Resort & Casino's Sunday Champagne Brunch.  Last Sunday morning my boyfriend and I both woke up and we were both trying to convince one another to make breakfast. Well, that wasn't happening for either of us. I popped opened my handy computer and began looking up inexpensive brunches in Las Vegas. That's when I found the Sunday brunch at Railroad Pass. It was listed at just $7.99 per person which for a breakfast buffet with champagne is a stellar deal.  When you visit Railroad Pass, do not expect the Wynn. They are an older property that brings you back to old Vegas. It's like you're stepping back in time which is pretty cool.   When we arrived to the buffet, we found the price had jumped up to $8.99 which was fine. We entered and were quiet surprised at the selection they had. They had french toast, breakfast sausage, bacon, all sorts of fresh fruit, biscuits and gravy, chicken fried steak, desserts, cereal, an omelet station and even fresh hash browns!   This is a great find and I recommend anyone who's willing to drive out to Railroad Pass do so and quick, before everyone else catches on and they raise the price!"}
{"text":"Nice old school place. Restaurant is always pretty good and reasonably priced just don't expect anything fancy but it's not that kind of place. Hotel rooms better than expected flat screen tv clean good air conditioning. Only negative was the bed. Very hard and not comfortable woke up sore but room very good price for amenities that you do get"}
{"text":"Lots of food & drink deals at the bars and restaurants, including $1 food and beer. This is an older casino and retains some of the charm of an 80 year old property. I went here a few years ago for the Pass's inaugural \"comedy nights\". I couldn't resist checking this out, and even played a little in the smoky casino. The comedy show was not well attended, and they had it for 4 weeks. I did enjoy the shows, but I don't think they have done any since then. The buffet is OK, it offers standard fare for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I spent one day in Vegas this weekend and it had to be the most eventful one day road trip ever. Maybe the whole Hangover movie was putting out energy vibes my way or something. Anyway, here is my lighthearted and long winded review of the Casino/hotel that I stayed in. It is Tongue and Cheek of course but I wondered about it before I booked it so I am being thorough for my Yelpers.   To stay in Henderson or the Strip??? Well, it depends on your goal in Vegas. Ask yourself, \"Why am I in Vegas?\" Then of course keep it to yourself because of you know, the whole \"unwritten\" rule thing.-lol-- If you just want a place to sleep and have a car this is the best deal in town. It really is and I am not kidding. 49 bucks for a Sunday night stay in a full casino type of resort. (No crazy extra resort fees either) I think the next night was like 18 dollars a night. Jezhhhhh! I looked all over for a hotel/motel that was cheaper and came up with \"Nada.\" In fact most were double the price. I only needed one night to lay my head down before the long ride back home. I did notice though that their Saturday rate was 79 dollars. All other places were way over $150 for that date.   I was all set to book another place for my one night. This place will remain nameless. Let's just call it the Norman Bates Inn. You know, it is one of those seedy motels hookers go to, in a very dubious part of Downtown/Strip. Let's also just say, it is an open style courtyard motel where all the doors open to the Morgue, Errrr,  Ummmmm, I mean parking lot, Ummmmmm, I mean street with no security, no services type of motel. You know the ones where they find dead bodies and all? And to boot, The Bates Inn even cost more. Now I am pretty brave at times, but why risk it? And why in the world would I pay more to view the oldest professions in town?   So, this was a great deal because it kept me alive being an enclosed casino and all, (Just kidding, or am I?) has a small, full service, not very busy gaming area, (nothing fancy schmanzy which works out great for me) a few restaurants, two bars, and even a Players Club. ( I got a free room to come back just for signing up. WOW!) I wonder if the Bates Inn has a Bar? Sorry, I digressed there for a minute and not sure I want to even ponder that thought too much. So in the end this was a \"steal\" for just needing a bed and saving 30 minutes on the car ride home. The staff members were all either nice, disinterested, or spectacular. More of them were on the wonderful side. The head of housekeeping is a \"Hoot\" and The servers in the Cafe were really, really, nice. I see other Yelpers mentioned that too. It is a well deserved comment because they really were like the nicest ladies I have ever met in an eating establishment. The food is not all that great but it is passable and they will try to make it right.   Please note, yes the rooms are very run down. This casino is very old. Historic. Check your key and paper to know what room you are really in despite what they tell you at the front desk. Now that's my first little secret Vegas story, wink, wink. The beds were pretty comfortable. I am not sure why another Yelper said no Alarm Clock. My room had a clock, lamps, beds, table, chair, wall unit ac that worked too freezing well, towels, iron, ironing board. Gosh Darn It, my room even had a TV too, not that I used it. The shower does have issues though. The shower is very old and is very hard to work. I got a great workout turning it on and off. I did notice some rust, or darker stains on the walls. I don't think it was mold but ya never know. (Just aged.) I personally did not care since it was clean. I was not in the room to spa it up or be fancy. I knew this was an old place before I got there and you should too. My room was just fine for the price.  Actually for the price I thought the room was even great. Go to the Strip if you want luxury.   If you plan on drinking or hanging on the Strip this hotel is NOT for you. It is too far away at 20 miles or a 35 minute drive. No drinking and driving please. I don't care about the whole \"unspoken rule\" thing when it comes to a DUI right? I helped someone who got hurt at the Smith Center because he was drinking, walking, and trying to drive. When I finally arrived back at this hotel after numerous witness statements I was drenched in blood. True story number two! And here I thought the whole blood thing would happen over at Bates.    So, in a nutshell if you just need a room to crash or don't mind driving to your fun like a local, then stay here.   Pros- Price, safety, location, Railroad/Vegas history memorabilia, The bar has a great window view, And yes, a train comes by outside, small casino if you do not gamble  Cons- Location for Strip fun, run down/older facility if you want fancy, small Casino if you gamble  Choo, Choo, Bye, Bye!"}
