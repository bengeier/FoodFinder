{"text":"Two glasses of Malbec and a plate of lobster fritters, to get things started. Wow. Finally, great food. Crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside. Great taste and texture. These could become my new food group.  Entrees. For me fish tacos (fried) with house side; for her Combine meatloaf with garlic mash and slaw. Three choices of hot sauce at the ready. I am impressed with this place. Very impressed. My mustard vinagrette was perfect and everything was fresh. Great balance of flavour in the tacos and did I say fresh; as in homemade tortillas fresh. My significant other could not finish her meal, so I rose to the occasion. Amazing meatloaf. If you have never experimented with blending ground meat, you need to try this. Now. Meatloaf, burgers....etc. It adds another level of flavour to the plate and helps maintain moisture. The wrapping of double smoked bacon, just melts in your mouth.   In a world of poor mega portion platings, (1 kebab and 4 cups of rice) this was spot on and is just what this area needs. Close to transit and great food. It would have been a 5 star if it wasn't for the inquisitive wasp and the noise. We were only 1 of three seatings in the place at the tme and it was LOUD. Some may like that kind of environment, not me.  Grab some friends, go here. Everybody order something different and sample. The service is top notch and very friendly. It doesn't get much better than this. Enjoy."}
{"text":"My hubby and I had the pleasure of eating at this 3 week old resto in our neighbourhood last night.  It was a pleasure to get to know Amy and Albert (the brother and sister co-owners) and to experience the beautiful esthetic of their space. They were both extremely friendly and good humoured. Albert even offered us shots of Tito's vodka, which went down extremely smoothly!  The fish tacos were yummy and the atmosphere was very relaxing.  Go!"}
{"text":"SoCal/Mexican eats on the Danforth? Now this is a much-needed addition to my 'hood. The Danforth is obviously filled with Greek restaurants, but those who don't know the area as well may not realize that we've got a wide variety of other cuisines as well, from Thai to Italian to Chinese to Japanese...and now some Southern-California-style Mexican food! I didn't even realize how much we were missing it, but now I don't know how we went on so long without it!  I had the delicious Chipotle Pulled Chicken Burrito (served with guacamole, win!) with a side coleslaw. As some other reviewers have noted, the slaw was definitely on the vinegary/peppery side, but I thought it complemented the dish really well. My boyfriend had the Veggie Fritter Tacos which I stole a bite of and enjoyed, too. We started the meal off with a plate of taquitos - a dish I'd somehow never tried before! Basically, they're a Mexican version of spring rolls, filled with potatoes and other goodies and deep-fried. Um, yum.  Service was friendly and prompt - definitely still signs that they're a new restaurant and super eager to please. I'll be back when I need a break from my other Danforth standards...and I need to try a mojito next time, and some dessert!"}
{"text":"The Bad:  I found this retaurant to be excessively noisy.  My friends and I literally had to shout at each other to hear anything anyone was saying.  The service was horrible; friendly but far too slow.  In addition to it taking a ridiculously long time to order a bottle of wine, for it to come to the table, order our meals, for them to come to the table, to then ask for the bill and wait, and wait, and wait... I finally had to get up and approach someone to ask again if we can have our bill.  Pretty annoying.  The So-So:  I had the fish tacos.  They were mediocre.  Really, it's the hot sauce you put on them that spices them up - no pun intended.  My boyfriend had the Adobo steak burrito.  It was DELICIOUS!  The Good:  All this complaining to say that I would go back but likely forego the fish tacos and try one of the other burritos.  I should also mention, I called about 30 minutes ahead (as other reviewers had suggested) and requested a table be reserved for us.  Much to my surprise when I arrived there was a line-up at the door and there, amongst a full house, was my little table for four set aside for my friends and I.  We waited a couple of minutes and were ushered by others who I suppose did not call ahead!  Very helpful hint from the others, so thanks!"}
{"text":"The service is wonderful and the aesthetic nice. They take good care of you in so many ways including being attentive to food allergy concerns.  The pricing is steep and though the food quality is great, the portions are not."}
{"text":"Food was great !  Service was laughable !  Had or table in giggles at how rude the wait staff was. She plainly couldn't give a rip.    No tip for u   ; )"}
{"text":"I read about how amazing their fish tacos were, so on a Friday night, five of my friends and I came hungry... and were disappointed.   I had the grilled fish tacos, and it was mediocre at best. It was bland, and definitely needed some hot sauce and/or salsa that they had provided on the table. Without the hot sauce, it was dry and almost tasteless. The creme fresh was good, but it did not make the dish worth it. The tortilla was rubbery and tasteless.   The service was hardly service. The waitress came by at the beginning, took our drinks and waited half an hour before taking our orders. When the food came out, she failed to give us cutlery. We all ate, and sat around waiting at least another 45 minutes before she came back for dessert.  I was craaaaving beignets, so I ordered their apple beignets for dessert... and the dessert is the only reason why I am giving it 2 stars and not 1. It was actually quite delicious - and am craving them again today.   Suffice it to say, unless I want a long drink and beignets, I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the chipotle grilled chicken tacos (with caesar salad) and they were amazing. Also enjoyed the service and their caesar is the perfect compliment for brunch."}
{"text":"Just had their new brunch today. All I can say is yum. I got the Chicken and Bacon Waffles. My friend had the egg casserole.  I hadn't been here in a whlie, but when passing by today and hearing they now do brunch we decided to check it out. They also have a new chef, so maybe that's making the difference. Will come back again to try out some of the brunch offerings."}
{"text":"The food, while good is somewhat overpriced for what it is. 3 chicken tacos for $16.95? No bueno"}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!  The Combine is a very nice, both happening and romantic, spot for a drink in a convenient and hip location. I wouldn't hesitate to bring a date, go for a drink with buddies, or to have a party of 20 or so here. They have a good selection of beers, pleasant and professional service, and some very good food. I can't go to 5 stars, but it's a solid 4. Combine gets the job done, and I wouldn't hang out with anyone who wouldn't like this place.  4 stars"}
{"text":"This place is very overpriced for the quality of the food. I had the burger and it was very bland and dry. It doesn't come with any condiments on it, and my server didn't even ask if I wanted any. The side salad was very disappointing also, didn't seem very fresh and had a  flavourless dressing. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Had the burger with cheese and it was really good. It was a big patty with fresh toppings.  The restaurant is in a great location if you are going to a show at the danforth music hall which is right across that street."}
{"text":"Well, the fish tacos were not as yummy as I imagined them to be after reading all the other Yelp reviews of this place.  My friend ordered the pulled pork burritos and I though his tasted very good.  Overall, it was a good experience, but the absolute best part of our lunch was the dessert.  We ordered the pumpkin pie, not expecting anything out of the ordinary, and man, it was the most extraordinary pumpkin pie I have ever had!!!!!  This pumpkin pie tasted like it was made with real pumpkin, and the crust was crumbly and had a slight caramel/molasses taste.  It was serve with whipped cream and berries, and the slice was not a slice, it was more like a chuck!  The pumpkin was cool to the mouth and the texture was heavenly!!  I would come back to this place just for the pumpkin pie.  Alcoholic drinks at this place were way too expensive and coffee was blah."}
{"text":"The owners are lovely and you can tell they take pride in their restaurant. Great decor, cozy feel.   My partner and I shared chicken and beef tacos, which were great (although they could use some spice!). Also had the popcorn shrimp app - amazing."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here with DW one day for lunch.  We were greeted by a really fun, polite server.  Atmosphere is casual, space is small, but cozy.  DW had the fish tacos, and I had the pulled pork burrito.  The good thing about this experience was that our server suggested a certain hot sauce to go with our meal. Think of it like a wine pairing, but with hot sauce.  Her taste in hot sauce was on the ball because the pairing was great.  We tried different sauces, but the one chosen for us went the best with our meal.  It's a little pricey, but well worth it. Would definitely return (in fact I've been here twice already)"}
{"text":"There's good and bad things about the The Combine.   The good - the food, I've tried almost everything (except the fish tacos...), and like it all. The wait staff are really nice as well.  The bad - the owner (the woman - her brother is a doll).  But she is unbelievably rude.  She raised her voice at a friend of mine because she asked for the fish tacos in lettuce wraps (it's a dietary issue).  My friend is the calmest nicest person ever, never gets upset with wait staff, she's extremely polite and asked nicely.  The owner told her to stop ordering outside the menu, that it upset her chef (seriously? what a Prima Donna if that's the case, which I highly doubt). At one point she actually shook her finger in her face.    This woman told me that her restaurant was better than any of the others on the Danforth because she had class and she lived in the neighborhood.  She kept dissing Allen's across the street - that's been there forever.  Yikes!!  I hope she reads these and cleans up her act, because the restaurant has potential, but not with that kind of attitude.  I'm giving the restaurant 4 stars for the food and wait staff, if I could rate her alone, it would be a minus..."}
{"text":"SERVICE: Staff service is usually good, but sometimes friendliness is not so genuine.  FOOD: Potato Taquito's are FANTASTIC, the Fish Tacos also very fresh. I highly recommend asking for the house-made hot-sauce. Strange you have to specifically ask for it, otherwise you get Tobasco (what a shame!).  DRINKS: Overpriced considering, although they do have a thorough menu.  Priced a bit expensive for the portions, but the Danforth is notoriously over-priced.  Also worth mentioning: - Gluten-free friendly/accommodating, although the menu isn't too exhaustive if you must eat GF - Nice decor; back patio is nice!"}
{"text":"Despite being leery of any place that calls itself an \"eatery\", I have been to Combine twice now (with 2 and 3 people) and ordered different items each time. Sad to say it's hit and miss with nothing in between: either wonderful fresh flavours, or utterly bland. Decor is also lacking flavour. Gotta say if you're depending on a hot sauce for flavour then the food is not doing its job. Also: what's with the pepper mill pushing in a Mex-ish restaurant??? ...another signal that Combine doesn't stand behind their flavours."}
{"text":"I don't know how I haven't reviewed this place yet! I've been here twice. The Combine Eatery is a lovely family run restaurant with fabulous food! We have tried a few different things, for apps we decided on the seafood fritters which were excellent. They were light and fluffy, most places deep fry to the point where you get oil residue in your mouth, this didn't happen here. They came with two different dips, some sort of sour cream one, but the best by far was the second, a spicy aioli. The first time we went I had selected the fried chicken sandwich, which was to die for, a huge portion and was so delicious. It comes with a zesty cabbage slaw (on the sandwich) and fries. The second time I tried the mac and cheese, it too was delectable, super creamy and rich. They also let you have your choice of TWO sides, oddly enough I picked coleslaw and salad, both were great. The coleslaw was clearly home made, no pre-packaged yuck. Both times we have come last minute and the restaurant was great finding us a spot both time (one being last mother's day!!). The lady who runs this restaurant is wonderful and greats people at the door. In the end we will be back for more delicious food!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the place, such friendly hospitality. I think I got a hug here. :)  Unfortunately it had fell short of my taste expectations.   Yeah there is a good selection of hot sauces but the heralded Fish Tacos were just alright..  they left me hungry.. the tasteless slaw inside of them didn't help either.  On top of this I had even more 'slaw on the side. Eek I should have ordered fries.. screw the carbs!  The table service could be improved it took forever to leave to pay the bill..   Perhaps it wasn't a good time (Fri night).. the kitchen is small, if entire restaurant puts in their orders be prepared to wait a long time before getting your food.    I'll try again though but this was my honest take the first time around.."}
{"text":"I give this place one star for the decor and the service (both of which were excellent).  The menu was a FARCE!  $16 (before tax and tip) for three insipid fish tacos on store-bought tortillas and a mound of soggy flavourless slaw!  Same dish from a food truck: $8 with better flavour.  $17 for a BOWL OF SOUP.  Disgusting poop-brown \"smoked shrimp bisque\" that was poorly made and tainted by an overdose of  liquid smoke flavouring.  Although it claimed \"Entree\" portion, it did not come with any sides, bread or accoutrements at all and it certainly did not warrant the insane price.    Seriously, I can NOT believe this place garnered positive reviews!!!  The food is a JOKE"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to going here for a while, because I had heard good things. I am vegetarian and got the veggie burrito, and I was pretty disappointed. There was some type of veggie patty in the burrito, and overall, I just didn't really enjoy my meal. I will say though that two of my friends did really seem to enjoy it.   I think this place is probably fine, depending on the type of food you order, but not the best for vegetarians/vegans. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"note that this review is ONLY for brunch. I've had dinner there, and like many others, feel it's totally overpriced and the tacos are REALLY lacklustre.   However - their brunch is really great. I have been many times, I live in the 'hood, and I would truly vouch for it.  Chicken and waffles? Divine! Down & Dirty Danny? Delicious mess. Everything is about $12-$15 which is fine considering the portions.  Go - try brunch. Forget this dinner nonsense."}
{"text":"Delicious Food, delicious atmosphere. Best restaurant I have been to in a while. The menu is not overwhelming. Pricing is worth your money. I had Lobster Tacos that were fantastic. Authentic shells and fusion perfection inside that included huge chunks of lobster. If you're a hot sauce snob, try the house brand. Sweet, savoury, spicy. Go here."}
{"text":"Brunch of choice was lobster tacos and drink of choice was Amsterdam Big Wheel (Amber). I was not disappointed. I would choose this over anyone's lobster rolls. This is the real deal. Service was great and is a toddler-friendly establishment"}
{"text":"We had our first visit to Combine this morning and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. My wife had the bacon waffles with fried chicken - delicious.  They were about $15 which was good value because the serving size was large (I got to finish them off).  I had a big breakfast sandwich but I forget the name. Bacon, two over easy eggs, avocado, sauce etc all on a cheesy bun. Tasty and well proportioned - also around $15.   The owner(s) are attentive and our server was excellent.  We plan on returning to try the fish tacos and some other fare."}
{"text":"This place has some rough reviews so I wasn't really sure what to expect.  I went anyways with a friend though as we were going to a concert across the street after.  I got the Toquitos (not sure if that is how they are spelt!) I loved them, the wrappers were super crispy like a spring roll and inside was a lot like a perogies.  The other thing I got were the sweet potato fries and they were so addictive, my friend and I ate so many of them that we thought we were going to get sick...and then we ate even more!  The dipping sauce definitely makes them but the fries themselves are really good. My friend go the daiquiri which she really liked and it was huge, I got the mojito as well the lemonade, I think the lemonade was a bit better so I would go with that again.  I really didn't think the prices were too bar - we are in Toronto still and it is a super funky place. I would come back, but I'll wait until summer because I want to hang out on that patio!"}
{"text":"Not very often am I taken aback by the sheer dullness of a plate of food, but the Combine seems to excel in this territory. My partner and I went there last night for our anniversary based on the favorable reviews on here. I don't know, maybe we have high expectations when we're shelling out $70+ on a meal? Maybe innocuousness is something people value highly on here? I guess we didn't get food poisoning, so that's a plus. But I gotta say, aside from the atmosphere & service which were both quite good, the food is nothing to write home about (unless it's to warn your family not to bother spending their hard-earned cash here).     I wish I had taken a photo of my partner's chicken tacos... Three flour disks with plastic-looking sticks of filet, literally Way Too Many Tomatoes and a heavy-handed application of crema. Not appetizing. By her account, not worth the repetitive hand-motion to lift to her mouth. I know that there are lots of new ways to interpret the taco - but is the \"we haven't done groceries in a week, can we make tacos with this?\" approach feels a little unseemly when you're charging $18 for it. Apparently it didn't taste like anything... I didn't bother trying.   I got the burger, and although I don't expect to have my mind blown by any meat sandwich, I don't want to be totally bored by it. Meat was kinda dry and charred. Side salad was like \"what's the point?\".   Overall I would like to compliment the restaurant for providing good sustenance. I went in hungry and left not hungry. They served us food and we left and will probably not come back."}
{"text":"We out on Friday with a few friends to try this place.  I find out that they do not take reservations but you can \"call ahead\" 30 minutes before you plan to arrive and they will try best to hold a table for you.  I was travelling from work and arrived 30 minutes earlier than when I was supposed to meet up with my friends, so I grabbed a table and got a drink while I waited.  Food When my friends arrived, we decided to try out as many dishes as we possibly could to share.  Appetizers  Poutine - very good, rich, lovely beef gravy.  The shoestring fries were surprise.  Would order this again.  Lobster Fritters - ok - they were cornmeal like, could not really taste the lobster.  The sauces they were accompanied with were great, one hot and creme fraiche like.  Entrees  Fish Tacos - Grilled and Fried - highlight of the meal made delicious corn tortilla, I preferred the grilled fish tacos to the fried.  Coleslaw was fresh and peppery which also yummy.    Dessert Key Lime Creme Brulee - recommended by the owner, it was very good, smooth, a bit tart and perfect sweetened.  The sugar top crust was the right crunch.  I wonder how their desserts would taste like after experiencing this one.   Service  When I initially got there, there was a bit of confusion because I was ahead of a family with a baby in a stroller.  I grabbed 4 empty spots on their large communal high stool table and waited for about 10 minutes till someone noticed me.  After that, service was much better, they were attentive.  The owner was very sweet and thanked us for our patronage.    I highly recommend this place for fish tacos + more; Combine Eatery adds another dinner alternative on the Danforth."}
{"text":"Who would have thought it, fish tacos are all the rave these days!  Combine Eatery has been popular amongst the Yelpers.  I finally made it out here to check out the legendary fish tacos.  On Friday night this place was packed! The menu has a good variety of items...items other than tacos that sounded great!  I was going to get the fried shrimp burrito, but the waitress told me I'd be too full and I have to try the tacos.  For an appetizer, we had the special: Duck and blueberry poutine! Lots of shredded duck meat, curds (could have used more curds), gravy which was pretty sweet from the piles of blueberries. It looked like a festive holiday version of poutine. The fries were a bit overcooked but other than that, we weren't disappointed and it was a gigantic serving.  Tacos:  Three tacos for $15.95.... They were good though.  You can get the fish deep fried or grilled.   I went with deep fried, I might as well, I had poutine as an appetizer. The fish was moist and soft, lightly crispy, salty but not overly flavourful.  I tried my friend's carne tacos.  A lot of meat, a lot heavier than the fish tacos, and harder to eat.   I preferred the fish.  What are these hot sauces people are talking about?!  I didn't get any!!! =(  After the poutine we were full.  After the tacos, we were beyond full. But I still wanted dessert.  Beignets with walnut crusted ice cream, apple/walnut sauce with fresh whip.  That's one heavy dessert.    The fried donut things were a bit overfried...but when smothered in sauce, they softened up.  The apple sauce, ice cream, and donut mix was a great cheerful dessert.  This is a great place for dinner!  But I might hunt around for a hole-in-the-wall place to be my regular taco spot."}
{"text":"This is such a cool little restaurant on the Danforth. The restaurant is dimly lit with great decor and the service was laid back, quick and friendly.  True to yelp recommendations I ordered The Fish Tacos, and let me tell you, they did not disappoint. The portion was huge, the fish was cooked to perfection and the taco was full of great flavour and beautifully presented. The coleslaw that comes on the side is really tasty too.  It's definitely worth checking this place out."}
{"text":"Our first two brunch destinations were packed, so we eventually stumbled upon the Combine. It was a decent experience for a walk-in without any prior research.  The good: I like the look of the restaurant. Casual, warm, charming. I sat near the windows and enjoyed the plentiful sunshine and lovely woodwork.  The meh: My friend and I both got the bacon waffles and fried chicken. My other friend ordered the eggs benedict with peameal bacon. I didn't really taste the bacon in my waffles, and felt that the chicken could have had more seasoning. My friend seemed to like his eggs benny just fine.  Would I come back? It wasn't a bad experience, but it also wasn't anything special food-wise. If I return to Toronto and am looking for a brunch location, I'd probably look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Combine served me up my very first fish tacos, and what can I say...you never forget your first.  The tacos were absolutely delicious.  I really liked that for the fish you had your choice of grilled or fried; I'm not big on fried food, and I HATE bugging servers to alter the menu items for me, so having this choice on the menu right off the bat was great.  The corn tortillas were also very tasty, and reminded me of the foods I ate in Mexico.  They didn't hold together very well, but Chris P assured us that's just par for the course.  And if you like hot sauce, you won't be disappointed --  I think there were at least 9 different kinds at our table!  Staff were very friendly and as other yelpers have mentioned, any server who can handle a crowd of 14+ and 1) bring everybody the right order 2) bring everyone the correct bill, truly deserves a medal.  Be careful when ordering booze here though.  I didn't check the prices and my glass of house wine added about $8 to the bill.    Will be back to try the shrimp tacos soon :)"}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food. Whether you're looking for an amazing brunch or consistently delicious dinner, this is the place to be.   Head chef - Danilo - knows how to smoke a mean brisket, so be sure to take that dish on if available.   Small criticism - avoid the old fashion if that's your drink of choice. You'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Scared off by the 10 oz hamburger I indulged in a grilled fish taco. It was unbelievably good!   I never choose fish but when I saw it pass on its way to the next table I had to trade in my heart disease inducing burger for that tempting plateful of freshness. I was rewarded. The side of coleslaw wasn't too my taste but the tacos hit the spot nicely.  Service was fast, courteous, efficient and friendly. Am I still in Toronto?"}
{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about this place, and we've lived in the neighbourhood for 23 years. The drinks menu is creative an really well-prepared. The menu is varied, with everything from salads to burgers, to upscale mac and cheese, to lobster tacos, to meatloaf. Southwestern comfort food would be the underlying theme. We split the Cobb salad to start, and I had the pulled pork burritos. OMG, everything was SO fresh. This is probably the most outstanding thing about the Combine. Freshness. Desserts were good, too, and there is an extensive selection of bourbon, because of the co-owner, Amy's, background. Talk to her! She has had a lot of interesting experiences in her life. Service was impeccable. Patio in front and out back in the summer. Honestly, this is a GREAT addition to the Danforth. Just go!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch and it was mediocre at best.  I got the down and dirty danny which was the best part about both my partner's and my meals.  The sandwich was tasty.  My partner got the Dad's egg casserole which was tiny and mostly potatoes and wasn't fabulous. The home fries were okay, except there was some type of pepper in them I think, which the server never told me about when I asked how they were done.  She offered spicy ketchup which I didn't like at all, and I asked for regular ketchup which they didn't have.  I then asked for the sauce that was on the sandwich but she wanted to charge me extra for a small cup.  My partner was still hungry after his food and wanted to order something else, but the fact that we already weren't impressed with the food and that the cost of each dish was really expensive $14.95 for a breakfast dish which is pretty outrageous, he decided against it.   The service was okay, and the place was nice looking.  Too bad about the food and the price.  Just not worth it.  I don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"I live in this neighbourhood and I had no clue they had been there for 2 years. The server raved they had the best tacos. No they are not the best in the city. The meal was great even though I don't remember what I had now. Ribs maybe? I won't be running back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I am coming back here for SURE.  I came here last night with 14 other yelpers. We pretty much took up half the restaurant. No problem for the server. We all got our drinks and the correct food orders AND separate bills.   I had a hard time deciding what to get, as everything on the menu (and everyone else's table) looked incredible. I went for the fish tacos, as that's what we were all there for.   Three tacos on a plate, with a size salad, $14.95. Served with at least 7 varieties of hot sauce on the table. My kind of place.  The fish was perfectly cooked, springy and lime-y, the coleslaw in the taco was also a great touch. The tortilla itself, however, was on the dry and crumbly side. It fell apart as I was madly cramming tacos into my face-hole (I was super hungry). I think I may have been missing out on some flavour, as I couldn't have the lime crema or the monterey jack in the tacos. The salad had a nice, light vinaigrette on it and the veggies were all very very fresh.   After dinner, Amy (co-owner) came over and chatted with us. She's incredibly friendly and laughs a lot, it really was the topper to a great evening.  Next time (yes, there will definitely be a next time) I'm going to try out some of their other items, namely their meatloaf...."}
{"text":"Avitania nails it in her review. The food just doesn't quite live up to the decor, the buzz, the excellent service, and the prices. We ended up eating a lot of fried foods, and they were never the best. Onion rings were extremely crispy but surprisingly flavorless. Veggie crisps were also sans flavor. Poutine was okay, but nothing special (unlike next door at The Globe where poutine is astounding).  The mains we had were all OK, but never more than that.  The mojito, however, was the best I ever had. If I come back to this place, it will be to enjoy a spot at the bar. I might get a little something to nibble on, but I won't be expecting to be wowed."}
{"text":"Attentive and friendly service goes a long way but can't make up for an under seasoned and under-shrimped trio of shrimp taco. Watery pico di gallo and a thick tortilla left me with mostly, the flavours of soggy bread. Coleslaw is lovely, but my dining partners house salad was positively drowning in acid and totally inedible. This is pretty unacceptable for $17 meals (with high end portioning to match.)  Carne Asada tacos are reported to be tasty, but a very thin marinade made the eating experience too messy to enjoy.   Highlight of the meal (only redeeming factor) were the lobster fritters, which are crispy, not greasy, and stuffed with big hunks of real identifiable fresh lobster. Make a meal of them with a few sides and it's worth the visit. That and the reasonably priced wines (decent bottles under $30) and a good mojito save this from being a 2-star experience.   Sorry folks. Really wanted to like this place. But I've had equally enjoyable meals at places like Sneaky Dee's for a lot less coin."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here as I've heard so man good things about fish tacos. I was a little disappointed at the price point, and was hesitant about coming - but my Yelp sense got the best of me, and I had to review the place one way or another.   $15.95 you get 3 fish tacos, in a crunchy corn tortilla, either fried or grilled, with coleslaw or salad. At first, I wasn't even sure I could finish 3 on my own, but they were smallish in size and I did.   I'm not sure how to eat these. I picked it up with my hands, and it ended up dripping along the other side, or falling apart. I ended up eating 2 of them, with a fork, but really defeats the purpose of the taco and eating it so that all the flavours meld together? I made a mess for sure. This isn't a first date kind of place.   Flavours were good, and tasted good, and I was definitely sated, when I was done. At $20 including tip and coffee, this isn't a usually dinner/lunch haunt for sure. (psst, I really liked the coffee here !! haha)  The decor was nice and rustic. I like flat wider tables, and it was at a good height (not sure why I noticed that today).   It's definitely something different, but would like it more if you could get tacos individually instead of making it 3 =meal. It would allow for more variety, and ability to order starters. I would come back again, but only if I needed a place to eat in the area."}
{"text":"After sleeping for 4 hours and then driving for another 3, we were held for an hour at the Buffalo / Ontario border because someone who shall remain nameless *ahem* may or may not have a criminal record.   There was no time to stop for breakfast (or dinner the previous night) so needless to say, our stomachs were growling big time by the time we reached the Danforth Music Hall in Toronto.   A quick Yelp of the surrounding area lead us to the Combine eatery which was fortunately located right across the street. Perfect.   Stepping inside, it did not go entirely unnoticed that the place was a little light on clientele, but who were we to judge the food before we tried it? The lack of a booming post lunch / pre dinner crowd could be the result of a myriad of reasons unrelated to the food quality... and the place looked pretty clean so that's always a plus.  The menu was a little pricy but when you consider the USD / Canadian exchange rate, its kind of average. Items ranged from the basic (fried chicken sammy) to the somewhat fanciful (grilled fishy tacos) to the down home TradCan (poutine).  *TradCan is an abbreviation of Traditional Canadian that we have invented.  Each of us reviewed our own meals individually and aggregated the results to produce a pie chart. Said pie chart was then lost and remains at large.  So we're giving the Combine eatery a solid four because the food was good, our waitress was nice and they had some really spicy hot sauce and that ain't nothing to sneeze at.  Lots of love, Lo Moon  X"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very kind staff and engaging. The drinks come and come which is great, if only the food was quicker I wouldn't have drank so much. The grilled fish tacos are exellent !!! and a strong addition to the the Danforth which is overpowering with Greek food. I was impressed and I recommend you check it out. If you love fish tacos this is the place for you, they make all kinds, fried and grilled."}
{"text":"Came here for the tacos since they hit most top ten lists.  Place wasn't too crowded and had comfortable seating.  Kids came with us and no one was giving us the evil eye.  They did not disappoint on the tacos, I would list them top five.  They have Toronto craft beers on tap which is always a plus for me."}
{"text":"We came here with a party of 14, and I don't think any of us were disappointed.    Almost everyone had the fish tacos and they were a big hit.  The fish tacos are apparently the best in Toronto. Even though it was my first time having them, I must agree.  The service was surprisingly attentive for having a packed house. My water was filled up frequently and the food was brought out within an hour, totally reasonable since we showed up with 14 people during dinner time.  I will definitely come back when I have a craving for fish tacos."}
{"text":"It's a shame the food at Combine isn't better, because everything else about the place -- the service, the decor, etc -- is really great. I came here because I was a bit homesick for SoCal/Baja-style fish tacos and had heard Combine did them up right.   I'm going to call no on the fish tacos, unfortunately. The breading was soft and not crispy at all, as if they'd been fried in oil that wasn't sufficiently hot. The chunks of fish were also way too fat and large, so the tacos were also very unwieldy to handle. Accompanying salad was also overdressed. The poutine we ordered was also pretty okay - it arrived slightly lukewarm, and skimpy on the cheese.   The prices were actually quite high given the fair to middling food. I was a bit aghast that the fish burrito was $17. A burrito! Oh, well. Given the decor and space, I guess the rent's high. But they might want to step up the offerings a bit.  I don't know if I'd go back. Maybe."}
{"text":"Joined a pack of fellow Yelpers on an excursion to try their fabled fish tacos.    We were greeted and seated by one of the owners...she was very friendly and chatted with us briefly.  Our server came by soon after and took our drink orders, then our food orders.  Service was quick and efficient and we were all provided with separate checks (WOWSA).  The menu had a number of tempting items, and I was tempted to have something other than the fish tacos, but I was there to try them, and try them I would.    You are given the option to have the fish grilled or fried for your tacos, I chose grilled, the person sitting across from me ordered fried (he had tried the grilled option on a previous visit).  I didn't try the fried fish, but my table mate indicated that he preferred the grilled option.    The tacos themselves were fresh and delicious and portion size was ok.  The fish could have perhaps been seasoned a bit more, but it was tasty all the same.  The side house salad (coleslaw is another option) was fresh, but a little too dressed for my taste.  Of note, the seemingly endless array of hot sauces to dress your taco appropriately...yay for that!  The decor was simple and elegant (exposed brick walls, clean lines, rustic wooden tables and church pews, great lighting), the menu had a lot of options (not just tacos but meatloaf, mac & cheese), their bar menu looked good.   The only downside would have to be the sub-zero temperature of the restrooms...seriously, do they hang sides of beef down there?"}
{"text":"Went last night for a girls' dinner - fun and casual - good spot for that sort of thing.  The room is a bit too bright and slightly uninspired - heavy wood tables, etc.  Our apps were really good across the board - I think that they are all best for sharing. Folks raved about the Quesadilla and the poutine was yummy - all are very large portions - simple presentation.  Our mains were hit and miss - the salad and steak burrito were only so so - despite the other reviews here the fish tacos were a hit.  The slaw is good too...again, very large portion! Deserts were also surprizingly good...try the banana bread pudding or the cheese cake - skip the creme brulee.  Only one server for the whole room and one missed entree - left me so so on service - friendly though.  I would go back, but more for a midweek casual meal than a big night out...definitely a good addition to the Danforth - and a nice alternative to Allen's..."}
{"text":"I've only been here for brunch, but it was great! I had the \"Chilaquiles en Salsa Roja and Huevos\" and loved it.  Nice atmosphere, great staff."}
{"text":"Third time visiting and while I like the interior and the service (sometimes), the food is overpriced and not very good. I don't know why I keep coming back. I want to like this place, but after today I won't be back.  Just went for brunch and they only have coffee, no espresso-based drinks. We had one veggie salad, one coffee, and one plate of veggie fritters and a few pieces of soggy bacon = $45. No thanks."}
{"text":"GREAT place.   1. Fab vibe, great atmosphere, great location. Love this area of the D-forth!  2. Staff are, without exception, AWESOME. Especially owner Amy and her bro Albert! They make you feel so welcome, like you are going to a party in their home. Great sense of humour, clear passion for what they do. It's an infectious mood.  3. GREAT. DRINKS. The bartender(s?) is really, really, really good. In our case, it was Albert... but I saw Amy shaking a mean martini while we were there too! ;)  4. Cool decor. Art by locals (mostly B&W if I remember correctly). Furnishings are rad all-around - cool lighting fixtures, open brick and metal pipes... Art is for sale too! Love it!  5. Food. YUM. Fresh, flavourful, though I guess I'd better admit I didn't have fish tacos! Ha! That seems to be the most popular item. I had an omelet (a special) and home fries - came with fresh and interesting (read: no melon) fruit salad as well. YUM all around - and everyone in our party felt similar (we ordered every item on the brunch menu between the six of us, I think).  We went for brunch, obviously, and they opened a few minutes early just for us (we didn't check the hours before heading out) and YES, we drank. My mimosa was PERFECTION. I put it on par with Fire on the East Side, and for those of you that know me, you know that is my #1 mimosa place. You see what I mean.  We ate on the back patio, which was airy and intimate, though it can seat about 50 people (I asked). We sat at a gorgeous (and huge) table made out of a huge log of wood! This back area would be a fabulous place for a private summer party! Hmmmm..."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were fine but, frankly, nothing I couldn't make at home. $16 later I was still feeling peckish. The slaw is unusually spicy.  Our server was a neophyte and interpreted our \"could we get the bill\" motion for \"where's our food?\" They might be a victim of their own success. We got the food okay but there was little in the way of a table check up to see if we wanted more drinks, dessert, etc."}
{"text":"Hmmm... this place was... good.   The food was fresh and plentiful. We tried the So-Cal fried fish tacos and the lobster tacos. The plates came with three plentiful tacos that were perfectly filling and visually they looked colourful and appetizing. Tasty,yes, but there was just something...missing. Inside were tomatoes and cabbage (seemingly the same as the coleslaw I had on the side) and the fish-slash-lobster. They needed some bite- cilantro or onion or maybe some fresh lime on the side? The lime creme fresh was nice yet subtle. The lobster was delish-very fresh. The fish was kind of bland.   To me, these tacos are just a little too bland for all the hype- the selection of hot sauces were necessary for this lapse.   Two plates of tacos came to $40 plus tip (including one sparkling water). All in all, I'd rather go somewhere more authentic (and cheaper!) for tacos, but I'd be happy to return to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Love this local neighborhood restaurant!   We come regularly and the food and prices are reasonable.  The owner Amy is a true delight!"}
{"text":"On a Wednesday night, I was searching for a dinner venue, and decided to check out the newest addition to the Danforth restaurants. I called ahead; they don't take reservations, but do 'call aheads' and they assured me there would be room for our party; there was.  I ordered the fish tacos, having heard a lot about their yumminess on yelp reviews. The tacos were delicious. Three small tacos, with a side garden salad, is just the right portion as well. Also at our table, someone ordered the Danforth burger. It looked amazing and I want to try it next time. It comes with fries and salad (a winning combo; who wants to choose anyway?). The bun was made just up the street at Dough Bakery, and the patty was large. A choice of toppings made this burger an excellent meal choice. Another diner with us had the tacquitos (an appetizer; she wasn't as hungry). All said, all of our meals were well plated and delicious.  We all opted for a dessert, and they do make mean desserts. Choices at our table included: peach beignets with almond encrusted vanilla ice cream, sweet potato pie, and lime margarita crème brûlée. Yum!  The service was attentive and the atmosphere casual, hip and clean. Will definitely be coming back here soon."}
{"text":"I go to this place oftentimes, since I live a few blocks away. They bill themselves as southwestern cuisine place, though their southwestern-themed dishes are not the best I've had.  However, one surprising discovery here - their burger is awesome! The patty is huge and bulky, well chosen meat, not too fatty, not to lean, and didi mention it is huge?  Use their southwestern dishes as appetizers and then gorge on the burger!"}
{"text":"All hail the fish taco!  Outside of La Jolla (San Diego), CA this was the best plate of fish tacos I've had.  They just opened on July 11th but after a week and a half they seem to have things together. I didn't experience any of those new restaurant growing pains that you normally see within the first few weeks of opening. Everything was top notch.  Upon entering I was greeted by Amy, one of the owners, who gave me a very enthusiastic \"Welcome to Combine\". Because I was alone she asked if I would like to sit at the bar, which I did. Albert, the other owner, was behind the bar and quickly got me a pint of Big Wheel.   Their menu is southwest inspired with salads, burritos, burgers, tacos, and many more things to choose from. Each entree will run you approximately $12 to $20, but average at $14 or $15.  I went with the fish tacos (grilled not fried). Yes, I know what you're saying; \"Chris opted for tacos over a burrito?\". True story. That's because these guys do a So Cal style fish taco and I have yet to find anything like it in Toronto. Though there are two places in San Diego where I've had better fish tacos, I would come here in a second because they're such a close second place to the other two.  The server asked if I wanted hot sauce (ofcourse I did). I was pleasantly surprised when she brought out 4 different options and they were actually real hot sauces (not that Frank's redhot crap). Further to my hot sauce enjoyment was when Amy came by with a fifth option, saying it was her favourite. It WAS the best option.  Combine is clearly benefitting from the press and word of mouth they're getting. By 7:00 on a Friday night the place was full and they were having couples wait at the bar.  After my meal, while I was enjoying a pint of 416, Amy stopped by to see how everything was. We chatted about how I was just in and going back to So Cal and enjoy the fish tacos there and that hers were fantastic. She explained that she worked at a restaurant in OB (Ocean Beach for you non-So Cal travelers) for two weeks to learn how to make a good fish taco.  For the fish tacos and two pints my bill was just over $32. Great value for the quality and service you receive here.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Yummy fried chicken sandwich, but HUGE! (Can be a good thing for leftovers.) Quite spicy though. I had their lemonade with a kick to drink and that was quite good too. Solid dinner place."}
{"text":"I have an old-fashioned standard about fish tacos, which many taco places in Toronto fail.  A fish taco's focus is the fish fillet and the tortilla, not the garnishments.  Garnishments make a taco tastes better and unique, but they cannot replace the importance of the fish fillet.  Many taco places I have been to in Toronto want to wow customers with garnishments, but they go cheap on the fish.  They either use fish fillets not fresh enough, or choose a type of fish that is not meaty AND make the fillet too small, so the texture of the fillet is completely overshadowed by a big pile of garnishments.  The Combine Eatery passes the standard.  Yes, the tacos are expensive  The fillets are Basa fillets, a non-meaty fish.  Yet the fillet is big enough that the fish flavour comes through the garnishments, which are fresh.  The texture of the fish fillet stand up to the volume of the garnishments.  The fillet is fresh. The diner controls the spiciness level of the taco.  And this, my friends, is how I like a fish taco."}
{"text":"Good tacos, I had pulled pork. I like everything except the horrible Whitney Houston-esque music...ugh!"}
{"text":"What you've heard is true: Combine Eatery serves up the best fish tacos this side of California.  I met up with a dozen other Yelpers tonight. This UYE was so popular that we took up almost an entire wall of the restaurant. Well, almost. It's not a big place: including our group, it was a full house and a line-up had formed midway through our meals. Come here on a Wednesday or a Friday night, this place will be hopping for a while.   My experience of fish tacos is somewhat limited but I can tell that you won't be disappointed. I ordered the So Cal style grilled fish taco with coleslaw. The coleslaw was OK, a little too vinegary for my taste, but the fish was yummy.   Since I like to put hot sauce on everything, I made sure to dollop my food with drops of the XXX spicy habanero sauce for that kick. Even if you're not a fan of hot sauce, they've got milder versions but do add some: it will make your meal taste that much better.   I didn't order any drinks but for the meal, price-wise after taxes, it seemed reasonable. Fish, after all, can be expensive. Even after eating every morsel on my plate, I could have eaten another taco because they were that good.  Since it can be difficult for any restaurant to accommodate a large group like ours, the staff was fantastic, patient and attentive. The best part: we were all given separate bills. We were a group of 20, who does that?! Apparently, Combine Eatery can."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday. I was going to a concert across the street. The place was pretty busy but we got a table right away. Its really nice on the inside. Although its a little small and tight.   The waitress who first helped us wasnt good at all. She didnt say the specials or soup of the day until we asked. The waitress who helped us after though was great!   I ordered the chicken chipotle burrito with fries. I skipped on an appetizer as the waitress told me the portions were filling. The chicken was extremely well seasoned and tasty. The meal it self was filling and I was pretty hungry since I didnt eat a lot throughout the day. The fries were also tasty and the lime sauce it comes with was great for dipping. Im not a fan of guacamole so i cant say much for that.  For desert I had a chocolate peanut butter cheesecake and it was delicious! I was torn between the cheesecake and the brownie but the waitress really recommended the cheesecake so I went for it and do not regret it at all. It was perfectly creamy and flavourful.   Overall, this place is a little pricey but the food was delicious and I would return again if I was going to another concert since its convenient. I don't really find myself in this area ever but if I did Id return."}
{"text":"Yelpers hit the nail on the head with this place! Great local beer on tap (Mill St, Steamwhistle, etc)  I started with the mussels, which were dynamite. There were 4 corn fritters on the side which went very well with the sauce. My guest had a caeser salad that was tasty and well made.  We both went for tacos, lobster tacos, and the vegetarian tacos. Both came with a lime creme sauce which was fantastic. The vegetarian soft tacos were quite good, they had tomatoes, cilantro and the lime creme. They were much like falafel or veggie ground, and was quite good. Asked for hot sauce, and got 4 varieties. Real varieties too, not Frank's, etc. Only complaint about the lobster tacos, was they got quite soft, quite quick. They fell apart from the juices if not eaten quickly. But still VERY tasty. Service was decent. There was only the one main waiter, so was a bit slow sometimes, but was still very attentive.  Dessert was a brilliant blueberry beignet that was fantastic.  You wouldnt know this is a brand new restaurant, very well run so far and will definitely return.  I do see how it can get a bit loud. We were there on a Tuesday at 7pm, and was half full and very loud."}
{"text":"Went to this new Danforth establishment for the first time this past weekend.  Loved it.  In the Mediterranean Sea of Greek restaurants that litter the Danforth from Broadview to Pape, there are few solid alternatives.  The Combine Eatery, a mere three weeks old, fills that void very nicely.  The service from the minute we walked in was great.  We were greeted warmly and developed a wonderful rapport with our server throughout the meal.     My friend opted for a cheese burger, but I was fortunate enough to experience their amazing fish tacos.  Emphasis on amazing.  Strong emphasis.  Seriously, this place is fantastic, and our meal was great start to finish.  Anyone who happens to be in the area looking for a great place NEEDS to come here.  Fantastic."}
{"text":"I've dined here three times. The first two times were great and so was tonight's. There are a few things that makes a dinner an enjoyable experience. The atmosphere, the food, the service, the price and location. My wife and I love this place for all those reasons.   The atmosphere at The Combine Eatery is exceptional. The restaurant has low lighting in the evening giving the feeling of comfort, has great sunshine in the morning for brunch and appropriate slats for shade on the back patio if you use the patio. The restaurant is well decorated and quite clean and appropriate for different moods.  The food is awesome. No matter what I have ordered I've never been disappointed. Everything they serve is quite delicious.  The service is always great too. Nice people, friendly, real, personable.   Overall this place is great. It's all mine so don't go here k? Go somewhere else"}
{"text":"VIBE  It's very wooden at the Combine eatery. From the mahogany floors to the pictures on wooden panels against the brick backdrop, The Combine has a simple vibe. I went on a weekday afternoon at 2:30 so the only people there were two girlfriends and a mother/daughter duo. Cute.   I ATE  The Fish tacos. Everyone raved about the fish tacos and they were hearty. BUT I felt they lacked a bit of flavour. I shouldn't be wanting to put salt and pepper on my fish. That said, the fish was grilled very nicely.  I would never eat these on a date, however. With the overload of toppings, it was a bit awkward to eat and I probably wouldn't get a second date! The tacos come with an order of coleslaw or salad. From what I saw, the salad was your basic iceberg, tomato variety so I got the slaw, which wasn't too creamy and had a sweet flavour to contrast with the sourness of the lime in my tacos. The tacos were $20 (with tax and tip).  OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  All things COMBINED, I say The Combine has a bit of work to do, especially for the value of what you're getting. Best fish taco so far for me has been South of Temperance. I hope Toronto steps up its game in the fish taco department."}
{"text":"I went here for a lovely Sunday brunch with a great group of ladies. The Combine Eatery is a very nicely designed restaurant with a great atmosphere. Most certainly the best place to sit is in their back patio.   The service was attentive and very friendly, which was pretty important because the back patio can be quite hot and we needed those water refills.   Their brunch menu is fantastic! There is a marvelous selection of creative dishes. I even learnt that fried chicken and waffles are a thing! Clearly I have been out of the continent for too long.   I had the open-faced pulled pork sandwich with pico de gallo and eggs. It was pretty darn delicious. If I was to be picky I'd choose another kind of bread (the one they use it's a bit too thick). But my friends had the fried chicken & waffles and the eggs benedict. Everyone was thoroughly satisfied and stuffed.  My only complaint with this place is that it is very expensive. The brunch portions were pretty decent (although they may seem deceptively small but believe me when I say it'll fill you up), but it's still about $15.95 for each dish and about $8 for each drink."}
{"text":"This place was BUSY on a Thursday!   Brooke N. and I met for fish tacos and had a great night. The interior reminds me of New York; tables close together, loud, woord, bricks, good food. We ended up talking to the tables on both sides of us as different food came out ('oh my god, what is THAT??') and it was a really fun atmosphere.  The good: - the fish tacos were great - as Chris P notes make sure you get hot sauce - the ambiance was lively and happy - good draught list and the beers were the right price  The bad: - The mojito wasn't great - The coleslaw is not special - definitely get the side salad instead  Overall, this was an outstanding night. Great food, great company, great ambiance (but LOUD - NOT suitable for a date) great staff. The tacos were just a little bit too expensive ($15/3) for me to be heading back there on the regular but they were delicious and I will still return for sure (on the semi-regular)."}
{"text":"Awesome comfort food in great area.  Incredible Bourbon collection and bartender knew everything about it let us do a tasting. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went there for weekend brunch.  Got the traditional breakfast with bacon and side salad.  The side salad was pretty bland,  but everything else on the plate was good.  I also ordered a banana pancake which tasted sooo good.  It was light, fluffy and not too sweet.  The syrup had a really nice banana flavour to it.    Next time,  I may just order a full plate of the banana pancakes."}
{"text":"To begin with, my actual rating for this restaurant 3.5 out of 5.  I went for an early lunch on an overcast Sunday and got there just as the place opened at 12.  My partner in eating crime and I were the only ones there, so I would expect to get good service and we did. The server was very pleasant and another person (perhaps the manager/owner?) made a point of coming over and chatting with us about the food.  She was a little intense, but had good intentions.  We made the trek specifically to try the fish tacos.  My partner having recently traveled to L.A. was interested when hearing they are the closest Toronto equivalent to what he had, and loved, there.  When we got there, we decided we had to try the shrimp, the grilled fish, and the carne asada.  The server seemed a little surprised at our gluttony, but I assured him we had skipped dinner last night and hadn't had breakfast, so we were up for the challenge.  And we were!  No take home today!  I enjoyed the shrimp tacos the most.  The carne asade was a little chewy, and the fish was a bit underwhelming.  I understand that the fish's lime marinade is purposely kept very simple, but I think it needs a little more depth.  Having said that, it was cooked very well - perfectly flaky.  I did enjoy the variety of hot sauces and I did put them to good use.  The house salad was pretty bland and the coleslaw was okay, but could be more interesting.        Our bill for the three dishes, no drinks, and a 20% tip came to $64 which I feel was a bit too expensive for the meal we had.  Having said that, we did order what would normally be eaten by three people.  I'm glad I got to try it anyway even if I'm not raving about it."}
{"text":"Was here with the rest of the huge Yelp gathering for a fish taco feast.  The tacos were pretty good but I thought somewhat overpriced for the portion size. I had just come from the gym and I could have eaten a lot more! I am not a fish taco expert by any means but I didn't like the tortillas too much and the tacos were a bit bland, but they were definitely fresh.  This place is busy but the staff was exceptionally friendly and accomodating enough to do seperate bills for all 14 of us!"}
{"text":"I caught up with a friend for some later night drinks. We ran past closing but the staff was lovely and did not rush us. Great atmosphere - has style but is still warm and accessible. What made me give it a five is how immaculate they were about cleaning and maintaining their establishment. Every little detail - and that kind of summed up the place to me: every little detail receives the proper attention and creates a great overall vibe. And once again, the staff was awesome. If you live in the danforth, you have to stop by."}
{"text":"They specialize in Southern California-style food like burritos, salsas and fish tacos. The decor and ambiance is great. The tables and bar stools, exposed-brick wall, modern light fixtures etc. make for a classy and comfortable dining experience. I saw a few craft beers and a respectable bourbon list. However, we did an early Saturday morning breakfast, which was fantastic. The banana pancakes were unreal."}
{"text":"It sounded a little sad if I coming back to The Combine Eatery just for their hot sauces??!! But only if they have the XXX extra hot habanero...   I don't know about you guys... but I found it a little boring to just eat Fish Taco here as there are so many different items offers in the menu. After twisting the arms of Vivek and Rafi I nicely convinced them to order Carne Asada (Beef) and Fried Shrimp Taco! And I have this special Jennifer K's Trio Combine Tacos ($14.95).   Fish - a little bland... I need to drown that in hot sauce... but it was fresh and if more seasonings would be added will make the taste more complex   Shrimp - has a great kick since it has sauces already.. a little sour, sweet and tangy... (thanks Vivek for sharing)   Beef - really tender slow cooked in a tomato based... most filling of them all... (thanks Rafi for sharing)   Services are excellent!! Separate bills?!! No automatic gratuities??! Accept All credit cards?!   I want to be back and try out other food items on the menu..but I will probably skip their tacos....   I don't know why Tacos are so expensive in Toronto.. the Mexicans must be laughing and wondering why we paying so much for their street food..."}
{"text":"I came out to the Danforth to try these legendary fish tacos with a busload of Yelpers. Solid Mexican eats are a rare find in Toronto, so when you find a place that even approximates the fresh and delicious flavours that one can find south of San Luis Obispo [1] you want to hold on to it as tightly as a ren-faire nerd would his first girlfriend. I was not disappointed with Combine Eatery.  Though we were a large group, our server handled us with grace and, dare-I-say-it, aplomb. Since everyone at our table was ordering Fish Tacos so I did the sensible thing and dare-I-say-it-again: ordered something different. You wouldn't believe the flack I got for this; as though I kneed a baby in the face, or made a reservation at Pickle Barrel.  Anyway, my grilled shrimp tacos were incredible. The shrimp was cooked just right and the pico de gallo was really fresh. You will be advised to try one of the many hot sauces available. There were no fewer than five different varieties being bandied about the table; I liked the brown habanero which had some serious kick, and the dark green jalapeño.   This might be the Combine equivalent of blasphemy, but think I liked the shrimp tacos better than the fish ones. Grilling the shrimp gave it some 'edge' while the fish tacos were comparatively mild in flavour. Neither were anything to sneeze at however. (Don't sneeze on these tacos!)   I can't wait to come back and try some other selections.  Obligatory Title Pun: Ending Toronto's SO-CALLed taco drought. [2]  Menu Readability: Quite readable. Everything is carved into sections and tacos are front and centre.  Need to mention: Our server brought our group separate bills without prompting.  What this place teaches me about myself: I would sooner knee a baby in the face than sneeze on one of these tacos. (How are these even expressions?)     _____ [1] AKA \"The Happiest Place in America.\" Go Mustangs. [2] I was advised by Eric L not to use \"taco\" or \"combine\" in my OTP."}
{"text":"Came here for a wedding rehearsal dinner.  The place is nice and the staff was great.  I ordered the Cobb salad and it doesn't disappoint. I love how there's chorizo as one of the toppings.  Also they're fries are yummy. Next time I go I'll have to try the adobodl marinated steak burrito."}
{"text":"The Southern Fried Chicken sandwich was sooo good. I got sold on it when the waitress said it was featured on TV...and I thought \"a famous chicken!? Yes, I'll have that\"... very classy atmosphere and super good service. Definitely will go here again whenever hitting the Danforth Music Hall!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  The food was very good and the drinks were fantastic but more importantly the service was outstanding.  We all started with cocktails - Margaritas and Mojitos.  The Margarita was made with bourbon and rimed with crushed bacon and salt (yes I said bacon).  The Mojitos were fresh and minty.  The one thing I we all really like about the drinks was that they were not too sweet.    We ordered two apps for the table - Lobster Fritters and Braised beef short rib poutine.  OMG the poutine was out of this world!!  The fritters were good but there was no lobster flavor.  I think next time I would just order the vegetable fritters.  For mains we had fried fish tacos, steak burrito, jambalaya and grilled pork chop with red potato salad.  The jambalaya and the pork chop were features. The burritos was very nice.  The steak was a nice medium rare and it came with guacamole and lime crema.  Fish Tacos were delish!  The corn tortillas really make a difference.  The pork chop feature was really good.  My friend found it to be a little fatty but for those of us who love pork fat it was perfect.  The only dish that fell short was the Jambalya.  The sausage in the dish had great flavor but the overall dish didn't seem to come together.    You would think by now we would be full but we sucked it up and ordered dessert. Two sweet potato pies, beignets and a Patron creme brulee.  My word it was good. The sweet potato pie was more of a bread pudding with a bourbon carmel sauce.  The creme brulee was one of the best I've had - it had a lovely fresh citrus flavor.  The beignets were tougher than I expected but still good.  I would like to point something out about this place.  No the food isn't cheap but the quality of the ingredients justifies the cost.  Our meal with tax and tip was $200 (for four).  The food was really good but what sets them apart is the service.  The restuarant was fairly busy and there was only one waiter who had the assitance of the owners Amy and Albert.  Yes there were times when we seemed to be waiting awhile for things but they made sure that we never felt forgotton.  They went out of their way to talk to us and make us feel welcome.  I've been to some really nice restaurants and had some incredible food but I've never been made to feel as welcome as did at The Combine Eatery."}
