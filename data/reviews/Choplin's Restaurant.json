{"text":"Its been about a year since we came here.  They offer a new menu daily with nice selections to choose from .  I ordered the wahoo fish . it was nicely done.  Always looking for a local place to go for fresh fish.  Four hours to the coast for fresh seafood where we usually go.  I m glad we found a local restaurant for that.  Service and food was excellent."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm counting off a star on this restaurant is bc of the location. Food is amazing and the service is wonderful. They have a really interesting menu... there's something there for everyone."}
{"text":"I had lunch only here, only once, but it was excellent.  When you go in, it looks like the diner that has had several incarnations in the space, but the handwritten specials on the wall reveal that there is a chef here who cares about his craft (he came out in response to my compliments so I am not presuming the gender).  There were several creative dishes, combinations of ingredients I had never seen before, and all of them looked delicious.  I had fried catfish, and fried catfish at lunch can be predictable and can show that it is been waiting too long to be served.  This fried catfish by contrast had a nuanced and very fresh taste.  I also had green beans, slow cooked Southern Style; when I inquired about the taste, the chef came out and revealed they were cooked in pancetta.  They were quite delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food and at great prices.  This is one of the best restaurant deals in the Lake Norman area."}
{"text":"Celebrated Valentines Day here for dinner. The menu was a three course pre-fixe. Shrimp cocktail was a sad looking plate of three shrimp, a blob of great tasting cocktail sauce and some spinach leaves. We had wanted to order a Cesar salad in addition, gladly paying any extra charge but we were told that we could not vary from the menu..ok...Ordered the filet for dinner and were told we could have it medium rare or well done...no variance...ok...we were feeling a bit stifled at this point. The food was good but we just had an uncomfortable feeling the whole time...especially when the bread came to the table in a large basket with two rolls in it! I suppose they were trying to make their night as easy as possible and expedite service to accommodate more people. I felt like we should have had trays and pushed ourselves along in a cafeteria line."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews we decided to try it. Although the meal was better than a chain restaurant, in our opinion it was not worthy of a 5 star rating. The server was more interested in the apparent regulars than us. We waited 5 minutes to order a second glass of wine while she shared stories with another table. As for the food, we ordered Filet Mignon and it was okay, not as tender as we would have expected. We also ordered the Grouper and it came drenched in sauce. It almost looked like soup on the plate. It would have been better with less. Overall, if you are looking for an alternative to a chain restaurant it is not bad, but not a 5 star meal."}
{"text":"Went here last week. I bought a Goupon for $18 worth $30. Take your money and go elsewhere. The first thing they asked us when we were seated is \"do you have a groupon.\" It was asked in a manner that was very snotty and condescending. Yes..yes I do have one. Service 2/5, food 1/5 I ordered my meat dish rare and holy cow it was well done. The waiter added the tip to our tab...yes ADDED THE TIP. Maybe cause we were groupon...OK whatever. We ordered a bottle of wine with our meal and the tab was $114 before tip, after the groupon discount. The waiter was also very snobby and had quite an attitude."}
{"text":"Fresh, locally sourced food that is lovingly prepared with beautiful presentation.  Soups, salads, and main dishes are spectacular and the service is among the best I've ever encountered.  The name of the restaurant is the owner's name and he really takes pride in his preparations.   Their scallops are exceptional.  Food is all delicious.  Really unusual, special experience.  It can be pricey but well worth the cost.  And I wish they were open on Sundays."}
{"text":"First the great chef; Food is super creative, sweet savory, and well prepared. We started with French Onion soup. Has a hint of bourbon in it, absolutely great and if you read through my reviews you'll see we've had it all over the country from fine to faux dining, and this was one of the very best. Menu is daily depending on what is available that day fresh. I had the Halibut which was a little sweet for my taste but it was perfect. Textures were right, temperatures and all. I figured some hot sauce my knock a little sweet out of it but I hated to ask as to not insult the chef who is also the owner. When asked by our waitress, I fessed up; although perfect was a little sweet for my liking and a bit of hot sauce would probably help me out. She brought over some Texas Pete and a super hot. brand. I opted for the Pete which promptly ruined the dish. The owner's wife showed up at the table with a small dish of hot sauce they make in house. I explained I already ruined the dish with the Texas Pete and that probably wasn't going to help at this point. She left it anyway which I tasted. It was tomato based more salsa like than sauce but had a good flavor and subtle heat. I used it to finish up my Halibut by dunking the fish thus washing off the Texas Pete. One Good thing was that my wife couldn't finish her shrimp with scallop over linguine dish and I helped her with it. The food was tasty the service was friendly. I was having a really enjoyable evening even though the actual restaurant fixtures themselves are old and worn like a Chinese place had been there years before and they tried to transform it into a real looking restaurant, and then came the bill which I couldn't read because I didn't have glasses and the lighting was dim. We were talking to the waitress (super nice and helpful) about how great the soup was and notice how inexpensive it was also. I was holding the bill up to the candle halfway across the table to read it (older you get the longer the arms have to be to see) and also to figure the tip when I noticed it!! Dang, I told my wife I wish I hadn't read that. When I was looking at the soup price I saw the dreaded dollar charge! It was all going so well until the ole nickel and dime smacked me upside the head. One dollar..., one dollar for the extra bread. When the waitress asked how we were doing and if we needed anything I said a little more bread would be nice. Apparently this is a dollar up charge; nice. This is where the great chef changes hats to not so great businessman. Why would you charge your customer a dollar extra for bread with a menu that produces 50+ dollars for two people? There is nothing good that can come out of dropping a dollar charge on the bill. Nickle and Diming just upsets people. Food is only part of the experience when you go out, people want feel like they are being appreciated and are paying for the overall experience. Up charging a buck isn't going make that happen. Heck I was just at Sullivan's and had the summer squash soup which too was a little too sweet for my taste also, It was delicious but I ended up giving it to one of my sons to finish off. Our waitress asked about it I shared it was a bit sweet for me but he loved it pointing my son. While reviewing the bill I noticed the soup wasn't on it, I called her over and told her she forgot to charge me for the soup. She said no problem, it was on her. I added the 12.00 to her tip! Then we go here and they charge you a dollar for three rolls, delicious rolls, but still!!!! I understand you can't get fine dining prices located in a strip mall with paper covering you table cloth. A bar located dead smack in the middle of the dining room (complete with loud talking French dude when were there) and old booths that could use some upholstery, but the creativity coming out of the kitchen could definitely compete. On our way out I read a sign something about the dishes being inspired and or dedicated his mee maw. I'm thinking mee maw would say to charge a little more for the soup and give em the extra three rolls sonny!"}
{"text":"Bloody awful. If it's not bought in,they don't sell it. Service was ok. Food terrible. Don't bother coming here."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Couldn't have asked for a better experience. Service was on point and food was amazing. My steak was cooked to perfection- seriously one of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Well I was not impressed at all. We went to this restaurant on Valentines Day and thought it was going to be great however we got there a little early and the lady sat us at a table that was uncomfortable and I was so far away from my husband we could not carry on a conversation. We sat there and both tables that got there after us were served first. Finally the waiter greeted us and I jokingly said, \"I have been waiting at least for the champagne\" and he said rudely, \"I'm getting it!\" 20 min later still no champagne. We finally got it. The couple next to us were brought the wrong appetizers 2 times. Then here comes ours!! Wrong appetizer again. Finally get the appetizer... now we have been there over an hour. Then our meal... lobster tails were good but the quinoa was awful! Then the dessert... I'm not lying when I say we received 4 marshmallows and 3 unwashed strawberries and a dish of cold chocolate... isn't fondue supposed to be hot???? So we paid 134.00 for this? I was astonished and needless to say felt like a fool. Also to get to the bathroom I had to go through the front where people were coming in because they had tables in places where you could not get to it. Unreal! You know they could have had a real chance to make an impression for future customers as I work at a hospital. I would never recommend this place to anyone.  Well with that kind of arrogance,   that I also I experienced with your staff, I see why we got ripped off! The way you treat people is a reflection of who you really are. You should look up the foundational principle of reciprocity. You get what you give! Good luck!"}
{"text":"We held a large group dinner at Choplin's, and every part of it was great! They were wonderful to work with during the planning, and the dinner was fabulous. We had almost 70 people, and everyone raved about the food and location. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Completely understaffed and overwhelmed with a full restaurant.  Would have been fine with a wait from a reservation but telling us we would we are just clearing our table to be seated and then ignoring us for over half an hour and still not being seated is no way to run a \"fine dining\"restaurant."}
{"text":"It's been awhile and we're glad to be back.  Very well prepared and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Went  there again the other night with my wife and daughter. During the meal my daughter said I have had salmon in a lot of restaurants but they cook it better then any where else! I had the seabass and as it always is cooked perfect. The best thing we and a lot of our friends love is if you see the dish you want but it doesn't come with the sides you like Just Ask! If you want a great meal this is the place great food great service friendly people."}
{"text":"Started off with pino noir wine (nice and smooth), then some warm bread with a hint of salt and butter (very good!), then the delicious fettuccine with seafood with a little kick to it (was so stuffed) and finally a salted caramel chocolate peanut butter marshmallow meringue dessert to go (drool worthy)! All the wait staff was extremely friendly and made me feel at home. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Holy WW!!!  Amazing steak.  Amazing sides.  Best service I have had in a long time.  Kristen is a rock star!!!  The entire staff was great.  Bartender made the best whiskey sour I have had in NC.  Date night/ adult time was made amazing by such a great atmosphere, great food, great service and great drinks.  Thank you so much!!!    Brad Allaire"}
{"text":"Ate there last night with my wife and another couple. The meal and service was good. The other couple had the scallops and a steak dish, my wife had scallops as well and I had the crispy duck all were delicious.  We split the bill with the other couple. Our portion meal totaled $120, I used an Amazon voucher which had a $50 value and the resturant forced a tip on the meal. When I asked why I was forced to pay their preset tip I was told it was a company policy if you used a voucher i.e. Groupon they automatically place a tip on the order. I will not be going back to this resturant when there are so many other choices that do not force a tip on you when our meal was for a party of two."}
{"text":"We have been to Choplins twice and I cannot say enough about this hidden gem. Located in a deserted looking shopping, Choplins is worth the detour. The staff is amazing and friendly, the ambiance magnificent and the food exquisite. Everything is plated beautifully. This is a must do if you appreciate fine food!"}
{"text":"Wes as the chef, Adrianne as the hostess and Elizabeth as the server: this Choplin family hat trick made our St. Valentine celebration the best yet.   The atmosphere combines and balances class, friendliness, warmth and professionalism.  The menu itself was a piece of poetry, and the meal it produced at our table was poetry in motion in both presentation and taste.  Thank you Choplin family for doing for us what you do best."}
{"text":"Great service. Tasty French Onion soup. Duck, Sea Bass, & Scallops split 4 ways.  Everything was equally amazing.  Cornelius should be proud.  Highly suggested."}
{"text":"Choplins has been our favorite restaurant for several years. We haven't had a bad meal yet!  It's always a treat when crispy duck is on the menu, but even when it's not there are some amazing selections. Try the soup, no matter what it is.  Even something as simple sounding as chicken noodle is transformed when prepared by Chef Wes."}
{"text":"We came here on Valentine's Day and my fiancé and I were disappointed. The set menu was $40. We didn't know about that ahead of time but that was probably our fault (even though we called ahead and made a reservation). I wouldn't mind paying $40 per plate if I felt I was getting my money's worth. I ordered the shrimp for part 1 of my 3 course meal. The shrimp they served looked like they took 3 shrimp from a frozen shrimp ring you get from a grocery store. They were small. They dressed it up with some decorative greens. The 8 ounce angus steak as the main dish was OK- but definitely not worth $40. I ordered the steak medium rare and it came out closer to well done. I thought maybe the steak would make up for the terrible 1st course, but it fell way short of my $40 expectations. My fiancé got the scallops and they were pretty good- but they were very small portions. She usually eats like a bird and was still hungry as we walked out. We shared the cake for 2 as the desert. It was the best part of the meal!   To make matters worse, we had a $25 gift certificate that they refused to accept because it was Valentine's Day. That was the icing on the cake for us.  I've been to Choplin's once before and thought it was a solid local place to eat. Perhaps coming back when the menu is normal and my expectations aren't so high."}
{"text":"Great food, upscale atmosphere.  The company Christmas party was here.  They went out of their way to make us happy.  The chef makes it your way.  This family-run business has an upscale feel, with a casual, friendly appeal."}
{"text":"Chopin's is excellent! Delicious food,people and ambiance. Their menu represents southern class hospitality at it's best!"}
{"text":"We were a party of three that truly enjoyed the food, drinks and service.  Try the Watermelon cocktail! The Reese's Cup creme brulee was a bad boy's take on a classic--and it did not disappoint! Our waiter Cory was friendly, attentive and knowlegable (he also made the brulee!). The Aussie lamb, fillet medallions and sea scallops we're all excellent.  Will definitely stop in again when next in town."}
{"text":"I've only been to Choplin's twice, both times with large groups.  The food was very good and the service was consistent. Not a big fan of the location but if the foods good I guess its worth the trip..     Editing my review, recently revisited, yum!"}
{"text":"Choplin's is our go to date night spot, the food is always absolutely wonderful. The evening usually goes smoothly and is a wonderful time to enjoy ourselves and wind down from the stress of adulting and being a parent. ....But we've always had the same server, I'm awful for not remembering her name but she is amazing and always on point with refills, questions, suggestions and coursing properly.   However, this weekend we came and had a different server. I'm so appalled Im tempted to no longer be refer my customers to this establishment. If only it wasn't for that sweet server, the delicious food and those amazing martinis. I'm not that petty, but we will not be returning ourselves.  Our evening last night was awful from entering the building. My mother recently got a divorce and I wanted her to have a great Valentine's weekend. She lives 5 hours away so I was unable to celebrate the day of and coincidentally she was in town for my sons birthday. We were all beyond excited for our evening at Choplin's, we thought it was the perfect place for our one evening together before we go another 5 months not seeing eachother. I mentioned that we had a child with us on the reservation, why they thought it a good idea to put us at the table right next to the door when it's cold outside is beyond me. I asked if we could move and got denied even tho there were tables empty. So we were chilly all night and I kept worrying about my toddler catching a cold. We order apps, the wrong dishes were rang in. Never got an apology. they were sent back and they fixed the error. however, they did not halt the remaining courses to give time to prepare and fix the app mixup. We are given one of the 2 apps and ask for bread to go with it, which the waiter decided to respond with a rude, condescending tone that the other app comes with bread and promptly turns and walks away without another word. After another 10-15 min the other app appears after staring at the first one just waiting for bread. (Ive worked in the industry, I understand baked dips have high ticket times. I also know that house bread is always at the ready. Why make us miserably eat something and wait when u could have made us happy) he was clearly weeded with his tables and his response to these situations is to act extremely rude and not even bother to try and fix his mistakes in a reasonable manner or even ask for help. Next thing we know we have apps and salads. As Wer trying to eat the app fairly quickly since there is absolutely no room on the table. He then comes over and rudely says \"ladies u better hurry and eat those salads ur lobster tails are sitting in the window!\"..... . A minute later and the entrees arrive, they try and take the app that still hasn't been finished. Salads haven't been touched. I admit I'm mortified at the tone I had but I simply asked where they planned on putting all of this, why isn't this coursed properly? I then realize they probably are going to let our food die in the heat lamp and we send our untouched salads back and ask for the entrees. He then says he will be back with our boxed salads. I simply avoid eye contact and blink back tears as I tell him I don't want it. The story never gets better... it continues down hill.  The food was amazing as always. If I send anyone there I will tell them to request the female. And I will also tell them to walk out and run if they are sat with a bald gentleman. The server sets the tone for the evening, and it was epically awful. I will admit I cried later when my mom left at 6am and I kept having to apologize for the awful evening. So much for trying to perk her up with a Valentine's dinner....  I understand high volume and Wer human and make mistakes. But man up and apologize and learn some humility. Never once saw a manager or received any type of apology for the series or unfortunate events at this awful evening"}
{"text":"Super yummy dinner.  Wes was on his game tonight as was Jeff.    Halibut steak and scallops were all prepared perfectly.   Mike, lea and Olivo will all be back soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing dinner.  The Shrimp Appetizer was incredible, perfect texture and sweet with just enough spice.  My steak was one of the best steaks I've had in a lifetime...   If only I could dine like this every day.  My wife and I were treated with the utmost care and kindness by our server and the atmosphere was private and relaxed...  A great time and we're going again soon"}
{"text":"Went the other night with my wife for a night out with out kids.  The fondue app was great and hot so watch out let it cool off a bit first.  I had the new flank steak and my wife had the crab cake.  Both of us loved our meals, even though it was flank steak it was still very tender.  My wife said the crab cake had a lot of big chunks of crab and was quite tasty.   I highly recommend this place.  The staff is great and the chef always aims to please and will do anything for you if he has the ingredients."}
{"text":"What a fabulous experience! I have just moved to this area and had a girlfriend visiting from out of state. We met another girlfriend who lives here. All of us dined at Choplin's for the first time. Luckily I had made a reservation. This place was very busy with every table full and many waiting. We were shown to a booth with plenty of space and pillows and welcomed warmly. Our server gave us lots of helpful information and plenty of time to enjoy our meal and the dining experience. Food was amazing, perfection on a plate for all three meals. Wine list was varied and complete without being overwhelming. The final course included flaming cherries jubilee tableside with a French serenade by the server. What a treat! Choplin's was not just a great meal, it was a memorable experience. I will be bringing many friends and family here to enjoy this fabulous find!"}
{"text":"Kristin is amazing. She did an amazing job and worked with our special needs for our entrees. This restaurant is a great place to dine and the atmosphere is great. Chef Choplin did a great job with our dishes and was very accommodating to our requests. We will be back and wish we knew of this place sooner."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical when we arrived at a sort of strip mall for this type of restaurant. The atmosphere is a little different. Warm and cozy but still feel like it was once a Cato's. However, the staff is incredible! Wow..... They act like family with each other and smoothly interact with their customers. The food was some of the best I have ever eaten!!! Who are these magicians??!!! Wow!!! I was blown away! The Filet Mignon was incredible. I ordered it medium rare. It was perfect. Warm pink center that melted in your mouth. I have never skipped on the A-1 sauce but it was not even a thought as I let each piece melt in my mouth... But let me back up and talk about the French onion soup! Oh my word! Nice base... I could have drank it out of the bowl... But over the homemade bread crouton was 3 layers of cheese which were mozzarella, provolone, and Gruyere cheese. Phenomenal! Dessert was a little bit of heaven in a dish. We split the crème brulee. Wow... My husband loves that particular dessert and has tried many. He said it was very good. It was my first time and I was wowed! The center was not warm however... I felt it would have been better warm but the sugar crust was to die for. Lightly browned and crispy. Overall... I gave 5 stars.. I am so glad we found this place. It was our 5th anniversary and they made it very special for us. All of the staff members turned from what they were doing to say good bye. An amazing place to eat!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in the Lake Norman area. The outside is fairly limited but the service and food are wonderful. Every time my wife and I go there, at least one of us gets an entree that is phenomenal. We have been 4-5 times dinner now and each time was really nice."}
{"text":"Another great night at Choplins!!! It is really one of our favorite places. The staff is super friendly and we have gone there so many times that we know them all so well and they always make everyone feel so welcomed!! Now let's get to the food.. After moving to NC from NY let's just say we know good food! The food is always such great quality and the preparation is always perfect!! What we love is that they will always go out of their way to serve your entree just the way you like it by making changes to the sides or veggies if you would prefer. The fish dishes (we love fish) are cooked so perfectly. My daughter had salmon tonight and said it was the best salmon she had ever eaten..But don't miss the Sea Bass.. As it has been said.. To Die For!! And don't miss the homemade creme brûlée.. Best ever!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from the Steak Valet tonight for the first time. Everything from the ordering process to the delivery was simple and easy. The food was amazing. Ordered the BBQ Chicken breast as well as the twin Filet Medallions. What an awesome dinner. And the best part of it all, the Groupon."}
{"text":"Great Food, and the freshest Fish around, Highly recommend, We eat there all the time, All ways great service."}
{"text":"What an amazing dinner. I usually don't bring kids to a foodie restaurant but we went early and the kids loved it. A brussel sprout appetizer the kids loved. Delish. I had the scallops and my husband the duck. Both amazing. So fresh. Everything is local. A new menu every night. The kids had salmon and a filet ( and chicken fingers and fries for my third child). They loved it. Service was friendly, knowledgeable and very attentive. Shannon what amazing. Just like family. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place has an identity crisis, from the menu to the decor it can't figure out its audience. We went here the other night and the list of specials was very large -- not a good sign, and the menu wandered all over the place. It should be 1/3 to 1/2 its current size and focus on what it does well.  I wish I could tell you what Choplin's does well. I had a Waldorf salad with a much too-sweet dressing and a onion soup that was flavorful but still too salty. My husband had a very bland penne and chicken w/ vodka, needed garlic or some kind of kick to it. Our kid had a heaping pile of fettucini with red sauce, nothing on the side and nothing to write home about.  The service was pleasant but very slow, especially considering there were only a couple other tables of diners. Usually I appreciate not being rushed but we had our 3 year-old with us and the pace needs to be faster with small children.  The atmosphere is odd. On one hand it has a bar with beer signs and a TV, but it also has kitschy sayings scattered around (\"Live! Laugh! Love\" type signage) as well as a section trying for a Paris bistro effect. None of it quite works. I wouldn't care if the food had been better, but when you are waiting  a long time you get to noticing the other things not working.  My husband declared in the car that we would not be back, but I might be willing to chalk it up to an off night. Though it really needs to get its identity sorted out."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Choplin's for my birthday on August 31st . It was the best restaurant experience we've had in a very long time. The steak was unbelievable!!! It was tender, juicy and the favor was out of this world. Don't forget to have an appetizer. The French onion soup was the best  and the shrimp was so juicy and tender. We added a a side of scallops per our servers recommendation. The scallops did not disappoint either. They were cooked to perfection. My husband and I had such a great experience the first time that we came back for his birthday and again, the food was excellent. The atmosphere at Choplins is so friendly. Our server, Cory was so knowledgeable about  every dish and he has the best personality. You can tell that Corey and the rest of the staff really love thier job and care about thier customers. We live in Clemmons, NC and drive 45 minutes to eat at out new favorite restaurant. We love Choplin's!!!"}
{"text":"The Asian take on shrimp and grits would definitely inspire me to go back to Choplins, however, receiving the \"tray display\" desserts for our dessert orders, and getting sick off of them, was a HUGE let down. The entrees are good, the salads are subpar... And the desserts are embarrassing for this great-location restaurant."}
{"text":"All of the food was excellent! The service was great and fast. All of the servers were so sweet. The French onion soup was the best I've ever had! This restaurant is a definite must go to if you live in the Lake Norman area but if you live further away it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"I will never set foot in this place again. Corey, our obnoxious waiter babbled a list of specials.  Among them were, \"Surf and Turf\" and \"Scallops with Lobster Tail\".  My husband I chose both of these dishes.  When we received the bill we were charged for 4 dinners!  Corey had us understanding that they were combination dinners.  They were not.  He brought 4 meals to the table.  The Total for Surf and Turf was $60 and the Scallops with Lobster was $66.  Then of course, the smooth talkin' Corey added his 20% tip.  When he brought the bill I asked why he charged us for 4 dinners when he led us to believe that's how the dishes were prepared.  His response:  \"You ordered 4 dinners\".  I was a regular there.  When they fire him, I'll be back.  I made about 25 phone calls to all my friends that go there, too."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a delicious light dinner here Saturday night. We weren't overly hungry so we both ordered the \"Mother Earth\" salad to start. It was FABULOUS! Fried Goat Cheese, Spinach, Pancetta, Egg, House Roasted Peppers & Cider-Honey Vinaigrette. Probably the best salad I have ever eaten. The cool thing was you can order a half portion of any of their salads which I did and it was still substantial.  Then we both had the Sashimi Grade Tuna with Tamari Soy, and Wasabi Sauce appetizer as our dinner. Wow, this was the most delicious tuna I've had.  The staff  was very friendly and helpful and we will definitely go back again.  I  only gave 4 stars because I agree with another reviewer that the decor is not up to par with the fine dining experience of the food. This won't deter me from returning  but improving the decor would definitely make this a 5 star joint in my book."}
{"text":"What can I say about Choplin's that hasn't already been said..? His heart is as open as his palette. The owner/chef loves people and food equally. He gives back to the community in a big way by feeding the less fortunate with dignity and grace. The service was excellent. Our waitress was wonderful, charming and very helpful with recommendations. The chef came out as always to say hello and made sure his guests felt welcome. The environment is very crisp, elegant and inviting with candles, but still manages to not make my kids feel out of place. The food was phenomenal, as usual and there's nothing I wouldn't try, but sadly, we don't live close enough to eat there more often. Whether formal or informal is what you're after, you'll fit right in no matter. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"please turn off the TV so that diners don't feel like being in a sports bar type of restaurant"}
{"text":"Another AMAZING dinner tonight @ Choplins!  I've dined all over the USA. Coming from a sales background for a monster fishing tackle company, my job for years was to wine and dine clients. I've eaten at some of the finest restaurants North America has to offer. Choplins still remains my favorite meal.  We were lucky enough to get Corey again for our server. Even though he knows us as regulars, he still explained the menu with pride. That's what I love about this place. From chef, to server, to table, they're doing something special here! The Halibut was incredible. The texture was something you'll just have to experience for yourself. Cooked to perfection. My wife's New York strip was the same. Perfectly cooked and absolutely delectable. Key Lime pie was better than the \"best key lime pie\" from Key West. Portions were very generous as always! All around just outstanding! If you're anywhere near this place, you HAVE to try it! Chef Wes and his crew are on point! If I could give more stars, I gladly would!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing.. I didn't want a big dinner so our waitress Kristin who also was amazing recommended the small wedge salad and shrimp appetizer. They were both excellent and we shared the creme brulee that was just made and excellent also. We were traveling but definitely will stop again when in the area as the entire staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a road trip thru NC and wow, we were so fortunate to find this excellent restaurant.   From the moment we entered, the staff was attentive, knowledgable, and skilled.   The menu had amply diverse choices in meats & seafood.   The Chef changes the dinner menu each day and only uses local or special ordered meats. The fresh fish we both opted for were beautifully prepared, plated, and presented.   Even the side vegetable were worth a rave.      As we were really satiated already, we did not opt for dessert, but I am confident this too would have exceeded our expectations. This was a chance stop along our drive, but we will surely try to return when we are in the area.   If you're lucky enough to be in this area, I highly recommend Choplin's Restaurant."}
{"text":"What a great little spot for a fantastic meal.. Service was exceptional, personal, and not over the top!  My second trip here and I am wondering why I haven't been more.  The only thing they are missing is a full bar, but they do have a great wine selection."}
{"text":"Excellent Thanksgiving buffet and fantastic fantastic service!! Enjoyed it as we always do. Looking forward to returning for New Year's dinner!"}
{"text":"Oh sweet baby Jesus. Best steak place in North Carolina. Perfectly cooked usda prime steak in town. Great environment, romantic and I felt so relaxed. The team here knows the food and are wonderful people. They took care of us well. Coming here again!!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. I will never eat here again! I felt a little sorry for our waitress who was very nice and tasked with serving overpriced tasteless and cold food!  I had a very expensive 8 ounce Filet mignon which was unevenly cooked and served with cold scalloped potatoes and cold carrots and green beans. The wine sauce had the consistency of a gel like gravy.  Absolutely disgusting!  I wish I could give no stars."}
{"text":"We came here with my parents and in laws when they were visiting from out of town on a Saturday night. We were seated quickly and served immediately. Our waitress was so friendly it was almost too much but she seemed genuinely happy and excited to be there. The menu was varied and the wine list was pretty good. I had the handling duck which was cooked beautifully with a very crispy skin and well flavored meat. The potatoes and vegetables were also very well seasoned and complimented the duck well. My husband had the sea bass which I'm told was very good but the few bites I kept trying to eat were swiped by my one year old. Mashed potatoes though we're awesome. The other favorite dish of the group was a fettuccine seafood dish - well seasoned and the seafood was very fresh. I would have given it a five but I thought the dishes were a little overpriced and a couple of the dishes were just okay ( chicken was a little dry and grouper was a bit lacking in flavor and kind of a small portion ). Despite that I think I would recommend it and would come back."}
{"text":"This place was weird.   First: the location. It's in what feels like an abandoned shopping center (though it's clearly not abandoned, the grocery store a few shops down is gone, so this place feels empty). The restaurant feels like it could just as easily be a laundromat or daycare with a few swaps of furniture or lighting, which I think is because of the bay of windows on the front side. Never fear, anxious car owners, you'll be able to watch your precious Porsche outside throughout your meal to ensure no one dings its doors. Also strange was the outdoor seating. It felt like a sidewalk sale would have been more appropriate in that space, but instead you see white tablecloths and bottles of wine. Confounding.   Next, let's discuss the decor. Dated. Mishmash. Not what you'd expect of a restaurant charging these prices.   Third, the food. It was mediocre. The flavors were underdeveloped, the meat was universally overcooked (rubbery shrimp and hard as rocks fish, no bueno), and the appetizer felt like a sodium-laden cheese attack you'd find at a generic American food chain. The dessert wasn't really worth it, either: I think the chocolate syrup was Hershey's. And worst of all: at 6:30 PM on a Friday night, they were already running out of food. Completely out of scallops. And their substitute was \"more shrimp,\" on a dish that claimed to include both shrimp and scallops, but the dish came out bearing only a handful of shrimp and no smaller a price tag for the scallop-free and shrimp-lite experience. Not the way to do it, folks.   Things they did well: service. Our waiter clearly had a little \"bit\" he liked to use with customers, but it was cute. The grains (served under my rubbery shrimp) were cooked to perfection. That's about it."}
{"text":"Upon entering, we were greeted by co-owner/manager Adrianne Choplin, who along with the casual ambiance, made our party of 13 feel comfortable and welcome. Our server Matt, was courteous, informative, timely and well versed in the outstanding selections of beer and wine.  The menu was exquisite, offering a variety of NC seafood and meats.  The appetizers were delicious: crab fondue, French onion soup and Chef Wes Choplin even prepared blackened butterfly  shrimp, not on the menu, for my son.  The entrees exceeded expectation in every sence. The quality of fresh local ingredients combined with Chef Choplin's talents made for an unforgettable dining experience."}
{"text":"I probably would never eat at this place again, we have tried it twice now and both times were extremely disappointed. It is very awkward when you walk in and there is no one there to greet you. We had to wait 10 minutes before someone finally greeted us and sat us at a table. There was nothing special about this place at all. This place is just awkward, plain and simple. I can honestly say I've never been served a can of pop at a fancy restaurant before. As far as the food goes, my wife ordered the Seabass that I am confident was nothing more than dolphinfish or some other type of fish passed off as Seabass. My meals so memorable that I can remember what I had two days later. It was very disappointing. To sum it up, mediocre food, mediocre service, at high prices."}
{"text":"Brunch was fantastic last week. As always we were not disappointed. The new seating and decorations are beautiful. I was able to eat some good sized portions and still stay within my diet. We had a mushroom, spinach and scallop scramble with three eggs. Would like to tip my hat (again) to Wes and Adrienne."}
{"text":"Well I came in the other night expecting the same dish as before... thought I was crazy when I couldn't find it, anything remotely similar on the menu. I asked the waitress if they had done something with the menu and turns out it was almost completely re-vamped. I thought I was going to be dropping some real $$$ for a questionable dish. I was reluctant however, to hear that the chef was willing to make me a comparable dish to what I had before- WHEW! I was stoked to hear this. Big thanks to the kitchen staff for coming through for me in the clutch! Dish was spot on!  Otherwise, the second trip went just ok... it was definitely a busy Saturday this time around, and we had to wait a bit for just about everything. Not enough bread served with the $12 hot crab dip so a good portion of that turned into cold crab dip before our waitress got back with us. Not a big deal. Still good times for a date night."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere , lunch service was mediocre but they were busy. Hamburger cooked med well instead of med rate- quiche was over cooked - dense with brown crust on top. Waiter made no apology but offered plenty of excuses. Waiter encouraged us to try again some evening but doubt we will."}
{"text":"I had long wondered about this restaurant and now I'm sorry I hadn't found it sooner. A very nicely acquainted place in a strip center off the beaten track, it's neighbor is a Thai restaurant I haven't tried but with an excellent reputation.   I was there for lunch and was greeted warmly despite the cold day.  The place wasn't empty and it wasn't full but the staff was just right frequently visiting the table to see if there was anything they could do.   The menu was nice but limited.  Surprisingly I saw the catfish on a different day and asked about it and they said they would be happy to provide that item.  It was great.  The French fries were terrific.  The green beans were green beans.  And the muffin was maddeningly delicious.   I am looking forward to returning for dinner.  The selection looks awesome."}
{"text":"Oh my, once again Wes and Choplin's is feeding me food that makes my mouth savor the flavor. A favorite place to have lunch!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The people were genuinely nice and I would like to give a huge shoutout to our awesome waiter! The portions were huge which is nice. Everything just tasted fresh & delicious; compared to other restaurants, they deserve all the hype in the world. A must come!"}
{"text":"I have here a few times.Jeff & his wife run the greatest eatery Iv'e ever visited.I took my family here for my mothers 70th birthday,ad they did such a good job,decorating,meal planning ect...You will have the best dinner/luch in the lake norman area."}
{"text":"Great family place to eat. True southern comfort food staff very personal chef/owner comes to each table. Soup and specials are addictive will return next week."}
{"text":"The service here is Absolutely Impeccable. The chef prepares everything only to the complete satisfaction of each individual customer. If you're looking for THE place to eat in Lkn this is the place to go. Tender meats, Savory Fresh Veggies, and Desserts to die for! Choplins serves you feel like family."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food, I mean unbelievably wonderful things happen to your taste buds!! I found Choplin's on Groupon and have been a few times now. A great place to take your significant other if you want to impress and have a great evening. The staff is amazing and are very knowledgeable about the food that is prepared fresh daily. It is an upscale dining experience so it's a little pricey but worth every penny."}
{"text":"We tried Choplin's for the first time tonight with some friends and we had a wonderful dinner from beginning to end.  Our waiter Corey was great, so helpful with his recommendations and descriptions of the food.  We took his advice and started with the French onion soup and it was as delicious as he claimed it was.  The guys had steaks, my friend opted for the duck and I had the surf and turf.  Everything was fresh, delicious, and perfectly cooked.  The desserts were all amazing, we ordered the chocolate cake, the Heath Bar crème brulee and a lemon cake.  Such an enjoyable dinner, we will definitely be returning here and will highly recommend it to our friends!"}
{"text":"First time in this restaurant. Wonderful food, great ambiance and the most attentive waiter (Matt) I've  had in a while. There were nine in our party and every single plate was delightful and belief me, we are a tough group! Can wait to go back. What a wonderful gem!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The wine, appetizers, entrées and desserts were top notch! We will be back for sure and highly recommend this diamond in the rough to anyone looking for a fantastic meal! The service was impeccable and the owner stopped by our table and was a gem! I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best dining experiences I have ever had.  Initial greeting was so warm, the servers are so knowledgable. They were all so helpful to each other.  Food is absolutely amazing.  Music creates a great ambience.  One of my new favorite places, what a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Choplin's is lucky I'm giving them 1 star. We went there for a Mother's Day and graduation dinner. We couldn't even taste the food - I will say that it looked good. We had reservations for 7:30pm. We didn't get seated until 8:10pm. When we arrived at 7:15pm we were told that they were running behind. First strike - they have our phone number linked to the reservation and should've made a call when things were behind. Once seated 40 minutes after our reserved time we waited another 10 minutes. During this time tables around us got drinks, were asked for their orders, and waited on multiple times. We only got served water and only three for our party of six. Strike two - when we were waiting for our table we never got offered any drinks for our wait, appetizers, or any apologies for the inconvenience. The table next to us though were offered drinks upon getting seated. But that wasn't strike three. Choplin's third strike was knowing that we had a 3 year old with us. We were easily going to spend $200+ there especially with everything we were celebrating.  I am extremely disappointed, especially since it came so highly recommended. Luckily we were able to salvage the night and got seated right away from the highly recommended North Harbor Club. They also got food ready for our very hungry 3 year old and got it out fairly quickly and more than made up for all the short comings from Choplin's."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful Valentine's dinner at Choplin's this weekend. Hands down the best meal we've had in the Cornelius area. The duck and lamb were both perfectly cooked, and the accompanying sauces were delicious. Our server was also very friendly and attentive, rounding out a perfect evening. The setting/interior leave a little to be desired, but the food and service are top notch. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We all liked it. Appetizers were the fried green tomatoes and pork dumplings. Both were delicious. The entrees included chicken marsala and the NC mountain trout. All of us were pleased with our meal. The service and atmosphere were also good. It's a little strip mall area right off of Catawba Avenue in Cornelius. Plenty of parking in the outdoor lot."}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! Stopped here on our way home to PA from Florida. The owner was wonderful...very friendly. Our waiter was fantastic! And the food was excellent...everything we ordered was amazing! I would definitely go out of my way to go here again!  Do yourself a favor and give this place a try...you will be happy you did so!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Choplin's to celebrate our birthdays over Easter weekend. We found them based on a recommendation from a colleague of my husband's but also because we had a Restaurant.com gift certificate that they participated with.   I will go back to this restaurant over and over! The food was SO good. I would highly recommend ordering the Sea Bass if they have it available. Their menu does change based on what they're able to get fresh (which I LOVE).   They were still in the process of putting together their bar when we dined but they had a nice wine list and were able to accommodate us without the full bar and we didn't miss it at all. Our server made this cool mojito spritzer thing with Sauvignon Blanc and it was really good!  I believe that our server's name was Elizabeth but I should have written the review earlier while it was fresh in my memory (sorry if I got her name wrong!). My whole point is that she was fabulous. You could tell that she actually wanted to be there and enjoyed serving us. She was super knowledgeable about the menu, the mission of the restaurant and was passionate about their quality.   Couple of stand out things: my sister was interested in a pasta/seafood dish that included mussels and she had never tried them before. The chef actually gave Elizabeth a couple of mussels to bring out to the table for my sister to try to see if she liked them! Also, we ordered an entire round of desserts because we were celebrating three birthdays and they were all given to us on the house... Seriously?! You don't get much better than that, guys.   Thanks, Choplin's! We hope to see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food, atmosphere, location.....I can keep going!! From the door until we left, nothing could have been better. Our server, Elizabeth, made sure we were totally taken care of and enjoyed our time with them. The menu was amazing and couldn't have disappointed at all. The scallops and ribeye were the selections for dinner, a long with crab fondue and a house special drink called a Choplintini. I wanted more, more and more.   This place will be that spot I take friends/family visiting for sure. What a great experience!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Choplin's three times already.  The food is excellent.  Seafood is fresh.  Meals are flavorful and the spinach salad with the dressing which is made by the chef is delicious.  Have had the scallops, fillet and recently the zuppa di pesce.  Amazing!  Nice atmosphere and service was good!"}
{"text":"I read all the reviews and was quite impressed with all the stars. I recently moved down to NC from NY and have experienced many restaurants. We generally do not go out on New Year's Eve because it becomes very commercial. Our experience at Choplin's should not be based on an evening where all hell broke loose.  I believe that a fine dining successful restaurant should not capitalize on a holiday event. Although not rushed, we were crowded in a small room. I don't feel at $60 a person we should be passing plates to one another. The servers could not walk around to serve properly. There is a lot more to dining than the taste of the food. I questioned a staff member on a sauce on the way out. He was very pleasant and answered with knowledge. The food was prepared well and was well worth the money. I rarely give 5 stars or even 4 stars unless the restaurant is very good.  I hope I'm not a snob by saying that the server isn't my friend when I'm a patron. I think \"what are WE drinking this evening\" isn't the way to approach a table. People go out to be served, hence \"server\" not pals.  We will definitely patronize this restaurant again on normal evening. I hopefully will be able to add a star to my review."}
{"text":"Must say the food was delicious. However quite expensive to be served on paper table coverings. Was not pleased w/ the way I was given a straw to use. It was not in a wrapper, but handed to me by hand. Was very dissatisfied w/ the way the total bill was figured. Even tho we had a Groupon offer and know one tips on what the bill would have been, we resented having a 20% tip added ( for 2 people). It was figured on total of food and taxes. The taxes are not to be figured into the tip. We should have refused to pay that big of a tip. Service was good but not worth 20% automatically added. Will NOT go back"}
{"text":"I can't for the life of me figure out why I don't eat here more often. It's not exactly close to home, but it's definitely worth the drive down from exit 42. My family asked me where I wanted to eat for my birthday, and my first inclination was Fig Tree in Charlotte, but that drive is a pain, and the drive home is worse.   So I decided on Choplin's. Wes is a talented and creative chef, and you won't find better or fresher seafood in the area. We ordered the blue crab gratinee appetizer, two scallops dishes, the crispy shrimp app (as a main course for my mom) and the \"land and sea\" - two tournedos of beef tenderloin and a Maine lobster tail. All fantastic. Really good cheesecake for dessert. The creme brulee could use a little work, as it had a little too much \"texture\" for my liking. I'll bring Corey one of mine to try the next time I make a batch."}
{"text":"Although the service was amazing, the food was pretty disappointing. Burnt, oily, watery, bland, mushy, old, etc. The mac and cheese was oily and had no flavor at all. Y'all, I asked for garlic powder and hot sauce and it still couldn't be salvaged. The meatloaf was sitting in a puddle of oil and it was burnt. We also had the fried steak sandwich and that was soggy, the roll was burnt, and the sauce on the sandwich tasted like the takeout sauce from Panda Express. The prices were appalling considering how low quality the food is. Even the hard candy at the entrance was old and unwrapped. From beginning to end it was nasty food. Our waitress, Kristen, was wonderful though, she was very accommodating and kind. She's the reason I gave two stars instead of just one."}
{"text":"Low Country with a Twist  This is basically Low Country  (Charleston) Cusine with an upscale twist.  The closer to traditional Low Country Cusine, the more consistent.  The upscale, because it has a bit of experimentation with it, can be great or a bust.  Not everything is great but what does score is great.  My favority is their take off on Shrimp and Grits.  First of all, I am not a Grits fan even though I was born in the South, raised in the South etc.  My take on grits up until now was that it would make a great driveway repair agent.  The grits here are different.  More of a risotto with a light, not the characteristic heavy texture without having to saturate it with butter.  Who would have though that grits would come across this way but they pulled it off.  The owner, Wes Choplin will normally make his way through the dining area at least once during your dining experience soliciting comments. One thing I liked was the fact he does listen.  Menu evolves based on this feedback."}
{"text":"First of all, the waiter Corey is AMAZING!  He is super friendly, eager to serve his customers, and very passionate about his work at the restaurant.  By far, he is one of the best servers we have come across and was very knowledgeable about the menu and various specials being offered.  As for the restaurant, the food was excellent, great variety and reasonably priced for the lunch we had.  We will definitely be back for lunch and possibly dinner.  They are a locally owned restaurant and have earned an outstanding reputation!  This is a place that must be visited if you are in the Charlotte/Conelius area."}
{"text":"Excellent experience!  This was our first time here and we were definitely not disappointed.  The  atmosphere was quaint but the food was every bit that of a five star downtown restaurant.   The waitstaff was professional and knowledgeable.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Our first time at Choplin's, and we brought friends (also their first time). We made reservations & showed up on time. The atmosphere was quiet & romantic. The food was delicious: the lobster bisque was tasty, the crab martini delicious, and the pan-seared scallops were divine, and dessert - a pistachio orange phyllo cake - was absolutely amazing! For the food, we would give five stars all the way. The waitress, though, is the reason for four stars. She started out nice enough, even telling us to \"make ourselves at home\" (an odd thing to say, but ok...) But as soon as we paid the bill, and, I mean, the ink on the tip section of the bill had barely dried!, she came over and abruptly told us to leave, because she wanted to get another group seated at our table! Our entire group was slack-jawed flabbergasted! Oh, AND she never brought us our leftovers she had taken to box up... So, my husband spoke to someone who identified himself as the manager... After spending over $200 per couple (and we had tipped generously...something we certainly regretted after her sudden flip behavior), and having been there *LESS than* an hour & a half, total, it would've been nice to at least be able to finish our $15-each after-dinner cocktails without feeling like we had to chug them! So, while the delicious food will bring us back, we know what waitress we will ask NOT to be seated with, and we will NOT pay the final bill until we are completely done & packed up, ready to leave."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to love to visit this restaurant . Upon a recent visit we were disappointed about a few things. First we were shocked about how much the prices have went up since our last visit. The prices are the most expensive in the Lake Norman area. The biggest turn off was our rude waiter, Corey. He acted as though we were so beneath him / low lifes for ordering water and chicken dishes. He acted as though we were inferior during our whole meal. Our dishes were good, but not good enough for the price and rudeness."}
{"text":"At one of our favorite/regular places enjoying a wine from our Oregon visit and great live music by Second Inversion. The staff are amazing and so great and the food is outstanding!  If you're in the area, come check them all out.  #secondinversion #choplins #greatrrstaurantandgreatstaff #birthdaycelebrationcontinues #cheers #bestfrenchonionsoupever"}
{"text":"Service with a smile. Friend on a sugar free diet. The chef was accommodating and understanding. Many American home made dishes with a twist. Food is delectable."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. My wife and I have been here twice in 2 weeks after moving to NC. Wonderful and attentive servers, the chief is excellent. Now has a full bar too. Highly recommended for any occasion"}
{"text":"Baked brie is so fabulous.  puff pastry done just right.  crispy snapper is perfect....sauce is delicious.  wild ricy is yummy..  hubby had duck.  very good...sauce nice and zippy.  he thought the mashed potatoes needed something extra....i thought they were good."}
{"text":"We were there for our 21st anniversary on Thursday, and had yet another delightful meal.  The desserts, the salads..... My wife had streak & lobster, my daughters had ribs and trout, I had a wonderful NY strip - the\"candy bar\"cut, with a chocolate-Port sauce, that was the best NY strip I've ever had.  The desserts were fresh and topped it off in a magnificent fashion."}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday evening with my girlfriend. We wanted a nice evening out. So I made a reservation on Thursday for 7:30 dinner. When we arrived we were told the reservation was not in the books and the couple behind us had the same issue. The hostess was not at the station and we waited 5 mins for someone to greet us. We were told there would be a wait. I felt weird waiting when we had reservations. We finally were seated the staff is very friendly but the service is slow. They seemed to be understaffed here. The food was good. I ordered the short-ribs and they were tender and the sauce was pretty good. The sides scalloped potatoes were very good and so were the mix vegatables. The protions are generation for the price. Would I come back again yes I give it one more try in hopes the service is better."}
{"text":"We came for a birthday and left with a new appreciation for this yummy dinner joint tucked in next to Planet Fitness. The steak was amazing, the lamb was to die for and the lobster- well I don't eat seafood, but my husband says it was delish! We enjoyed a few bottles of the wine special, great apps (try the brussels- and don't give me any of that \"I hate Brussel sprouts\" sass- you just haven't had them cooked right!), and divine desserts. Highly recommend for the delicious food and impeccable and humorous service."}
{"text":"4.5 stars I went with my husband to Choplins on a Saturday evening. We made reservations for 7:30 p.m.  When we arrived there was a rather long wait to be seated, close to an hour, but when we were finally escorted to our table things began to get better. There's complimentary bread and butter to start. It was pretty good. We ordered an appetizer, a wedge salad. It was also good. For the main course I had a chicken dish, my husband had steak.  We shared our meals with one another. I was pleasantly surprised by our food. The chicken was tender and the demi glacé that it was nestled in was delicious (my only complaint was that I asked for no mushrooms and it arrived with mushrooms all over it.  They were large enough to see so I removed them which was good).  The steak was cooked well.   I'd return to Choplins, but only for a special event such as an anniversary since they are a bit pricey. We had a groupon which helped, but still too pricey considering the extremely modest interior and $60 price tag that didn't include any beverages or dessert, and was after the $30 taken off for the groupon.   Overall, excluding the long wait and the mushroom mishap, we were pleased. Everyone was very pleasant and we would return for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Wow...words cannot express how much I enjoyed this restaurant and the owner.   1. The food was outstanding...super fresh, high quality, and wonderful flavor! I had the halibut with crab and my hubby had the surf 'n turf (filet & lobster). Melt in your mouth good.  2. The waiter Corey was so friendly and passionate about the food...you could really tell he loves what he does and takes his job very seriously. The detail he went into describing each dish was impressive. He made the food exciting and we ended up taking every recommendation he gave (and I'm usually a tough sell!  3. The owner Wes Choplin is the salt of the earth. We've gotten to know him a little since then, and just love who he is as a person...his story, his family values, his involvement in the community and various charities, and the way he stands behind his food, putting his whole heart and soul into it. We're the type of people that are loyal to good people that make an effort to meet and engage with their customers... and Wes does just that. Makes you feel welcome and right at home, and to me that's priceless. Rare to find these days. We'll be a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had high hopes for this restaurant but we were extremely disappointed. Food was good but the service was horrible. Waited 45 minutes for our food to then be told by our waiter that he had forgotten to put our order in. He assured us that the chef would put a rush on our meal. Our food came out 15 minutes later and it was a good meal (but for $46 a piece we expected great). Server asked if we would like a dessert and listed off the desserts however we had over heard from a different waiter that they had crème brûlée although not listed as an option from our server. When asked if they had crème brûlée he said yes we also have 2 additional desserts.  We felt he was either undertrained or having a really bad day. We left knowing we would never come back for the price we could get both excellent food and services else where."}
{"text":"SO GOOD!! Love the fresh baked bread & the fact that they use local fresh ingredients in their food! Everything tastes so fresh & healthy which is a plus. My pasta was BOMB. Don't be alarmed about the price because the food/portion absolutely made up for it!! ( Portion was huge!)"}
{"text":"Food is always wonderful, the chef comes out and checks if you're happy with everything usually. Which is cool, service is always extremely good. Low light which I love.. Will be a regular for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Very nice setting for date night. Waitress was attentive. It was nice having the live music playing not too loud. The food was great and not too heavy. Perfect walking distance to go dancing after dinner!"}
{"text":"My first impression of this place was not something that I care to remember. When my husband booked our reservations there was no set menu and he wasn't told that there would be a set menu so we ended up paying $60 a piece for a dry steak a so called cheesecake. Included in the menu was champagne that neither my husband or I drink. I don't know that I'll go back and try this restaurant. Trying to maneuver to get out was horrendous!"}
{"text":"I have been in very fine restaurants throughout the US and one pet pieve I have is disorganized greeting.  When one walks in a fine establishment, they expect to be acknowledged, even if someone is in front of them.  We walked in and had to wait in line only to be made to wait longer because the hostess had to take phone calls.  Now I don't expect them to not answer the phone but put them on hold...I was there first, I made it a point to be on time for my reservation.  Now, regarding the reservation.  We were placed in a separate room that appeared to be a banquet room with banquet chairs.  There was a party in there of 15 it so and half were little kids.  Not what I was looking for.  Everyone else was in the nice part of the dining room, we were chosen to be in the after thought room at the kiddie table.  Not a good start to our $250 dinner.  However I must say, the food was very good and the service was as well.  Server Cory was a true professional.  Knew the menu cold, made suggestions and was passionate about food.  The lobster tail was incredible and my wife's chicken was perfectly cooked.  Our $15 martini can in a water glass and a wine glass because they ran out of martini glasses... Again, not expected in am fine dining restaurant.  After a long week at work, we choose an upscale place to relax and unwind, all we got was stress when we arrived and the kiddie room.  Thankfully a very good meal and great service."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience from start to finish.  We were there to celebrate some very special occasions and we were a large party.  Cory was super attentive and took care of our every request.  The food was exceptional, service superb.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time and we love this restaurant!  Our waiter, Cory, may be one of the finest, most knowledgeable servers I've ever seen.  He knew the menu upside down and apparently the Chef changes it up every day.  The whole staff was very nice.  The French Onion Soup is unbelievable, the chef nailed it.  I thought the Pan Seared Chicken was goos too, except there was too much Demi-Glace added to the dish, which I thought distracted from the perfectly cooked chicken and almost drowned the excellent vegetables, if it weren't for the mashed potato dam. I really liked the potatoes too.   I see complaints on here about the place not allowing alcohol for gift certificates and vouchers, but they have a framed sign right up front - saying exactly that. State law won't allow it, and quite frankly it's not that big a deal.   We'll definitely be back. Definitely worth the overall experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, a menu that changes daily, superb service, total date night excellence- there are just not enough great superlatives to describe this restaurant!  The best part was getting to take the leftovers home-because the portions are big enough to make another meal! Choplins is a MUST!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the essence of fresh food, friendly service and wonderful ambiance. I will bring all my friends and family here. I love places like this. Please let's support local restaurants!! Cory is the best server I've ever met!!"}
{"text":"Excellent,  fresh menu. Went fir my anniversary and they gave us the royal treatment.  Very relaxing atmosphere.  Just all around great restaurant."}
{"text":"Somebody tell me why until now haven't I heard anything about this place! This the best meal I've had in Charlotte in Years! 1st of all the atmosphere is mix of bourbon street, and napa valley! I didn't have any expectations for Choplins but right away I was blown away with the level of professionalism from the staff and Omg our food was over the moon! It started with a shrimp appetizer which was full of flavor and the Shrimp was exceptionally Large! The crab Fondue, you couldn't stop eating. The Mother Earth & Caesar salads were above average and the entrees where simply Amazing! From the Land & Sea to the Pork Porterhouse again simply amazing! Even our drinks were good! This Restaurant Deserves to be in New York, or San Francisco, glad that its here and close!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable dinner. Osso Bucco was wonderful. Loved the French onion soup and the grilled avocado appetizer. Great service as well"}
{"text":"Not going to find a better dining experience anywhere!  The food is to die for and the service is astounding.  Looking forward to my return. Best restaurant I've been to in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin praising Chef Wes. I freaked out over collard greens the other night. Yes , he can even blow your mind with something as basic as greens. Everything is always fresh and delicious. I've never had better service. I can't recall ever having to repeat myself or ask for anything twice, and we eat here a couple times a month. Get the filet and lobster - skip the knife you can cut it with your fork, and the tail is 12 oz., all for the price you would pay for just the filet at any high end chain. Any fish dish promises to deliver as well, the swordfish, halibut, salmon. Just eat here, you will be back often."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The burger was overdone when I ordered it medium and the fried chicken lacked some salt and was nothing to write home about. Service was great though."}
{"text":"Last night was our fourth dinner at Choplin's and every visit we are delighted with a new array of tasty dishes.  We ordered the Mahi Mahi and Veal and both meals were \"melt in your mouth\" delicious.  The other couple who accompanied us were skeptical of trying a new restaurant but they were pleasantly surprised.  Being a younger couple, sometimes servers can be neglectful or inattentive. This was just the opposite with our server, Matt, who was very courteous and would check in at all the appropriate times during our meal.  Thank you Chef Wes for continually delivering a quality dining experience. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Don't let the store front fool you. . . Choplin's is a wonderful jewel!   My wife and I visited there this week and were very impressed with the service and the quality of the food.   My wife had the salmon and I tried the halibut. . .  they were both wonderful.   And, the large portions allowed us to enjoy it again at home!  Did I mention the French Onion Soup?  We lived in France for a year and tasted many versions of this special dish, but Choplin's captured the taste and aroma perfectly.  I highly recommend this terrific, local restaurant."}
{"text":"Hmm. Not sure if the food is deserving of four stars. The wait staff was indeed friendly and starter came out quickly along with the fresh salad.  The starter hush puppies were the star of the show. The NC flounder was late and was a flop. Rice was too salty and fish under seasoned."}
{"text":"So delicious, and the excellent service really makes them stand out!  I was heading to another restaurant nearby when I saw Choplin's sign saying \"open\" so I quickly looked up some reviews for them and saw they were really positive.  I ordered the homecooked special which was fried chicken with gravy and came with two sides.  I chose corn and mashed potatoes.  This was really delicious and most certainly homemade.  The corn was crisp and fresh and the mashed potatoes were very creamy.  I also ordered the cheesecake and it probably was the creamiest, most moist cheesecake I've ever had.  The service was top notch, very attentive staff and they offered many suggestions as I ordered and ate and also really seemed to care about my experience.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and so glad we did.  Our meals were outstanding.  I had their wonderful French onion soup followed by wreckfish with greens with an added crab cake.  Divine!  Hubby had lamb chops done to perfection with veggies in season. Wine was a nice pour and reasonably priced.  Portions were large, so no room for dessert. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time going for dinner at Choplin's and the food was just as great as the first time.  Every single member of the staff is very warm and welcoming.  They are also very accommodating as well.  I had asked about an appetizer/small plate that I saw online and turns out was on the lunch menu not on the dinner menu.  Our waiter (Matt) offered to ask the chef if he would make it for us and he did. The overall atmosphere of this restaurant is great I highly suggest it!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place during my trip from Chicago. By far the best fish (mahi mahi) and presentation that I've had in this area. The clams were great and my coworker had the seared tuna. You will not be disappointed with this place!! Will be returning before I head back."}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience possible. Our party of 6 had a 7:30 reservation, we arrived at 7:15 to be told, without apology, that they were running \"30 minutes behind\". If you knew you were running behind, the right thing to do would be to call your patrons with reservations and explain the situation so that we, (And our TODDLER) could make an informed decision. Instead we were made to feel like an inconvenience to the staff, not offered a drink of piece of bread while we were inconvenienced for 40 minutes. At 8:10pm, we were finally seated, again no apology for the now 40 minute late seating. We also had a 3 year old with us, who was losing patience faster than us... after being seated, and receiving 3 waters (for a 6 person table), we waited an additional 15 minutes without acknowledgement from our waitress. We watched her wait on the tables surrounding us for 15 agonizing minutes, even bringing drinks Beach to their table that had been ordered after we were seated, before we finally decided to leave. All of a sudden, the waitress was interested in her automatic 20% gratuity that was walking out the door,and tried to convince us to stay... her first words to us in over 15 minutes...what a joke. Needless to say, we left and had a wonderful dinner with amazing service at North Harbor Club, where the food was on the table by 9:05pm. I will gladly give my hard earned money to establishments that value their patrons time and money, unfortunately that is not the case at Chopplin's."}
{"text":"Arrogant manager and unresponsive owner.  After trying to redeem a voucher for a meal that listed no exclusions the manager who agreed that it wasn't stated used a line that said they had to follow state and local laws which didn't allow the discount of alcohol.  Seems a bit b.s. since a table stand promoted 1/2 price wine on Thursday nights.  There wasn't even an attempt to find middle ground even though options were offered.  I left the owner both an email and a voicemail and got no response back.  I waited 2 weeks before writing a review to see if there was an attempt at resolution or a polite response.  Instead it's seems they really don't care.  I'll agree that in most visits the food is pretty good, thought it can be over-seasoned at times.  I had been a regular but too many other options where I can spare the arrogance, Alton's, North Harbor Club, Dressler's, Red Rock's, Mickey and Mooch to name a few.  To add in response to the owner's comment and be transparent here's my email to him  Wesley  First off I apologize for my parting words with your staff last night.  The displeasure of being incited to such a response was also dis pleasurable.  The long and the short of it was the manner into which I was spoken to and the unwillingness to find a resolution.  I attempted to use a restaurant.com certificate and made the waitress aware from the beginning.  Once presented I was told it stated I didn't include alcohol.  I stated and showed my certificate didn't say that.  I was told the printed version did by the waitress but when one was brought out it didn't either.  Then said the fine print did.  In examining the manager got involved and said nope it doesn't but says (not exact words) but within state rules and the state doesn't allow discounts on alcohol.  However on your table top you promote 1/2 price wine night which is either a violation of the law or the manager is misinformed.  However any of this wouldn't be an issue if some resolution was offered.  Reimburse for certificate, so much off food or some compromise.  Instead the blame was put onto restaurant.com and nothing was done.  I've dined at your restaurant several times and have  recommended it to others.  I came in last night due to your marketing through restaurants.com.     Brian Elam"}
{"text":"Excellent all around dinner and service.  Best seared scallops I have had.  Family feel to the place and very comfortable.  Is in a strip center, but the food and comfortable vibe are worth a visit."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best! I have been here many times and my family loves the French Onion Soup along with the variety of different meats and vegetables they offer. I recently had the pork chop and was amazed! The staff is super friendly and responsive. They have made it to the top of my book!! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for fine dining at a great price. AMAZING JOB WES AND STAFF!!"}
{"text":"Great little place. From the outside, it looks like your average restaurant that serves American cuisine. But then you get seated with warm smiles and you know this isn't your average strip-mall restaurant. All of the recipes in here are handed down from the chef's own \"Mee Maw,\" which I think is awesome. I myself have running-in-the-family recipes from my grandma and great grandma, and I think it's great that the chef not only has cherished them, but serves them in a restaurant for his customers to enjoy. They have a varied menu, with daily specials. You can, however get the Mee-Maw special which has a little bit of everything. We tried the loaded potato soup that was hearty and delicious. I had the quiche with the salad, and my husband had the barbecue. Our friend ordered a burger. All of our food was delicious! We also had the apple cinnamon cake, which tasted a bit like a carrot / hummingbird cake. It was very light, fluffy and YUMMY! Will definitely go back to try other stuff from Mee Maw's cuisine."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in the Lake Norman area!"}
{"text":"Well, that was a lovely response! It definitely validates my post. We had planned on trying again, but probably not now. As someone who worked in restaurants for many years in virtually all capacities (hostess, server, bartender, manager, prep cook), I know that customer service is the priority...always. Your response shows me that you don't care. An apology and a request to return would have been way more effective. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful!  We attended a party that Choplin's was catering and found the selections abundant and flavorful.  The wait staff was also very nice and helpful.  White table cloths, great food, but no stuffiness, just a good place to eat."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Consistently very good....consistently the nicest staff ever....and consistently a lot of care going into the preparation of good food.  The chef is out and about and tells you what's fresh, which is rare at any restaurant.  At any smaller restaurant, you have to be willing to wait sometimes for things...since there is a smaller staff.  I've never minded waiting and I've never waited a long time.  A relaxed attitude, good appetite, and an appreciation for people who also love food is what you need to bring with you to Choplin's.  We've tried every other restaurant in the area and nobody touches this place on service.  The bourbon-spiked French Onion soup is to-die-for!!!  Menu changes regularly according to what's fresh---which again is something that a smaller restaurant is able to do more successfully.  If you're looking for fancy decor or some sort of ambient distraction......maybe you should pay more attention to the food in front of you and enjoy it for a minute."}
{"text":"I would consider myself what some would call a foodie and this place is totally one of my favorites. Some of the best places I have ever eaten in have been in a strip mall. I believe because they keep the overhead low and focus primarily on the food and service.   The menu is chef driven and is always fabulous and changing. The food is always fresh and oh so good!!!  The wine list is amazing and the service is always top notch.  The Chef and owner is always on sight and walking around to make sure you are enjoying your meal and to hear any feed back and suggestions.   The Lake Norman area is chock full of good restaurants and Choplin's has got to be in the top 3 hands down.  If you want a wonderful meal with good wine and great service that is quiet, romantic and relaxing....Choplin's is the place to be.  Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"I ate at Choplin's a while back and was very impressed, and only recently came back for another visit. I think there are some excellent items on the menu and I appreicate that they have affordable lunch specials every day. However, I was a bit disappointed with my experience this time.  I ordered the monday special- breaded chicken breast with choice of two sides. It took a long time for the food to arrive, which was surprising, considering that I arrived early and the place was pretty empty. The food was very good- especially the sweet potato casserole which was very flavorful. The collard greens were my other side and they were pretty good, but they didn't stand out in any particular way. The chicken breast with gravy was good, but there wasn't enough of it. There was simply  not a lot of food on my plate. I realize that it was a special for under ten dollars. But some rolls would be nice. Or maybe a cup of soup.   I think Choplin's is a nice place and I'm willing to return because I like supporting local businesses and avoiding chains. I just wasn't wowed. A little more food on the plate and maybe next time I will be."}
{"text":"Used a groupon for dinner. We loved it. Filet Mignon for me and Grilled Romaine salad and Pasta with Scallops and Shrimp for him. Really delicious. Not crazy about the automatic 20% tip but will go back anyway. Server was very good too."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in LKN!  Constantly changing menu of fresh and delicious choices and friendly service."}
{"text":"I am so glad my husband and I gave Choplin's another chance!  We returned after a long absence when we came upon a Groupon for a weekend dinner.    The decor has been updated, with muted dark gray walls, and very comfortable seating.  It's very classy, and a fitting improvement from before.   Choplin's has a chef's menu, where the menu changes daily.  There are quite a few steak options to choose from, as well as several seafood options and other meats, like chicken and lamb.  It's like having a special every day.    We started with the french onion soup (him) and fried lobster tail (me).  Our server, Corey, said they had the best french onion soup in town, and he wasn't lying.  Their version is less salty than the usual, but it was still so full of flavor.  My lobster tail was divine.  It was light and crispy, and was served with a delicious remoulade sauce.    For our entrees, I had the scallops with quinoa, and my husband had the 12-ounce fillet.  The scallops were served with a rich curry flavored sauce that was delightful.  I did my best to soak up as much as I could with the scallops and quinoa.    My husband's steak was fork tender.  He said it truly rivaled some of the higher end restaurants we've visited, too.    We knew our favorite server from another restaurant, Corey, worked here, and he was just as wonderful as we remembered.  The other servers helped to serve our dishes and clear our plates, and everyone was friendly and helpful.   When we left, the waiting area was packed.  Choplin's is certainly worth the wait.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We tried Choplin's for the first time last night. Everyone enjoyed their meal thoroughly. We had the mother nature salad, a crab dip appetizer, and a crab cocktail appetizer. For entrees we enjoyed the Pork Porterhouse, Filet Medallions, and New York Strip. We didn't try dessert.. but I will make sure we do on our next trip back. Cory provided great service."}
{"text":"Love this charming restaurant. The food, ambiance and service were perfect. Loved the music!  Our server, Elizabeth, made us feel right at home and made terrific recommendations. Was difficult to choose from all of the cleverly named dishes. The chicken salad sandwich was out of this world and the collard greens side, quite tasty. Felt very comfortable and not rushed. Would highly recommend this restaurant and definitely plan on returning!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant out using a Living Social $30 voucher. (which is only good for certain nights} Very nice place, but we did not enjoy the food that much as it was simply mediocre, took over 50+ minutes to get, and was VERY over priced. When leaving a negative review on Living Social the next day,  and instead of apologizing and taking my feedback, I was attacked by the chef/owner who went on to insult me and call me names so will NEVER EAT there again! Poor unprofessional behavior from the owner!!! {See pics of convo)"}
{"text":"I have a standing lunch appointment with a close friend and we always meet at Choplin's & LOVE it!!   I have never been disappointed in any meal I have chosen, the atmosphere is warm and inviting and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly!  So happy to have this wonderful restaurant in town."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Choplins. From the crab appetizer to the after dinner coffees, everything was delicious and the service was very good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Choplin's the other night for Valentine's Day dinner. They did not accept the groupon we had, saying they don't take them on Holidays (even though that is no where on the groupon site). The appetizer we ordered, the blue crab and spinach fondue, tasted like canned tuna. They ran out of the steak I tried to order (12oz filet at 7pm, so it wasn't late in the evening) and they tried to make up for it by giving me a cut of another type of steak in addition to the 8oz filet. However, they were cooked at different temps (the smaller piece of sirloin was over cooked) and still charged me for the full piece of 12 oz. filet. Tables were cramped and too close together. Had to wait for a while even though we had a reservation. Overall, I would not recommend this place, there are a lot of other restaurants where you can get better food and much better service for  less cost."}
{"text":"I think Choplin's is great. The couple of bad reviews on here are immature nonsense. Complaints about the waiter adding the tip when it states that larger parties will have the tip added as they do most anywhere. And whining about not getting alcohol covered by a coupon is ignorant. It's state law, and if the guy doesn't know the difference between discounting the price of a bottle of wine and not allowing it to be paid for with a coupon, well what can anyone say to that ignorance? Steaks are always perfectly done.French onion soup is superb, as is the seafood. Homemade soups. Different menu every day. Excellent wine and beer. A few dollars more but then, a cut above. Worth it, and Groupon coupon fixes that. Everyone is professional, friendly, and knowledgeable. Kudos to Wes et al."}
{"text":"Had late lunch there on a Friday; my BFF was kinda put off by the decor and thought it was more of an evening place - I didn't have an issue. We shared several plates and all of it was delicious! The chicken satay (my name for it since it came with a ginger/peanut sauce) was tender, well cooked, moist chicken. Loved it. The hot crab /spinach dip was some of the best I've had - not too crabby, mellow and comforting. The 'chips' were weird, like fried Indian bread or something - I would prefer a different chip. But it was good. The New Waldorf Salad was excellent, I could have eaten that all day. We also ordered a side of the mac and cheese; it reminded me of grandma's -simple and uncomplicated. I liked it. This is a good place for a girls lunch - wait staff was excellent - food was solid and the prices were in line."}
{"text":"I have a culinary background and have eaten all around Lake Norman and Charlotte. We eat at home a lot but when my husband asks where I want to go out to dinner, it is always Choplin's. The chef is always adding to or seasonally changing the menu. Great service, knowledgeable wait staff. If you think your a foodie and don't love this place, you might need to rethink."}
{"text":"Food was astounding. The lobster bisque was so creamy and full of flavor. For entrees We both had the filet, slightly charred more than I like, but the inside was incredible!!! Adding a lobster tail wound up being a little more pricey than we thought it would be, but it was worth it at least once. So succulent. Our server, Corey was excellent we enjoyed his service as he was cheery and smiling the entire time. Such an inspiring, optimistic demeanor that more people should have! We enjoyed this experience so much and can't wait to return"}
{"text":"WOW! Me and my husband came here to try something different and WOW!!!! Excellent food!  Excellent flavor!  Excellent service!  Honestly very impressed!!  Will DEFINITELY be back again!!!!  My husband got the ribs and he said they were the best!  He says they are \"very tender, juicy, and fall off the bone... The way ribs are meant to be cooked.\" I got the scallops and they were amazing.....really.    We are very impressed.    Fantastic new place on our list to visit.  We love to eat out since we both work full time and no one has time to cook much. This place will be one of our regulars now. Kudos to the owner/chef at Choplin's.  Good job!   Just wish we knew our favorites would always be on the menu.  :). The menu changes each day but everything is amazing anyway."}
{"text":"My wife and I just had our first meal there tonight. If I could give it a couple of more stars, I would. We shared the crab and cheese fondue with fresh warm bread. OVER THE TOP!  WE then shared a wedge. I hold a high bar for wedges as we both are very picky on this one. The one that we shared was at the top.  We topped it off with lobster tails and medalions. My wife was stuffed by the time that this came and fortunately, I had most of this highlight of our night to myself. Service was most exceptional and genuinely friendly.  I cannot wait to go back. I might even take my wife."}
{"text":"This WAS absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in the area! They used to have promos and coupons which is what usually brought us in from a few exits North. Not that they started out unreasonably priced, we just tend to go places that are on Entertainment.com, Groupon or LS. Since we don't drive by here often, we are guilty of forgetting to visit as often as I'd like. They're off exit 28, in the area behind Starbucks where the old Bi-Lo used to be. It's a very unassuming location but the food's always fresh.   My review originally was 5 stars, but now it's down to 3 for a few reasons.  1) their prices have gone up. 2) the male waiter we had was very odd, and made us all uncomfortable, and 3) they overcharge for add ons (for salads), and 4) my beloved onion soup has become far too salty (this has happened the last few times)  This used to be my absolute favorite restaurant. However, after our last dinner there I may have changed my mind. My go-to here was the french onion soup. It was like drinking from a salt-lick runoff this last time. Painfully salty.  Our waiter was frankly odd. At first he started out kind of funny/quirky, but then he just became weird. As our meal progressed, we found ourselves more and more uncomfortable with his quirkiness.  The deal killer for me was when we got the bill. We were charged either $13 or $14 to add a tiny bit of grilled chicken to an already overpriced ($12) simple caeser salad. Their prices seem to have left the 'reasonable range' and I don't feel the food's flavors or presentation merit such a hike.   Because of this, it's no longer at the top of my list. Which is a shame, because their food is GENERALLY fresh, flavorful and creative. And usually, the ladies we have wait on us are great. They were moderately busy on a Friday night (only 3-4 open tables), but service, pricing and quality went way down. So, if you've never been here, it's worth a try. But, I fear they may have jumped the shark."}
{"text":"ok, the food is great. I liked that but let me tell you some things that I think shoudl happen when I pay more than 150.00 for dinner. One, a cocktail should not be 15.00. That is way to high. Secondly If I am still eating my appetizer, don't bring the dinner and say you are bringing it so it will not get cold. I thought it was just us but the table access had the same thing happen while eating their salad.   I want to enjoy both things hot, so wait another 10 minutes before cooking the main course. I love the freshness of the food but would have like to have a nicer whole experience. Not  a lover of the paper on the tables either(my husband said) or the music which should be acoustic so we can chat.  I also had a credit from a groupon we were not allowed to apply because we had a free fondue which looked more like a dip."}
{"text":"Excellent food and ok service. The restaurant became busy after we arrived and our waiter wasn't very attentive. The menu changes daily a D the food is fresh. Mr. Choplin does an amazing job with the menu options. We had the baked mozzarella filet and sirloin and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my parents and we loved it! It's hidden from the main road so it wasn't too busy on a Friday night. The food is a little pricey but they give you nice portions and the quality matches the price. The thing that stood out the most to me was the service. Matt was our waiter and he handled my father's (terrible) dad jokes, our indecisiveness and all of our questions very well. Our waters were never low and the food came out quickly and warm.  We ordered crab fondue to start, the NY strip, crispy duck, and a spicy pasta with every type of seafood you could think of on it. All of our dishes were really tasty. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice for lunch now, and everything I've eaten has been excellent -- a \"4.5\" or so among places in this area.  It's between Thai Marlai and Blockbuster, back from Catawba Ave behind the Waffle House, etc; it's not a terrific location (an old shopping center that has seen at least two other restaurants come and go in the last few years), but the food makes up for that.  I wouldn't call it a seafood restaurant, just a restaurant with some seafood dishes on the menu (fish & chips, et al.).  For lunch there were three or four salads ($7-$8), three or four sandwiches (also ~$8), a handful of entreés available.  I'd been there for lunch before, a year or so ago; had the \"mother earth\" salad (which was awesome) and something very good for dessert, don't remember what it was (something fruity?).  Today I went for lunch and had a crabcake sandwich with cayenne mayonnaise (subtly spicy, not too much), side of mac & cheese (great-- cheesy, without a processed feel); then for dessert, chocolate bread pudding (super) with vanilla ice cream.  Total ~$15, or under $10 with no dessert (but get a dessert)."}
{"text":"It's tIme for an updated Choplin's review and Chef Wes and crew are once again up to the 5 Star task.  According to check-in's I'm at 16 visits over the years with the most recent coming this weekend on a kind of spur of the moment, \"Honey what do you feel like eating\" moment.  I'm an absolute sucker for their Bourbon French Onion soup which is a menu staple but this visit was intrigued by the lobster bisque which I'd never seen available before.  What a nice change-up!  This was by far the best lobster bisque I've had recently and I've had it from Ruth's Chris, Capital Grille and Alton's over the past 6 months or so.  Let's just say those others are lacking big time vs. the flavor Chef was able to deliver.  I tried a steak cut I'd never heard of and again was glad I did.  A \"Times Square\" striploin.  It was about a 2 inch thick rectangle of perfect medium rare goodness.  So tender and flavorful.  The side was scalloped potatoes that are again a Choplin's standard and absolutely creamy and delicious.  My wife had the mussels app as her dinner.  They were served in a \"please soak me up with bread\" tomato sauce and, we did as ordered.  Most of the servers have been there for years and are quick with a smile, friendly banter and go out of their way to make regulars and new diners alike feel comfortable.  The menu has a lot of rotating standards and many changing, what's fresh today, options and in my opinion, it really does not matter what you order as Wes will bring it forth with great flavor.  if you don't see it on the menu just ask and it's likely something that suits you can be whipped up.  Saw it in action on this visit as a customer a table over was Vegan and before we left, I saw him eating his meal and looking happy doing it.  Thanks Choplin's for doing what you do so well and doing it here in LKN!"}
