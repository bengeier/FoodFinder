{"text":"Came today with family. They now have stirfrys too. We had the singaporean noodles, general tao and some sushi. Very friendly staff, fast. Will come back"}
{"text":"Hidden away on Rachel Street, there lies Izu sushi,

let's get the interior out of the way first: it blows, just a couple of tables and some chairs strewn about, the bare minimum so you can recognize a facsimile of a restaurant.

Onto the good stuff, they have a large selection of creative maki rolls, with soya rolls, regular rolls and rice paper rolls. Their take on the standard sushi rolls will have to wait.

The sushi is fresh and prepared on the spot, the rolls are a good size and quite flavorful, the Miso soup had a lemony tinge and the salad had a good amount of seafood in it.

The prices are a bit too high and they don't seem to have any 8 piece medium Maki Rolls, which I found odd.
But if this is the worst I can say about the place, then it's not a bad place to get sushi."}
{"text":"Came today for an impromptu christmas dinner. We enjoyed our dinner very much! Our waiter was really friendly and really made our night :) will definitely come back again!"}

{"text":"I have a weekly sushi craving and Izu sushi has been the place I've been ordering from, sometimes even twice a week. The sushi is always soooo fresh and delicious! Definitely highly recommend Izu sushi"}
{"text":"It's my best friend Patrick's birthday, and we wanted some real quality Japanese food, so my other friend, Dean, did some research. He came up with Izu, and we decided to give it a try. The sushi shop is relatively small and unassuming, not lavishly decorated like some of it's close by contemporaries. Instantly, Howard, who we assume to be the owner, eagerly welcomed us. We decided to intrust him with a randomly picked combo, and he graciously provided us with a refreshing wakame salad. From our table, we could see the sushi being made, a fact which tortured us and tantalized us, but mesmerized us all the same. The sushi was simply delicious, a delightful variety. Just great sushi. I'd recommend the place, frankly. Happy bday pat"}
{"text":"The owner here is great! So helpful and friendly and just a sweet guy. There is a lot to choose from which I love and some nice
Combos too. We took the food to go and did not stay to eat at the restaurant itself, it is very bare in there and made it feel a bit uncomfortable. The food came out really quick, almost too quick, because I'm not sure how fresh four rolls can be if they came out in probably less than 10 minutes. So food I would give 3/5 and service would be 5/5. I'm glad I tried Izu but I know there are better sushi joints around."}
{"text":"The owner was incredibly welcoming and helpful, and the sushi was the best I've had in Montreal by far. You can also see the sushi being made, which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Izusushi is one of my favorite sushis restaurant on Montreal island. Their sushis are always fresh and tasty. Unique creations are available there such as Rachel, which is a mix of spicy tuna, tempura, avocado, apple and ginger.

I've been there many times and always been completely satisfied with what I ordered and the service. Staff is friendly, fast and convenient."}
