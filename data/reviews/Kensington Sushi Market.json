{"text":"A great little place to get sushi and poke bowls! The dynamite roll was one of the best I've ever tried. It was so good I had to order one for takeout as well. Definitely did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"The salmon teriyaki was literally cooked by wrapping it in plastic wrap and microwaving it for 2 minutes. Needless to say it tasted terrible."}
{"text":"Great new sushi place in Kensington Market with very fresh ingredients, reasonable pricing, and friendly staff. Highly recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"New spot for sushi in Kensington market. Not much seating but they have takeout. Lots of tasty colourful options"}
{"text":"This new spot in Kensington Market offers good sushi at a reasonable price. They have a variety of rolls on offer, as well as miso soup and other standard sushi-place offerings. They accept credit and debit cards as well.  One thing that is not apparent from the sidewalk is that they have a good selection of grab-and go sushi in the case directly in front of where all the sushi is prepared.  They also have seating for about 15-20 guests (max) in the back of the Restaurant. The seating is pretty bare bones, but for anyone who has eaten a meal in Kensington Market, finding a minimally comfortable, non-cramped place to sit in a restaurant is not an easy task.  I enjoyed my meal here. This is a worthwhile spot in Kensington Market that will hopefully survive the winter and become a long-term staple in the area."}
{"text":"I came in on a whim and was not disappointed the udon fowl and the pok√© bowl were some of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"A great new addition to Kensington. The sushi is fresh, the staff are nice, the prices are reasonable, what's not to love. Wishing them the best of luck."}
