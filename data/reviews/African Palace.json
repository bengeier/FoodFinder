{"text":"I'd been to African Palace a few times when it was impossible to get a table at Nazareth and so I already knew that the food was mediocre. This last time was the first time I'd been since developing Celiac disease and it was just a horrible experience all around. First of all, extremely poor service. I tried explaining to the server (owner?) that I have a gluten intolerance and she just cut me off and walked away. I ended up ordering 100% teff injera, which is normally delicious, but this one was lumpy and at least a few days old. We weren't offered anything to drink or given any napkins. I finally got up to ask for them behind the bar and she apologized, said she would bring them, and then proceeded to sit down at one of the tables and chat with a customer. I will never, ever, ever go back."}
{"text":"Bar none my favourite Ethiopian restaurant in the city. The service is fast and friendly, the prices are very affordable, and the food is delicious. The beef tibbs are my favourite dish - I order it to go at least once a month. The vegetarian platter is excellent as well. So flavourful.   People of the world who have not tried Ethiopian food yet, I feel sad for you. This is one of the best places to go and remedy that."}
{"text":"I booked a group dinner here, for about 16 people.  It was amazing, the owner was super friendly and accommodating.  And for $25 a head for tons of food and a lot of drinks, you really can't go wrong.    The food was really tasty, we had the veggie platter.  Really can't say a single negative thing, would definitely go again."}
{"text":"This place rules. Much better than the super-overrated Nazareth a couple of doors down.  Our standard order is the veggie platter plus a sizzling plate of tibs, shared amongst two people. The samosas are yummy too.  The lady who runs this place is motherly and sweet; you kind of wish you could give her a hug."}
{"text":"Never as slammed as the neighbouring Nazareth, but just as tasty. The owner is very sweet and is more than willing to help first timers get into the Ethiopian groove (she'll show you how to use just the right amount of injera to scoop up the mouth-watering stews, the usual North American inclination is to use too much injera--to try and keep your fingers from getting saucy). The ambience is a  bit lacking, but it beats waiting for an hour to be seated and then another hour to be served (as was my recent Naz experience)."}
{"text":"Shared the meat and vegetable platter for five. The hostess/owner was amazing, very friendly and inviting. Food came surprisingly fast and unlike Nazareth on the same block, we were brought extra injera at no charge. That being said, the food at Nazareth is better. The meats were a bit dry but as it was still flavorful and the service was stellar I have to give them a good rating.  We finished with the coffee ceremony (freshly roasted coffee and popcorn) and then took turns rolling each other back to our hotel."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's day.  The place is nicely decorated and has a quiet, friendly atmosphere.  They were very friendly, and the food was delicious.  We even got a top up of Injera and free dessert! Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I once came here when Nazareth was closed. Needless to say my friend and I were bummed it was, but we figured we would give it a shot. Despite being the only people in the restaurant (around 4pm) our food took forever. When it finally arrived, it was lukewarm and tiny - not to our Nazareth expectations. The service was okay enough, but it just wasn't good. Half the food, twice the price. Doubt I'll ever return."}
{"text":"African Palace was my first experience with Ethiopian food, and boy, was it good!  We ordered the meat and veggie platter, and it was filled with such flavourful, saucy goodness. It was spicy, but tolerable (this coming from a person who is absolutely terrible with handling spice). It was also quite interesting eating with our hands and using the Injera as the food scooper. However, in the end when we all ran out of Injera and had some of the meat and veggies left, we asked for forks to finish everything up. I don't know if we committed some sort of cultural taboo, but what is one to do when there is no Injera left to scoop the meat and veggies? (Serious question.)  The service was friendly. The restaurant was beautifully decorated with a serene atmosphere. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Ended up here because Nazareth was closed, but we were not disappointed!  Got the veggie platter for three and it was more than enough delicious food for the three of us.  The service wasn't great- they came by thinking they forgot our order rather than they hadn't taken it.  Didn't ask if we wanted any drinks.  Said they would bring more injera, but forgot (and then remembered when they walked by our table).  But it was a tasty, filling, inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there twice. We do like this place. The food is delicious, a little bit spicy for me but still tasty. Also the decoration and the music are amazing. I strongly recommend this place. If you are going in group, give them a call before, it's a small place and get busy easily. Enjoy"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Ethiopian food. The serving size is very generous whether you dine in or get takeout. The service can be slow. However, the friendly lady makes up for it. If you or someone wants to try Ethiopian food for the first time, definitely go here! She shows all first timers how to pick up the food and even hand feeds you. The coffee ceremony is a cool experience. I would recommend people to only get it if they are in a group of 3+ or really love strong brewed coffee. I had it with one other person and it felt like we ordered bottomless coffee because it wouldn't end."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have been curious to try Ethiopian food for a while, and decided to come to African Palace on a weeknight. Place is not fancy and service was a bit indifferent, but nothing that would prevent us from coming back. We ordered the vegetarian platter for one and the doro wat (boneless chicken stew with berbere spices). The curries on the platter were good and the injera was spongy and soft - perfect for scooping up the food! The chicken stew was VERY tasty, and was our favourite. I also tried the spicy tea, which was kinda of like a chai (without the milk) with black pepper. Not bad! All in all, we really liked the food and will try some more soon."}
{"text":"I had dinner there tonight, great place, great food, and great service. Our order was fulfilled quickly: the meat and vegetable combo platter is definitively to try! As an extra, if you want to experience something different, order the coffee: delicious and totally worth it."}
{"text":"\"My first time eating Ethiopian cuisine Experience\" - delicious , affordable and close to Indian food.  Today I have visited to this place for dinner with two of my friends.  We have ordered, 1) Samosa  2) one person Veg platter 3) Two Person Meat Platter(Two Meat - Chicken and Lamb curry, Four Veg curry)  Satisfied with the food taste and I would recommend people to visit this place :)  Decent place to hangout !! Drinks also available!! :)  **Only Problem is they don't accept cards , so you need to carry cash**"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. I feel more like I'm at an Ethiopian home than a restaurant."}
{"text":"As a big fan of AP at their old location, I was super happy to see they had re-opened closer to Davenport.  Unfortunately, I have one major concern about the new spot.  Because it is only a few doors away from Nazerath, it is only a matter of time until it becomes equally or more busy and therefore inaccessible.  Food at AP is better than Nazerath (which I also enjoy) and it currently costs less (in reality it is fresher and should cost slighly more in my opinion).  Portions size? Massive.  Went with 2 friends and had the meat and veggie platter for 2 with a side order of Kitfo. All delicious and unbelievably fresh.  I've lived in the area for years and tried most of the Ethiopian restaurants here and across the city.  Since discovering AP I rarely go elseware anymore.  There is something different about the food at AP, not sure what it is, but it tastes fresher and more \"homeade\".  The owner is very friendly and clearly passionate about the food, and about ensuring you enjoy it, so it does not surprise me that she is putting more into it than others.  Oh yes, forget to mention that this meal, along with 3 cold beers, came to a total of $40!  My advice:  get there while you can, before the Nazereth crowd clues in to it, and enjoy the best Ethiopian food currently available in TO!"}
{"text":"This place is in some ways even better than nazareth next door! The meat is always fresher and in my opinion higher in quality. I like the taste of their injera better, its less sour. I also like the chicken dish better than Nazareth's. The lamb dishes are both excellent and of course beef tibs are great! What even better is that you get to sit down right away and you dont have to wait for 2 hours to be fed. The portions are a tiny bit smaller than Nazareth's but everything esle makes up for it. Plus they serve lamb on a sizzling plate! The owner is a very nice lady who believes in her food. :) Yum!! I give African Palace 5 stars!"}
{"text":"After trying Nazareth, Nunu and Ethiopian House, I made my way to African Palace. Overall, the food, service and atmosphere were \"meh\". The food was a bit muted lacking the flavourful spices and rich colours I've become used to. A moist towel was not provided to clean your hands before or after eating (a standard at many other places I've been). Each dish tasted as though it had been sitting a while - which was evident by the fact it arrived 1min after we ordered. Garbage was piled in the corner near the door the bathroom. Likely won't return."}
{"text":"OUR FAVE!  We come here regularly, and often in large groups with kids.  Mary is amazing and the perfect host.   Plus the window art is awesome, of course"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. Delicious food, friendly customer service, comfortable setting and affordable pricing. Highly recommended to veterans of Ethiopian food and newbies. They are located a short walking distance between Dufferin and Ossington stations, Also, has a great vegetarian selection. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Pretty expensive compared to Nazareth. I had a hair in my food. Even the food I ate wasn't very good."}
{"text":"I went to African Palace one night with my boyfriend when we were starving and there was a massive line at Nazareth. Reading a prior Yelp review saying that African Palace was comparable to Nazareth with virtually no wait time, we decided to take a chance. What a mistake that was. We walked in and the place was empty - that should have been our first red flag. We ordered exactly the same thing we order at Nazareth and the food just didn't compare. It was a little cold, the portions were much smaller for a more expensive price tag and the food wasn't as flavourful. Go to Nazareth and save yourself the unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"The food was good, we had the 3 person non veg platter. However, they are cash only and did not post that clearly in the restaurant or mention it when we sat down. As tourists we did not have CAD and they added a hefty surcharge in order to accept our USD, so the customer service left us wanting."}
{"text":"Friendly, delicious, and inexpensive. I have had so many delicious meals and generally wonderful experiences here. If you love Ethiopian, you shouldn't miss this place. Last night, my friend inquired about one of the spices used in a lentil dish. Our amazing server actually went and got her a little container of it to take home!"}
{"text":"1. The food is divine. We (three of us) ordered platter for 2. It was enough for us. We finished it all. 2. Service is good, sometimes slow. But, no big deal. 3. Lamb is great! 4. The TV is annoying. This place is for socializing and catching up with friends. Yet, the sports channel is on and the TV is big. It is a distraction."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner at African Palace upon the recommendation from Yelp!  I forgot how filling and large of portion Ethiopian food is.  We ordered the platter for 2 that had a bit of everything and left stuffed and surprised we could even come close to finishing the dish.  The service really stands out at this place - servers are unrushed, friendly and happy to explain anything on the menu.  I felt like I was dining in a friend's restaurant.  Will definitely going back.  This is a great option on the Bloor/Ossington/Dovercourt strip.  I always ponder why Ethiopian restos cluster together.  There are 3 on this strip - seems odd, given that there are probably 10 total in the city.  None the less, African Palace is a good stop.  Tip:  Get the coffee and let the frankincense rip!  I nearly smoked out the entire place with my eager stoking of the frankincense ember.  Good times!"}
{"text":"**3.5**  Mr. H and I wanted to introduce our friends to Ethiopian cuisine and picked Nazareth. We got there and realized that its closed on a Sunday! Their yelp page doesn't have the open-close timings, but luckily for us there are 2/3 other options in the same location. That's how we all ended up at African Palace.  Our orders were taken pretty quickly and we were served quickly too. The food by itself was very good, we ordered the meat and veggie platter for four and the quantity was perfect. It was the service that was lacking, there was just one server and one other person (chef) in the kitchen.   It took extremely long for us to get refills and although we really wanted to try the coffee ceremony we were told that it would be a 40 minute wait! Needless to say we left a little disappointed due to the lack of service."}
{"text":"Huge platters! I ordered a vegetarian platter for one that came with an extra injera. There were six different kinds of vegetables with a salad in the middle. It was really good. Service was lacking but the food made up for that."}
{"text":"I think I am a fan of the charm of this restaurant, the food, and Ethiopian cuisine in general. My bf was going to be around Ossignton area and we decided to Yelp for some restaurants. Out popped Nazareth as a nearby location and we had read some reviews of the insane line up's but we decided to take a chance. Unfortunately, we couldn't even see in the restaurant because of all the people waiting in line. So, by fluke, we walked up a few more steps and saw African Palace.  Intro. The restaurant is quite narrow and small, but we could see the kitchen staff and it felt immediately homey. After being seated, my bf and I quickly perused the menu and decided to eat the shared plate for 2 consisting of meat (lamb and beef) and assorted vegetables platter with a side of salad and Inerja (which tasted like crepes to me!) The food was delicious, and quite spicy, so beware for those with extreme low tolerance to spice. I loved it and really brought out the flavours.  I also ordered a half litre of red and quickly saw that the booze options were insanely CHEAP! A bottle of wine will set you back only $22.50. A bottle of Stella, normally priced around $7-$8 at most establishments offering \"high end\" exports, was only $4.50. Needless to say, both the food and alcohol will make your meal very complete. In the end, I was still feeling hungry, and decided to order the Fatoush (hope I am spelling it right) salad. I remember going to one of my friend's homes for summer bbq's and his mother would make the most delicious Middle Eastern salad ever...and I suddenly had a craving for it. Regardless, the Fatoush salad was tasty, fresh and light - sprinkled with chips of some kind which brought out the whole salad.  Now, I have't tried Nazareth, but what I can say is that if it is ever busy, come to African Palace and you will not be disappointed. It is a very cozy little restaurant where you eat with your hands, chat the night away, and leave feeling very satisfied."}
{"text":"Amazing flavours! Meat and veggie platter ($21 for 2 person) was great along with our additional order of Shiro Wat - The other vegetarian dish that isn't included in the platter. Worth the $12 for the serve and is a great addition to the already stellar spread.  We came here as an alternative to Nazareth and were pleased with the food.  The negative- Even though the restaurant only had a few guests, we had to ask for service, requesting additional injera and for our water to be refilled. But a warm atmosphere and good food made for a great date night!"}
{"text":"popped in here to satisfy a craving of Ethiopian food (the first time I had tried it, it was at Ethiopian House in Toronto).  it was self seating and we ordered the veggie platter for 2. It was bad food, but it also didn't satisfying the craving I had.  The food was somewhat bland and not as flavourful as I remember Ethiopian food to be. We were hungry so we finished our meal but it was the least to say it was satisfying. There wasn't \"service\" we were seated, our order was taken, and we walked up to the register to pay the bill.   I give this location a 3 star because of their honesty. When the bill was paid, an extra $20 was stuck together and the lady was nice enough to come back to us as we were walking out to say we OVER paid. Honestly goes along way in my books and if I'm in the area, I'd probably give them another chance."}
{"text":"Première expérience de restaurant éthiopien très satisfaisante. L'accueil est nickel et la serveuse vous montrera même comment utiliser les galettes afin de saisir la nourriture dans les assiettes (et nourrira de force l'un des convives). On nous a conseillé les assiettes à partager pour 3 qui consiste en une multitude de viandes différentes et de légumes de toute sorte (tomates, oignons, salade). Attention aux palais sensibles, il y a pas mal d'épices dans l'assiette donc demandez bien une carafe d'eau. Petit bémol : certaines tables brûlent des batons d'encens qui peuvent déranger certains clients.  A conseiller définitivement!"}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie platter and there was a long piece of hair in it. I tried to discreetly show the waiter the piece of hair and pointed it out without making a big deal over it because I didn't want any of the other customers to hear. He thought I was asking what one of the stews on the injera was. And when he finally realized that I was pointing out the hair...he actually looked ANNOYED at ME...like what?? He took away my plate without saying a word and when he brought it back, the portion of the stews on the injera were noticably a lot smaller. So to sum it up, there was hair in my food and the waiter was annoyed that he had to bring me a new plate, gave me smaller portions of each stew as a result. Also, I received no service after he brought me my new plate. No water refills, nothing. I didn't leave a tip. If you're looking for a good Ethiopian place, don't come here - go to Lalibela instead - it's just a short walk from the African Palace and you will have a much better dining experience there. I'm sure they won't get annoyed at you for accidentally putting hair in your food."}
{"text":"Ethiopian food may not be to everyone's liking because of the injera, that spongey, sour-tasting bread that you use to scoop up the variety of veggies (or meat). I fall on the side of being a fan.  It's been a couple of months since my last ethiopian meal so I forgot that you can't shovel the food in like racehorse because that injera is going to expand in your belly and you'll end up exploding like a pigeon eating uncooked rice (is that just a myth or true?). African Palace is a bit dark inside and when I used the women's bathroom, I'm pretty sure that rubber balloon on the ground was a ribbed condom but I wasn't going to inspect it further. The service though is good.  We ordered a vegetarian platter and a meat & veggies platter. We devoured the veggie platter like vultures. There were lentils, split peas, some dark reddish coloured kind of curry which was spicy & delicious, cabbage, spinach and beets - all unique in flavour and tasty!  My friends who were eating the meat platter paced themselves. The lady who served us came around and noticed food still on their platter. She asked if this was our first time eating ethiopian food (it wasn't). She proceeded to show us, regardless of our experience, on how to eat the food. She tore off a tiny piece of injera and then scooped up 3 different \"dishes\" and fed my friend like a baby haha! i think that was the highlight of the meal.  If you want the coffee, you have to order at the beginning of the meal as it takes time to prepare.  She brought out the coffee beans that were smoking and waved it around us to inhale. It was rich & intoxicating (and made the smoke alarm beep). She then brought out the coffee along with some incense and popcorn. Normally, I'm not a fan of incense because it reminds me of hippy stores and i hate hippies but this shit was good! So I would recommend this place but just eat slowly and enjoy the meal with some good buds! Another bonus, ethiopian food is gentle on the wallet too!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, with friendly service. We ordered the veggie platter for three, a plate of the samosas, plus a liter of wine. More than enough food, and it was delicious!   It came to $75 with a generous tip. $25 for a full meal plus 2-3 glasses of wine! It just can't be beat!  Also we were able to be seated almost immediately at 7pm on a Friday, which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Decent food, quick service compared to many other Ethiopian restaurants in the city. The Lamb is poorly made. Stick with beef or have lamb somewhere else."}
{"text":"Price: SWEET. If you're a poor student like me who has a big appetite, this is the right place. 20$ for stuffing 3ppl, oh boy!=D  Service: the lady was SOOO nice. She was like a nanny, showed us how to eat, and treated us like family. Funny too lol (she would doze off and bring food to the wrong table then wake up just before she let it down and say what am I doing? And move to the correct table)  Food: if you like injera, go for it. To be honest, I'm one of those \"can-eat-anything\" ppl, but I just couldn't swallow down more after having a few slices of injera. If it were naan, it would have been better but injera, let's face it, it looks and feels like sponge! Otherwise the meat and salad were amazing. I would go back just for the lamb, yum yum.  Atmosphere: it was around 4:30 when we went in, it was quiet, no blaring music, no loud customers, thought it did start to fill up around 6. Nevertheless, good place to have a quiet conversation.  Half a star off for the injera... It was too cold and soggy. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Im here on business a lot, so i eat out everyday.  This is my favorite place in Toronto.  The food is perfect, and the staff are friendly.  I just can not get enough of this place."}
{"text":"This is a great Ethiopian place in a little section near Ossington and Bloor which has a surprising number of Ethiopian places. Ive come here several times and always been impressed with the quality and the quantity of the food. We usually get the beef and veg platter with comes with a variety of chicken, lamb, chickpea and other dishes, all of which have to be soaked up with spongy Injera bread, which we inevitably run out of!   Always a delicious meal and a good value as well  Recommended"}
{"text":"This restaurant left an impression on me. I never forgot it. Especially the coffee ceremony which was a very nice experience and a unique option. Very friendly atmosphere and welcoming. I will definitely return at some point. It is a very convenient location near the dufferin subway on bloor. Very affordable and accessible.. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Opted for African Palace because Nazareth was good.  Great little spot.  Service was a little on the slow side but rightfully so as there was only a single waitress for an otherwise full house.  Admittedly, I haven't had too much Ethiopian food.  I had the meat platter and the flavours were great, particularly the goat.  I could eat a whole plate of the goat, actually.  Great for a vegetarian.  The spreads aren't overly saucy so they won't completely sog the already spongy injera.  It's also relatively cheap.  $20 for 2? Why not.  I'd return when the craving strikes again."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to African palace. Though I have always loved Ethiopian food because of it's close similarity with Indian food. My husband and I ordered a two person platter. It was sumptuous and amazing.  The place is nice and the food is not expensive at all. The owner is super nice and came and personally demonstrated the way to eat Ethiopian food.  Important thing you note is that they are a cash only place ."}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian food. My friend and I are always looking for different Ethiopian restaurants to try out and we heard good things about this place. When we walked in we were the only ones in there so we didn't know if we had to wait to be seated or what, so we kind of awkwardly walked in and sat down. Someone in the back must have heard us talking because they came out to greet us and brought our drinks. She took our orders and then came back to spread incense around the restaurant.   The food was good, we were really full. It was hard to get the server's attention though because she was busy doing other things so I couldn't get a refill on my water until my meal was basically finished. I think the service would have been better if we came later, since the place opens at 4pm and we got there around 4:45pm."}
{"text":"I would rather eat here any day of the week vs. Nazareth's!!  Great quality and quanity of food!! The owner is such a lovely lady!! Nice and clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nazareth is closed, so my sister and I ate here by default. It was nice that a lady checked in on us at the start of our meal and showed us how to eat with the injera, ripping off a piece and sort of using it as a claw/taco contraption with a swift swooping/pinching effect to pick up several things at once off the vegetarian platter... She then fed the both of us with the pieces she used to demonstrate. I haven't been fed by somebody since I was a child and was a little taken aback! It was a nice gesture, and it was even nicer of them to have given us an extra piece of injera on the house, when they saw that we needed a little more to finish the plate. Not a bad default to the well-rated Nazareth a couple of doors down, because it was quiet and rather cozy inside and the food came quickly. Friendliness, of course, is always a plus."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I initially wanted to visit Nazareth but because it was closed we chose this place. The menu is not very extensive. We ordered the 2 person meat and vegetable platter (2 meats, 6 vegetables). We have been to another Ethiopian restaurant and this one was was a lot better in terms of flavour for the lentils (I'm a vegetarian!). The spinach was good but i found it way too salty. My boyfriend liked the meats that were given (lamb and chicken), however he found the chicken to also be quite salty.  I would recommend but I probably wouldn't come here again, I would like to try other Ethiopian restaurants!"}
{"text":"Amazing curries served on delicious flat bread (injera)."}
{"text":"Great veggie platter! As a vegetarian, I really appreciate the wide selection of lentils in the platter, super healthy. Nice atmosphere in the place, has a locally-owned/family kind of feel.   Didn't really care for the service, the waiter seemed absent minded and didn't really attend to us except when we flagged him down. But he wasn't rude or anything, just not very friendly.   With that in mind, I would go back again because the food is super worth-it. Just don't expect friendly service.  p.s I saw a few potential diners walk out because they stood at the front waiting for someone to seat them, and eventually got frustrated by the lack of service and left. It's more of a seat yourself, and then flag down the waiter kind of place.  Also, no cutlery. But eating with your hands is half the fun :)"}
{"text":"It's nice to have an alternative to Nazareth right on the same block, especially with the insane popularity of the place attracting people from all over the city now making it nearly impossible to go there without a lot of planning.   Ousted locals can find their way to African Palace which recently moved from the Christie Pits area to Cleopatra's old digs. You can't miss this place. In honour of Oprah's departure of daytime tv they painted a portrait of her wearing a sash that says 'Queen of Hearts' in the window. It's pretty awesome.  A vegetarian combo platter for two rings in at $17.50, a good $10 more than what you'll get for the same dish at Nazareth. The quantity is also smaller, however the quality is noticeably better. Unlike Nazareth, which really shouldn't be eaten or viewed in the light of day, African Palace's selection of wats are an impressive feast for the eyes and mouth. We had corn, lentils, collared greens, a cabbage and carrot stew, and salad.   The best part is that you can order this dish for one if you don't have someone to share it and you'll get the perfect amount of food.  They also have a middle eastern menu for falafel lovers."}
{"text":"I decided to go out for Ethiopian food recently, which I haven't done as much since moving back to Scarborough, as most of the places that I used to go are either along the Danforth or downtown. I have been to African Palace 3-4 times before, always later in the evening as they are open until 11pm every night. This was the first time that I had visited during dinner hours, and they were much busier than previous visits, but I didn't have to wait for a table, although the wait for food was longer but still ok. It's usually dark when I go late, but it was also a little dim inside this time. The restaurant is thin and deep, seating maybe 30 people, with not a lot of decoration up front, mainly mirrors along the walls, with a small bar by the kitchen in the back.  For food, I generally have either the vegetarian platter or meat-veg platter (which is a smaller vegetarian platter with beef tibs). The platters have small portions of different dishes on one piece of injera, with a green salad, and there is also more injera on the side. The vegetarian dishes will vary a little, but I usually get red lentils / chick peas / split peas / cabbage and carrots / collard greens, all in various spices. The meat-veg platter that I had this last time had 4 vegetarian dishes plus a good-sized portion of the beef tibs, which were tender and spicy. Overall the food is very good and very filling. With one bottle of beer, my bill was $18, cash only."}
{"text":"This is Great place to eat,  my first time eating Ethiopian cuisine and I would come back again . Simply delicious:) and very affordable!"}
{"text":"Flavorful vegetarian options. I also find myself craving the fish tibs a lot. The coffee here is really delicious, and served with popcorn to cut the bitterness for thosse who aren't as into coffee. Service is prompt, friendly and helpfful."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is perfect for dates: small tables, low lighting, slow music, and very cultural decor. The service, however, was alright. At the beginning, they are very friendly and accomodating. However, they never came around to refill the waters and when our table was towards the end of finishing (still food on our plates) they came over to collect them abruptly.   The meal: we ordered a veggie platter and a meat platter to share amongst 3 people. Although we all expected to enjoy the meat more, the veggies definitely took the W on this one. The veggie platter came with 6 different types, plus a salad with vinegrette in the middle. The sauce of the meat was not as spiced as we had hoped for, which was a total bummer considering Ethiopian food NEEEEDS to be spiced well. On top of that, the meat was lacking; most of the dish was served with bones. This meat platter is also served with a salad on the side.  Just a heads up: although this resto closes at 23:00, their kitchen closes by 22:30!!! Sooo, if you want to come for dinner you MUUUST come by 22:15 latest."}
{"text":"First time I've had Ethiopian food so can't compare it to other places. But really enjoyed the experience. We had the meat/vegetarian platter. The taste was a little different but enjoyable. We ate everything with our fingers and used the bread that the platter sat on.   I think I preferred the experience over the taste. Also the price was really low especially for all the food you get in your platter."}
{"text":"We had a great time at African Palace. The restaurant has a nice ambiance and friendly service. The veggie and meat platter for two comes with a lot of delicious food for a reasonable price. Overall, a very satisfying experience."}
{"text":"Lovvvved it! I'm still dreaming about it. Just two doors down from Nazareth I'm sure the place gets a lot of run-off. That being said, it is comparable and some dishes are even better than Nazareth!  The service is so much friendlier, injera is complimentary, and the food is delicious.  I loved the vegetarian dishes here and the flavour of the meat dishes was good but the texture could use a bit of work (it was a bit tough).   That being said, I will probably be back here instead of waiting in crazy lines next door."}
{"text":"After signing the lease for our soon-to-be diggs, my future roomie and I set out to check out what was good in the the hood. I knew from a quick peruse of googlemaps that there were 3 ethiopian places near by, so we thought we'd try one. Our first stop was a quick run-in and run-the-heck-out again of Queen of Sheba (See my review: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-queen-of-sheba-restaurant-toronto#hrid:nqC7Km2BiOMgmfsjC7uP1Q) and Nazareth had a huge line, so we popped into African Palice.   It didn't take long for our beautiful veggie platter to arrive, along with two small plates of a folded, flat bread like substance. It was drool at first sight, and we were pumped to dive in--until we realized that we had no idea how to eat it. Laughing, we sheepishly pleaded ignorance to our server, who responded with a wide smile and a very INTIMATE demonstration. She tore a piece off of the flat bread, called injera, and used it to scoop up several of the stewed veggetable mixtures on our platter. Without skipping a beat, she had my head back, mouth open and was placing that morsel of goodness right into my pie hole. I kid you not. And WHAT a morsel! After seeing what a kick we got out of this, she repeated the process with my friend, with good humour and with the efficent, no-nonsense manner of your own Auntie. We couldn't have hoped for a more entertaining first bite of Ethiopian.   Everything on the platter was delicious: there were two portions of a spicy spread, a warm spinach mixture, stewed lentils, something similar to warm curried hummus, and a tasty garlicy salad in the middle. It was PLENTY of food for two, and we both left stuffed and happy (especially after we paid; two beers and the platter came to around $25!)  Warm atmosphere, friendly service, delicious food and a price that lights me up inside. I see African Palace becoming a regular spot for this new member of Dufferin Grove."}
{"text":"really love the lady working here. She's so warm & friendly :)   I like the way the menu is setup (although I was a bit confused at first). You can order a veg + meat platter which automatically comes with all the veg menu items #1 through #6 (e. g.  red/green lentils,  cabbage,  salad) as well as meat items #9 beef & #10 lamb. We added #11 chicken.    The food came promptly & everything was cooked well. The only setback is the lamb (bone-in) was cold but it wasn't a big enough issue for us to send the platter back. The beef was my absolute favorite -  so savoury and juicy! I really enjoyed the platter and you can request extra Injera, no problem! :)  Full bar on site. My Jack & coke was generously mixed & the glass of house red wine was fairly decent.   FYI -  Merlot & Cabernet available by the bottle.  Bathroom is tiny...certainly not the loveliest but clean.   Would like to experience the traditional coffee ceremony one of these days. In general, I appreciate the very reasonable pricing. I would definitely go back again.,  and soon!  Strongly recommend dining here if Nazareth is too full."}
{"text":"I was here for a reunion with some old colleagues, it was a growing group and they accommodated us nicely. The atmosphere is nice and chill with African art pieces on the wall.  Most of us were new to Ethiopian food, our server recommended for me the meat/veggie combo and gave us a brief intro on how to eat with our hands. Everything came quickly and tasted fresh. The injera was delish!"}
{"text":"This was my first time having Ethiopian food so I'm certainly not an expert. HOWEVER, I can say that the food here is delicious, cheap and satisfying. A group of 5 of us had the five person meat platter and it was all our first time trying Ethiopian food. We loved it. The food was flavourful and so incredibly satisfying. The injera was so spongey and light tasting! Scoping the meat/vegetables with the injera was quite the experience too. The wine and beer here is also priced very reasonably. I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Food is just okay.  Very mildly spiced. There are other restaurants for a better Ethiopian food experience. Mediocre atmosphere.  Very poor service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  My partner and I went for platter which comes with 6 sides of veggies and 2 meats served on injera (spongey, sour pancake bread) as well as some injera on the side.  Like Marge Simpson, this was my first shot at Ethiopian food.  Like... the limit of my knowledge of Ethiopian includes some basic knowledge about Haile Selassie... and that's all.  When we were served, the lady asked us if it was first time and if she can show us.  Like the other reviewers noted, she quickly schooled out on how to scoop and prepare each morsel and were feeding us by hand before we knew it.  Service was very friendly - the waitress were entertaining many regulars and checked in on us a couple of times.  It was definitely fun eating with your hands and experimenting with different sides - varying the portions and ingredients made for a different taste with every bite.  Definitely will be back - I would recommend just going for the vegetarian platter which I felt were better and more complex than the meat sides.  Will be back."}
{"text":"We ended up here as Nazareth was packed out the door. I was happy we ended up here as we had a beautiful warm authentic African meal which comprised of: Beef Tibs, Spinach, Injera and Rice. All tasty, delicious for a -10degree night in Toronto. The service was a little slow and we order Samosa's that never arrived but other than that, I was impressed! Thanks African Place!"}
{"text":"We had not been to Ethiopian in a long time, so when a friend suggested African Palace, we were all excited to try it out! The place is convenient to get to, as it's right on Bloor street, with easy access to the subway and many Green P parking spots. The restaurant is casual with an interesting vibe - almost authentic but not quite! The menu is a mix of appetizers, platters and drinks. It also has tons of veggie/vegan options .   We were 4 people and we went for the meat + veggie platter and added a veggie dish on the side as well. The idea with Ethiopia food is to make it a communal experience and to use your hands! The platter was delicious and so was the veggie dish. By the end of it we were all stuffed! We had to follow that with their traditional coffee ceremony, where they roast the coffee beans in front of you, and then once they are ready, they bring out 4 small tea cups and pour it out for the group.   The food was really good, but I would also want to try Lalibela, that's just by this restaurant to compare. The service was good but the washrooms were a bit dingy. Overall a nice experience if you're craving Ethiopian, but not something I would come back to on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"In terms of Ethiopian places, I have eaten at Nazareth (down the street), Nunu, and now African Palace.  And this is how they compared...  Nazareth - dim, more bar-like atmosphere.  Lotsa ppl just came in to have a beer.  Small restaurant is crammed and decorated with fake vines.  Service was alright, but not super friendly, food was GOOD & cheap!  I think it was like $8pp (or even less) when sharing a platter.  Nunu - contemporary décor, bright 'n colourful lighting, I believe the owner is Caucasian.  Interior of restaurant is nice 'n new, saw quite a few couples on a date while I was there!  Server pushed alcoholic drinks.  Service was alright, aside from owner, not super friendly.  Food was good, not as good as Nazareth, but prices are quite expensive.  I remember paying ~$20pp even after sharing a platter.  And now African Palace - like Nazareth, the restaurant itself is quite small, but not as cramped, brighter, not as cluttery.  They don't try to fit as many bums as possible.  I believe African Palace would also get quite a few of Nazareth's overflow customers.    Server was nice and even hand-fed us!  She noticed that we finished our injera and automatically brought us more.  She then showed us that we can grab more than 1  \"stew\" with the bread and then put it in our mouths.  (I thought it was quaint, but some germos may think it weird.)  Food-wise, I don't think it was as good as Nazareth.  However, female server was definitely more personable.  Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony was $10 for a serving of 2-4ppl.  It took approx. 30mins for the coffee to arrive to the table, after we finished our food.  I believe that the beans are freshly roasted.  Coffee was served black with a cinnamony taste.  No milk, but you can add sugar.  Server also brought popcorn and burnt frankincense at the table.  It was an interesting experience.  If budget is a concern and you like to drink, check out Nazareth.  However, if you prefer a quieter, more comfy atmosphere with warmer service, definitely choose African Palace!"}
{"text":"Spinach is good and they offer platters with veg and meat for one person, two or more. (You don't see this everywhere.) Lots of it was very spicy -- a little too spicy for me and I like spice.  Service is pretty inattentive. Drinks are cheap -- all around 5 bucks each -- but they're nothing special, just Labatt's, Steamwhistle, etc. A platter for two plus two beers for him and a rye and coke for me ran to 40 something dollars. This place is decent, but it won't be my go to."}
{"text":"I came here because Nazareth is closed, this place was an excellent alternative. The food is great, and the owner will show you how to eat the injera the proper way. We had 5 people and split a $50 5-person meat and veggie platter, and a lot of injera. It was very good, turns out to be less than $15 per person. It was very good."}
{"text":"Great food and good service at reasonable prices. Go here instead of Nazareth - because you won't have to wait hours to eat dinner. The lighting is also better, and you can feed three people for thirty bucks. Not bad."}
{"text":"Overall a great experience.   After hearing many comparisons between Nazareth & here I figured I had to try it out for myself. Originally planning on going to Nazareth's but finding the lineup looking like it would take at least 45 mins, which we didn't have we decided to try African Palace and because there was no wait. I have to admit the reviews are pretty on point.   The food is just as good but African Palace is a little more expensive (about 1.5x in price depending on what you order) but still relatively cheap for a night out in Toronto. However, the atmosphere is much more original at African Palace unlike Nazareth's interesting mix between religious statues right next to beer merchandise! The service is super quick at both places, which is great especially if you have plans and are running late!  So in the end, would definitely go back but I must admit I'd stop by Nazareth's first to see if the line up is too long (I like things cheap, what's wrong with that?!)"}
{"text":"Although neither of us had ever tried meat dishes in Ethiopian cuisine before, my dinner date and I ordered a meat platter to better suit his dietary preferences when we  went to African Palace for the first time. While we both agreed that the vegetarian stews were absolutely delicious, our shared dislike of lamb (in general) became apparent when we left most of it untouched. This is too bad because I'm sure a lamb connoisseur would have enjoyed it! While my dinner date enjoyed the beef quite a bit, my favourites were hands down the cabbage and lentil stews.  The service from the lady who seemed to be the owner was lovely. The colourful room with the beautiful decor and quiet, uncrowded atmosphere made dining at African Palace perfectly date appropriate."}
{"text":"I host service/work projects for youth in Toronto and I usually like to take them out for an ethiopian dinner so they get to experience something new. After trying the food, meeting Mary the owner, and bringing a few groups there, I can't imagine why I would ever want to go anywhere else. Mary is incredibly sweet and accommodating and went out of her way to ensure our experience was above and beyond our expectations. I will be coming here often in the years to come."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Ethiopian- I eat it in almost every city I travel to.   This review is 3.5 stars - stepping in there's an overwhelming onion and spices aroma.   The service and nice and quick. We ordered the meat & veggie combo for 2 people ($21). Plenty of food. The veggie combo is lentils and beans- didn't have much variety. The beef tibs and lamb was pretty good. Plenty of injera.  Get their Mango juice - it's very good nectar.  Not the best Eritreian / Ethiopian but it was good. I'm curious to try other places in town"}
{"text":"I honestly have nothing bad to say about the food or the service. The food was very tasty, albeit my chicken and beef were a little spicy. I can't recommend this place highly enough if you're into Etheopean food. This and Lalibela Ethiopian Restaurant down the street are my 2 favourite Ethiopian restaurants in Toronto so far. BTW: If your diet prescribes gluten-free stuff, African Palace offers injera flatbread.  Now, stop reading my review and go check out this place already :)"}
{"text":"So this was my first time trying African food, and it was quite the experience. When we walked in the restaurant we were seated by a nice lady. Right off the bat I noticed that there were no utensils at the tables, only a napkin and a wet nap. I found this a little interesting.  The lady serving us knew that we were noobs because she asked if we've had Ethiopian food to which we said never. So she recommended we get some dinner platter for 2 for $23 and some samosas for an appetizer. I have heard from other places that Kitfo is an interesting dish of raw ground beef so I figured I'd enquire about it. The lady offered to put that in with our dish for $5 more (cheaper than the menu). I got Gored Gored instead because it was beef cubes rather than ground beef.  The samosas came out pretty fast and they were very flavourful. They were bordering on too much spice (for me at least), but they were good. The sauce they came with was a jalapeño sauce that gave it some kick.  In between the samosas and dinner was quite a long wait. I had read in other reviews that you don't get African food if you are in a rush. It may be the culture but this was true. During our down time there was a group of 'tards' (I mean some guys who just yapped the whole night away that the restaurant could hear) that bought this coffee ceremony thing for $10. The lady brought out this coffee tray with frankincense, popcorn, and coffee. The frankincense was lit and she poured coffee for everyone. The coffee smell of the beans and the frankincense filled the restaurant with a nice odour. I had never seen this before and was quite intrigued.  The meal for two came out on one plate and it was served with some kind of bread (it reminded me of a chamois). This was like a sampler platter where you rip off some bread and grab the items on the dish. There were a bunch of things like beets, cabbage, spinach, some bean pastes, beef, lamb, and my raw beef cubes. I didn't care much for the bean paste things but I did enjoy these beets, cabbage and spinach. We were kind of glad the lady recommended this because it gave us a taste of a bunch of things.  After dinner I asked the lady if I could get some of that coffee (without the ritual). I had wanted to see what this tasted like. She gave me a coffee (which is like an espresso shot) and brought some frankincense. The best part was that she said it was ON THE HOUSE. I was impressed with that.  I was really impressed with this place because the lady went the extra mile to make sure we got a taste of African food and I appreciated that. She was very nice and charged us less than the menu price for the samosas..  The restaurant is fairly small, can only seat about 30 I think, and the one knock I have on it is that there is no A/C in there and it got a little hot.  Overall the lady gave us a great first experience and I'm glad I went there. I would recommend people check it out, but only if those other tards aren't there."}
{"text":"Randomly bumped into this place. Had never tried Ethiopian food before. The veggie platter is really good. We ordered the platter for 2 and just couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Wohoo ! my second ethiopian food was just as satisfying as the first! since I've only been to one other Ethiopian restaurant I can only compare this experience than the last's.   It's great to bring someone along as a date if you want to be adventurous! There's a gigantic platter of different mixed vegs and meat you dip your sour dough bread. Kind of like eating several different kinds of hummus. I love how you can have some fun by feeding each other.. and the waitress showed us how to eat it by demonstrating how they wrap it and feed it to you first. It's fun and engaging by i just hope her hands are clean."}
{"text":"Try the coffee! If you're into coffee at all you will love how this business tastes--they roast the beans in front of you and the end product is thick, strong, totally delicious brew.  Oh, and the food's good too! We got a standard Ethiopian platter for five to share with various meats and veggies. I love the spongey bread used to mop it all up and the spices were all on point. We were all stuffed by the end and there were some big eaters among us so the portioning was not a problem.   The place gives off a family-owned vibe and the service was friendly. All in all a great option in the west end for African fun!"}
{"text":"My friend and I tried this place last night and loved it. We had the 2 person veggie and meat platter. The injera was perfect and so were the wats. The service was great, they checked up on us every once in a while and they showed us how to properly use the injera to scoop up the wats. My favourite part is that we didn't feel rushed to clear out. I'm so going back there ASAP!"}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian food . We came to Nazareth and ended up here . Service was very very poor. We came here after seeing the positive reviews  . If u want to have a good dining experience please don'y choose this place . We waited waited for someone  for refills and few more injera's but none turned up ! Will never ever come back again to this place .."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service was lovely.  I had no idea what Eritrean food was like, but by the time that I left, I had also been able to watch some... Eritrean television!  My dashing companion thought his lamb was okay, a bit tough to finish eating.  I'm a veg-head, and found the meal to be satisfying... that is, until I bit into chunks of lamb or beef.  :P  The server was so sorry.  Would I go there again?  At some point yes.  There are many Ethiopian restaurants on this Bloor strip to try out, not to mention the ones on College st. and on Irwin near Yonge, and of course Addis Ababa on Queen X Gladstone.  PS - Please try Ethiopian coffee, if you haven't already.  Always a memorable thing to do w/ friends.  Order it first -- as it normally takes 30 min to arrive, and can sometimes come with ceremonious offerings beforehand...  No, not like with lambs - but rather incense and/or popcorn! (depending on where you order the coffee from)."}
{"text":"Outstanding flavours that we've all enjoyed before in good Ethiopian food. The major difference here was that it's not oily at all.   For those who have been to other Ethiopian restaurants, you'll find that at African Palace, the food tastes amazing without all of the oily soggy injera afterwards.   We got the $21 beef tip and 4 assorted vegetables dish and it did an amazing job filling the both of us up.   Must: try the Ethiopian coffee served with insence, and popcorn (which surprisingly works very well with the flavours of the coffee)."}
