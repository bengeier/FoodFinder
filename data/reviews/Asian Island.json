{"text":"It was unbelievable how amazing my oranch chicken and fried rice was to perfection. I mean seriously she Chef speaks no English so you know your getting genuine Asian Cuisine. I come here about once a week and will keep coming. Thanks Asian Island you guys are the best!"}
{"text":"I was really craving Chinese food and it was pouring so I decided to order delivery. I ordered the crab puffs, egg drop soup and pork lo mein. Delivery time said 45-55 min. I ended up not receiving my food until an hour and 15 minutes. Crab puffs were cold but luckily the soup and pork lo mein were piping hot on arrival!"}
{"text":"The most friendly Chinese restaurant I have ever eaten at! They are a very nice family that will customize your meal they way You want it to be. My husband wanted to try them out right after they opened. We were so pleased with the food that we have to go back almost every week since than. Two weeks ago I decided to try their Sushi and was very impressed. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for dinner one night and we were pretty happy! The food arrived sooner than expected and it was hot. We enjoyed the short ribs and spam masubi. The orange chicken was ok - a little bland, I need more spice. This will be our new go-to place for quick, yummy Asian takeout."}
{"text":"You HAVE TO try the Hawaiian Barbecue Chicken!! My husband, 16 month old daughter and I go 1-2 times/week for lunch and get it every time. We love the simple, well cooked chicken and our little one loves the sticky rice and the friendly attention she always gets from the staff. With so many lunch choices in the Scottsdale Airpark, it's rare we become regulars anywhere. With their consistent quality, fast service and super friendly staff, Asian Island has gained a lifetime customer."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for sushi delivery. I'm allergic to shrimp and they always give me the shrimp spring roll with my choice of tuna or salmon and don't charge me extra. Very accommodating!! The staff couldn't be friendlier! I love that they gave us a Chinese calendar for the new year. I have never been in the restaurant, but I've been ordering from here for over two years and love it! So cool that they have Hawaiian options as well. It's like three restaurants in one: Chinese, Japanese and Hawaiian. Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great chinese food! I have only ordered online for delivery, but everything I have had is good by quick chinese food standards. The prices are very decent, and the delivery is on time. I am a big fan of the lo mein."}
{"text":"This is really good if you like cheap Chinese take away.  It isn't gourmet, and the dine-in experience isn't the greatest, but it is good value and if you need to pick something up after work then this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Making this review two days out and still feel the need to warn people about this place.  My first issue is that Yelp gave a 45-60 min wait time.  We ended up waiting for 2 hours for our food and needed to make a phone call because they had now closed.
   Once we recieved our food we were happy to eat.  The food i can honestly say was very bland.  My orange chicken tasted nothing like orange chicken.  My wife had the mongolian beef and we asked for it to be very spicey.  Aside from the bland taste it wasn't even spicey and my 4yo could have easily ate it.
     Could this have been a complete fluke? Possibly but be warned of the possible bland food."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from here for over a year now and Never been disappointed , great quality food , excellent customer service and they have everything from sushi to authentic Chinese and BBQ."}
{"text":"Really a surprise! Did not expect any good Chinese food here. It exceeds many Chinese restaurants back in New York City."}
{"text":"I had take out from here yesterday.  The chicken was strange - I had sesame chicken, and it was surprisingly salty and had the flavor of Worcestershire sauce in it.  It wasn't sweet.  It simply tasted odd.

I gave up after about a quarter of the meal.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good place.  It's kind of tucked away in a strip mall area, but the food and service are great.  We've gotten take out and delivery (they'll deliver within 3-4 miles of their location near Frank Lloyd Wright and the 101) with several different dishes and each dish was good to great.  The prices are very reasonable.

I've been searching for a really good \"dive\" Chinese restaurant in Scottsdale since I moved here 4 years ago and I've finally found it."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good Asian style restaurant that fit our needs since we have moved to AZ. We heard about Asian Island through a friend and we decided to try it. The not only had all our favorites, but the prices were reasonable and all the food was very fresh. Everyone was very friendly and the overall atmosphere was very comfortable. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Asian food. I will definitely eat at Asian Island again."}
{"text":"Asian Island rocks. No MSG, big portions, and good quality meat and fresh vegetables. Very fair prices for Scottsdale. It is hard to find their location but it is by the Scottsdale Gun Club. 
Family business and very friendly. They cook to order so I like to call ahead about 10 minutes before and they have it ready!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say I loved this place but my experience was definitely positive.  My curry shrimp over rice meal was good and it would be quite difficult to beat the $4.99 Saturday lunch special price.  You could tell the family who owns the place was working very hard and that garnered my respect.  It was cool to see even their young daughter eagerly helping out and truly enjoying greeting guests and bringing out food.  The free chips with sweet and sour sauce while you wait were a nice small touch too.  My meal had more of a chicken broth flavor than a curry flavor which was unfortunate but there was a good amount of shrimp in the dish and I liked that the veggies were not way overcooked like many other Asian restaurants.  Overall, pretty good food, can't beat the price, and a family business worth supporting."}
{"text":"This food here is pretty good. I give it 4 stars because I have had better Chinese food in other cities, but for Phoenix (which lacks quality Chinese food in general) it is actually quite good. The fried rice is OK, could be better (more fried)....it tends to be a bit more on the steamed side. The Mongolian beef is good but it's not seared/crispy the way I like it. The flavor is still very good though. The Lo Mein is quite good as well. The fried spring rolls that come with the lunch specials leave a little bit to be desired. Overall I do enjoy the food here very much. For Phoenix, it is quite good. Prices are reasonable as well. I recommend it."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. The spicy Tuna hand rolls are bomb. They deliver, and it's always correct and super fast. So nice to get quality sushi delivered. Love it."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and I love the food. My favorite dish is kung pow chicken and I also get the spicy tuna roll I would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"This place is awesome on all accounts. I went there today with my wife for lunch and we were both very pleased. They have a good sized menu with a lot different styles of food. I had the General Tso's Chicken, and my wife, the Curry Chicken. Both were great, and reasonably priced. It was less then $20 for the both of us. The service was also excellent. Not only are the staff very friendly, but we had our food in less than ten minutes. I will be going there again, maybe tomorrow."}
{"text":"Great find! This place is fast, very reasonably priced, and tasty. I love Hawaiian fare and this place has the classics:) I had the fried shrimp with, of course, white rice and macaroni salad. The shrimp breading had a nice crunchy texture and the macaroni salad was fresh and had the right amount of mayonnaise. My husband tried the vegetable roll. I love sushi and am always on the look out for good sushi. I thought the roll was great - especially for the price. The ingredients were all thinly and neatly chopped and looked fresh. The rice to vinegar ratio was good, not too tangy. We also tried tofu vegetable dish. My husband spent 3 yrs in China and he said that dish is exactly the style of stir fry he loves. Again, fresh veggies, and the tofu is a fried tofu. Sauce was a light gravy not too strong and good amount of saltiness. I can see why this place has 4 stars. High quality food for a really great price!"}
{"text":"I ordered there. It took 10 minutes longer then expected. The food was mediocre at best. Yelpers, I am severely disappointed in this so called '4 star' place. Delivery does not make a place good if the food is ick."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there w/a big group (4 adults & 6 kids).  Our bill came out to $84 for 2 plates of sushi & 6 large size entrees (orange chicken, veggie lo mein, house lo mein, veggie & garlic chix, mongolian beef, hawaiian fried rice). What a great deal & everything was great!  Even had some left overs!  Located near the Scdl Gun Club.  Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Asian Island is one of my favorite places for chinese food in the valley. Although I've never actually eaten in the restaurant the take-out is always great. It is one of the few places I've not only found Happy Family on the menu but it also tastes spot on. The Kung Poa chicken and fried dumplings are really yummy too. I normally grab a bag of wonton chips with each order as well. When I order take out its always quick, easy and ready when I get there.  The family that runs the restaurant are always very nice and friendly as well. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow ! We will be back for Take Out ! We wanted to try a new Chinese Restaurant in Scottsdale for Take-out today. What a pleasant surprise )  The service was great. Delivery was a fast 25 minutes. The food was really good and hot ! The order was perfect. The portions were large and generous. All around Value was terrific ! Next time we will try the Sushi - the reviews look really good. Ohhhh - we like 'old school' chow mein ... and could have been further delighted with hard crunchy noodles. 

We eat frequently at Jade Palace, NaRai Thia and Big Eye Sushi.

Jade Palace has great Egg Foo, NaRai has really hot hot red chili paste for their awesome lunch specials - large large portions - and Big Eye service is excellent and has a -huge- spicy Shrimp dish that is presented like a volcano - heavenly creation."}
{"text":"Not very clean. Weird smell. The staff/owners lazing about at table at 4pm with kids running amok. I asked for BBQ beef combo. After the woman at the register shouted something on very loud Chinese at a man (I guess her husband) she said ,\"No. \" Just simply no.. Not I'm sorry or we're out of it, or anything else, just \"no\". I turned around and left. I say no too........ AVOID!\""}
{"text":"I can't believe it's been so long since my first review of AI!   Here we are in 2015 and this remains my favorite spot for Chinese food.  I've tried a bunch of other places in between and no one even comes close.  Kung Pao Tofu is still awesome as is the Mapo Tofu, Veggie Lo Mein is so good, and my husband's latest favorite is the Shrimp Chop Suey. There has been no drop off in quality or quantity (the amount of food they give you is crazy) and they always accommodate special requests.  The prices are beyond reasonable.

I bumped them up from my original 4 stars to 5 because now that I've tried the rest, I appreciate this place so much more."}
{"text":"Love this place great food.

Nice people. 

So fare everything has been very good."}
{"text":"I ordered from this place after being mistreated by some rude young ladies at Jade Palace.  When I placed my order the staff were friendly and helpful. The delivery came in almost exactly 30 minutes which I appreciated since we were hungry! 

First the spring rolls - they were awesome! I wish that I would've ordered more, and for only $2.50 - you definitely should! 

Next I ordered the Kung Pao Tofu - the tofu was not as firm as I would've liked it and I would've preferred some other veggies, but overall a solid dish. My husband got the curry shrimp and said it was quite tasty as well. We also ordered some veggie fried rice - perfectly cooked with big bold veggies (delish)! 

The portions were very generous, we will have plenty of leftovers, and all to your door for $33! I love it - and we will definitely be back. (Side note- comparable meals at Jade Palace was $56, woah!)"}
{"text":"I called an hour ahead for take out and my order was ready when I picked it up. The Kung Pao Chicken was delicious with a little kick to it. My kid loved the Mongolian Beef which was a generous serving. It came with a side of rice, and all for $20.00. It easily fed 4 people. I have been coming here regularly and have never been disappointed. The husband and wife who own the place are always smiling and happy to see customers."}
{"text":"I don't think this place knows what Asian food is.  We had 6 items and all were terrible.  You could microwave frozen boxed food that had more flavor and texture."}
{"text":"I ate at Asian Island this weekend. It was what you would expect for fast Chinese food. We got the king pow beef and Szechuan chicken with fried rice and low neon as the sides. The food didn't save well as leftovers. The meat was ok and the fried rice wasn't the best I've had. I'll definitely eat here again if I need some fast Chinese food."}
{"text":"I wasn't wild about this place but it was perfectly okay. It's kinda a generic Asian restaurant that does not specialize in any one thing in particular. More Asian than island."}
{"text":"Delivery service was good but the food wasn't great. The fried orange chicken was soggy on the outside and the quality of the chicken seemed questionable- rubbery and possibly past it's prime. Kind of freaked me out so I lost my appetite and could not finish and felt I wasted my money. I've ordered take out about four times over the last year from this restaurant and I'd say the food was good less than half my experiences. Too bad!"}
{"text":"Really hard for me to rate this place.  I was a bit apprehensions going in for sushi as it's kind of a small hole in the wall place that has serves everything plus some sushi. My experience has taught me to avoid such places.

Nonetheless i gave it a go and ordered about $70 worth of susi.  The place was absolutely empty and it took about 35 mins to make the 7 rolls I ordered.  The place was clean and simple.  It's more someplace I'd run in to get a quick rice bowl versus having dinner.

The folks that were working there were very kind and brought us won-ton's and sauce while we waited and offered us a soda.  Nice touch.

The sushi was ok.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't necessarily very tasty either.  It just was.

Had it not been for the nice service I'd probably give 2 stars but as the saying goes - kill em with kindness."}
{"text":"We ordered $100 of food here through grub hub, delivery.  We found 2 coarse black hairs in the sweet and sour chicken, cooked into it. Now we have a ton of leftover food we are afraid to eat.  The staff is friendly but I just can't do hair in my food...."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice in two weeks. First time we hade take out and it was great. Keep in mind that nothing beats fresh out of the kitchen, but it was great take out. Liked it so much we went back to eat at the restaurant and loved the food even mire as it was served hot out of the kitchen and delicious. The quality was top notch, white meat chicken only, high quality beef, and super fresh veggies cooked perfectly. We have tried the Mongolian Beef, Szechuan Beef, Orange Chicken, Dumplings, etc... and all were top notch. This food blows away any established Asian place we have tried like Jade Palace. The only thing this place lacks is atmosphere as it is mire of a fast food type of atmosphere but the food is first rate tasty and fresh. A small family establishment just getting started and doing it all right. Lets make sure these guys stay in business as Scottsdale needs this quality of Chinese food at the affordable prices they offer. Loved it! Going back for more."}
{"text":"Yelpers you were right again!  Had the combination dinner of mongolian beef, fried rice, spring roll & wontons.  Everything was delicious and although the fried rice was meatless it was flavorful--some of the best fried rice I've had in the valley.  Hubby had the egg drop soup which I thought was absolutely delicious but he thought it was a little salty (but what does he know?!) .  He did like the flavor, but you know, always a complaint.  He had the orange chicken with brown rice which he liked especially because the crust was not heavy and they spiced it up the way he likes it.  Prices are very reasonable.  Service was attentive since it was a rainy day and we were the only ones there.  Their delivery business seemed brisk (although not to my area.)   I'll have to drive there to pick up my orders but I tell you, it will be very much worth it.  I definitely will be back.  
Thanks to Yelpers who give credit where credit is due."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Asian Island going on 3 years.  Their food remains high quality and their prices remain more than reasonable.  If you are a sushi fan and cannot make up your mind, go with the Sushi combination plate!"}
{"text":"I called at 845pm for a take out order and they happily took the order.  I got a little mixed up on their address, so I didn't pull up until 9:01, but they were as gracious as could be.   The portions were very large.  My cashew chicken was some of the beat I've ever had and they didn't hold back on the cashews!  My husband was pleased with his orange chicken too.  This is definitely a neighborhood gem.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We found Asian Island pleasantly busy at lunch, with good food and pleasant service. The menu is extensive. 

There's nothing fancy about it, but it's very good. My wife had a veggie dish over brown rice. I had delicious fried tofu and vegetables over brown rice. This was the first time I have ever really enjoyed tofu, so hats off to Asian Island! 

We plan to go back for sushi, and other things that sound good."}
{"text":"I don't think I'll go back.

First prob, the bathroom.  Yuck.  It wasn't clean.  There was trash on the floor, the hot water didn't work, and there was minimal water coming from the cold side.  Makes one wonder how clean the kitchen is...

Second prob, the food wasn't awesome.  Being from the islands, I was expecting more than what I got.  Granted there are people out there who think I'm Mexican, which is no biggy, but when they serve food that's sub-par because they assume I don't know my food, well, that's when I get a bit offended.

Went there with my mom.  She had the mini loco moco - family fave.  Yet, the eggs came out way too runny, like not even close to being cooked.  I ordered the seafood mix with the short ribs.  Both plates came with bland mac salad and old rice.  Believe me, I know the dif between fresh cooked rice and day old rice.  For pupus we ordered the chicken musubi.  The chicken was good, but the rice brought the whole dish down to blah.  I'm taking a leap here, but I'm guessing the fish and shrimp were frozen.

What I did like was the short ribs.  Too bad the butter knife couldn't cut through for smaller bites.  I'm all for using my hands when eating, but come on.  You usually cut the meat off then finish the bones.  As for the eggs, the lady was a little angry but took the plate back and came back with much better looking eggs.  Cool thing - the cook came back to make sure the eggs were okay.  They were.

Good luck when eating here.  I usually give a restaurant a couple chances in case there was an off day, but I'm not sure I'll be doing that here.  The kids were cute and were helping out, but that doesn't cut it when the food is sub-par and the bathroom is dirty."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  Not impressed. Food had some heat but not flavorful. General Tso with fried rice and normally a choice of spring roll or crab puff BUT already at noon, out of spring rolls. Also watched two people after me get food and I had to remind them of my order."}
{"text":"The good : Good portions, great variety, not overpriced.

The bad : Understaffed for lunches, yelling cook staff, old disgusting sriracha bottles must be replaced now!"}
{"text":"We ordered from here last night.  The food was delivered hot and it was very tasty.  I'm very picky about my Chinese food and this place rocks!!
I had the Mongolian Beef.  Hubby had the BBQ Plate.   The portions were huge.   
We ordered from Yelp.  And delivery was inexpensive and very quick.  They said 45-55 minutes.  We got our order within 25 minutes.
We will be ordering again soon."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place for lunch. The food is good and the portions are generous. I would stick with the traditional Chinese menu items and stay away from the Thai selections. I've had much better Thai elsewhere."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews, but the food here was disgusting!  I got the loco moco, which is pretty hard to mess up since its just a hamburger patty, an egg, topped with gravy.  The hamburger patty here smelled and tasted super gross...like either it was expired, or some kind of mystery meat.  I'm not sure how this place has managed to survive all these years since it was completely empty at 6PM on a weeknight and their phone did not ring once in a 25 min span of time.  

Advice to owners: Do not have so many menu items.  They have Chinese food, Hawaiian food, Japanese food, sushi, smoothies...way too much to choose from. The entire menu is disorganized and on 3 different walls of the restaurant, cause it's too long to fit on one..

Also, the inside was super dirty.  Definitely won't go back."}
{"text":"My favorite Asian food place in town. Mango shrimp roll is beautiful and tastes amazing. Vegetable Kung Pao had 6 veggies and peanuts and was great!  Friendly staff. Great for to go orders.  Large portions. Huge menu including sushi. 
Love it!"}
{"text":"Fast! Fresh!! Perfect! And that was just the food. The service was excellent as well. I'm very picky about my fast food Chinese and don't normally comment, but this was worth it. The girl friend said the Hawaiian was really good too."}
{"text":"I haven't tried their sushi or Hawaiian selections yet, but this is a great place for your stereotypical Chinese food.  I live close by so I can utilize their delivery service, and they are always speedy.  I'm to the point of obsession with their shrimp snow pea!"}
{"text":"This place gives great service, the food was good and the price was decent. New to Phoenix area and already went here twice. The fried rice is really good and the spring rolls are amazing! Between me and my girlfriend trying different dishes, we have yet to have a bad dish. All of the ones we have tried have been prepared well, not greasy like some places, and more important...very delicious!! And they give you a lot of food for the price too!"}
{"text":"This was one of those places that we tried mainly because of the high Yelp ratings. In this case, I hate to say, Yelp was wrong! We drove in for take out. We decided to order at the store and wait for our food, rather than call ahead. The goal was hotter food by the time we got home. The food came out quickly and was still quite warm once we got home.
I did not enjoy my meal. Boyfriend and I each ordered the dinner special. Choice of entree, rice, spring roll and crab wanton. Boyfriend ate his orange chicken, but said he has most definitely had better. My general tso chicken was very sub par, mostly celery and onion chunks. Not much flavor, although pretty good chicken pieces (size wise and not dry). It wasn't bad or inedible. I just felt like it lacked spice and tang. The spring roll was good, crispy and not soggy or greasy. Crab wanton was good, but tasted pre-made/ fried from a frozen bulk bag.
My most disappointing item was my hot and sour soup. I am a h&s soup fiend! This hot and sour was the worst one I have ever tasted, by far. I was very happy to see tofu, mushroom, seaweed, and other chunks of goodness in there, more often then not you get a lone chunk of tofu in your serving at other places, so I was excited to taste it. Boy what a let down! The flavor was non-existant! No hot, no sour. Just like what I would imagine dirty mop water to taste like. I tried about three bites, stirring in between in hopes of magically mixing up some flavor, but nope. I didn't eat it beyond my taste. I hate to throw out food, but it was that bad.
Maybe the empty store was a give away, It was around 7:30 on a weeknight, should have been SOME one getting dinner... But the only occupants were the employees, working at tables doing various tasks.
I will give them one more chance, in a few weeks. I would like to try the Hawaiian side of the menu. But if it fails to impress, then I won't be back. Boyfriend agreed, there is no need to return and spend our hard earned money on sub-par food just because its hot and in our price range. I really don't see why so many high ratings."}
{"text":"After trying to order takeout twice over the phone I simply give up! The woman who took my order speaks very poor English and she messed up our order both times.  When I asked her to speak to the owner, she gave me the cook who knows nothing about customer service. When I asked him politely to have the owner call me, he responded, \"The owners no speak English.\" The food is very reasonably priced but can be hit or miss on quality. I don't think we'll be ordering takeout again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm having a night where I just want delivery instead of going out, this is my immediate go to.  They have a really big menu and for the price you get a LOT of food.   The drivers are always very friendly also.  Good Chinese delivery for a great price."}
{"text":"We love this place. The Sushi is very good. The staff is very friendly. We try to go every week. Like the Hawaii Fried Rice, lots of shrimp. Lots of pictures of the food so you can see what you're getting. A real neighborhood feel. My wife wanted the Berry Roll and they were out of berries. They offered to go get some. Next time we came she remembered and told us she had berries today. It was very good."}
{"text":"i seriously love this place. Their always so friendly and the food portions are huge. More than enough to split is you want. Its so cheap and so good and they deliver! What more could you as for!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm recommending a place that serves Chinese, Hawaiian and Sushi.  And I'm still having a hard time to believe I summoned the courage to try the place.  I would usually turn tail and run, but I trusted my fellow Yelpers and gave it a shot.

They were spot on!

There were six in our group (2 adults, 4 kids) and everyone's dish was legit - and a great portion for the price.  

I'm still thinking about the Mongolian Chicken I ordered.  Wow!

Asian Island, I'm so glad I don't need a boat to get to you cuz I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a reasonably acceptable take-out Chinese & Sushi place. The Sushi was fine. Nothing to write home about. Sufficiently fresh fish, but was not made with proper Sushi rice. Although the proprietors/operators appeared to be Asian, the Chinese food was quite Americanized. But, generous portions of food, including meat and shrimp in my dish. No surprises or disappointments here. Just a regular strip-mall Chinese & Sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly good.  I say surprisingly because it does not look like much. But the ffod and tge value is great."}
{"text":"We (Family of 4 with a 10 year old and 15 year old) grabbed some take out from here for a later dinner after a LONG day of travel. 
We ordered spring rolls, steamed dumplings, Katsu Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Orange Chicken. All were very good. (which is a big compliment from us as we are Asian-food-snobs!) 
I realized that I was most impressed with the Katsu chicken, mostly because it was a very simple and delicious panko fried chicken dish that lent itself to SO MUCH DIVERSITY that you could please almost anyone with that one dish!
Ten year old being picky? just let him eat it as 'chicken fingers'
Fifteen year old being....teen? Just let him eat it with some hot mustard dipping sauce.
Hubby and I had it with a bit of the dumpling sauce...YUMMY!
I would not say that anything we had was 'earth-shattering'...but it did strike me as being dependably and consistently very good food!"}
{"text":"Food was great! It came out very quickly, and it was hot and fresh. It was typical Chinese Food. Nothing really special, but we still loved what we ate. I had Kung Pao chicken/shrimp. The others at my table ate Mongolian Beef and the Happy Family. All the meals includes fried rice, crab puffs, and a spring roll."}
{"text":"This place is one of my new favorites for lunch here in the airpark...and I've tried just about everything. This is a small family run Asian fusion type joint. It's the kind of place where you shouldn't be surprised if you see their young daughters hanging out and chatting up the customers (they're super cute the one time I saw them). 

I'm giving them 5 stars because they can whip you up a quality lunch for under $5. There's a whole list of options over rice for $4.95 posted outside. On the inside they have even more lunch specials ranging from $5.50-$6.95 and these things come with fried rice and choice of spring rolls or crab puffs. It's really a heck of a deal for an quick and satisfying lunch."}
{"text":"Those who desire home delivery beware.  After 1.5 hours and several phone calls regarding status, we finally gave up and called to cancel the delivery.  We were told it would have taken yet another 20 minutes.  We have eaten here numerous times and this is too bad - the food is decent, but the home delivery is not at all reliable.  If seeking delivery, move on to a different restaurant."}
{"text":"A colleague took me to lunch here, and it is a solid 3-Star place offering both Chinese and Hawaiian food. Since you don't see Hawaiian food very often, I chose to go with that.  

For lunch, I got a combo plate of fried mahi-mahi, Hawaiian barbecue chicken, white rice, and cabbage.  The star of the dish was the fried mahi mahi.  It was thick cut, juicy, and fried to perfection.  They could do a better job on the sides... Maybe offer a more colorful vegetable side to add variety to the dish?

Completely lacks ambience. No need to eat in.  And counter staff is a little bit gruff.

Tried a side of their kimchi, but it was way too fermented. My friend remarked that may be because it does not get ordered that often and thus sits for long periods of time. 

Overall, give it a try. Just get your meal to go and avoid the kimchi!"}
{"text":"Nice to be able to get some Hawaiian BBQ stateside!

I like to the get #5, the Meat Combo Mix.
This comes with generous portions of Hawaiian BBQ Chicken, BBQ Beef, and BBQ short ribs, along with rice and macaroni salad.

The meat is tasty and well cooked, and the macaroni salad is ono!  (The mac salad tends to be really bland at a lot of the stateside Hawaiian BBQ joints - so that's a big plus for Asian Island).

Stop by for lunch or dinner and get your Aloha BBQ on!"}
{"text":"Got a burger with spring rolls for lunch on Monday, spent all Monday evening being sick and am still recovering from food poisoning. I am NOT a happy camper."}
{"text":"When I think back to my past lunches at Asian Island the first word that comes to mind is \"value\". 

The second word would be \"kuàisù\" which is Chinese for \"this was a good meal that didn't take long and they have a soda fountain with free refills and each table has a bottle of sriracha which is also pretty cool\""}
{"text":"I've had meals here, and food taste great. Prices are god, and if you go for lunch you should get the combo.  Try their Garlic Shrimp and Teriyaki Chicken as well as the Hot & Sour Soup. Sushi is good too and at very reasonable price, my daughter loves their mango smoothies."}
{"text":"Good old fashioned salty Chinese food!  I wish I lived closer.  The portions are huge!"}
{"text":"* good hot & sour 
* good combo meals 
* fast delivery (faster than the estimated time by 30 min) 
* fresh ingredients
* nice delivery guy 

My new go-to Chinese!"}
{"text":"If I could give 6 stars, I would. Delicious sushi! Their egg rolls are bomb diggity too!"}
{"text":"I've ordered so many things from this place since I started working in the area about a year ago. I love that they have so many options to choose from since they're one of very few places that deliver (other than pizza) and the only one that's consistently on time with my food. I only have 30 minutes for lunch, so getting my order in a timely manner is pretty important. I wouldn't say that the food in phenomenal, but it's pretty decent and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Have had the lemon chicken twice now (both delivery), and it is great! Ordered thru grubhub and the food got here 30 earlier than the estimated time, which I appreciated!"}
{"text":"Great food. We love the orange chicken and everything else on the menu. The delivery is fast and the people are nice."}
{"text":"Found this little place and happy we did, it's awesome! Love little hole in the wall restaurants.

Asian Island has a big selection of Hawaiian dishes AND Asian food. I lived in Kona for a bit so I knew I wanted something off their Hawaiian menu. I ordered the Kalua  pork which came with white rice and macaroni salad (if you've never been to Hawaii, you always get a side of macaroni salad with your dishes, Island favorite.)

Clean establishment, super fast service and really yummy food at a decent price.

Perfect for families as there is selection fits all age groups. Noodles for the kids, Mahi burgers for the adults. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I ordered Asian Island through grubhub for the first time tonight and will definitely order again. The delivery fee was only $1 which is very convenient. The estimated time on the delivery was about an hour but the food actually came very quickly and only took about 25 minutes. The spicy tuna sushi roll was amazing and very fresh! I also ordered the orange chicken dish because it was suggested as a favorite item and it was very good as well. I thought I received everything I ordered then all of a sudden the very nice delivery man knocked on my door with a second order of the Orange chicken dish because they gave me the half order when I ordered the full. I had no idea it was the half order because it was so big but that was so nice of them to bring me a second dish. You can tell they truly care about their customers. I highly recommend the sushi!"}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant to go if you work near the area and you are in the mood for some cheap chinese food. The plates are cheap and the quality is what you pay for. As long as you don't go expecting amazing chinese food for 6-10 bucks, you'll enjoy the place. The people working here have always been friendly when I've gone."}
{"text":"It's not often I venture away from my desk for lunch during the week without having to bring it back and eat all alone. So I was quite excited to actually get a lunch break...
Since other Yelpers keep checking in here, I thought I'd give it a shot. 

The place is nothing spectacular to look, but the service was great and the food was good. 

What I was in the mood for, wasn't on the menu so in a hurry I just spit out \"General Tso's Chicken Please\". After we ordered and paid I walked away wondering how they will get the food to me since I didn't give them a name and they didn't give me an order number. Oh well, they'll find us....I hope. 

We took a seat outside and waited about 5 minutes before some lady brought our food right to us with wonton chips for FREE. 

For $12 (no drinks) for two, I was happy.

I'm not in a hurry to get back here but they met all my expectations and I'll add it to my list of places to eat when I'm craving Asian food in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent!! Good quality chinese. Large delivery area. I will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed with this place at all!   

From the minute you walk in it's dirty and depressing.    I should have followed my gut and left right then, but I didn't.    I was starving and thought I'd just order.   

The California roll was yucky.    It comes with a chunk of fake crab meat.   Not the shredded up kind.      And a little avocado.     Tasted blah!   

The orange chicken was just gross.   I couldn't even get more than a couple bites down.    Meat was full of gristle.     Yuck!    

I will have to find another place to eat next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great food and adorable prices. Highly recommend if you're looking not to spend too much on Chinese"}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp! yesterday and ordered some delivery while I was working at-home. This place wasn't amazing but it's pretty good for American Chinese food and I will def. be ordering again. 

The menu is really varied which is awesome and they include all of your standard, traditional favorites. 

The delivery was fast (about 20 minutes). 

The only downside was the lady who answered the phone could barely speak English and had a really hard time understanding me on my phone number, address, and credit card info. But...it was totally worth it. 

I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, spring rolls, and steamed rice. All yummy. They even put the sweet and sour sauce in a seperate container which I love because it gives you control over how much sauce you want (hey, sometimes I just want the chicken without the sauce) and is great for leftovers. 

There is no other good Chinese food delivery in the area. 

A great find. Try it! You probably won't be disappointed or greatly impressed."}
{"text":"Business meeting in Scottsdale, this was the closest Sushi Bar that delivered.  Delivery was 45 min the sushi was Excellent - costly but good. My lunch with everything  was $40 this included Dragon Roll, Spicy Tuna & Cucumber Roll."}
{"text":"I eat there four or five times each week.  I love the Chinese food the best, but my wife like the sushi as well.  Today I had the Hawaiian BBQ pork.  The flavor was delicious.  The restaurant is family owned with fast tasty home style food and friendly service.  The portions are large with fair prices.  I have tried most everything on the menu and I enjoyed every meal.  You can't go wrong eating there.  I highly recommend Asian Island."}
{"text":"First time I came here, it was pretty empty. Not that it's a bad thing, the food actually came out better. Then today, I came again. Except it was busier. The food- (BBQ Beef) came out oily and kind of gross. They also mixed up my father's order and gave it to someone else. If you come when the restraint is empty, you get better food and service."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Friendly delivery kid. Went for the Hawaiian menu and was disappointed. The ribs were tasteless and tough. The macaroni salad made me sick because I think they spoiled a bit en route due to the heat. The spam musubi was extra salty and dry...hard to fuck up spam musubi?! The nori was also stale AF. The chicken Katsu was atrocious. Tasted like straight up grease kept in a pot for a decade. Lo mein was a plate of lo mein bits and no noodle was longer than 3 inches for some odd reason and totally against the tradition of long noodles for health and prosperity so that immediately pissed me off. To boot, it was tasteless and bland. SO disappointing and the only reason it gets a second star is because the prices are really fair and the delivery kid was nice. Won't be ordering again and definitely don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"My family and I ordered take out from here last week. We love how big their selection was! My family and I got their fried veggie roll appetizers and their dumplings. My family was a fan of both of these dishes. We did it family style so we ordered several main dishes and everyone took a little of what they wanted. The lemon chicken, orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken were a little hard to tell apart from one another. We wish that the sauces for the lemon and sweet and sour came actually on the chicken instead of the side - like how the orange chicken did. 

The dishes that people loved were the veggie fried rice (we were pleased at the fact that it didn't seem super greasy). People also loved the sauce for the garlic shrimp, it tasted amazing. Lemon and sweet and sour chicken were both well liked. 

We weren't impressed with the Mongolian beef at all and decided that we also wouldn't get the orange chicken again. Instead we'd love to try one of their Hawaiian dishes or sushi next time."}
{"text":"It's been a couple of years since I last reviewed this place. Thankfully, Asian Island is still standing tall and cooking up delicious and fresh food at a great value. The chefs are very talented as they wok and roll cooking up their culinary masterpieces.

They have free delivery which I have used on occasion, especially when the Blackhawks were making their most recent Stanley Cup run. No way was I tearing myself away from the game. But I usually drop by to eat at the restaurant. The families that run this place are really friendly and care if you have a satisfying meal. If you want more bell peppers and less onions, no problem. So don't be afraid to speak up for substitutions or if you're not digging your entree. And of course, they are appreciative of positive feedback as well. As a side note, one Yelper mentioned that there was a lack of protein in his Mongolian Beef, I find that hard to believe.

 I actually ask for less meat for my signature dish of  Mongolian Beef and get a bunch of broccoli added.  All dishes are served with ample amount of food. Some other favorites include the Orange Chicken, Egg Drop Soup, Chicken Lo Mein, Shrimp Lo Mein and Happy Family. I'm not a Sushi eater so I can't attest to that part of the menu. But I have seen a lot of Sushi orders in the dining room. These guys don't have the name recognition of a couple of other Asian restaurants in the general area, but they are truly the tastiest option. Believe me, I have tried them all."}
{"text":"Ordered Mongolian beef, good flavor but was overloaded with onions and not enough protein. 
Prices are fair, it's decent but nothing special."}
{"text":"Super good!! The price is more than fair, most of the stuff are Yummy, and my favorite dishes are: Beef with Black Pepper, Singapore rice noodle, Dry Fried rice noodle, Beef Chao Fun, and Hawaii BBQ Beer or/and Short Ribs, dumpling is awesome too, wow, do not miss the hot and sour soup, my Buddha, house Fried rice is amazing too....so many...can't type them all here. And the people work in this restaurant is super kind and nice, it is absolutely worthy to stop by and check it out! It is right by the Scottsdale Gun Club, easy to find. :-)"}
{"text":"Great plate lunch!

Stopped by for the first time tonight and had the BBQ beef plate lunch. It was right on target - sticky white rice, mac salad, sweet thinly sliced beef. It was a very filling meal and tasted great. Nice prices in the place too. I will certainly be heading back."}
{"text":"I didnt eat in, but i ordered take out. I think its pretty cool that they offer free delivery for $15 and above pirchases. I highly recommended it for multiple people who wants to order, unless you have a huge appetite like me. 

I believe the two people who answered the calls were the owners of the place. They did take an hour for my food to come, but it was my fault for putting in the wrong address. To be honest, they are very nice people. Cuz even if it was my fault putting the wrong address, it seemed they took the fault. And they gave me extra spam and bbq beef musubi from my order! How generous!? So as GREAT customer satisfaction, i gave them 4 stars cuz of that. 

There food is average taste wise, ive had better island food. Would i order again?! Definitely! Prices are right, customer satisfaction, and i was happy with my order, and extra order they provided. Lol."}
{"text":"My husband and I were on our way to Sam's Club and decided to check it out. We sure are glad we did. Friendly family service. Fresh and tasty food. At prices that will make your wallet smile. We will be back and soon!"}
{"text":"Generous portions. Decent food. A good bang for the buck. Casual inside, quite a lot to choose from on the menu. Kahlua pork was delicious; melts in your mouth. Family owned. Their service was genuinely kind and helpful when ordering. Recommended!"}
{"text":"The food here is plentiful and so good. They cook everything fresh right when you order it. I have eaten here more times than I can count. The friend rice and egg drop soup are terrific. Super friendly as well. A+++"}
{"text":"Got Hawaiian BBQ for lunch - the chicken katsu & kalua pork combo. First, it took about 5 minutes of me standing at the register before they took my order. They acknowledged I was there, but the person taking orders was busy putting to-go meals together. They were definitely in the weeds for lunch and it sounds like they are often busy based on other reviews. I waited about 20 mins for my food. I was pleasantly surprised when they brought me wontons and sweet & sour sauce after 10 mins since i was waiting awhile.

The food was unimpressive. The katsu was dry. The pork was terrible - no flavor whatsoever. The mac salad was delish, but everything else went in the trash."}
{"text":"Great Chinese place, big portions, the taste and the quality is really good."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is amazing! The food is super fresh out of the kitchen so I highly recommend eating in the restaurant rather than getting take out. They've got some awesome hot mustard sauce too."}
{"text":"The spring rolls, mixed vegetables 
Fried rice,egg drop soup, panfried dumplins were great.we would come again. Service was good"}
{"text":"Searching Yelp for a locally owned place to eat lunch in this area and the Asian Island popped up.  Hawaiian and Chinese cuisine with sushi, prepared and served restaurant style but in a place that looks somewhat like a new dinner/fast food-ish.  

I had their Kung Pao Two ~ with chicken and shrimp.  The portion was large and it was delish!  The fried rice was a little dry, but still tasty.  My friend had the Hawaiian Seafood Mix with fried shrimp and BBQ short ribs with a side of rice.  He really enjoyed his meal.  The Hawaiian BBQ short ribs were his fave ~ he gnawed on the bones!  

The service is very friendly and eager to please.  If you're in the area looking for a great lunch, the Asian Island is a solid place to go."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I always order here when I get the chance.

I think my favorite has to be the sweet and sour pork... and the mongolian beef.

Wait, I changed my mind. The katsu chicken and teriyaki chicken was AMAZING. Yep, those are my favorites. haha!

The portions are good. It does taste more authentic than some of the Chinese places around the area. And the fact that it's Chinese people that own the place kind of confirms it.

Good place for lunch. They also have some Korean and Japanese and Hawaiian style food here too!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Not that good either.  Lots of stuff to choose from - a mix of Hawaiian and assorted Americanized Asian cuisine.  Hidden a bit near what I think might be a gun club.  Meh."}
{"text":"Really good. Had beef fried rice and coconut shrimp. Both really tasty and reasonably priced. Very friendly service for take-out."}
{"text":"We gave this place try.  We ordered takeout and everything was very good. The portion sizes are generous and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"The Chinese food was mediocre. I had chicken fried rice, it had a very weird after taste. 

I wouldn't be ordering that again. My husband had the shrimp mein fun. He said it was okay. Nothing to write home about. 

All in all the food was just that OKAY!!! In sure with a little research I can find a much better place to eat Chinese food."}
{"text":"Very average. The people were nice but the food was average, I had the mongolian beef and so did my friend. Broccoli was cooked perfectly, the meat was a little too \"pounded out\" and fatty and had no real texture. The sauce was missing flavor. I think if they improved the sauce it would have been better, and of course the meat. I may try them one more time but likely will avoid."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great.  Ok for a fast lunch.  I had the #5 Hawaiian BBQ plate which did have quite a bit of food.  It has a combo of beef and chicken, 2 scoops of rice, some macaroni salad and then a small side of chips, with sweet and sour.  Service was straight forward, and the wait was decent, had food in less than 5 minutes.  The thing that was missing was taste.  Beef was bland, and I couldn't determine if it was blade steak, or what exactly.  Not a fan of mystery meat.  It did taste like beef and was not fatty.  The chicken had better taste, but when I went to cut it, it was kind of sinewy, like I had to look at it and then tell myself to not overthink it. Macaroni salad needed a little more zip to it.  All in all not as good as Ono, but good enough, Id be willing to give it another shot and try something else there."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and solid Chinese/Hawaiian food!!!"}
{"text":"I would recommend take-out from Asian Island. Eating in is pretty depressing. My partner stopped in on a week night after being at a nearby rental property we were working on.

The owners/employees were all sitting in the dining room playing on iPads, Phones, etc. One of them was even sleeping! \"If there's time to lean there's time to clean\".

The food was okay, but interestingly enough, served on the same plates as the previous restaurant that occupied this space and closed years ago.

Place your order and eat at home"}
{"text":"I was a little early for a Trauma first aid class at nearby Scottsdale Gun Club.  Saw this restaurant a few doors down and stopped in for a quick meal.  Was in a bit of a hurry so ordered something fairly safe - sweet and sour pork.  

The test of a good Italian restaurant is their bolognese sauce.  If they don't offer it or it tastes canned, don't bother with anything else they offer.  Fried rice is the real test of a good oriental restaurant.  Get that right and everything else is also probably good.  Asian Island makes great fried rice.  It has that background smoky flavor that says the cooks know what they are doing.  

The sweet and sour pork was good along with the spring roll and crab rangoon.  Much better quality than I was expecting.  Asian Island just went to the top of my \"where to eat\" list when I visit Scottsdale Gun Club."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese delivery in the area. I have yet to have anything that disappointed. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to grab lunch real quick and found this spot. I was really excited because I haven't had Chicken Katsu in forever. I saw that you can order online and just pick up so great! I placed my Chicken Katsu order online and got in my car to get the food. 

When I finally got there, I didn't even get a \"hello\". The lady asks me, \"pick up?\" I said \"yes\". She walks away and I decide to have a seat since she didn't come back. I assumed they were making the food when I got there because I waited 10 minutes until they gave me my order. 

When I finally dug in to eat, the chicken was so hard dry and lacked any flavor. It tasted like they fried the chicken way too long. I could only eat half of my order and threw away the rest. I am giving two stars because the portions are generous and the price is cheap - about $8 for chicken, macaroni salad and rice. Maybe it was an off day because I came due to their overall four star rating. Oh well!"}
{"text":"My family orders delivery from Asian Island every few weeks. It's so convenient, and no extra charge! And we LOVE the pan-fried pot stickers and Mongolian Beef. The rice is nice and sticky, just the way I like it. The price is right too. This is definitely our favorite traditional Chinese place. We haven't ventured beyond the Chinese food menu to try the sushi."}
{"text":"I recently ate here (I had the teriyaki chicken plate) and it was delicious, although the chicken was a little rubbery in taste. Other than that minor complaint the service was nice and the food was fast."}
{"text":"I agree with Lindsey's review and others below.  I almost never give negative reviews.  We wanted to try something new and gave it a try.  This place was not clean, and after sitting down it seemed like a family run place, which I have no problem with.  There was an elderly man there looking at us intently then went back to cook.  After we got our food, my wife and I saw him blow his nose in his hand and wipe it on his pants!  It totally grossed us out and we'll never be back!"}
{"text":"Sad, uneventful food. Went for lunchtime on a Saturday and it was incredibly dead. Only plus is that my son and I didn't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"Asian Island has become my favorite take out place. They have Chinese, Sushi and Hawaiian BBQ, so if I'm in the mood for sushi and my husband wants fried rice, we're both happy. The food is really good, with very fresh ingredients. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated, very clean, and the people who work here are friendly, nice and helpful. We try to go once a week for my sushi fix."}
{"text":"Tried the mini version of coconut shrimp. Wife loved it  I had Kung pao two. Lot of food, spiced just right. Service friendly. Try it for lunch.

Went again. Had Kung pao veggies for lunch. Friendly staff. Do it."}
{"text":"Welcome to Asian Island, home of some of the best Chinese take-out in Tucson--uh, I mean, home of some of the really good Chinese take-out in Phoenix. For SEVEN MONTHS, I have been deprived of fan-worthy Chinese food. Good grief. T-Town should come with a disclaimer: \"The city of Tucson lacks 4 and 5-star Chinese restaurants.\" I've been hunting around for a while now, and then on my first attempt at Chinese in Phoenix, I experience a victory of sorts.

For Americanized Chinese food, this place is good. They have $8 dinner combos with a super-portioned dish, a spring roll, and two crab cakes. 

I especially appreciate Asian Island's transparent kitchen wall, which allows guests to peek in while the cooks do their thang. So get on in there and watch how they fry all their shtuff."}
{"text":"I eat here every week on Friday for lunch. Never gets old. It is so good. Genuine Chinese restaurant. So far all my meals have been fresh, clean and delicious"}
{"text":"Crab puffs...very good, spring roll...very good, mongolian beef dinner...great!  I was very skeptical of the reviews at first, so we tried the food.  It is deserving of 5 stars for the quality of the food and the price.  My wife's meal was great also, as I tried her dish.  The food was not overally greasy like most places.  The cook used all fresh vegetables and ingredients as I watched him cook everything fresh.  This seemed to be a family run business as well.  If Asian Island reads this...keep up the great food quality and prices.  People will find you if the food continues to be good and my wife and I thought it was great.  We recommend yelpers to do take out.  We did not eat inside, but did take out only."}
{"text":"This is a little hidden gem in a mini mall parking lot.  Their spam musubi is amazing, and I embarrassingly think about it when I'm starving sometimes!  Their ma po tofu, bbq chicken and short ribs are also amazing.  I wish their staff was a little more friendly.  Food is great!"}
{"text":"Chicken Katsu was terrible. It was extremely fatty and tough."}
{"text":"I ordered General Tso's chicken.  I was served sweet and sour chicken, extremely sweet with green peppers, onions, and carrots.  I asked one of the servers after I tasted a few bites, \"Is this General Tso's Chicken??\"  Was told by the woman behind the counter that it was, just with spices.  I did not taste any heat and it was not a Tso sauce. My belief was that the kitchen made a mistake and no one dealt with it.  If this was Tso's Chicken, then the chef needs to check some recipes for the dish.

Directions
In a bowl, whisk together egg white, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, 2 tablespoons rice wine, 1 tablespoon soy sauce.  Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator up to 2 hours. 

Recipe #1 Sauce:
* 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
* 2 teaspoons Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
* 3 tablespoons chicken broth or water
* 1 tablespoon minced ginger 
* 2 teaspoons minced garlic
* 2 teaspoons cornstarch for thickening sauce, optional

Recipe #2 Sauce:
* 1tbsp dark soy sauce
* 1 tsp rice vinegar
* 1 tbsp Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
* 1 tsp granulated sugar
* 6 tablespoons chicken broth
* 1 tsp minced ginger 
* 1 tsp minced garlic
* 2 teaspoons cornstarch for thickening sauce
* Sesame oil

Recipe #3 Sauce:
* 14 cup chicken stock
* 1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon chili paste
* 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
* 1 teaspoon hoisin sauce
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 teaspoon cornstarch

Remove the chicken from the marinade and carefully slide into hot oil in a large wok or pot, 350 degrees.  Fry the chicken until golden brown and remove to drain.  Prepare the sauce in the wok.  Add the chicken and stir for 2 minutes, until the sauce thickens.  

For sauce, discard extra oil, leaving 1 tbsp oil in wok.  Add chile peppers and stir-fry.   Add the garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes and 1/2 cup green onions. Stir-fry  15 seconds. Add chicken stock sauce, boil until the sauce thickens.  Arrange the chicken on a platter and pour the sauce over it. Sprinkle with chopped green onions.  Serve with hot rice."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of Asian take-out until I stumbled upon Asian Island through Grub-Hub.  In the past month, we've already ordered 3 times !!  The food has been yummy and consistent each time.  HUGE portion sizes too !!!  Very surprised also that after eating, I don't have that \"omg I just ate a plateful of sodium\" feeling.  Cantonese Pan Fried Noodles seems to be the one I get every time. Crab Puffs and Sesame Chicken are also winners.  And the sushi is good too!   It is definitely worth giving a try."}
{"text":"Terrific lunch specials.  Super friendly staff and the food is awesome.  One of those places that you can get a great meal and feel good about patronizing a local family run restaurant."}
{"text":"this is a typical americanize version of jack of all trades. hawaiian, chinese and japanese food all in one place.
went here for local yelp get together. wife had a chinese food and I tried the japanese food (sushi). 
if you come here for the sushi. skip
if you come here for a quick chinese food, this one will be fine. I wouldn't call it authentic chinese food though. its more like your typical chinese fast food @your local mall."}
{"text":"I was doing a general restaurant search in my area and came across this place. My girlfriend and I wanted to just stay in for the night so we decided to call in an order. We ordered what we typically would at an Asian spot - some potstickers, hot & sour soup, fried rice and some entrees, in this case Chicken Lo Mein and Szechuan beef. It came out to a little over $40, which seemed high. 

Then I picked up the order. There was so much food! Not only was it delicious, far above what I'd consider standard take-out Chinese fare, but there was enough that we were able to have another 3-4 meals of leftovers each. I then read the yelp reviews that mentioned $1 delivery. How did I miss that?! Since then we have ordered delivery almost every week and have yummy leftovers in the fridge for the week. The only downside I can think of is that the atmosphere of the restaurant is uninspiring to say the least. However, we've found that hole in the wall and at times tacky Asian spots like this many times have great food at great prices. This place is no exception. That's why I still think it deserves 5*. Give it a try."}
{"text":"3.75 stars!  

Just finished putting away leftovers from a take-out order I placed via phone six minutes before closing time.  Mom was hungry, so I asked, would you like some pizza or Chinese?  She said Chinese, and as I started to look for the Flo's menu I had in my purse, she mentioned the pamphlet we received in the mail from Asian Island.  While she pored over the menu, I checked for Yelp reviews and found only one of significance (by that, I mean those reviews written by elites-- real photos and names), that of Scott D.'s.  Mom gave up looking, disgusted at seeing the high prices.  \"What do you mean the food's expensive?,\" I asked.  I looked at the menu, and I didn't see anything over-the-top ($9 chicken; $10 beef and pork; $11 shrimp), so I decided I'd go w/ Scott D.'s wife's selection of Shrimp Lo Mein for Mom, and the Twice-cooked Pork for me.  I'd requested that they omit carrots, celery, and, if any, corn and mushroom.  The woman on the phone repeated these veggies TWICE, so I gathered that she was taking careful notes...

The food was very tasty!  Mom said the shrimp dish was \"good!\"  I asked \"Good-good or good-because-you're-hungry-good?\"  She said \"good-good, but not 'out-of-body experience' good.\"  (To quote Scott D.)  LOL  My twice-cooked pork (bbq pork sauteed w/ CARROTS, bell pepper, water chestnuts, spring onions, CELERY, and onions, among other things, was also very tasty!  Mom liked the dish, as well, but, when asked, preferred the shrimp.  I had also requested a side of egg noodles (loved the bean sprouts!), instead of rice, and I really appreciated that they obliged!  Other restaurants would've forced me to take rice, which I cannot have, and then make me pay for a side order of noodles.  This alone deserved a star!  

Easily 4, 4.5 stars, which isn't bad for my first take-out meal from here, and I'd have given 5 stars if my request for certain veggies to be omitted was followed.  I will return to try other items, and, hopefully, they'll be more mindful about my food allergy concerns!

Lunch options look tantalizing, and sushi and Hawaiian dishes are also available!"}

{"text":"This place was pretty convenient for me to check out. They had a wide lunch special menu, but I was craving sesame chicken $6.25. It came with
crab rangoon was ok, which the shell seemed like it was made from a flakey, crispy wrap. The sweet and sour sauce was too liquidy. The fried rice was good, pretty standard. The sesame chicken was good, had a good flavor. I would come back for sure. They have Hawaiian food! I'll try that next time."}

came here to treat myself to comfort food after finishing a skating competition.
i opted for the mongolian beef combo plate, given the stellar reviews on yelp
the beef was nice and tender, not gristly at all, nicely seasoned and had a hint of spice.
the fried rice was good as well.
the egg rolls were crunchy and warm.
perfect meal to make one happy.
price very very decent."}

$1 delivery?! Heck yeah! That's better than nasty Jimmy Johns!

I ordered the spicy tuna roll, musubi, and BBQ chicken. I had so much left over, so its well worth the $15 minimum, because it'll be my left overs for the next meal or two. 

The spicy tuna roll was really good. I was hesitant about having sushi delivered considering our unforgiving heat here. But I'm really glad I did. It was spicy, fresh, and cold. 

The musubi, hit the spot, although I'm not Hawaiian, this was something my gma adopted when we were kids, so it was a throw back to my childhood. That salty, fatty, starchy goodness.

Lastly, the BBQ chicken. Dark meat, and your choice of side of rice (fried, chicken fried, white steamed, etc. the list goes on). The chicken hardly had any gristle or fat (thank god, because when you're in a good mood, biting into something crunchy and rubbery can mess up your groove if its not your thing) and it was charred to absolute perfection. I'm one of those weirdos that likes her meat cremated, gives it a different flavor!

And they were nice enough to give me a fistful of fortune cookies, a pair of chopsticks, and basic plastic ware. As well as a take out menu. 

Which btw, when it reads \"We Delivery!\" on the front portion of the menu, you know your meal is going to be legit. :)

This is a HAVE TO spot. Its better than Ono, better than L&L. Their menu is long, sushi, Hawaiian, and Chinese! All in one place?! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE."}
{"text":"I often order for delivery at my office. Service is fast and food is delicious. Very reasonable prices. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Manager told me to give half of my money back due to wrong order. it never happened.  He should not lie!!!"}
{"text":"We have been searching Scottsdale for good Chinese for almost two years and finally we can stop. We got some traditional Chinese dishes as well as some sushi (Tiger Rolls are amazing). Everything was excellent and plentiful. By the time it hit the fridge we barely felt like we had dented it. All in all it is the best Chinese food in Scottsdale for our money."}
{"text":"I'm born and raised from Hawaii, and this did not taste like anything back home.  I asked the owner if they are from Hawaii, and they said no, they haven't been there.   That was sooo disappointing.  I won't go back.  The service sucked too!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Asian Island because of all the nice reviews it got. This is a little mom and pop place that reminds of those little shops in SF Chinatown. 

We decided to eat there and they started us off with fried won ton strips with sweet and sour dipping sauce. Won ton was stale.

I ordered the pan fried noodles and my wife ordered the hawaiian BBQ chicken. The BBQ chicken seemed like it was marinated over night and was very juicy and tender. The noodles was pretty good and had shrimp, chicken, and a bunch of veggies. 

I thought the food was good and I've tasted better that's closer to us. So we'll see if we visit again"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for Dad from out of state.  Did isn't feeling well.  I PAID for the order and they messed it up.  I asked the gal to REREAD THE CC, and it still screwed it up.  Well, A nice gesture went Sideways....."}
{"text":"Great price point to plate ratio.  Amazing sushi  and menu items.  Food was excellent.  They gave us complementary chips and dip.  We had General Tso's Chicken, Beef Lo Mein, crab puffs, and spring roll (best I've had). Excellent service."}
{"text":"Not great food today.  Got the Singapore dish... noodles were all stuck together.  Flavor was not good.  Bland . Asked for spicy..  was not . Orange chix was good . Took over a hour to be delivered."}
{"text":"Can't say this is the best.  I ordered from here on a business trip (from ATL) for delivery. Most places give you a window for delivery time, and my experience is they cushion it by at least 25%.  Not with this place.  They said 40 to 60 minutes.  From the app (Yelp EAT app that is), it was officially 59:58:03 to delivery.  

Food was so-so.  Not bad for delivery, but not what I paid for at $30 (including tip)."}
{"text":"Not the best Chinese place around. Lo mein was flavorless and the orange chicken was extremely mushy and all fatty chicken bits with very little flavor as well. The Rangoon's and hot and sour soup were delicious though."}
{"text":"Wonder prices. Tried for first time today. Picked up orange chicken and my coworker kung poa chicken lunch specials. Nice portion and I am still full 4hours later. It was amazing. Will return! Ill try something different each time."}
{"text":"If you want to close for several days, you should make sure your customers know. Otherwise they may drive 15 min out of their way and find that everyone is on vacation"}
{"text":"Just moved to Sdale from the N. Valley and after reading the recent Yelp reviews for this place (and the 4 star overall rating), I thought I would try it for delivery.  Took about 1 hour to get the food and wasn't impressed at all.  Blah Moo Goo Gai Pan and my roomie didn't like his Chicken Lo Mein much either.   Hot and sour soup was so so as well.  I did like the fried wontons they give you for free, thin and crisp unlike most Chinese restaurants. Throwing the delivery menu in the trash and won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place today, after a bad experience at Ono I wanted to give Hawaiian another chance. However when I waked in here today I ordered the Orange Chicken on auto-pilot - Why? I really don't know... It was decent but likely the lamest dish I could have ordered. The staff seems to be on the ball and the place is really clean, so I intend to return and fully explore the Hawaiian menu."}
{"text":"Great food! 
Ordering is quick & easy!
Good service!

To Go ordering
The time to get my food is the problem, I don't mind waiting for 30-45mins 
but an hour or more...is too long. 
Also the last two times I've ordered, it's been wrong...super frustrating. But they've always given me credit or replaced my order."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food and service at this spot.

I walk and and the owner starts to scream at his worker who seems to be his wife. He is screaming at her in mandarin so I can't tell what he's saying.

I order Kung Pao chicken and find two hairs in the food. I also got a hot and sour soup that was way too salty and didn't taste right. I was hesitant to eat the soup from the beginning as I heard the owner coughing while packaging the soup.

Anyways, there should be much better choices in Scottsdale for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Never ever been restaurant like this in USA!
1. It's like their home cum restaurant. They have small TV turned on nearby our table. They have the portable fan on facing to themselves and A/C was turned off so it was quite humid.
2. They have kept the doors open so housefly came in and tried to sit on our food. Yuck!!! I then asked the to go box and packed the food and came outside and threw the food in the garbage. 
3. I tried to grab the hot chilly sauce but saw the thin layer of dust so i didn't grab at all. 
4. They were talking in Chinese in a loud voice so it was very disturbing. Very disrespectful environment for customers.
5. Food was just okay. The Singapore rice noodle has too much turmeric powder so it looked very yellowish.

Sorry, I don't usually write the bad reviews but this was way too much."}
{"text":"I have been around this food my whole life and these guys/gals are legit. I have been coming here for a couple years and I almost never eat out, but when I am working near here I make a point to stop in for lunch. I have been here 50+ times and have never once been disappointed...get some MUSUBI!!!"}
{"text":"Good food."}
{"text":"schezwan chicken i ordered was boring and not very good- too bland. wont be coming back."}
{"text":"When I think of Asian Island, many things come to mind... Delicious, and I mean everything.  Fresh ingredients that are prepared-to-order.  Great service.  Many menu options.  Forever.  As in, it takes FOREVER to get your food here.  If you are in a pinch and need lunch quickly, call ahead or plan to take your meal to-go.  This kind of deliciousness doesn't happen fast.  Dine in customers (and often customers waiting for takeout orders) are treated to crispy wonton strips and dipping sauce to prevent them from eating one another during the extended wait for food.  But fret not, my friend, for once the goods are placed before you, you can't help but forget the agony you endured waiting for it.  This is top notch fast-casual dining.  Sadly, I have to deduct a star for the slow food service.  If they can get moving in the kitchen and start turning tables over a bit more quickly, they'd have no trouble getting a five star rating out of me."}
{"text":"Asian Island has good food and they're  always on time. I have only ordered online delivery through yelp (even though I live across the rd) so my review is based on this alone. Everything I have ordered has been pretty good. My favorites are the orange chicken, almond or cashew chicken and crab puffs. Their sushi is pretty decent also. I love the tiger rolls. 

The highlight of this place is ordering delivery through yelp! That's what makes this place 5 stars for me. It's just so easy and convenient, maybe too convenient. Ha. On their take-out menu there is an option of a free item with 20, 25, or 35 or more which is nice, although they have forgotten a couple of times to include. 

Overall I like the food, love the convenience and I am happy with the service."}
{"text":"Finally a decent and \"normally priced\" Chinese food place in the area and they DELIVER!! Wheeeeee!!!!   For those of us trapped at the office, that means a lot. This and having such great lunch specials. I get the Curry Chicken with brown rice and it's delicious :) Definitely will use them again."}
{"text":"If I could give a place 6/5 stars, that would be this restaurant.
You know those times when you want take out and you want Chinese food but you could be swayed towards sushi, or even maybe even Hawaiian? Go to this place and just stare are the MANY menu boards. It's all good. I've had their sushi (Tiger roll is my current favorite here), their chinese combo lunch plates (which are outrageously cheap), and their fried fish hawaiian combos. Everything has been great and way more food than I can eat.

Their service is great as well. They bring the food to your table if you are eating in and start you off with crispy wonton strips and sweet & sour sauce. Then your food comes, fresh from their grill, and it is just wonderful. They even offer to top off your drinks for you, and bring you anything else you need.

You could come here for lunch every day, try something new, and never run out of choices or variety. On top of that, their hours are amazing, something like 10:30 AM to 8PM. Early lunches to late dinners, and they deliver.

I can't think of anything to complain about. Maybe they could offer soup. Really. That's my wish, not even a complaint, because I probably could not eat wontons, soup, AND a dish. But I would try.

--- UPDATE - They DO have soup. It's not on their big boards but is listed on their small takeout menus. So, there you have it. It's all good!"}
{"text":"I was having a bad night so I decided to order some hot and sour soup, rent some movies, and just stay in that night. I looked online and the only place that had decent reviews was this place.

So, I go to their menu and I ordered my hot and sour soup. I had to order chicken fried rice and pot stickers also since my total had to be at least 15$ or something like that. But that's okay I wasn't fretting it. 

Anyways, I ended up not having to wait long until my food was at the door which was great! I put the food on my table and open it all up and it smelled great. Now let me tell you I am a huge hot and sour soup fan and I know good soup from bad but this soup was hands down the best hot and sour soup I have ever had! They even put shrimp in it! The fried rice and pot stickers were just like any other restaurants. 

The only negative thing I could say about this place was the fact that they gave me three fortune cookies and it was only me eating the food. So 1 it made me feel like a fatty and 2 it made me feel lonely because I was supposed to be eating that meal with 3 people. Or on the plus side I needed to open all three fortunes to find the good one and I now have a good fortune!

Will definitely we returning for some more hot and sour soup!!"}
{"text":"Called them directly and placed a delivery order to our hotel room. Food arrived in a timely manner and was delivered by a friendly driver. I was immediately struck by the weight of our 2 bags. Generous portions packed in excellent containers that did not leak; still piping hot.

Black Pepper Chicken was my favorite, with juicy, tender pieces of chicken and crisp vegetables in a delicious sauce with just the right amount of pepper kick.

I would not hesitate to order from this fine establishment the next time I am in town :)"}
