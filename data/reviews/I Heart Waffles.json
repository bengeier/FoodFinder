{"text":"The waffles were okay. My friends and I visited this hoping for a great meal, but were upset at the quality of the food. It took about 10 minutes for us just to order because the lady at the register answered about 5 phone calls before taking our order. I would not recommend going here just due to the fact that it would be easier to make these waffles at home."}
{"text":"Although my visit was about 2 weeks ago, I am still stunned by the customer service in this place, or the lack there of! Me and my mom decided to try it, after she'd heard some good things about it from coworkers. We were excited to stop in because after all, who doesn't love a good waffle?!

We decided to try sweet potato waffles and chicken; she had tenders, I had wings, which were quite smaller than what I expected ater the description I'd recieved, but weren't bad. Her tenders looked quite under cooked, but she said they were done, but could have been cooked a little more. The waffles looked and smelled amazing!! But unfortunately were not cooked all the way through when we cut into them.

Reluctantly (I hate to complain!!), I took the waffles back to the counter with the hopes that we could recieve waffles that were cooked entirely through. Unfortunately, we were told \"that's just how that waffle comes out\", and \" we make out batter using sweet potato puree, so it's not that it's undone, it's just really moist\" and \"our waffle makers are set to a timer\". I don't know about you, but those all sound like excuses to me!! I know an under cooked waffle when I see one, and those were it!

Instead of causing a big fuss, we opted for the cinnamon waffles instead of continuing to eat the half- cooked waffles were served first. When they came out they were not warm at all (the butter didn't melt!), and my mom recieved an original versus the cinnamon waffle she ordered. The cashier came to see how everything was, and when we let her know of the other issues, she simply had even more excuses! And the worst part is that the owner was in the dining room at the next table over from us during our entire visit and never even acknoweleged the problem!! The quickest way to lose a customer: offer excuses for problems instead of rectifying them!"}
{"text":"We were in town for a wedding and found this spot on yelp, and it had so many good reviews and something called the \"Donuffle\" so we had to try it.  It was such a pleasant experience, I promised Phil, the proprietor, that I would write a review.  The variety of food you can get is ridiculous, but I don't doubt they do all of it well. My husband and I chose to get savory waffle sandwiches ( I got the \"handful of breakfast\" which had bacon, sausage and eggs and my husband had chicken & waffles. We had to try the donuffles and went for a bacon maple glazed one and chocolate espresso. Everything was cooked so well and the flavors of everything were showcased very well. The sausage had a great sage/Rosemary taste I wasn't expecting. 

Not only was the food great but the staff easily one of the kindest, most welcoming waitstaff I've been around. When we walked in we were greeted with warm hellos and Phil, who I think is the owner shook our hands and explained the whole menu! Our waitress Michelle, checked in often and I observed her also being so welcoming to everyone that came in, even a woman who wasn't in a position to buy anything, she gave her a coffee and was very sweet. 

This whole staff exuded kindness and such personal service. when I learned they've only been open for 7 months, I was shocked because they had so many good reviews. Now I know why. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Phil the fire is back!  I've really missed the chicken and waffles of Phil the Fire since they closed a few years ago. Now I  Waffles is serving amazing waffles with chicken and every other delicious topping imaginable - 5 minutes from my house. I couldn't be more excited. 

Not only are the waffles great, my son had the shrimp and grits and that was fantastic as well. 

Oh yeah, and $35 for dinner for a family of 4 is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Cheap food for what it is (high quality). Not only that, the people that work there are friendly and seem to be enjoying themselves. Ask them anything about the menu (which is huge) and they will help you out. 
G R E A T strawberry donut waffles!!!! Must have. Also, their inlets are super tasty and savory!
If you're in the shaker area there aren't a lot of good local food spots especially for breakfast (maybe lee road?) so this makes 
I heart waffles stand out even more!

Ps, the owner Phil is a super nice guy. He stopped by our table and spoke with my girlfriend and I for a moment while we were eating.

They have energy drinks too!!!

Gatta try this hidden spot!!"}
{"text":"Great fast-casual place for waffles, omelets, milkshakes, etc. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Waffle was good.  Eggs were terrible and the bacon was microwaved and over cooked. Next time I'll just make my own apple waffle. Will NEVER go back there."}
{"text":"I Love Phil the Fire!  I HEART WAFFLES....  is a small spinoff. Prices are great,  waffles are ok, but the chicken breast needs an implant...it appeared to be a processed boneless piece of flat meat! Staff was courtesy and attentive."}
{"text":"Thank you yelp. I am an out of towner looking for a breakfast after noon, on a Sunday. I waffles came highly recommended so I gave them a shot. The gal working the counter asked if I was a first timer and explained the process. I went with buckwheat with blueberries, real maple syrup, 2 eggs over easy with bacon & sausage. Throw in a cup of coffee and the bill was still under $10. It was as good as it gets in the waffle world. Excellent customer service and an outstanding value. The owner came in and chatted it up with all the customers and cleared our dirty dishes. I waffles and yelp are 2 organizations that make our country worth living in."}
{"text":"This place is great. Great variety of waffles and breakfast foods. The donuffles are out of this world!! No wrong choices here. Great customer service too. The owner said hello and the waitress and the men cooking the food made a special 'Happy Birthday' waffle for my sister.  Will definitely be going back for breakfast again soon!"}
{"text":"Just experienced a Donuffle (donut waffle hybrid) for the first time and it was delicious! Affordable, delicious and great service."}
{"text":"Breakfast lunch and dinner served!  We had dinner tonight.  Chicken and waffles with traditional waffle batter & BBQ pulled pork waffle with corn bread waffle batter.  Both were delicious and served with a smile.  The owner even came out to clear our plates and introduce himself.  What a nice guy!"}
{"text":"Man, listen... I was in need of quick, tasty breakfast immediately and iwaffles came through clutch. 
The staff recognized I was a newcomer and walked me through the offerings politely and clearly--I was struggling with the whole shopping-while-hungry thing. The menu has enough selections to keep it interesting but concise enough so it's clear they're focused on what they do. 
They do it well. My food came quickly. The scrambled eggs were perfectly timed and the turkey sausage was seasoned just right. And that waffle, mannnn, that waffle was perfect. Light and delicious! Real talk, I am stunned at the value I got for $7. 
Definitely one of my go-to faves...especially during the workday. The vibe inside is relaxed and super clean, too."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and the food was AWESOME both times. The staff and owner are all very friendly and attentive. The price is right as well. I would recommend this place every day."}
{"text":"We came in Sunday morning after church. The food is great the staff warm and friendly.  I orderd the doughnut waffle it was great it had bacon glaze on top. It was well cooked and the glaze was just sweet and savory enough. My dad had the waffle with bacon on top and my mom had the  handful of breakfast which was waffles with egg, sausage, and bacon. The food was wonderful. The atmosphere is very nice. The owner came out to greet guests. There were tables are set up for socialization great for small group. Its in a nice little area with close parking. The food was light I left feeling satisfied and not stuffed. The price was just right."}
{"text":"I was greeted by the staff when I came in. A very nice lady greeted me again as I approached the counter. I was surprised by the low cost of the food and beverage. This was my first time here, so I took a little time looking over the menu and beverage selection. It was a pleasant atmosphere where nobody rushed me to order. I got the bacon glazed waffle. It tasted wonderful. I would say that I had 3 greats:  food, service and cost."}
{"text":"No kidding that piece of shit Phil is out of business again- not surprising- Phil has been a liar and piece of garbage since he was on shaker square- fuck him"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a breakfast treat and all I can say is \"wow\". I'm not a huge sugar fan, so I'm not sure what I was thinking when I ordered the Nutty Professor. I made it a little over halfway through the waffle (to my surprise and discomfort), though! If it hadn't been so sugary, I think I would have finished it--the waffle was no doubt delicious and who doesn't like Nutella?! 

As for the service, everyone was super nice. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and everyone was incredibly polite when asking the details of our orders. The entire staff seemed to be enjoying themselves, even though it was fairly early on a Saturday. 

I think we'll be back now that we know the level of sweetness that comes with these items. I'm super curious about the chicken and waffles, one of my favorite dishes ever, and the taco waffle. I'll definitely be going the savory route on my return! And if I'm feeling crazy, maybe I'll get another Nutty Professor, but ask for less Nutella...I'm nuts, I know."}
{"text":"They get an automatic 3 stars for being within walking distance! I've eaten there a few times and always leave satisfied. The atmosphere is casual and unassuming; the way I like it, and the service is always friendly and prompt. 
The food is hot and tasty - what more can you ask for? I'm on my way there right now to get some breakfast - see ya!"}
{"text":"Okay, so this is the first trip and I will be back, so that should be an indicator.  This place is relatively new so there are some things they will need to work out.

So Letts look at the positives.  The staff was great.  Very friendly , warm and engaging.  Second, I love the layout.  Took me a little off guard at first, but I like the family style seating. There are some stand alone tables if you don't want to meet new people.  There menu is creative and has a southern / New Orleans hint.  E.g. the Doughwaffel, has a reference to there version of the Beignet.  A great French donut made famous at Cafe Du Monde.  They also do shrimp and grits.  That s more Carolina and Georgia.  That is to say they have a great flare.

The grit, had a side, were great as we're the waffles, coffee and doughwaffle. So it is really a Belgium style waffle strip made with different waffle mix to make it fluffy and crisp.  The normal waffles are of the thinner variety, but still great.

So I will be be back and reserve the right to bump up the ratings.

So the down side.  And while I appreciate that the kitchen layout may need to be considered, they used a frozen chicken patty.  Had I know, I would not have ordered chicken and waffles.  I love that they want to try it, but don't was it up by half stepping."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Had the chicken and waffles and they were fantastic. The owner came around and was so friendly and appreciative, it made me want to go back."}
{"text":"Went here because it's right by my mother-in-law's.  The chicken & waffles were great and so were shrimp & grits, but I was still a little hungry after the shrimp & grits.  I also tend to eat a lot, so I wouldn't hold that against them.  We got some donuffles to go, and they were all great.  If you do get a donuffle though, make sure you eat it fresh.  We got a lot so the ones that sat got soggy."}
{"text":"We ordered the \"handful of breakfast\" which includes waffles, eggs, bacon and sausage, and a coffee.  I had the cornbread waffles.  The food was really tasty. 

The place is nice and clean and the service was really good too!  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love chicken. 
I love waffles.
So, it's no surprise that when I found a place that combined the two, along with other creative selections in Shaker Heights, I was excited.

The folks at I Heart Waffles are nice and their food is very good; I got the standard chicken and waffle combo, and my wife got a curry chicken waffle combo that was spicy and tasty. They also have egg combos, shakes and other interesting culinary treats. 

I encourage any and all to check out this little place for a breakfast treat, or a snack as it's really got some good stuff. 

There's plenty of parking in the area, and if you're a fan of that griddled great, the wonderful waffle, I'd give this place a try:)"}
{"text":"I went to I Heart Waffles on 6/25/15 with one friend. It was around 2 o clock and when we walked in and the place was empty. We were enthusiastically greeted by two employees.  I was surprised by how dark the inside of the restaurant was because typically breakfast places have a sunny vibe, but the decor wasn't bad. It was different.  They play fantastic music that put me in a good mood.  When we walked in, Beyonce was playing.

I ordered 1 donuffle topped with chantilly cream and strawberries with a side of smoked salmon and a caramel iced coffee.  I got all that for about ten dollars.  The donuffle is a good size and the side of salmon was large.  The salmon was quite salty, but it wasn't a bad thing because it contrasted well with the sweet donuffle. I think it's important to note that the salmon is not served cold and slimy with capers like lox (as i was expecting).  My friend ordered two Bacon, Bacon, Bacon donuffles to start and I suppose he enjoyed them because he asked for another before we left.

The woman at the front register who took our order initially checked on us twice and she was very friendly and genuine.  Upon leaving we were thanked for stopping by and I plan to go again very soon."}
{"text":"Well I love waffles because I'm fat so I figured... Why not. I really liked the atmosphere and the gal who took my order was such a babe! However, I ordered a strawberry waffle and a side of bacon and it was $9! The waffle was a bit disappointing as I was expecting a big fluffy Belgium waffle and I had to remind the staff about my bacon, where they brought out the two saddest bacon strips of my life. The weird part is, as I was standing up to leave, they brought me more bacon to compensate for the sad bacon, which to be honest, was pretty delicious. I'm a big fan of free anything, but it was just odd timing. 

I think I had a weird experience there, but I would probably go back and try something different. I think the prices are high, but overall, the food was alright."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this plae. It has a ton of good reviews + i was severely craving waffles.  So, we headed in here hoping to be wow-ed and because we were so hungry, that job should not have been so hard.
As we entered, we were greeted by a very polite soft spoken server who ran through the menu with us. I appreciated the diversity in the menu. While it focused heavily on waffles- both swee and savory, they did have eggs, mac and cheese , fries, grits, etc. 
I opted to go simple and make my own waffle - originial with strawberry and banana infusion. Theyve trademarked their toppings and 'infusions'(?) and i dont know why. But it didnt matter. I am used to an abundance of fruits on my waffles, however what i did get was about half a banana ( maybe less, there were about 8 small rounds of banana) and maybe the same amount of caramelized strawberries. It was barel enough fruit for 4 bites. Topped with some whipped cream, yet my waffle felt naked. I also ordered the omelet- it was pretty okay, bot 5$ for that was very disappointing- it was flat and had very little veggies in it. 
My friend got the i heart burger waffle which was a burger topped with cheese and mustard in a waffle. He said it was unimpressive.  We also got a donutuffle with chanitilly cream: it was pretty good.. but honestly couldn't really see the difference between this and a waffle. It tasted like a lighter , more airy waffle. 
The service was good, so was the coffee . The decor kinda looked like a 3rd grade homecoming dance setting: there were heart balloons everywhere, heart stickers on the table and on the walls. Food was served in paper plates and utensils were plastic. I also noticed our server brought out our food on an aluminum tray- something you could probably buy at the dollar store.
Either way, we ended up spending 30$ for 1 waffle with 2 toppings, 1 omlete ( i cant even consider it a decently sized omlet) 1 burger waffle,1 donutuffle, 1 soda and 1 coffee. In my opinion overpriced. It felt like i went to someone's house and they made me breakfast. It didnt feel 'restaurant quality' . Maybe if it was more reasonably priced we'd return, but highly unlikely. Either way, i think its worth going in for their AM special- 2 donutiffles and coffee for 5$. But not for a full breakfast."}
{"text":"Visiting friends in the Cleveland area and they suggested we get Chicken and Waffles. After a night of adult beverages, I was game.

Located on the corner in Shaker Heights, this place is extremely clean. We were greeted by the helpful and friendly staff. 

I had the Southern Belle, which is waffles, chicken, bacon, Swiss with some honey mustard. It was delicious. Also had some grits which were cooked quite nicely. The better half had the Chicken and Waffles with real maple syrup and since her plate was empty quickly, I know she loved it.

Definitely a good little spot for breakfast or anytime you want some comfort food!"}
{"text":"We can only call this place \"creative\". Who would think of making sandwiches with waffles? There are also conventional waffle breakfast meals and desserts. Lots of options, lots of creativity and lots of very good food.

It should be noted that this place is born of the creative mind of \"Phil the Fire\". If you loved his waffles in whatever venue you've tried them you can enjoy them again. This time filled or topped with, yes chicken, but also sweets, meats and many other options. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"I really like the omelette and the plain waffle with the syrup. The prices were affordable. The chicken wings were good. They taste better dipped in sauce."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!....Cheesecake Waffles + Coffe + Free Wi-Fi + Bigtime Success!!!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and helpful. Donuffles were great and better than the waffles. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for some good comfort food in Shaker Heights. I ordered the cheesecake waffle on my first visit and was blown away simply a waffled bed filled with creamy cheesecake. filling topped your choice of either strawberry, blueberry, banana or pineapple. Only thing that could make this bad were horrible filling and an undercooked waffle. The waffle was cooked to perfection as to all the filling to lighty melt into the grooves and really sit on the waffle, the strawberry, clean and juicy and I found I had enough of them on my plate. I just wanted to be home in my superman pajamas but  he end of the waffle, under a blanket trying to recovery with a glass of milk."}
{"text":"Great waffles Phil stopped in today and got an original waffle with a side of turkey sausage the waffle was delicious had a great smell. And the turkey sausage was good also"}
{"text":"Best waffles in the area strongly recommend place we totally enjoyed everything we got"}
{"text":"I'm deathly coming back to this place! I tried the Southern Belle waffles and it was delicious. It took me 30 minutes to drive out here but it was worth the drive."}
{"text":"With a few tweaks, this could be a 5*.

First, I can walk here from my house. There go any weight loss goals. Much needed in Shaker, where the only other decent place to eat is J. Pistone.

Second, THE DONUFFLE!!! To hell with the cronut, right? I mean it's just a waffle shaped like a long john with donut glaze but the waffle is fluffy inside, slightly crispy outside and the glazes are AMAZING. Cookies and creme donuffle is probably my favorite thing to eat ever. Lemon zest glaze is awesome. I tasted salted caramel and chantilly cream as well, also killer. For the plain old waffles, my son had a sweet potato waffle infused with apples. Didn't even need the syrup. YUM FIVE MILLION STARS.

On my second visit, I ordered my husband the TacOMG with pork. It's a taco on a waffle. He liked it but wasn't drooling. The sweet potato waffle fries... had a nice touch of cinnamon, but i think they were fired too early and ended up soggy. I ordered the Nutty Professor - nutella, peanut butter, chantilly cream and your choice of fruit on a waffle. Cream was excellent, but the waffle got soggy in the time it took for them to give it to me and for me to get home (literally a 2 min drive). Maybe they prepared it too early while waiting for the taco one or something? 

On the plus side, they ran out of shredded lettuce for the tacOMG and offered to refund me. I said, who cares about lettuce on a taco, and they said, no, really. So I told them to comp me a donuffle instead, and that is how I met a waffle covered in oreo glaze. YES. The owner definitely wants to please his customers and was super nice.

So, I think the problems could be solved with better timing of when things are fired and prepared. Like, make all the waffles and then don't top them til the last minute? There are plenty of staff, seems like there could be some kind of organized line to make things go faster, there is definitely a decent wait. Maybe make the waffles you're going to top with stuff extra crispy on the outside or something? I don't know. But I will eat more donuffles, weight watchers be damned."}
{"text":"I got the Chicken Cordon Bleu, it was so delicious. The chicken was perfect, the sauce was bombastic. The Mac n Cheese is absolutely that must try, but I would recommend getting shrimp or lobster in it."}
{"text":"We were craving waffles, so onto Yelp I go. How can you not try a place that hearts waffles. While the concept is darn near genius it was not executed well. The shy cashier noticed we were taking a while to figure out the menu so she came around the counter to walk is through it. At no time did she mention that they were out of chicken breasts, which eliminated about 40% of the menu. We then ordered three items. One build your own waffle and two varieties of chicken and waffle sandwiches. After we paid and sat down the cashier came to our table to inform us that they were out of chicken breasts and one of our sandwiches couldn't be made even though they both came with breasts. So she opted for a refund instead of a replacement. Getting the refund was a story in its self. We had to wait for the manager to show up 10 minutes later in order to receive it. A few minutes after that we received the build your own. The toppings were minimal considering each one was .95$. My sandwich was no where in sight. About 5 minutes after that I was presented with four hot wings ( not what I ordered). So I questioned my order because the sandwich was twice the price of wings. We then received a refund for the remaining total. The cashier was extremely apologetic and urged us to try them again because in her words \"I swear it's not usually this bad\". 
While it wasn't what we expected, the food we did receive was good. I was impressed that my wings were still very crispy even after a generous coating of hot sauce. 
The manager leaves something to be desired and left a bad taste in my mouth and I didn't even interact with him. His attitude towards the employees was poor at best and he probably shouldn't be in a position of authority. But his crew still did the best with what they had to work with. They were all very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We saw someone walking in and realized that I Waffles was open which led me to look up the website...no website. (You need a website with descriptions on your menu selections. Also, we live in the area and never seen any advertisement in the local magazines or mailings that you were coming to the area or even open). However, we did find It on Yelp. We ordered the shrimp and grits and the Southern Belle based on pictures on Yelp. When we walked in we were greeted by at least 4 staff and the owner.  This was a pleasant surprise. The cashier even came from around the counter to explain each menu item which added a nice extra touch of customer service. The place was clean and roomy with a simplified decor.  We ordered the food togo and received large portions of the shrimp and grits! The meal didn't look like the picture with the sauce.  Instead there was a green and red peppered mixture with onions.  The taste was still good and plenty of nice sized shrimp. Our Southern Belle tasted good even though I only took a bite to taste. I was full from eating only half of the Shrimp and Grits.  The prices are very reasonable! We need this type of eatery in the area."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for breakfast. We were greeted immediately and our server was more than happy to explain the menu and how everything worked. It's panera-style where you go up and order and they bring your food out. I got the chicken and waffles and a maple bacon \"donuffle\" which is basically a glazed waffle. YUM. Small, family-owned place. Everyone that worked there was so friendly and made sure we liked our meals. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food was great, crispy waffles and good coffee - but what really impressed me was the owner/manager (?) She was so friendly and welcoming to everyone who walked in. Her warmth and positive attitude made the restaurant atmosphere even better.  I would highly recommend stopping by- the sweet potato waffles were my favorite!"}
{"text":"I just enjoyed (huge emphasis on enjoy) breakfast at I Heart Waffle today. I am a social eater which means I take a little food from everyone around me. This allowed me to sample many yummy things. My waffle was perfect and the omelet was one of the best I've ever had. Seriously how do you make fried chicken wings with no oil? And the Cajun grits.... OMG!! Let me also say the staff was wonderful. The ladies working the counter and running the food were friendly and professional. The chefs were quick and efficient."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this establishment for a Valentine's Day lunch and had a rather disappointing service experience. We tried to resolve the issues while on site to no avail. I was refunded the monies for my meal and left the establishment (after being there for an hour) hungry.  I posted my dissatisfaction on Facebook and stated that we would return once the 'kinks' were worked out.   What happened next made me feel as if I were being 'P'nked'!    

Chef Black contacted me via inbox and instead of just apologizing, stating he'd look into the issues with his staff, and maybe offering a free waffle at my next visit, he decided to make a bunch of excuses and basically blame me for my poor experience!!

He also accused me of trying to 'defame another black establishment' and spewing negativity on FB instead of talking to management.  Which my husband did btw. 

I was appalled. 

I informed him that I was not that 'type' of patron and that I give credit where credit is due. I even sent him a post that I had done 2 days earlier for Ligali's Bistro in the Tremont area of Cleveland, OH. Another 'black owned and/or operated' establishment.  I gave them a glowing review for both the food and ESPECIALLY the service by bartender/server Ricky.

Chef Black then asked me 'Who did I think created the recipes for Ligali's?' as if that had ANYTHING at all to do with this situation.

I shook my head and went to post the exchange on FB.  I also tagged Restauranteur/Entrepreneur Phil Davis who is also an owner of this establishment thinking he needed to be aware of what's transpiring with his Chef and to my SURPRISE he took the same stance as Chef Black!!  He asked me to be more understanding of the newness of the restaurant, and how busy it was that day, and requested that I just move on.  

My mouth dropped to the floor. 

I could not BELIEVE that not one, but TWO opportunities had arose for this to be addressed appropriately and both OWNER and Chef interactions equaled #EPICFAILS.

Chef Black and I have 70 mutual FB friends, some of which, contacted him to address the situation.

Phil Davis and I 'were' FB friends and he also was contacted by our mutual friends to address this situation.

To no avail..

Phil Davis would not even take the time to read my complete post to find out what the issues were so I Unfriended him.

Chef Black acknowledged me 'in third person' by stating he had apologized to me and said my next meal was free.  I acknowledged this statement and said it was fine.  I told him that Phil Davis had left such a bad taste in my mouth so I would pass on the freebie, but should he ever dissociate himself from Phil, I'd take him up on the free meal offer.  I told him 'no harm, no foul. If we have that many mutual friends you must be cool peeps!'  I thought everything was fine after this thread. 

I awoke the next morning to see his name blacked out in the thread.  I went to his page and it was no longer accessible.

I had been BLOCKED.   So here we are. Hopefully your experience is better than mine.  As for me I will NEVER patronize any establishment associated with Chef Black or Phil Davis.

***Update***  The owners of this establishment somehow think we are in cahoots with the other black owned establishment Ligali's.  

They think we are out to sabotage them when in fact we went to the establishment based off a good friend of mine's (and Chef Black aka Len B.) suggestion. The fact that it was nearby and that we Love Waffles solidified the deal...This is really sooo saaad... #CantWeAllJustGetAlong.."}

{"text":"I stopped by on Friday May 1, 2015, to pick up Donuffles for breakfast at my office. I got there at about 7:30. I was the first customer. There was a woman working the register and two gentleman making waffles. There was another gentleman taking out trash and the like.  The woman at the counter and the gentlemen making waffles were pleasant.  They were singing along with the radio and cracking jokes with one another.  It was a nice atmosphere.  I ordered a \"Baker's Dozen\" for the office, which was all twelve flavors plus the house flavor.  I ordered the early bird special for myself - 2 Donuffles and a coffee.  The wait was about 30 minutes, and they were apologetic for that, but they worked on my order the entire time. It just takes a while to cook so many waffles. No apologies necessary!

My only critique is that I asked multiple times that the Donuffles be cut in half since I was taking them to share at work. They forgot to cut some of them and had to go back and do that, which added a little more time to my wait.  They also did not separate my order from the Donuffles for my co-workers, which I would have preferred.  Afterward, when I was leaving, one of the gentleman said to the other \"we'll probably never see that lady again.\"  Rest assured, I will be back!  The Donuffles were a big hit at the office, and overall the service was good.  Also, thank you for taking the time to write the individual flavors on each box."}
{"text":"We decided to get some brunch before heading out of Cleveland. Walking into the place, I immediately felt happier due to the brightness and heart decorations all over the place (it reminded me of Valentine's day, but it's August!)

The donuffles! What a fun idea. They're a cross between a donut and a waffle, and you can choose your own flavor of glaze - I chose chocolate espresso and loved it. The iced coffee was too sweet for me, but I still drank the whole thing. My mom got an omelet and a side if smoked salmon and enjoyed both. The staff was also friendly and the prices low... if I lived in the area I'd bring all my friends here!"}

I'm no restaurant mogul, but that's crap service to not open your restaurant for business."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today. I ordered the chicken and waffles, and went with the cinnamon waffle as recommended by the young lady taking my order. My food came out very quickly and the young lady was very pleasant. I was impressed she remembered my name from our brief interaction. Halfway through my meal, the owner came over to check on me. He seemed like a nice man, as did the rest of his staff. The waffle was delicious and the chicken was good. My only call-out was that I left a bit hungry, but I'll just have to order more next time."}
{"text":"First of all this place smells amazing!  They make everything from scratch and the service and the food are exceptional! 

We ordered a bunch of stuff to try and the donuffles were so good!  The cookies and cream and the maple bacon especially.  The chicken and waffles were also really good as well!  

Since it was our first time there, Phil took the time to walk us through the menu and thanked us for giving it a try.  

We took food to go but there are plenty of tables and a great atmosphere too!"}
