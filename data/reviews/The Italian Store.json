{"text":"I've only come here once for lunch with my friend and found the food to be average/mediocre. We came before noon in hopes of beating the lunch rush and getting first dibs on the food but I was disappointed that their eggplant parmigianna was not available. It was the only thing I really wanted to try but instead settled for their gnocchi as they had very limited choices. We also got two slices of pizza, a cabbage roll, and a few pastries.   I found the gnocchi to be pretty bland but the pizza was ok and I quite liked the cabbage roll. The pastries were ok but I wish they had more variety as the fridge was half empty. Overall, it's not a place that I'd go out of my way to eat at again."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Italian grocery store in Calgary. Their prices are pretty reasonable for the most part and the food is pretty fresh. I usually go there to buy fresh pizza dough. It's about $2.50 or so for a 1 lb bag. One bag can make at least 2-3 medium size thin crust pizzas.  They have very good selection of quality italian cold cuts and cheeses. As well, their fresh herbs are very good priced. They also sell some gourmet frozen pasta. They also have a huge selection of grocery items that are at a fair price too.  They also have a cafe selection with a variety of hot food items that you can eat there. I've never tried the hot foods yet.  A lot of local Italians frequent this place so that's a very good sign. I usually like to go to places where the people \"in-the-know\" go."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes. I heard great things. The menu all looked so good. I finally settled on the lasagna because who doesn't love a good lasagna? Well, I think it has been sitting there for at least Infinity years, because the noodles were completely soaked through. It was basically a pile of wet flour. There was almost no meat. And stingy with the cheese.   So disappointing. So gross. Never again. I might never eat lasagna again. It's now ruined for me. I would've given only one star, except that the calzones looked pretty. I should've gotten one of those instead."}
{"text":"Now that I have eaten most of the things I bought at the Italian Store, I can provide a bit of an update.   Pear and gorgonzola ravioli: Big dissapointment. I feel like the package was mislabelled and all I got were raviolies filled with ricotta cheese.   Fresh pizza dough: Great!! I was able to make three 10\" to 12\" dia thin crust pizzas. I made two immediately, and then froze the remaining dough and made the third pizza the following weekend. Dough is very good, and I even got the previously frozen dough to bubble up when I cooked it on a pizza stone.   Lemon shell filled with lemon sorbet: Amazing. Worth every penny!  I'm still a fan of the Italian Store."}
{"text":"A must stop destination for Calgary food lovers. Call it Scarpone's, call it the Italian Store, call it Great West importers, whatever you want to call it, this is the place for your Italian staples and a few otherwise impossible to find items.   Shopping here, at the importer/wholesaler means you'll cut out the middleman (grocery store or specialty store) and pretty much always find the lowest price here.   The selection of deli meat and cheese isn't  quite as varied as some of the other shops, but the price can not be beat and the quality is top notch.   Our weekly stop and shop almost always includes: dried tortellini for soup (at $1.50 per bag less than the center street Italian shops), a couple cans of fire-roasted tomatoes (a pantry staple), a block if pecorino or parmigiana (at a phenomenal price), great dried pasta, a couple bags of Let's Pasta frozen butternut squash or pear and Gorgonzola ravioli (the only place to find this awesome Lethbridge produced product in Calgary), bulk sausage meat (bagged without a casing), various nut and olive oils, cured meats (including the only cured hog jowl, guanciale, I've seen in western Canada)...the list goes on.  The attached lunch counter has a great selection of hot items, though you'll want to get there early to avoid the lunch rush.  The only thing I'd still go elsewhere for is baking. While generally pretty good (especially the Italian donuts), cannoli and other sweets are certainly not the best in the city."}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time...nothing special they have a little deli with food in warmer for hours stuff to make you sock prices are not cheap if you want the quality cold cut.I find the Italian store on Edmonton trail much better and much cheaper.i will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"All around great Italian food place to visit.  I always stop by here when in Calgary!"}
{"text":"One of Calgary's best kept secrets is the Italian Store in the skyline area of Calgary (right next to the old WestJet head office off of Deerfoot and McKnight).   I used to work a few blocks from here and make lunchtime pilgrimages here at least a few times a week. They have a little lunch area with fab-u-lous daily specials, not to mention Italian donughts, fresh baking and a great gelato selection.   Now, on the shopping side you will find all sorts of imported goodies and food for what are most likely the best prices in the city. (Sorry Lina's, I love you but...) Since they are affiliated with Scarpones (right next door), there is ample selection, plus everything else you can imagine. Their kitchen gadgets are also affordable prices, as is the crockery.   Their produce is always beautiful, the fresh-frozen selection is simply to die for. Many of the sauces and other items are made in-house.   Gluten-free heaven here as well, which is surprising to some. The corn pasta selection here is out of this world and CHEAP!!! Looking for gluten-free farfalle or lasagna noodles? Check. Also, looked at some of the snacks and found a pizza-flavoured crunchy snack that doesn't have all the crap in it that I can't eat!   I could go on and on about how friendly the staff are, and how they are always well stocked. My suggestion is that you just go!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to The Italian Store (aka Scarpone's) for many years now for their amazing lunch and their unbelievable selection of items in the attached grocery store. Very simply put, it's a great place to stop for lunch if you're in the area for some delicious Italian food. The pastas and gnocchi are top notch with the perfect tooth and tangy homemade sauce. Soups are also very good and they change daily.  Later in the week, they also make arancini (fried risotto balls), tasty and crispy with that fluffy, creamy interior that you get from a really good risotto. All in all, the lunch here is solid and I am still a fan.  The grocery store carries imported items from Italy and Europe. With a full deli, they also offer a plethora of meats and gourmet cheeses for whatever you crave. If you get there early, they also sell freshly baked foccacia that are still warm and aromatic from the fresh rosemary and olive oil. Grab one of those and some dried chorizo and thank me later.   If you're a home winemaker, they also sell supplies for whatever you need. In fact, they have a lot of everything for the home or professional kitchen. I love to visit and just poke around the store to see what's new.   Pros: Great lunch selection of homemade food, an awesome deli Cons: Lunch can get busy around noon Overall: a great experience. Take your time."}
{"text":"Very good place to do much of your Italian grocery shopping. Although I don't get into the meat & cheese deli much, generally shop for pasta, pasta sauce ingredients, fresh herbs, chinotto soda (Stappi), bulk nuts and Italian coffee beans, and great dark chocolate (favour Whittakers from NZ).   On their cafeteria side they offer varied hot Italian dishes and cold items like sandwiches and pastries, and delicious true gelato in various Italian flavours. In general the food prepared there is not all that great (maybe it sits on the steam trays too long), but is adequate for lunch that has some Italian authenticity.  The pleasant old guy who sometimes walks the floor is the original owner, and at least one of his daughters works the tills, who also is most helpful in pointing out her favourite pasta noodles, etc. for purchase.  Not unlike Lina's, Scarpone's store adds flavour to the continuing eclectica of the city."}
{"text":"Great Italian store to find most things you like Italian... We went there looking for Burrata? cheese to put on our balsamic vinegar?, basil covered tomatoes. Burrata is so much more soft and creamy. Not too much there and it was expensive. Looking for better and fresh if anyone knows. We had a fantastic lunch of gnochi and minestrone soup with Italian sausage and bought some great cold cuts for a reasonable price, Great store and caring people. Also.. I almost forgot. You can pick up the best spaghetti?  sauce made by them. We  bought a few."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian market was there for the first time the other day they will be only Italian store from now on makes the one on 20th look like a dump. Huge selection of products if your going to buy Italian this is the place to go!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"As my fiance is from Bosnia, we frequent any store that sells European foods.  The Italian Store is a regular stop, as the prices aren't too astronomical, and the selection is usually consistent.  Anyone who has had to shop for European foods will tell you that consistency is a nightmare.  While understandable given the import/export industry and their mess on a good day, it's still very frustrating to not find what you saw last week.  The Italian Store excels at keeping a consistent stock of various items.  They always seems to have the feta cheese we like (yellow bucket, red lid, no idea what it's called).  And they have a lot of the deserts from my fiance's home country.  Now The Italian Store also has deli items, although we've never purchased any.  They also have a sit-in eatery, which we've also never enjoyed.  But both sections are routinely busy, so they must be doing something right.  If you're looking for European or Italian foods, The Italian Store should be your first stop!"}
{"text":"I love The Italian Store! I go there weekly for there freshly sliced cheese (love the provolone and European Swiss) and deli meat (love the mortadella); fresh eggs and house made pesto (found in the frozen food section. Great for pasta, salad dressing and on a sandwich). Their house made gelato is incredible! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because they don't always have gelato available."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in awhile but was drawn to return because I noticed that they put up an exterior sign that you can actually read from northbound Deerfoot Trail.  I walked in this afternoon and was excited to see that the store has undergone some major renovations.  They have modernized the deli, lunch counter, Cappuccino & Gelato Bar and the check-out tills.  It looks great and even though it has lost a bit of that old, authentic Italian feel, I'm more enticed to eat here.    The lunch counter was putting away the hot food around 3:15pm so I decided to buy a Tiramisu cup.  It wasn't as good as I'd expected and thought it was overpriced.  I'd recommend getting a slice or purchasing a cake instead.  This doesn't impact my overall impression and suggest you check it out if you've never been or haven't seen the upgrades.  Anytime I've stopped by it's proven not to be the zoo that Lina's Italian Market can be."}
{"text":"A great one-stop shop for groceries and a quick bite to eat.  If you are in need of Italian food this is a good place to know of.  They have a small cafeteria style area with hot foods served daily.  There's a decent selection of Italian subs, salads and even a couple of pastas.  The lasagna is a popular one as it can sell out if you're not early.  Most people take lunch to go so there's most likely a seat available even at the most busy of lunch hour rushes.  There is a deli and pastry counter with a good selection of goods.  I had the best pecan tart I've ever tasted here.  Also, their deli meats are vast.  The grocery section isn't huge by any means but you'll be able to find everything you need to cook a typical Italian dish.  All in all it's a good place. It would have gotten 5-stars had they more parking stalls.  If you're there in a lunch hour expect to park on the main road."}
{"text":"They sell all my favourite Italian products - my San Marzano tomatoes, my chemical free beans, and Illy Espresso Pods!   The trek out is always a pain, but if you make a morning or afternoon out of it, it can be quite lovely.   They have delicious lunch service as well for great prices.  You can get a sausage or veal on a bun with lots of meat, sauce, and veggies.  They also have great prices on their fresh pizzas.   My favourite though?  An Italian donut and their nutella cappuccino.   I think about it constantly.    They make a great fresh pizza dough as well that I frequently buy - makes for a yummy pizza.   Their cheese is also much cheaper than anywhere else I've been, as well as their gnocchi.    They are my benchmark for Italian canned goods and other products, I can't go anywhere else now."}
