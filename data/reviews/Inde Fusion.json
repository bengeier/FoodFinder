{"text":"The food was very good.  Great flavor not just spicy.  Give this new restaurant a try.  My wife and I went for Happy Hour great cocktails, and appetizers.  We liked it so much that we took home food for our kids.  And they loved it too."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! And the Best Shrimp and Grits I have ever had. A nicely seasoned bowl of grits with succulent large shrimp perfectly prepared teamed with a salad is a complete light meal.   Recently redone with a nice bar area. Good happy hour with nice wine selection but the name I think is a bit misleading. Although they have several Indian items I wouldn't expect the traditional fare. Nice selection of mixed Asian/Indian/Mexican had to add that as the tres leches cake is something I would go back for."}
{"text":"Their menu claims many items are vegetarian but actually have fish and oyster sauce in them. The waitress testily said that they still qualified as vegetarian. I suggested she was mistaken."}
{"text":"The ambience is beautiful and the food is great and so unlike anything else in the area. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Food was really good. My gf had the cioppino which she loved, and I had the tandori steak tacos, and we started with calamari. All of which was really good. The cocktails are for sure the highlight. While the gimlet is a bit small for the $9 price, it is damn tasty. I think between us, we had almost all of their cocktails, and they were all really good. The one with chai infused bourbon was as perfect as any cocktail I've had in the valley, and I'll be back for that very soon."}
{"text":"Great place!  We stopped in for Social Hour.  The teas were excellent.  We actually didn't hit any actual entree but did appetizers instead.  The tacos were delicious- we got the combo which gives you chicken, steak, and shrimp.  The Spinach and Cheese dip we would probably not get again, we had just been hummused and guaced out, but we'd definitely go for one of those next time.  And the pad thai was very good as well.  Oh yeah, and we had creme brulee for dessert which was great as well!  Also, our server was a super sweet girl (but I forget her name :( but she looks like JLaw)."}
{"text":"We had the good fortune to get to try this new restaurant and we were not disappointed!  We sat at the bar for happy hour and I swear, I think we had one of everything, it was that good.   The staff is super friendly and we were able to meet the owner of the restaurant, Rupesh, and had a lovely chat with him.  The food is expertly prepared, it's delicious, and I could eat here every day.  For those of you that might be afraid it's too spicy or too much of a cultural mashup , be assured that there's a pro working in the kitchen and you won't be disappointed with the flavors.  As in Goldilocks, the blending of the flavors is the \"bowl  that's just right\"!!!! Leave your passport at home and go enjoy the flavors of Inde-fusion, this place is on its way to being a staple of the restaurant scene."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for happy another one of those common themed days when I'm too hungry to cook after work. It is fairly new so the place was pretty empty but it was GORGEOUS!!! It's so nicely decorated and modern and inviting! I loved just looking around.  I sat at the bar and ordered the salmon croquettes and chicken soup. So, to be fair, I went safe with the menu. I also ordered their signature cocktail mule, it was very good.  My meal had a tremendous amount of flavor. They made chicken noodle soup so extraordinary it was delicious I could eat that everyday for lunch. The portion was just right to accompany either an entree or hearty app. I chose the hearty app with the salmon croquette. It was so tasty and even though I was full, I ate each and every one :-). Yum!!! The sauce that went w the salmon was also very flavorful.  I should mention that while full of flavor, it was not confused. It was a very deliberate mix of spices and ingredients. It was very \"vanilla\" for Indian food, so if you want a small step into this cuisine then definitely check out Indo Fusion."}
{"text":"We decided to come in for dinner one night after I had to drop something off at my company's office in Scottsdale.  I ordered a VIP Cosmo and was not impressed - not well mixed and tasted of cheap vodka.  We ordered the cheesy masala tater tots to share as a starter and again were not impressed...too much fried breading instead of potato.  For my entree, I opted for the island pork rice bowl - pork was kind of dry, but the rest of the dish was pretty flavorful and good.  They offered live music, but it didn't fit the setting...would have preferred to see a flamenco guitarist instead.  Hopefully it was just an off night and they can work out all of the kinks!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. This place is very nice and trendy. I will be coming back again with a big group or maybe even for Happy Hour!!  I did come with a group of 8 and we had the big table that was in a private area. It was beautiful.  One of the walls had this long fireplace that was recessed into the wall. Our server Jeff was so sweet and helpful with the menu.  I have not had much experience with this kind of cuisine before and everything I tried was very good and seasoned to perfection.  Started out with the spinach and cheese dip with slices of naan bread. I could have that all the time.   our friends had the hummus and said it was great. I ordered the tandoori flatbread. The tandoori chicken was tender.  I really enjoyed it. I couldn't stop there, I had to have dessert. I ordered the chocolate and vanilla cheesecake. Like the other food I had, the cheesecake was great. All of the food had great presentation.  Oh the wine list was wonderful, it looked like the owner took some time putting that together.  Speaking of the owner, Rupesh, was very nice. He stopped by our table before we all got our meal started and was introduced to our crazy group. Such a gentleman, he pushed in my seat as I sat down.  You won't be disappointed when you come to Inde Fusion."}
{"text":"I adore this place!!! I love the ambience, the live music is great, & the staff is all very nice & knowledgable.  I have tried many of their items, & have loved them all... My fav thus far is the Shrimp & Grits, but the Cioppino was delish as well.  I had them add grilled lobster to the Thai Noodles & to the Fried Rice & was SOOOOOO tasty!!!! The Indie Salad is very refreshing for lighter fare, & the Red Bell Pepper Soup was yum.  Planning to be back soon, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Inde Fusion is a newly opened restaurant in the Gainey Ranch Area of Scottsdale. Inde Fusion offers a blend of American, Italian, Asian, Mexican and Mediterranean dishes prepared with Indian Spices and Indian preparations. The atmosphere is very swank and attractive. It's roomy and comfortable and stunning lanterns accent the space.  If you drink hot tea you must order the hot tea here as it was one of the highlights of my visit. They bring you a glowing box of  high end organic teas for you to sniff and they get served in an interesting pristine clean vessel.  Not all but much of the food is served tapas style meaning small plates that you share. We shared two appetizers and split one lunch plate.  We started with salmon croquettes. These were absolutely delicious and were my favorite plate of what I tried for lunch. They were wonderfully flavorful and the raita sauce complimented them to perfection.  Next came Szechuan Chicken Lollipops. They had a very unique crisp oil free coating that I liked and it had some heat to it. The chicken was cooked nicely and got it's flavor from the crust. It would have been elevated if it came with a sauce that was like real Szechuan Sauce instead of the same raita sauce that the salmon croquettes came with. I note that this might have been an opening hiccup as the dish was described differently on the online menu.  After we finished with the Chicken Lollipops the Tandoori Chicken Sandwich arrives. It's a good size sandwich for splitting. It was ok but different from what I was expecting. Usually tandoori is marinated and very flavorful chicken that's seasoned with cayenne, chili, turmeric and paprika. We got a nicely cooked but plain chicken with a mint chutney on a very fresh roll. I used the Sriracha Aioli to zip it up. Maybe this is an example of when sometimes fusion turns to confusion. I did find the masala fries extremely delicious and additive.  I was so looking forward to trying the chocolate fondant for dessert. It was presented in an attractive fashion and was made with good quality chocolate and laced with a nice orange accent but wasn't a fondant dessert that I was expecting. A fondant is a French kind of Molten Lava Cake or sometimes called a pudding. The fondant I received was a sugar paste cake and was a mound of very good frosting but not a dessert called a fondant.   There is SO MUCH POTENTIAL for this restaurant to be five stars.  The service was exceptional. The atmosphere is wonderful and great! The food is cooked well and everything was good but somethings could use some tweaking to be special and memorable.  Some of the fusion is confusion.  I do note that this restaurant is newly opened and may have a few hiccups and may be tweaking the menu.  They offer a very interesting unique concept with great potential.  3 stars is a positive review and is defined on Yelp as A-OK.   This restaurant is worth a try!  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Truly good! I got the chicken fingers and fries (because I am such a picky person) and I found them truly appetizing! The fries are made perfectly and the chicken. Is outstanding, the crispness is mouth watering! I would eat there again!"}
{"text":"Inde Fusion was absolutely fantastic! It's still new and it's in a quiet retail center off the beaten path so it wasn't that crowded. The food was so delicious and creative that I really hope people discover it to keep them around so we can go back again and again to try some different dishes!"}
{"text":"It is a very beautiful remodel. There are two problems. It's a jinxed location. Also it's an ill conceived concept. Indie Confusion!! There is no identity and no direction. The food is fair to ok. I wish them luck, but they probably will not survive past the summer.  You needed to capture the Gainey Ranch customer and you failed.               Rest in peace."}
{"text":"Must try this place. Owner Rupesh proudly presents \"American classics infused with eastern spices and flavors\". Some of the most delicious dishes are the ribs, the ravioli, and shrimp and grits. Not like anything else I've ever had. This was a good find and I'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"2nd to go order: DAMN THIS FOOD IS GOOD.  We ordered the baby back ribs and they were simmered in Thai spices. Oh. Em. Gee. Sooooo tender and delish. Spicy goodness. The kids chicken strips are huge. The masala fries were perfection.   This food is legit."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in the Gainey Ranch area.  They did a beautiful remodel and the new space looks fantastic.  I sat at the bar and had a chicken sandwich with fries.  The Indian spices on the chicken were delicious without being overpowering.  The fries were hot and crispy and the siracha aoli dipping sauce was yummy.  The owner, Rupesh, did a great job taking care of me with friendly and efficient service.  I'd like to come back again and try more menu items because several of them sound particularly interesting.  They also have a good wine and beer selection to pair with the food."}
{"text":"We stopped by Inde Fusion to sample several dishes to see how we liked the new restaurant. We greatly enjoyed all the dishes we tried and their noodle dish was one of the best we have ever had. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and lounge in the Gainey Ranch area. We had the tandori chicken and it was moist and wonderfully prepared. Great wine selection, too. Just a great neighborhood restaurant and lounge."}
{"text":"Brand new Indian Fusion cuisine in the heart of Gainey!  I came on opening day, so I expected there to be some hiccups, which there were (ex. charged me for dinner salad instead of lunch....but they remedied that), but nothing that won't get fixed over practice/time.    The lunch menu is very reasonably priced for this area, which is nice, and they have a fun array of items to choose from.  I considered ordering the Naanwich (tandoori chicken sandwich with guacamole and grilled paneer cheese), or the Tandoori Shrimp flatbread, but I decided to be healthy and ordered the Inde Salad (salad with tandoori chicken, masala chickpeas and potatoes) instead.  Overall, the salad was quite nice. The chicken was juicy and flavorful, and the masala veggies were super tasty. I just wish that the dressing was something a little more exciting rather than a basic balsamic vinaigrette, hence the 1-star deduction.  I am excited to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood, and look forward to trying some of there other creations!"}
{"text":"Loved the food. Have been there twice and both times the food was excellent. The service is a bit slow but very friendly. The tater tots are unusual but crisp and delicious. The tacos are to die for. Great happy hour."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch with a friend, had the naanwhich and it was really tasty. The masala fries are very good as well. It wasn't too crowded but this  location will probably be its downfall, but the food is tasty and the service was good. They forgot one of our appetizers, But made it right by taking off the charge. One star for service, one star for atmosphere and three stars for taste."}
{"text":"Went to Inde Fusion today with a buddy of mine and had a great experience. The staff was super friendly and attentive, particularly our server, James. We even met Doug, the GM and Rupesh, the owner -- both really nice guys! I had the Blackened Salmon which came with purple sweet potato mash (I've never had purple mashed potato before, but they were really good) and mango salsa, a nice complement. The salmon was well-cooked and tender with great flavor from the masala spice rub. I would definitely recommend checking out Inde Fusion and do know that it's not traditional Indian food. It really is a fusion!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here and the atmosphere is absolutely beautiful. I love the older movies playing above the bar! The pumpkin cashew ravioli was incredible and the wine and beer selection is on point. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and my server, Marie, was fantastic. What a lovely addition to this neighborhood! Can't wait to bring my friends here!"}
{"text":"The flavors were out of this world and very intense as opposed to spicy. The spices were very singular and differentiated in every taste. The menu is very varied and eclectic with influences from many different regions of the world. The service by Stephanie was impeccable, sweet and very attentive.  We shared a few dishes including a Tandoori chicken flatbread, shrimp fried rice and minced lamb ravioli. All three dishes were outstanding in every way with very distinct flavors and personalities.  The owner Rupesh stopped by our table numerous times to check on us. He was very gracious, welcoming and kind. He wanted to make sure we were taken  care of and happy with our overall experience."}
{"text":"We are always eager to try a new Indian (or Indian inspired) restaurant, particularly one that is close to where we live, so we were eager to try Inde Fusion.  I guess I can sum it up by saying it was pretty good, but not great.  On the plus side, the restaurant is attractive, and the staff were very polite and accommodating.  The food, however, was a mixed bag.  Based upon other reviews, we started with the salmon croquettes.  They were worthless.  Just a tasteless mush with some nondescript raita sauce on the side.  You should skip them.  My wife had the cashew and pumpkin ravioli.  I snuck a taste and they were okay, but they were served lukewarm at best.  I don't know why restaurants don't understand that hot food taste best when it is actually served hot, but they don't.  As to the flavors, it is a clever idea to mash up various cuisines, but my wife thought the masala sauce was just too discordant for the ravioli.  On the other hand, I had the Salmon with the purple mashed potatoes.  The salmon was a nice size, and cooked just as requested.  It was very enjoyable.  So was the mango salsa on the side.  But the signature purple mashed potatoes were a disappointment.  Yes, they tasted pretty good, with a certain sweetness, but they were thick and heavy like glue.  So, overall, I would rate the restaurant somewhere between okay and good.  We will probably go back to try some of their other items.  In the meantime, we will continue to rely on Marigold Maison and Jewel in the Crown for more traditional Indian food."}
{"text":"A very gorgeous restaurant located in the Gainey Ranch neighborhood. The owner, chef, and staff were super courteous and friendly. I highly recommend the Kofta wontons with minced chicken, marsala spice, topped with mango salsa. The combination of savory from the chicken and the sour sweet taste from the mango salsa were a perfect marriage for a starter dish. The presentation is too beautiful to eat. For the main dish, I LOVED the Blackened Indian seasoning shrimps over grits, I'm not sure if this is the exact name on the menu, but this is what I'm calling it. The shrimps were seasoned with combination spices from India, and the grits, ahhhh, the oh so wonderful grits. It tasted like heaven in my mouth. So creamy and rich with India spices. The deserts were delicious, but they were more traditional American then India inspired. Both the brownie topped with ice cream, and the deconstructed strawberry shortcake were amazingly delicious, I would like to have tried something that were more, how should I say it, Inde Fusion (pun intended). Overall, I give this place a 4.5 stars They will get the last 0.5 from me when I see more out of my comfort zone desserts. Keep it up guys. You are definitely on the right track. Thank you for the fantastic dinner."}
