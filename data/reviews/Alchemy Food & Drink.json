{"text":"We went for the grand opening this past weekend for one of MasterChef Canada's contestants. It was fairly lively, both inside and outside in the patio, and we had no issues getting seated right away. Though live music was promoted on their Instagram, we must've left early and well before the live music began.

For drinks, we ordered from their themed cocktail menu, categorized based on the elements. The drinks are twists on some classics and reasonably priced at $12-13. To start, we shared the Fried Chicken & Latkes ($12), and we all loved it. The chicken was breaded and seasoned nicely, and not greasy at all. But the star of the dish was the gravy, and not  single trace of gravy was not left on the plate! 

I ordered the Mac & Cheese ($13) for myself and added kimchi ($2) to it, while my friends got the Smash Burger ($14) and the Pulled Beef Po Boy ($14). Initially, I thought the portion of the Mac & Cheese was small, but halfway through my meal, I started to get full. There wasn't any kimchi in the Mac & Cheese, and when I brought it to the server's attention, it was given to me on the side. Note: their kimchi is deep fried! I'm not quite sure if the dish is supposed to be made with the kimchi mixed into it, or as a garnish on top of the dish, or served on the side. The Mac & Cheese was pretty mild, and the kimchi wasn't that spicy.

Overall, an okay meal. A delicious appetizer, an average entree, and good drinks, in a pretty low-key spot with a nice patio. I'm curious to see if the menu changes up over the months, and I'm willing to pay them another visit."}
{"text":"We only ordered sharables and basically chat all night. The chicken is phenomenal but the plate is not so much. Bread too hard, salami or other pickled stuff the flavour is too strong, cold cut meats all sticking together. But their glasses are cute. Will definitely visit again and try their mac n cheese since everybody all recommending it."}
{"text":"Arguably the best cocktail program I've come across in the last twelve months. Kitchen is tremendous, the fried chicken and latkes dish is outstanding, definitely a can't-miss. The burger was a nice surprise, significantly better than the everyday bar burger. Excellent service, great food, 10/10"}
{"text":"Listen up people, this is important. I would never joke about this. Alchemy, you are full of surprises. I'm happy to say they are now serving brunch and it is deeeeelicious!

I was searching for some brunch spots and I was stoked to find out they are serving breakfast options on the weekend starting at 11 am. What a pleasant surprise!

I walked by a few spots that were completely crammed. Since Alchemy's brunch menu is just a few weeks old, it hasn't quite been discovered yet so there was lots of seating.

I ordered a mimosa, obviously (which are on special during brunch) and the loaded Breakfast poutine. It was the perfect size for breakfast with fries, gravy, cheese, hollandaise sauce, green onions and two perfectly poached eggs on top. It had great taste and I find myself looking back at the photos wishing I could eat it again. 

My friends all got the breakfast sandwich and it was huge! It came loaded with strips of beautifully thick cut bacon and you could get a side salad or fries with it. Their fries are killer if you didn't know that already. 

The brunch menu is small but that's Alchemy's style. They do the things they do WELL! The music they were playing was perfect for brunch. Such a relaxing time as always! 

Check them out soon, your table is waiting!"}
{"text":"Opened on 19th July 2017 - with a team from Masterchef Canada 2017. 

We had a great experience - interesting cocktails and really tasty food. We had the deep fried chicken and the jalapeño poppers to share - could have ordered another appetizer between 3 of us - but the tasters left us ready for our entrees. 

My son had the burger - which he rated as one of his top 5 ever - (I'm hoping the other 4 were from my BBQ ). My daughter and I had the pulled beef po boy which was delicious - and the fries were to die for. 

Good luck with the restaurant guys - so far so good!"}
{"text":"I visited Alchemy with a friend for a post-work meal and a drink on a warm Wednesday evening. Picked the spot because its new and was curious about the latest business to occupy this space since Fat City Blues peaced out and because it has a great side patio. 

Alchemy has kicked up the previous owner's patio game with comfy seat cushions and throw pillows and a few red umbrellas. Noting this, I immediately decided I'd be back for at least another patio hang before the summer months conclude. 

The drink list here is great for this plan too. A number of interesting sounding cocktails, a decent beer and wine list, plus a few rotating local guest taps. 

For food, we opted for a few sharing items. The charcuterie board, the stuffed jalapeños and warm olives, and the special for the day: tomato bruschetta with whipped goat cheese and balsamic. Standouts were the stuffed jalapeños (loved the crunchy addition of pine nuts in these) and the bruschetta (fresh and tasty in their well well-marinated goodness, plus goat cheese is always a good idea am I right?). The charcuterie board was good but I wasn't blown away. The selection on it changes a bit from time to time, so I'd be willing to give it another go and see what it comes with next time. 

Random little note: all three dishes we ordered came with the same grainy bread. It was delicious bread, don't get me wrong, but I would have enjoyed a little variety on this end. 

And finally, a special shout-out to our server. She was very helpful and knowledgeable, and just the right amount of attentive. A+ for her."}
