{"text":"Even though they might be a little pricey for donuts, they are pretty damn good.  Not oily like a lot of places, very fluffy and light.  So I don't mind paying their prices.  

They are also very hospitable, they make you feel very welcome and go a little beyond the 'how are you' which goes miles for customers.  They genuinely want your business. All round a great place to grab a snack or coffee.  Not a large selection but what they have is done well.  Going to be a go to from now on."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas and looking for breakfast. So found this place. The donuts are amazingly good. It is in the same parking lot as the famous pawn store. The only thing is there is no place to sit down. It is only a small counter"}
{"text":"Almost every morning I'm home I wander over to get my usual, Quad shot Illy latte!  

Pawn Coffee & Donut is located in the new Pawn Plaza container park.   They serve great coffee and THE BEST apple fritter... I am also now addicted to their cronut (croissant/donut)."}
{"text":"Doooooooonnnuuuttsssssss!! Love me some  Pawn Donuts! After going to Pawn Stars Gold and Silver Pawn Shop we stopped by for an afternoon coffee and donut. Cool little shop with great donuts. Also had a blast from the blast Boylan soda! A must stop !"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see this place carried my personal favorite - Sugar Raised Donut. Some shops don't even know what that is :( They have a pretty good selection with classics and seasonal favorites. You can't go wrong with Illy coffee to pair. Friendly staff, fresh donuts, fantastic coffee."}
{"text":"Donut fix achieved. Maple bar is solid. Croxnut is just right. Small shop but pleasantly surprised. Serves illy coffee which is a definite plus. Check it out while you're downtown!"}
{"text":"The donuts were interesting in selection and pretty tasty. Nothing fantastic, but a good snack. It was better than anything we got at Carlos Bakery. I would try something else."}
{"text":"Located at the new Pawn Plaza, this coffee and donut spot is TINY! Required city signage on the wall states the maximum occupancy is THREE. Grab and go or at least take your goods outside to the provided seating. Don't forget your wallet on the counter, which will probably be empty after the prices here...

Shop offers a case of fresh-made donuts in traditional flavors (sprinkle, chocolate cake, glazed), seasonal options and specialties (such as an Elvis-themed chocolate-PB-banana option, maple-bacon bars, cronuts), as well as \"holey moley!\" donut holes, and apple fritters- the latter of which seems to be a hit, seeing as how the three men ahead of me in line ordered them in quick succession, rendering me unable to sample them myself.

Opted for a cronut, which had great texture, though unevenly-applied glaze flaked off like dandruff all over the table rather than inside each bite. I did enjoy the light sweetness. Sprinkled donut ($1.50) was very average, did not seem the freshest despite my 10AM arrival, less than 3 hours after opening. There were two flavors of donut holes available (5/$3): the chocolate was dry and flat sans any glaze (arguably the best part!), but the red velvet was nicely glazed and seemed the freshest of my sampled items, though light on the chocolate flavors.

Service was friendly- my soy latte was made quickly and correctly, and they had no problem accommodating my last-minute check-in offer (2 free donut holes). Don't forget to redeem yours!"}
{"text":"Oh the Maple bacon to die for...  Great service and fresh selection of donuts!  I'm definitely referring others to come here!"}
{"text":"Amazing donut shop ! Try the apple fritter ... it's nice and light. This place also serves illy coffee. This is a must \"see and check out\" drop in downtown Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We came later on in the day, so donut choices were sparse. But the customer service made up for it ten fold. The lady helping us was super fun and relax and immediately made us feel welcome. She made me a drink that she said she makes herself everyday and it was very well made and delicious. I enjoy being able to converse with people who really seem genuine. I'm definitely going to go back so I can get a dozen donuts and hopefully have another great experience."}
{"text":"The best part about this place is the two free donut holes you get with a Yelp check-in. 

You'll find all the basics here, glazed, sprinkled and cake doughnuts along with a few more \"modern\" flavors, a Crouxnut, PB&J Donut, Matcha donut, plus a smattering of other unique flavors. The shop is very small with the only seating available outside on the communal patio area. The coffee option here is \"Illy\" brand, which isn't anything really spectacular, but good enough for donut dunking.

I sampled the PB&J, the S'more, and a Crouxnut. The PB&J was like a trip back down memory lane, full of recess and lunchtime memories. This donut is comically loaded with jelly, with every bite literally squirting out jelly in every which way. It was like the Peter North of jelly donuts. 

The S'more was my favorite. Great chocolate flavor, a nice roasted marshmallow crunch on top and filled with an east coast favorite, Marshmallow Fluff. This donut is pretty big and worth it to share.

The Crouxnut, was good, but nothing like an actual, \"Cronut\" which make sense, because the original recipe and name has since been trademarked. This deep fried dream was more like a flaky cinnamon roll, than a \"Cronut\". That being said it was still pretty good. 

Pawn Donut and Coffee is good, but not great. I would have to pass four other solid donuts shops before I even arrived to the front of door of this place. It's just not worth the trip for me. 


The next time I'm here will most likely be when nana is in town and she wants a, \"unique Vegas experience\"."}
{"text":"I was tricked into going to PDC by photos featured on Eater.  I say tricked because when we arrived, none of the playful, creative donuts are featured there.  Yes, there was a cronut knockoff (long live Chef Dominique Ansel!), a smores donut, a PBJ donut. But there was only one dount that appealed to children - a panda shaped donut made with Oreo's.  

The donuts were decent, if a bit pricey, but if you are not the only person in line you should expect to wait a while.  Service is slow... sloth paced.  I don't know exactly why it takes so long to place a pre-made donut into a paper bag, but apparently it is a long process.  I have been known to wait a long time for a good donut (Gourdough's in Austin comes to mind), but these donuts are not made to order.  And if you want a coffee, prepare to get a seat outside while you wait.  As a bonus, while you are sitting outside you can soak in all the great BBQ smells coming from Rick's BBQ joint located right next door.

The coffee shop is part of the Pawn Stars shopping center/container park located in the parking lot of the pawn shop, and this makes parking a challenge.  ON busy days you might want to park somewhere nearby and take a short walk to the mall."}
{"text":"Pretty solid doughnuts!

I have a donut, doughnut, deep fried anything problem, and I found the donuts here solid. We ordered the crouxnut (croissant and donut) and maple bar.  We used that pretty sweet check in offer to get some donut holes.  The crouxnut was my favorite-flaky, rich dough, sweet and just nice to sink your teeth into.  Definitely would have been better warmed, damn, forgot to ask for a microwave- d'oh! 

I only sampled the maple bar, and I didn't feel like there was enough maple- see the aforementioned donut problem.  Solid donut again.

I didn't really like the donut holes.  Not enough chocolate.  I wish they had their regular donut in the donut holes. 

The service was awesome.  The guy behind the counter was friendly and personable.  We stopped here after checking out the pawn shop, but this is a nice donut spot not just an afterthought.  Sweet!  I'd recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"The pawn donut shop has very good coffee and the ladies thar work there are really cool nice ladies  they take excellent care of their customers"}
{"text":"Well we did the Pawn Stars show thing, which I enjoyed.  We need to kill some time until the bus came by to pick us up.  So coffee and a donut(No it's not a cop thing) it's a donut think.  These donuts were OUTSTANDING.  It's  small and hokey connection to the Pawn Stars show but this place had good good donuts and coffee.  Check in on yelp and got two yes two free donut holes.  Good too. Try the donut shop.  Thanks for not judging the cop and donut connect thing."}
{"text":"Great coffee and love the variety of classic and innovative donuts. Le Delux... le delicious."}
{"text":"This is NOT the place for your daily donut fix.  This spot is for tourists only! The donuts were overprices as expected.  I will state that they have a variety of specialty donuts, but not much in the way of the classics.  Again, this is NOT the place to be getting a dozen for the office.  The coffee was BAD and strong; strong I love, BAD not so much.  The cashier was very warm and friendly and notched two stars for the place.  This is a place for tourists or someone who happens to be in the area and needs a donut."}
{"text":"Please come early! We went here on a Monday around 11:30am and almost all the donuts were gone. That was a bit disappointing...and when they're gone they're gone since they are supplied by a outside vendor. So, we came back on a Thursday around 9am and the selection was full! The Banana Creme & the Ling Hsing ( Panda Donut w/custard are the bomb!! I will definitely come here again for a gourmet donut. They also offer coffee, hot chocolate, chai and some blended drinks as well which are good. Be prepared to spend around $3-$4 for a donut...worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Great place breakfast spot staff was amazing! I can't wait to go back already planning our next trip to this place. Donuts won't disappoint these guys will have the right combination."}
{"text":"I got the S'mores doughnut and it was amazing. They also serve Illy coffee,which is my favorite. I went on Black Friday and got amazing service. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Great casual and quick coffee shop with delicious donuts. Only been open a few months but the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"The shop is small, but it has some basic fare for a quick nosh. The girl there was very friendly and even checked upon me when I was done outside. Donut prices are reasonable, its the drinks that will get you. 

Plus it's seems to be the only open food shop around Gold & Silver Pawn before they open and the crowds get silly mad."}
{"text":"My first time here! Love the design & the donuts were great! I had the Boston Creme, Vanessa was wonderful to chat with! I def recommend Pawn Donuts."}
{"text":"Delicious and great service highly recommend!!!  Try coffee , donuts, or tea all outstanding."}
{"text":"Still love this place but closes before 5:30, even though the door says 5:30. So be aware of that. I got here at 5:15 with 15 mins to spare and it was locked. Oh well..."}
{"text":"Although I felt a bit claustrophobic by the tight parking spaces and narrow entrance in the lot that connects Pawn Donuts and Coffee with the infamous Gold and Silver Pawn Shop (from the show that's on tv), once I bit into the donut holes I immediately was glad we'd decided to venture in. We'd eaten lunch moments before at El Sombrero and my hubby wanted a donut. We said O Face, then I thought, let's try something new. SO glad we did. These are probably the best donuts I have ever had, or at least in a long, long, long time. We got the assortment of donut holes, named Holey Moley (a couple glazed, a couple powdered and one red velvet and one chocolate).  Super delicious, the dense, moist cake donut with sugary, slightly crunchy glaze was perfect. We also got an apple fritter which was outstanding, lovely chunks of cinnamon apple in a yeasty, puffy fritter, again, not too much or too little sugary glaze. 
There goes my clean eating 2016 resolution. O'well."}
{"text":"Dude couldn't even make a coffee, had to call over a chick from two places over. She made two watered down coffees. Donuts were good. Coffee not so much."}
{"text":"Pretty good donuts. The Samoa was actually amazing. The Love Me Tender was also good. Apple fritters were pretty good but nothing that special. The powdered donut holes were very light and tender. Good to try but don't know if I'd come out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"This is a small shop with a small selection, but the donuts are A-OK. They offer basics like glazed, but also interesting flavors like Banana Cream. My husband and I did note that the donuts looked identical to the donuts we had that morning from Donut Mania. The shop also offers coffee. Before 11 this will be the only place to get food or a drink at Pawn Plaza. Yelpers, don't forget to check in for the two free donut hole offer."}
{"text":"Don't go to early .... I was there at 7 am and their delivery of doughnuts hadn't gotten in yet . Their maple bacon donut was very tasty. The lady working was very pleasant and helpful . If you're in the area it's worth a pit stop ."}
{"text":"Awesome. Great donuts and great coffee in a very cool business park. Absolutely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Though it's a small selection of donuts it's a great place where the service is attentive and friendly. Pawn Place is a great place to just relax and chill for food. The donuts here are great it's always a good place!"}
{"text":"This place is actually cool, it's small and kinda in the middle of no where *unless you're coming to the pawn shop* super good customer service yeah id say if you're craving a donut or just had too much to drink and need water check this place out"}
{"text":"Nice place. We arrived a little late so the donut selection was pretty bare. Ladies are super friendly & made lots of suggestions for what they did have. Wish we could've tasted more. Will be back in the future!!!"}
{"text":"What a place! Just when you think Downtown could not get any better!  Now there is a place to get your donut and coffee fix in a unique and fun way!

I have to say the croissant donut aka \"The Crouxnut\" was amazing and mouthwatering. Best I've had in Vegas. Their donuts overall are really tasty. Just good old fashioned donuts, and some new innovative donuts to entice and intrigue your tastebuds! The dough itself makes this place stand out against other places I have tried!   So next time your in the for nostalgic craving for a Sprinkled donut, or want to WOW your mouth with something different like the Crouxnut then definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Those looking for a great donut in a sophisticated shopping container mall will be super bummed to visit Pawn Donut. This mall is ghe-tto. I had the PB&J donut. Most peanut butter used on donuts is kind of a sweetened frosting version. Here, it tastes like they just put plain peanut butter on top, straight out of the jar. The donut itself was dry and had hardly any jelly. It was gross. The mall is ugly and there were trashy people milling about. Super skitchy. Unless this sounds good to you, I would skip this place."}
{"text":"Like any coffee lover, I gotta have a pastry with their classic glazed donut, goes perfect with coffee or latte yum. Hidden gem yet?"}
{"text":"I wanted to love you so matcha, but not so much. I got googly eyes for the green glazed donut \"I love you so matcha.\" Hungry AF after a night shift, I was scarfing this green glazed donut on my drive home. It honestly did not hit the spot. Sad to say that I was not impressed. With plenty of sweet matcha treats around town, this one had the least matcha flavor, if any. I actually ordered two of these just in case I loved it. My husband tried it at home without any clue what it was. His commentary, \"what is this supposed to taste like?\" Maybe I got a bad batch, but I am definitely in no rush to try it again.

The panda face one with oreo cookies, I assumed was a cookies and cream flavor. The oreos on top for the eyes was the extent of the cookies and cream flavor. The cream inside the donut was just cream. Just a sweet, but boring donut.  I feel that the cream inside should have some crushed oreos mixed in.

The Samoa, like the Girl Scouts cookie is loaded with chocolate, coconut, and caramel. Very rich, but not too sweet.

The apple fritter was okay. No complaints.

Honorable mentions: donut holes are pretty good and FREE (with Yelp check in). Selected red velvet and chocolate. 

For the amount that I paid, I wasn't too satisfied.  It's a tiny spot in the Pawn Plaza, that you can enjoy your donuts and coffee in the outdoor seating area or taken to go.

{"text":"Probably the best donuts I've ever tasted. The apple fritters were fresh, hot and super sweet and tasty. One donut had bacon, topped with Carmel, and a drag banaa wedge, followed by a cream filling. Try this place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Pumpkin Cheesecake
The King
Raised and Glazed
Apple Fritter
Crodough
Holey Moley! Donut Holes (Red Velvet and Classic)

Located in the recently opened Pawn Plaza, a sort-off \"Container Park\" concept on South Las Vegas Boulevard near to the Shop that spawned the Show that launched the musical (that bombed) and countless other concepts comprising the Brand, it was midday Friday that a stop was made at Pawn Donut and Coffee, and with friendly attendants offering contests and coupons in the free lot a quick perusal of other eateries showed a number of familiar faces, a familiarity that actually spills over to both the fried carbohydrates and coffee roasted by Illy.

Admitting a bit of predilection to the pastry our country has always defined as a breakfast treat but only  recently rediscovered as something worthy of more artistry and attention to detail, it does not take more than a quick perusal of the PD&C website to realize the work is eerily similar to Pink Box or Donut Mania, the later actually producing the goods at owner Ralph Cautela's request as he feels their donuts are the best in The Valley.

Not particularly wowed by my lone visit to Donut Mania, the pastries themselves good enough but off-put by the owner accosting me at the door for simply snapping an exterior photo before explaining himself and telling his story, suffice it to say that options are a bit more limited at the Pawn Plaza outlet while the nod definitely goes their way for smiling service and outdoor seating, though certainly not for  pricing.

Acknowledging the address + fame-based up-sell, though still not thrilled to spend nearly $15 for six selections ranging from $1.50 Classics to $3 for 5 Donut Holes and a $2.50 Special, it was with each item bagged individually that way was made to the patio for indulgence, first bites of the cake-style red velvet a bit light in cocoa while the white version tasted like a top-tier old fashioned with great texture to the dough.

Onward to the brioche style of yeasted donuts made popular at Pink Box, though supposedly developed by Wayne at Donut Mania, a Raised and Glazed ring next proved pillowy and delicious while the layers of lamination beneath a sugary lacquer placed the much improved alt-named hybrid on par with ACE on Tropicana or Press at The Four Seasons amongst the best textured in the country.

Unfortunately finding the seasonal filled donut to be far too much cream cheese and not enough spice or pumpkin puree, it was in two more successful selections that the not-so-modest snack concluded, the fritter well constructed with lots of apples and crispy edges in the soft-centered East Coast style while The King somehow managed to balance what must have been nearly a quarter cup of peanut butter with bruleed banana and plenty of crispy bacon stuck to a dark chocolate layer on top.

***Having now visited every independent doughnuttery in Las Vegas and Henderson, the results ranging from dreadful KD's to world class ACE, Pawn Donut and Coffee is a good choice for tourists and those who happen to be in the area, though locals would be better served to experience the goods from their South Durango source where each is freshy made and a quarter or two cheaper, as well."}
{"text":"Came here late afternoon and it seemed they were out on some of the donuts. There were only a few to choose from. Got the maple bar was good but a little too sweet for me and I could only finish half. The dough was the best part it was light and fluffy and not dense or cakey. I would be happy with just the dough!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised.  Donuts are creative, and they even sell cronuts.  The iced latte was even good.  Good for you, Rick & Co!"}
{"text":"Holy moly the best donut ive had in a while!!!!!!! This is the banana cream. Sooo good. Tasted like real banana bavaiern cream, i loved it! I cant wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Small donut shop. They don't have all your donut flavors but your classics were there plus cronuts. Good if your around the pawn star shop."}
{"text":"They contract with a chain to make their donuts.  Nothing special or fresh here!  Not worth the calories or trouble to get parked."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. The peanut butter and jelly donut was the best out of what we got which included lemon Bavarian cream and maple bacon plus some donut holes. Bacon maple was probably my second choice, and it wasn't anything to rave about. Coffee was the worst out of everything. At least the servers were kind."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the prices were very reasonable considering everything here in Vegas is stupid expensive (native Houstonian here). Donuts are good too. I have nothing else to say but eat here."}
{"text":"Just went to this donut shop. So delicious! My husband and I travel a lot and this was one of our favorite donut shops. The Samoa was ridiculously amazing. The Cronut was my favorite. So buttery and delicious. The girl working there was so friendly and sweet."}
{"text":"Walked in and walked back out. Lame excuse for a doughnut shop - there wasn't any selection at all and we came early morning. What kind of a doughnut shop doesn't have chocolate doughnuts??!"}
