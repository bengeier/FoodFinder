{"text":"I'm a little blown away that this restaurant is rated so high. The food is good, the prices are fair, and the service was ignorable. It's just your regular run of the mill, hole in the wall chinese joint. No crazy special dishes or anything unexpected. I know it isn't stricly chinese but this place doesn't hold a candle to a Pei-Wei. I got the house lo mein and the Mongolian beef. Not bad but not great."}
{"text":"We frequently get delivery from New Asian Kitchen.  We are quite close to the restaurant, but the food is always very, very hot when it arrives.  Most of the time it is 20 minutes or less.  Hubby likes his Kung Pao with extra nuts and extra spicy, and they happily comply.  I tried the pot stickers last Thursday for the first time, and they were amazing.  So great, we actually ordered some for lunch today which I picked up.  The dipping sauce is wonderful.  We like the crab puffs, but maybe a little sweet.  I have tried many of the entrees.  Delivery of deep fried items like sweet and sour chicken have the sauce on the side so things stay crispy.   I love trying different dishes.  Yui shan eggplant is a new favorite.  Moo shu crepes are a delight.  They will make any dish as a dinner combination for a small fee, but well worth it.  We love homemade Chinese, but I don't always have the time or the energy.   We are lucky to have them so close!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this restaurant with a friend two nights ago. I had a beef dish and she had the egg fooyung. The portions were substantial, but the food was very bland. Not even with the aid of liberal amounts of soy sauce and hot mustard could we tease much taste out of our selections. I guess if you are looking for large helpings of some cheap carry out, then perhaps this is the place for you. Otherwise, I would suggest looking elsewhere for a sit down Chinese dinner."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this restaurant several times now. They serve sweet corn chicken soup -- a family favorite. Everything we order has been great. Most people like to pick up, however, the ambience is all right so dining in is a good idea as well. A hidden gem in the area."}
{"text":"Great food, quick, friendly and clean! Been looking for a good Chinese restaurant close to us and we feel we finally found it."}
{"text":"we have gone to many places, but we always come back here ,food is always fresh and really good,my wifes favorite is the kung poa chicken, and by far they have the best hot and sour soup any where, all i can say is try it you will like it,"}
{"text":"We've lived in this area for two years now and have tried several of the Chinese restaurants.  Tonight we tried New Asian Kitchen for the first time and we definitely have a winner!!  It's the freshest Chinese food I've seen or had in ages!  We had three different entrees; Mushroom Chicken, Orange Chicken and General Tso's Chicken.  Each were delicious, fresh, generously portioned and very affordable.  The food was even delivered in a nice, clean and branded delivery box. When have you ever seen that? New Asian Kitchen is our new fave!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We ordered lemon chicken, vegetable fried rice, crab puffs, and egg drop soup. Everything was so good. The crab puffs were the best I've had, and the fried rice was amazing, with lots of fresh vegetables. The chicken was tender and the lemon was just right,  not too overpowering. We got this to go and it was ready in 10 minutes - can't beat that for fresh, homemade food. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"this place sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i placed an order for delivery and cost was given over the phone, upon delivery my charge went up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! driver had no idea and stated he couldnt help me.!!!!!!!!!  call back to restuarant and was told that the person taking my order was a driver and had no idea??????????????????????? really??????????????????????  manager told person on phone he would credit me 5.00 off next order!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!wrong answer, i will dispute this with amex and never order from here again!!!!!!!!!!!  i hope this dont happen to you, i know it will never happen to me again, i just won't do business here again!"}
{"text":"Food is very fresh and amazing! Very clean, friendly staff, and affordable. Very glad we happened upon this place, the beef chow fun is great! We will be back!"}
{"text":"So glad to of found our new go to Chinese restaurant. Everything was AMAZING. We got egg drop soup, crab puffs, general tsao chicken, curry chicken, & noodles. Not a single complaint. We ate there, but next time will get it delivered. I overheard another guest in the restaurant saying \"we just drove across town to eat here again.\" HUGE portion sizes. We can't wait to order again!"}
{"text":"I was looking for somewhere new and Yelp came to the rescue again! Checked this place out solely based on the reviews on Yelp and I'm so happy I did!  I was tasked with buying dinner for 5 people after a day of moving, I ordered crab puffs, beef squewers for an app and Happy Family, General Tso's Chicken, Shrimp and Snow Peas, Pepper Steak and Moo Shu Pork for the main course. Every single dish was flavorful and perfectly served.....plus I got a full order of potstickers for free!!   The only thing I'd change would be more flavor for the beef squewers, although they were tender they could have been seasoned better.  I love this place and for the price it was a GREAT VALUE. Stop by and check it out!"}
{"text":"Just had delivery for 1st time yesterday and I was so happy to finally find a Chinese restaurant in the area that was good.  I have tried several over the years and usually they are way to greasy, chewy or bland. I had the Mongolian beef and I really liked it.  I had the lunch special, good price, so I also had their egg roll and crab puff.  It was all really good.  Our office ordered so we received free pot stickers with the larger order, we all enjoyed them. I will be calling them again and trying different items on the menu."}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese food place for Lunch!! Saw a picture of the pork lo mein on yelp so I decided to give my favorite Chinese food dish a try and it was perfect here, I love the veggies they put into their lo mein like zucchini, carrots, white onions, green onions, mushrooms and of course cabbage. Also want to mention the fact that their egg rolls aren't over powered with Chinese 5 spice which gives them an almost cinnamon taste to it, these egg rolls are Perfect!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food! I've been going there for years off and on trying new places that might have an interesting dish,however I always find myself going back to this little gem. The standards for me are roast pork fried rice, lo mein, soups wonton egg drop or hot and sour the egg rolls are good. Their orange chicken and honey garlic chicken are a family favorite. Actually we've never had a bad dish from here. I am originally from NY and very picky about chinese food this place brings me close to home."}
{"text":"Warning, the food tasted rewarmed and old.  The fried rice was brown,  dry with no sign of egg or anything else that may have helped identify this as an authentic Chinese food.  If you want Chinese food and this is the only place open,  keep driving. That is honestly how all four of us felt after dining here."}
{"text":"When going here for lunch my food was sub-par.  It tasted like leftover food and had very little flavor.  I did not come in expecting much and I left dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, quick service and ridiculous portions. This place is absolutely fantastic and worth the drive up from Tempe."}
{"text":"I/We eat in or get takeout at New Asian Kitchen at least once a month.  Have been going there for MANY years and have ALWAYS had a great meal.  The food (In my opinion) is Fantastic!  Very reasonably priced.  Whenever we go to the Drive-In Movies, we ALWAYS stop at New Asian Kitchen and grab takeout to eat prior to the movie starting.  Lunch Specials are tasty and great price!  LOVE the food!  Love the prices!  Friendly People too!"}
{"text":"OMG!  The worst Chinese take out in town.  I ordered Sun Devil Chicken & Chicken lo mien.  Well the chicken was chewy.  Icky.v In fact I gagged.  Its was liked rubber.  My daughters also thought the chicken was nasty.  Never again.  Eww!"}
{"text":"This place is really quick and really good! It is also super cheap! Super calm and relaxed. It's good."}
{"text":"New Asian Kitchen has both Authentic and Americanized Chinese cuisine. My family always gets the fried chicken wings with the sauce on the side. Potstickers are another good choice for an appetizer. We prefer the specialty dishes pictured on the menu although everything we have tried is good, and we have been to many, many Chinese restaurants. We just started coming here about a year ago and wish we had found them sooner. Their  delivery is pretty quick when you don't feel like going out, prices are reasonable and service is friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here mainly for lunch. Food and prices are fantastic! I searched all over for a place that serves general tso. Even though it's not in the lunch menu, they still will make it if you ask. Service is good. The food comes quickly. It's become my go to Chinese place."}
{"text":"Love their food! Have been looking for a good Chinese place ever since I moved out here and I am so glad that I finally found one and  they deliver! I had the seafood combination last night and it was amazing! Just wish they have that option where I can pay extra and substitute white rice for different kind of fried rice. Other than that, Delicious food and Great value!"}
{"text":"Not bad. My parents used to own this restaurant, and I would say that not much has changed in the past 6 years since they sold it. The place has been remodeled and they have made improvements. Recently they expanded their delivery space which is great for me. I would, however, suggest their dinner as opposed to their lunch. The lunch that I have gotten the past three times or so has been over salty and sometimes just not as good. Their dinner however and their chef specialties is what would make me come back time and time again. Their specialties are super difficult to find anywhere else in Arizona, especially for the price that they sell it at, so I would definitely suggest it. The lunch is not bad for the price, but being chinese and as a foodie, I would say that for two bucks more, just go to Panda Express. Go for the dinner."}
{"text":"Not sure where these other reviewers have eaten chinese food before but the food here is mediocre at best asked for pot of tea and was brought a lot of tea with one Lipton tea bag every or be place its \"oolong\" or green tea the fried rice was bland and no vegetables not coming back"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and hits the spot every time! I have been ordering from them for years. My favorite is the honey walnut shrimp and there orange beef. I would highly recommend them for takeout or eat in."}
{"text":"We always order take out. Have never been physically in the restaurant. Prices are reasonable. Cream puffs/crab rangoons are one of my favorite things on the menu. The chow mein is beyond disappointing - you might like it if you like dry sticks and not real noodles. Delivery takes over an hour and we live close by. Helpful tip - go to Gorge and Son instead."}
{"text":"This place makes really great Chinese food.  So good, in fact that we drive from Desert Ridge over to where they are and get take out.  We ordered the first time and asked for delivery and they agreed.  But none of us knew where the other was -- it took the poor guy 40 minutes to deliver it to us and he just kept apologizing.  Dude - our fault for sure!  Their Moo Shoo Pork is to die for and their fried rice is fresh and yummy.  When I tell you we order $75 in Chinese take-out, you can imagine how much food that it.  We've had their honey Garlic Chicken, Almond Chicken, Beef Lo Mein (a total fav), both pork and beef fried rice, and the soups.  One thing we had that we weren't nuts about was the orange beef, not bad, just didn't love it.   As for appetizers, we LOVE their crab puffs - and i want some now as I'm typing.  Had the egg roll, and eh, it was just an eggroll.  I would definitely recommend New Asian Kitchen to anyone who likes fresh and tastey Chinese food.  I keep telling them they should open up a location in Desert Ridge - heck, we'd probably keep them in business all by ourselves!"}
{"text":"Service was fast. Lunch was pretty standard Chinese food, but it was pretty good. Price points were good.   The hot and sour soup was spicy. I really liked it. It wasn't too salty or too sour or too spicy.   The egg drop soup had a nice flavor but was a bit salty.   We had the beef skewers appetizer. It was simple but good, and less than $5. The baby loved it. She kept saying it was so good she couldn't stop eating it.   I had the moo goo gai pan lunch special. I wish it had more sauce but it was still tasty. There was a good ratio of vegetables to chicken.   The beef beef with broccoli had a nice flavor, wasn't too salty and a good amount of sauce.   The lunch specials are under $6 and come with an egg roll, cream cheese wonton, fried rice, entree and cup of soup. We had enough left over for dinner. We will probably be back."}
{"text":"Love this place, such good food, delivery is awesome, and foot is still hot when it gets here. Best place in phoenix!"}
{"text":"I had the Mongolian Beef Lunch Special with steamed rice instead of fried rice when I was in there yesterday. Wow. By FAR the BEST Chinese food that I've had since moving here. Egg roll and crab puff were fantastic also. I've tried 4 or 5 other Chinese restaurants since I've been here and so far New Asian Kitchen is the clear winner. The dining area was clean and server was attentive, but not annoying."}
{"text":"I had the mongolian beef (dinner size) as I usually do when I find a new restaurant with it. As with pretty much every strip mall chinese restaurant, their version was mostly white onion with a decent amount of beef and some green onions. The beef was tender but not exciting. It's spicier than most places, which helped cover the too-sweet sauce of low end restaurants. As far as the mongolian beef itself goes, it's better than most but PF Chang's is better (and more expensive).   I also ordered hot tea, hoping to get a nice chinese tea. Nope. It's plain lipton in a tea bag. I let the waitress know and she asked if I wanted \"the tea leaf\" and happily replaced it. It was better but it's not the type you steep. It's tiny bits of tea leaves in hot water. Meh on taste but the leaves didn't bother me.   The restaurant itself was musty, like maybe someone next door or in the back smokes all the time - or the last tennant used to.   As far as service, it was quick and polite but I was the only customer on a Tuesday from 11am to 1145."}
{"text":"Since moving out to the area 2 years ago, I've been looking for a good Chinese place. I'm happy to say that I've finally found it.  Not only are the portions and prices good, but they deliver (which is great for a lazy person like me)!!    My roommate and I have been getting food from here at least once every week because it's just too damn good.  You can't go wrong with the beef lo mein or the combo lo mein.  In terms of other dishes, our favorites are General Tso's Chicken and the Szechuan Chicken.  The Kung Pao is also good, but I'd be more inclined to recommend it if they gave more chicken and less of the vegetables.  Overall, I highly recommend this place.  The people over the phone and delivering the food are always nice and the food makes you want to come back for more"}
{"text":"I ordered food tonight for my husband and I. We've ordered from here many times. The chicken had no sauce on it and our soup didn't come with the chips I asked for. I called to see if we could come pick up sauce but didn't get that far because the incredibly rude lady on the phone was disgusting. She stated \" No you didn't say that I took your order!\" In fact, a man took my order. I had to hang up the phone because of how she was speaking. Not okay for a neighborhood business at all!!!"}
{"text":"Food is very cheap. I tried almond chicken and it is ok, not bad for the price. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good clean establishment service with a smile all the time. Lunch specials are tasty."}
{"text":"We love coming here! We have ordered take out and have dined in. We prefer to dine in and get the food fresh, they tend to be slow so we get great service every time. They are always NONSTOP with their take out orders. This place is great! Great prices and portions as well."}
{"text":"Just had Thanksgiving dinner and along with the usual stuff, my stepson's better-half brought awesome chowmein and friedrice... Just good chow!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a co-worker when first moved to Phoenix.  At one point I was going there 2 times a week. Food is EXCELLENT considering the prices. It's inexpensive, quick, and delicious. I recommend the ASU Devil Chicken... Their stir fried veggies are good too. I have not had anything that was not good. Their crab puffs are really good. A bit on the sweet side but I am not complaining."}
{"text":"This place is a family favorite! Very nice and clean! The food is all great! All there me ur items are great! Very goooooooooooooood food! ABACC,LLC endorses this great place! Come eat here!!!!!!  A quick note for those of you that complain. If you have an issue talk to them they are more then welcome to fix any situation. Stop hiding behind the Internet and solve the situation first hand. The owners are there with open arms to solve any uncertain difficulties you may have. Also, just speak up they will hear you out. Have a good one and hope this helps enjoy good eatings!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had food delivered yesterday. O my goodness everything we ordered came hot and freshly prepared. My favorite was the Crab Puffs and the Sweet and Sour Chicken. My daughter loved her Fried Shrimp and Sweet and Sour Chicken. The portions were big enough that we shared with my 2 boys when they got home. I had the Combination Dinner, it was a lot of food. My daughter had Chicken, Rice, and Shrimp. Will definitely be ordering front them again. Also they were very friendly. Even answered questions we had about a different dish."}
{"text":"Sooo, my first time ever ordering Chinese take out and it was amazing!!! They were nice, delivered fast and food is PERFECT. Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese delivery, take out or dine in restaurant on the Glendale/phoenix border. So good, so reasonably priced... love it!"}
{"text":"Order delivery from these guys today the person over the phone spoke English pretty well you could tell he was Asian but he spoke English really well a lot of these places you call up and it is really hard to understand them I ordered a combination Lo Mein and it was very very good I might say pong pongs  maybe slightly better but I usually order from Dragon Bowl and this place was much better than Dragon Bowl I ordered egg rolls and egg rolls were probably the best delivery I ever had very good egg rolls over all this place definitely deserve four stars I'll definitely go again"}
{"text":"THE only go-to Chinese place in the valley.  Really, everything thing about this place is wonderful.   Every bit, of every chicken dish I have had here has been tender white and the good parts of the dark meat and so fresh the little boxes will honestly get a little too hot to handle at first.  The rice is always fresh tasting and stores so well, its unbelievable. The people are friendly and we (the wife and I) have never once been disappointed.  Love ^_^"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials at $5.25 this is a good deal.  food is the bomb! ..I'll definitely come back to this place for sure. Service - outstanding. I highly recommend this place for lunch under 10.00... bathroom was clean too. ..my big pet peave...lol"}
{"text":"I feel so bad...I usually order PONG PONG but I thought I would try something new. I cheated. And it was like each has good qualities and bad ones. And now I am in a love triangle...blah.  I really like the veggies!!!! and the chicken quality is better.  but the fried rice and the egg drop was on the salty side.  the Mushus were even....they tasted equally good.  MMMM the cashew chicken and MaPoTOFU soooooooo good :)  My opinion is mostly based on veggies and rice quality so It is a tie. I will just have to alternate between the two till i decide? Oh look at me being naughty lol"}
{"text":"Best delivery Chinese ever!!! I freaking love this place.  I ordered it New Years Day and I think it might be a tradition now- great hangover food.    I've been ordering from them for a while and have never been disappointed, they are consistent and quick.  The only thing is, I have never actually been to the place, so I have no clue what it looks like.  I love it so much that now I am afraid to ever go there, so I just keep ordering delivery.  Better to enjoy my food and not think about where it comes from at this point.   As for the food, my favorites are: Honey Garlic Chicken Low Mein with Chicken The Scallops Mu Shu Chicken The Eggrolls- there's a hint of something sweet like brown sugar, not sure what it is, but it's good! Some kinda seafood mix- can't remember the name  You know what?  Everything is good.  This is seriously the best Chinese I've had in the valley."}
{"text":"For your typical, hole-in-the-wall, take-out Chinese Food place it's very good! Especially in this area. I'd say it's the best. Last night was the second time my husband and I ordered out here. (You can dine-in and they also deliver!) I'm really not a big fan of take out Chinese and I tend to avoid it. But I think this place has changed my mind! We got the Orange Chicken ($7,) Egg rolls (2 for $2,) and Crab Puffs (6-7 for $3.) {Yea... We know we're basic ) How do you beat those prices? The chicken was still crispy(usually hard to do with take out),  all white meat, nice portion, we had leftover after sharing even. The Egg rRolls were nice and crispy, as were the Crab Puffs! And the white right was nice, sticky, and not dry!  On the another note. I wasn't a fan of the Sweet and Sour Sauce. It had nooooo flavor. It was very watery. And I might get a side of the orange sauce. We discovered most of it ended up on the bottom of the box. So a tip I might give is to dump your food into bowls and mix to get a better coating of sauce all around.   If you are looking for a cheap, fast, good meal. You have come to the right place!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty the delivery guy rude. He actually demanded a tip and when i informed him that the person paying declined he literally almost asked to come in and speak to them."}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch beef and broccoli and it was very tasty. It came with rice, crab puff and an egg roll. I also ordered an order of crab puffs which were really good and they gave me a good amount. They delivered my food fast and hot. The portions were more than enough and the price wasn't too bad at all either. All in all I have to say I will be ordering from this place again. My first experience with them was pleasant and very satisfactory so I suggest this place if you want quick Chinese take out."}
{"text":"This place is slowly becoming my #1 asian spot! The lunch specials are awesome! The egg drop soup is some of the best I've had. The Twice Cooked Chicken is my go-to, although the last time I had requested it without MSG it wasn't very flavorful which is a bummer. The owners are so sweet & always remember us. Great pricing, can't recommend enough."}
{"text":"Someone needs to tell these losers what a wok is. The broccoli and beef dish I ordered was obviously boiled in water. The sauce was simply poured over the ingredients after they were boiled to the point where they were cooked into mush."}
{"text":"Only been there twice but I have been very satisfied both times I've been there. The best eggdrop soup I've ever had and the Kung Pao was amazing as well!"}
{"text":"I think it's a bit nicer than it's 'hole in the wall' description - no it's not a boring chain restaurant with 30 pieces of flair but there were very clean and pressed pale pink table cloths and nice chairs. Our large party (7) was seated quickly and comfortably. We didn't have to do the 'pardon me, excuse me' game because the tables are arranged properly to allow tall people to sit back away from the table, or room to stow a walker or baby carriage. The service was prompt and pleasant. The orange beef was spectacular, very tender. The beef chow fun and fried rice were also big hits. This is a store front restaurant, we had a great experience and a great meal. The food was better than most of the awful Chinese food in the valley."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to here in AZ. Everything is on point and delicious! I definitely recommend the house fried rice. It's bomb!"}
{"text":"I came here a few times. Its a pretty good place for asian food. Love the lo mein, beef chow fun. Would not recommend the pineapple chicken. Few people frequent this place, so its got a nice and quiet atmosphere. Clean, small place."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this place off and on for years. We like the soups, broccoli beef, cashew chicken, house chicken, and the yummy crab puffs. They make a hot mustard in house that is a must try. It's small and quiet. The people working there are very friendly. They have reasonably priced lunch specials. Here are pics of the hot and sour soup, egg drop soup, broccoli beef, and the mustard. The plates all came pretty, but the kids and I dug in before getting the pics."}
{"text":"Order each course one at a time. Right now we've got apps, soup and entrees - too fast!  I wanted to give them a higher score because they seem to try to run a good, tight ship.  The only problem with that is the food is a little on the bland side.  For instance, the \"Hot and Sour\" soup was the correct temp, however it lacked any \"zing\" to the soup.  Had a touch of heat, but you also need the sour.    The meal my wife had was the Egg Foo Young and it looked good, however once again it was a little on the bland side.  My meal was Pork Fried Rice - which is something I do at Chinese restaurants that I have never been to.  It was cooked properly, had good hot temperature, but ultimately unsatisfying.    The highlight of our meal was the Potstickers with dipping sauce.  These were pretty good, however I prefer them steamed to fried.  Having said that, even though they were fried, they lacked any semblance of \"toasting\" or browning color, which seems odd to me.  All in all, a nice place I wouldn't mind going again, but I won't seek it out."}
{"text":"Called in our order for delivery.   Hassle free ordering with the gentleman on the phone.   He quoted us 45 minutes, delivery guy was there in less than 30. Score!  Food is really good and hits our crave for Asian food."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. The honey garlic chicken and sesame chicken is really good. Service has been great."}
{"text":"This is my go-to take out place for Chinese. I wouldn't say there is anything in particular that stands out at this place but it's just good all-around food. I've ordered several items from the menu; teriyaki combo, chicken lo-mein, pu-pu platter and kung pow chicken.  They also deliver to our place that is slightly out of the delivery range and only charge $2 extra - not bad I think for the convienience. They have also always delivered what I ordered and in the time frame they specified."}
{"text":"I always try different dishes and they all are very good. Their Mongolian Beef is the best I have had in Phoenix! Their House Chicken is always the same! Excellent! I always have it delivered and the driver is always very courteous."}
{"text":"I agree with Ryan C on this one. New Asian Kitchen is the best small and independent fast food Chinese of it's kind in the area. Nobody in a several mile radius makes Chinese Food as tasty. Food packed with lots of fresh vegetables and great flavors. They even make the very hard to make Cantonese Dry Sauteed Beef Chow Fun that's considered a major test for Cantonese Chefs for cooking and their version is very good indeed and you will not see that dish at most places I note. My personal favorites are the Szechuan Chicken, the  Curry Chicken and the Yui Shan Eggplant. Lately they don't make these dishes as spicy as they use to make them but they are so flavorful it doesn't matter. The people that own the place are very nice and they will make anything within reason for you.  I have at least a half dozen places that are closer that aren't nearly as good.  This place isn't fancy  at all but it seems clean and is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I've never written a review for anything but I'm so annoyed by the misleading reviews about his place that I signed up and have to say a couple things. First, the portions are not larger than any other take out place. I say that because maybe I could justify $40.00 for huge portions of food even if it was mediocre. That being said here's what we got and why we won't be back. 1. Pot stickers - not fried or steamed possibly baked? Just awful. 2. Pu- Pu platter - fried shrimp decent, crab puffs over fried so no filling left inside the puff, beef skewers had no flavor, pork not a bad flavor but very fatty, egg rolls not terrible but certainly not great. 3. Honey garlic chicken - chicken itself was over fried so it was hard and unpleasant to eat, the breading was soggy and falling off every bite, the sauce had zero garlic flavor and was over sweet. Should have been called \"sweet and soggy chicken\".  4. Curry chicken - by far the best thing we got but was still very disappointing. The sauce was very watered down as if the curry sauce had been diluted.  5. Rice - overcooked WAY overcooked. I feel like any \"Asian\" kitchen should be able to do a good plain white rice. Not so much today. 6. Pepsi - a warm 2 liter - yes nothing like washing down disappointment with warm Pepsi.   Not to harp on the whole $40.00 but seriously I've had way cheaper Chinese take out that served a ton more food and it was more palatable than this place. I will say that the staff was very friendly. No complaints there. If you are looking for a new place to try....skip this one. More bang and flavor for your buck elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Basic Chinese food nothing special.   I've had better (see my reviews). Sorry will not be back."}
{"text":"Better than Kawii and George and sons. Hence the 5.  I got delivery. Came on time and everything was good. I don't know if this place stands up to tri state area Chinese but it is the best I've had out here."}
{"text":"Not So Good.  I really hate to give restaurant a less then favorable review.  Especially when the reviews are really good.  So lets start off on a positive note.  The staff New Asian Kitchen are friendly and very accommodating.   The service is fast and the prices are reasonable.  However, The food just wasn't that good. The pork and  chicken lo mein was very greasy and tasteless. The  vegetables were overcooked and soggy. The egg roll was cooked nicely, but just didn't have a good flavor.  The same could be said about the won tons and crab puffs.     I cannot  give New Asian Kitchen a good recommendation but in a pinch, you could do worse."}
{"text":"Not often that I hand out praise across the board but this place was great for everything we ordered. Seriously awesome lightly cooked to perfection fried wonton. Wor won ton was spot on. Chicken lo mein and fried rice was really good. Just make an effort to try this place out. This place just flat out does food right!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. My 1st visit. Service was great.  Very friendly. I had the garlic lemon chicken with brown rice. Delicious!! Prices are very very reasonable."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good! I love the beef skewers, they are delicious lathered in sweet and sour with a hint of hot mustard! Soup is pretty good but could use salt. The only thing I was disappointed in and I've been here several times; I had a to go order and they didn't wrap my mushu, my wraps got hard before my last one was made!"}
{"text":"The orange chicken and fried rice are amazing here and the delivery times don't even give u a chance to put your wallet away."}
{"text":"We moved from Northern CA 3 years ago and gave every Chinese restaurant in our immediate vicinity a try before we ventured a little further and found New Asian Kitchen. We are now weekly regulars and occasional take-out. The place isn't ornately fancy but - they serve very good food - outstanding and personable service - and so reasonably priced. I don't understand the few negative reviews sprinkled into the high ratings. Do you not communicate with your wait staff if something is not to your liking? Or do you just have a negative outlook? We've never had a sub par meal or a bad experience. It's a really nice little family run restaurant"}
{"text":"Though I have never actually been in there, this is the spot to call for delivery! I love the food they have! The Happy Family is amazing and my dish of choice."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food it doesn't get any better than here for delivery. If your in the area this is the spot to go to."}
{"text":"I brought the family to share in my delight this time. We ordered the \"Fam-a-ree\" special.   Egg drop soup. Good, but have you ever really had bad soup?  Won-tons. I could go with out  Crab puff. I heard they could be a dessert they are so good.  Egg Roll. Better this time to me   Chicken lomein. boring but good  Honey Chicken. good  Beef and Broccoli. Really good  Sweet and Sour pork. Eh it was OK  Cashew Chicken. Really good  Fried Rice and White rice both good.   Needless to say we came home with a ton of leftovers."}
{"text":"We ordered take out here tonight. We got egg fried rice, pork fried rice, chicken lo mein, Mongolian beef and 2 egg rolls. My daughter liked her egg fried rice. But she was the only one who liked her food. Everything else was either flavorless or mushy. The egg roll in my opinion was gross."}
{"text":"One of my go to places for Chinese take out , I wish it was closer to me so I wouldn't have to drive 30 miles round trip but that's Arizona if you want something good you need to drive 30 minutes"}
{"text":"My go to delivery spot! These guys have THE BEST EGG FRIED RICE! I get mine with extra egg! I love this place!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of 6 after attending a choral concert. To me the food was OK. Nothing of the entrees really stood out and we all tried some of each of the 5 different entrees ordered. The food was solid and plentiful. We all preferred the crab puffs over the pot stickers. The service was excellent and almost got them rounded up instead of down."}
{"text":"We love this place! Ordered a big to go order for lunch today, went to go pick it up and I had my kid on my hip since it's so hot out. The lady that was working offered to help me and carry it to my car! She was so sweet! Also the food is always delicious here. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"My family and I order from here about 2 times a month. We always order delivery. They are friendly and prompt. The main reason we keep going back is... Their food!!! It is delicious! I have never not liked anything I've tried. Good quality food.. That gets delivered right to your door!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I haven't dined here in several years. We have missed a lot. The service and food was spectacular. The shrimp with vegetables in lobster sauce was delicious. It was fresh and served hot. My husband ordered the Szechuan Beef was tender--it melted in his mouth with every bite. In essence the dishes they prepare are delicious and delightful.  I recommend dining here, you won't be disappointed.  **The restaurant is very clean and tidy--comfortable seating.**"}
{"text":"OK I have the kids today, I ordered delivery. I was a little concerned about the amount of food as always, expecting a small amount (lunch to boot). I ordered the Chatonese Chow Mein....with a side of crab puffs. WOW 13 and some change. Its Hot and has everything in it a man could love! Beef, Chicken, Shrimp. I have a new favorite! They guys are a class act. I can honestly say, I think that the NEG reviews is just unethical competitors! Try this place, it is the best! Another 5 stars on the deliver guys! ~J Benson"}
{"text":"Love this place.  We found this little gem online one night and ordered delivery. Well a couple months later an we are still ordering from there.  We like the dinner combos and have tried all of them; they are all really good. The appetizers are good as well (we like the egg rolls and crab puffs). Haven't been to the actual location but delivery is great."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new Chinese place to eat since the last place gave us food poisoning. This place was pretty good! They're egg rolls were really blan though :( But the pineapple chicken, egg fried rice, chicken lo mein were GREAT! We also tried the Dry sautéed beef chow fun... It needed a little more flavor though. I walked in and did takeout, the place is VERY small and good luck on getting through on the phone! Lol when I was there they just kept letting the phone ring over and over. They took care of the people dining in and doing takeout first. Also they have coupons on their website!"}
{"text":"This is like Panda Express and pei wei had sex the new Asian kitchen would be there baby. Ya it's good. Wait hold up.... it's great"}
{"text":"Great little place for dine in or take out we have tried both, everything was fresh and seasoned well, not overly salty. Great service."}
{"text":"I love this place and have been using it for three years now but I have to knock it down by one star because at times, not often, but it happens, we'll get our normal stuff and it will be nothing like we're used to getting from them.  Usually they are excellent, however, a couple of times now it has also been greasy, tasteless and overcooked to a point where someone should really have noticed it on sight before it ever left the kitchen.  It's disappointing when that happens, then wish you didn't bother."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time with my wife for dinner. Evaluating as a casual restaurant that appears to do a lot of take out business. Very clean, simple interior. Very quick service from the young man acting as host, server, and cashier.  The food: The crab puffs were top notch. Solid appetizer choice. The hot tea delivered in a steeping pot was Lipton. That alone should take away a star for a Chinese restaurant. The chicken fried rice was excellent... lots of flavor, good mix of veggies and meat, and plenty to share if you go family style. Then tried the Yui-Shan Chicken that was identified as a little spicy. Very tasty dish with fresh veggies, but it lacked any real heat. Next time I'll request something with a little more kick.  Overall, we both enjoyed ourselves in the relaxed atmosphere and the food was very good. We'll be back (and hope for different tea)."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal here and plan on going back. We have been here a couple of times now. The last time has been about a month ago but we cannot remember what we had ordered. We have Chinese food often and always have the items marked spicy. We always have hot and sour soup and theirs was excellent. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is my go-to chinese place when I get a craving. I've been ordering from there for about 3 years now and have yet to be disappointed. They recently redid their menu and added a whole bunch of new items, they also raised their prices a bit, but it's totally worth it.  I've tried tons of different things from this place, to make a small list: Pot Stickers BBQ Pork Beef Chow Fun (KILLER!) Chicken Corn Soup (really good) Egg Drop Soup House Wor Wonton Soup (I'm pretty sure this is the one that had gigantor shrimp in it, which is great if you love shrimp, unfortunately I'm anti seafood) Beef With Broccoli General Tso's Chicken Sweet & Sour Chicken Lemon Chicken (yummy!) Twice cooked chicken (meh...) Sesame Chicken (one of my favs, has a honey-ish perfect sauce) Pork Lo Mein ...and on and on  Like I said, I've never really been disappointed, and for the money it's a lot of food. I've never actually eaten in the restaurant, but it looks clean, nice. The people I always pick up the order from are really nice. Overall, a great place to get takeout from! :)"}
{"text":"We would highly recommend this place! Super friendly, fast and most of all delicious food! My boyfriend is from the east coast and has hated the Chinese food out here! Last night we tried this place and were very pleasantly surprised! I got the Mongolian beef and would HIGHLY recommend trying it! I was some of the most tender beef I have ever had from a Chinese food place and extremely flavorful! We will most definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"After recently having a less-than-stellar experience at another Yelp-recommended Chinese restaurant, my girlfriend and I decided to stop by New Asian Kitchen in hopes of redeeming our colossal failure. Actually, it's more of my failure than hers - but I admittedly like blaming others for my own mistakes.    We've been here a total of three of times in the past few years and have mostly been pleased with what's offered.  Anyway, its dishes are what you'd typically expect at an American-Chinese restaurant. The place itself is fairly small and has a fair mixture of pick-up customers and those who choose to dine in.   We always order the pu-pu platter, which consists of a combination of fried shrimp, excellent crab puffs and egg rolls, BBQ pork, and some god-awful beef skewers that remind me of the texture of my distressed leather wallet. For it's price, it's a great deal, although a bit of a mixed baggage in terms of what's good and what's not.  I usually order their beef and broccoli, while my girlfriend prefers their honey garlic chicken. Both are decent quality. I usually upgrade my white rice to fried, which is also done fairly well here.  Honestly, I won't really over-hype the place. It's good, but not quite great and nothing I'd consider to be memorable. But given their reasonable prices, I see no reason to complain. In comparison to other Chinese restaurants in the area, you can do much, much worse than New Asian Kitchen.   The servers are polite, the place is clean, and based on our experience, the food is pretty consistent. Therefore, if you're in the mood for no-nonsense Chinese, I see this as a pretty reliable option."}
{"text":"Yelpers, you let me down...  I have been searching for good chinese, saw these reviews and decided to check it out. My girlfriend and I were literally the only people in the restaurant at 6pm on a week day. Not a single person came or left the 30 minutes we were there.   I ordered a spicy chicken dish, asked no soy to be on it. Waitress confirmed, \"no soy, only spicy sauce\" and it was brought out at a spicy level of 0. Sigh. Half the reason I wanted asian food was for the spice. But I tried to eat it anyway.  However the chicken was like gum. I literally chewed my first piece for about 2 minutes... I wanted to spit it out. Not to mention there were only about 7 pieces of chicken on the entire plate. I took about 5 bites and decided I was done. Ended up driving through taco bell on the way home, very irritated.   Also, they decided not to turn on the heat when it's about 30 degrees outside. It was barely warmer inside than out, and all the staff were wearing thick jackets. Just, what?... cmon.   Absolutely will not be back."}
{"text":"We recently moved, so one of the top things on the list was finding our new favorite takeout place.  While New Asian Kitchen wasn't bad, I think our search will continue.    Portions were very good - we had lots of leftovers.  The beef in the beef and broccoli was very tender, and the chicken in the chicken lo mein was delicious.  But the dishes as a whole seemed to fall a little flat on flavor.  There seemed to be something missing, but none of us could really put our finger on what it was.  The crab puffs were more on the sweet side, to the point where it tastes like cheesecake filling inside.    This may have just been an off day, so I'd be willing to try it again."}
{"text":"The delivery time was what they quoted. Large portions. Food was really good. Whole family loved it. Will def order again."}
{"text":"They have the best egg drop soup I've ever had. Their broccoli w/ oyster sauce is good to."}
{"text":"I liked the fact that the chicken wasn't slimy or over battered. Clean. Affordable. Tasted yummy"}
{"text":"It can be hard to find a good Chinese restaurant, and after moving out to Arizona from the other side of the country, I was a little afraid of trying out a new place to get my Chinese food from, but this one was pretty awesome! The food was delicious, and the restaurant was clean. The waitress was really nice and attentive. Really on top of her game, offering refills when they were needed. I'd highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"As decent Chinese delivery options seem to be sparse for those of us who live North of the 101, this place is pretty good. Ordered four different spicy dishes, though not as spicy as I or anyone else who was eating with me wanted, all the dishes had a good flavor. Nothing was over salted, the meat was a decent quality and unlike other places I've eaten and wasn't all fat and gristle. They also get extra points for not using that red sickly sweet, sweet and sour sauce. It was light pink and still a bit sweeter than I liked, but it was tolerable. The rice we had was a bit overcooked, but still for the price, quality, and quantity it's a great option for those of us in the North Valley and find it too hot to go out of the house or cook."}
{"text":"Pretty Ok food. I ordered Kung Pao chicken, it really didnt have that much chicken but it had a great flavor. Also order Egg fried rice and that was good too."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Chinese food and this place was on my radar.  I really wanted to like this place, but it failed in almost every aspect.  This is my first two star review as I give almost every restaurant the benefit of the doubt and acknowledge that they must be doing something right to stay in business.  Upon waking in I didn't know if I should seat myself or wait to be seated.  No one approached me immediately, but I patiently waited for someone to greet me and be seated.  I really should have turned around at that moment, but decided to give it a shot.    I ordered a meal that came with a soupy/slurpee/sludgy egg drop soup, soggy cream puff, decent egg roll, boring brown rice, and flavorless kung pao entree.  Really was some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had.  During my meal I noticed the servers were unprofessionaly lounging at a table that had a bag of half eaten doritos.  Texting on their phone, and not paying attention to the customers.  The place is dirty and has clutter near the kitchen.  My advice is to clean up a little of that clutter and shut the door to the not so nice looking kitchen.    I'm sad to have to write such a poor review, but I'm only stating the facts.  I may be back, but it will be quite some time before I decide so."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The service is fast, attentive, and friendly. The food is good quality especially for the price. Everything I've ordered is far is fresh, and pretty tasty.  However, I do wish that their spicy dishes were a bit more spicy. I don't taste any heat, ever. I'm thinking that maybe the chilies they use aren't very fresh.   But for the price you cant really beat it.   This place is pretty small. And tucked in an old strip mall accompanied by a Taco Bell. There's some shady characters that walk by and occupy the area, but so far, no problems.   Overall, its a good Chinese food place for Arizona. Ill probably make this place my new spot for a while."}
{"text":"Great food.  Not the greatest atmosphere but it's not the worst.  I love picking up take out or having it delivered."}
{"text":"I was nervous at first to order food from here but I am impressed with the quality and taste. I ordered the house special chicken and is full of flavor, the combo fried rice is great as well. I will frequent this establish more often."}
{"text":"I have now been going here for a couple of years, mostly just get delivery and when I do it's fast. Like thirty mins or less fast and always hot and fresh tasting. This place knows what they are doing!"}
{"text":"First trying this place .pretty dam good I must say food has lots of flavor definitely comeing back again . But it's going to be awhile cause the portion where so big"}
{"text":"In-laws were wanting Chinese for dinner and on my recommendation we ordered from here.  All around good meal that was enjoyed by everyone.  The driver brought me a new menu and to my despair, they increased the prices across the board.  Some as little as .30 cents and as much as $2.  Most of the increases are between .30 and .55 cents; the $2 increase are for the family meals.  It has been a very long time since I last visited the restaurant in person and I've been most likely paying the higher prices all this time while ordering for delivery and never knew.  It's OK as this is still very affordable and I didn't notice a difference.  Now I'm going to be sad every time I look at my new paper menu but happy that good food is coming my way."}
{"text":"I am so pleased that I followed the Yelp reviews and tried this gem of Asian Culinary Delights!  Large portions (which I didn't need) and good taste.  Prices just right too.  The Dry Rub Beef Chow Fun was very tasty and had wide flat noodles with just the right amount of sauce and beef strips with onions and peppers.  The Won Ton soup was also tasty with all kinds of meat and noodles swimming around in a light broth.  The restaurant itself was very clean and neatly setup.  I carried out but did wait a few minutes for my order so I was able to observe others eating.  The server was attentive and friendly to the customers and also me.  All my food tasted fresh and very hot.  I'll go back again next week when I return to Glendale!!   And they accept all major credit cards definitely a plus for me since my employer uses AMEX and many Asian restaurants don't take it. Thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"Before tonight's meal, I would've easily given 4 stars. However, our meal (while delicious), gave me horrible food poisoning. I had the lemon chicken, egg fried rice and a few crab puffs so not quite sure who the actual culprit is. I hate to leave a bad review, but I won't give it a chance again."}
{"text":"The food here was not bad, but it wasn't great either. I ordered their sweet and sour chicken for lunch, and it came out with complimentary egg drop or hot and sour soup (I had the egg drop, and it was so-so), \"fried rice\" (I didn't see any egg or vegetables in it), and a crab/cream cheese wonton. The portion size and bang for your buck were great, but the food itself left a lot to be desired. The interior of this restaurant is also very basic with minimal decor, and it's located in a small strip mall. Overall, it's cheap, you get a lot of food, but there are better options nearby."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery the other night because I didn't feel like cooking and I was very tired from unpacking. We ordered chow mein, honey garlic chicken, white rice, chicken fried rice and pot stickers. Me and the boyfriend did not like the food as much. The chow mein was very mushy and had weird texture. The pot stickers were hard like a rock. The rice was cold and not fresh as it seems like. The honey garlic chicken was \"OK\" it did taste like sesame chicken and the chicken was smothered with sauce and sesame seeds.   This place is only getting two stars from me for the fast delivery which they said it would take about 40 minutes but it only was about 15 minutes from phone to door.   I will not be returning to this place unfortunately and will stick with Abacus Inn."}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken and garlic shrimp with veggies are good dishes. Egg drop soup is above average. Friendly service and decent spot in town."}
{"text":"Let me say this our family has been going to same Chinese restaurant for the last 15 years.  We tried this based on my mom's recommendation,  she teaches around the corner and the teachers get take out all the time.  Wow what favors and the veggies where fresh!   We all walked out saying it was time to make a change.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"You're tired. It was a long day at work and you forgot to start the dishwasher this morning. You dig into your wallet and find a $20 bill. Can you feed three people for that without \"driving thru\" some fast food joint?  Yeah, you can. And you'll have leftovers, too.  Order the \"dinner for 3\" and you will bring home egg drop soup, fried wontons, eggrolls, moo goo gai pan, sweet & sour pork and beef with broccoli for everyone's face. If you want to modify the beef with broccoli to, say, Mongolian beef, that's a dollar more.   Your dinner comes with all the soy sauce/hot mustard/sweet & sour/duck sauce that you'll need and a big ass egg-fried rice.   Carry it home in the handy box they provide for you (no spilling) and enjoy."}
{"text":"Loved it! Food was great. Service was decent. Loved the twice cooked chicken and pot stickers. Family friendly and prices were decent too!"}
{"text":"We like this place for delivery.  They are quick, friendly, and affordable.  We like the chicken lo mein and the chicken with broccoli.  They use white meat and the sauces and veggies taste fresh and hot upon delivery.  They put lots of veggies in the lo mein.  My husband has had a couple of other dishes and enjoyed them, I think he likes the sweet and sour chicken and egg rolls.  We've never been to the restaurant, only had delivery."}
{"text":"I was sitting at my dentist's office a block away and asked my phone about restaurants in the area. New Asian Kitchen popped up and I saw the positive reviews and picked up a menu (and checked out the inside which was nice). I had just eaten lunch, plus I was in a hurry so I didn't eat or order this day.  I convinced my hubby to got out of our way to eat at New Asian Kitchen today based on the reviews and prices. I'll admit my hubby wasn't really thrilled about driving the distance, but after he ate his lunch he left saying he definitely wants to go back!!! Me too!!!   The experience was good and the food was VERY tasty!! I got the pork lo mein and asked for extra veggies. I honestly wish they would have given me more veggies, but it was so good I'm not going to complain!! Hubby got the beef and broccoli spicy. The flavors of both dishes were really good!! The crab puff had a lot of filling, unlike most places!  The lunch prices are ridiculously low for such yummy food!! The lunch combos (as of today's date) are $5.25 for most and a few priced slightly higher. Everything was super fresh and just damn good!!!   This place will be on our regular rotation!! We have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant. Shocking thing is, we have THREE Chinese restaurants located 1 mile from us (we don't like any of them). We will pass all of them and drive the drive to go here instead!!"}
{"text":"went there based on recommendations by YELP.  It was very good, especially for AZ.  We had the combination fried rice (very good), beef chow fun (very good), ya-shu chicken - good but a little sweet, hot and sour soup (very good), and dumpling (good, but deep fried).  I am chinese and from Boston, and use to eating in Chinatowns.  We have been looking for decent chinese food since we moved here.  This is the best we have found so far.  Prices are very reasonable.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I am always a little scared to try new Chinese food places but I saw the good reviews for this place. It was excellent! I don't know why people rave about the other \"Inn\" place, this food is much better, arrived quickly and was piping hot. My only complaint is that they have an upcharge for fried rice and it's really only rice with soy sauce in it, at least that's what it looked and tasted like."}
{"text":"They have recently renovated! I have been going here for years and I consider it the best Chinese place I have found in Phoenix, hands down. I'm excited about the renovation because it's actually very nice to sit down in now. Very clean, consistently good food with great flavor. I never feel bogged down after eating here. The service is very friendly. They have a really nice menu with a ton of different plates that are all under 10$. Most of them start at 6.95 which is dirt cheap for the quality and quantity of the food you get. I love the pork fried rice, Snow pea pork, garlic chicken, chicken and broccoli, kung pao beef/chicken, and crab rangoons. They also have free delivery. Yum!"}
{"text":"We found this place here on yelp and the reviews were good so why not. Well let's just say we have been here every other Friday for the past 2 months. It's our favorite! We travel over 15 miles down the 17 and pass many Chinese restaurants but we insist on coming here. You must try this place."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this restaurant for 7 years and have never gone back to a different chinese restaurant. By day the best in the valley! Their lunch special portion is spectacular and affordable and the staff is awesome, they always remember just what you like!"}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese for lunch at work and a friend and I went at the recommendation of another coworker to try this place out.  The business was clean and service was good.  The value was good as well as I had the lunch special which came with Egg Drop Soup which was the best item I had, Rice, Crab Puff, Egg Roll (pretty bad one), and my entree which was the twice cooked chicken.  All I can say of my entree was HOLY SALT.  I think they put a whole jar of MSG in there.  I did try my friends dish and it was decent, but overall nothing I will make a trip back for."}
{"text":"Meh.  I was craving some Chinese food and started asking around at work, where I could find such a place.  A few people recommended New Asian Kitchen.  It's only about 2 miles down Bell and it made it convenient to pick up lunch.  I looked up their online menu and placed an order for myself and one of my coworkers.  I went with their lunch special of the \"house chicken\" as well as a sweet and sour chicken rice bowl.  My coworker went with a lunch special of beef and broccoli.  I drove down, paid my money (cheap btw...2 combos and a rice bowl was only $15.00!), and took my food to go.  Here is how it was.........  Lunch Combo House Special Chicken-  This special came with a decent sized portion of breaded and fried dark meat chicken, in a tangy brown sauce, fried rice, an egg roll and a cream cheese wonton.  The chicken was cooked properly and tasted alright.  Not one of the better \"house chickens\" I have had, but it wasn't nasty at least!  The egg roll that came with it was my favorite part of the meal.  Crispy and crunchy and filled with the usual veggies and pork (I think).  The cream cheese wonton was good, albeit small.  Now onto the rice.....I was happy when I saw that their fried rice was just rice!  No fillers like peas and carrots and shit like that.  Just plain, fried rice!  The problem with it was that it was bad...like, bad as in I didn't even come close to finishing it bad.  I took a couple of bites and was done.  It had no flavor to it at all and had a weird texture, too!  One of the worst fried rices I have ever had!  Sweet and Sour Chicken Bowl-  Seeing is the lunch deals are so cheap, I decided to order a rice bowl, too.  This rice bowl was horrible!  The sweet and sour chicken was all gummy and didn't taste good at all.  The white rice had a weird texture to it (same as the fried) and had no flavor at all.  The sweet and sour sauce was horrible, too!  It was way, way, way too thin and almost like a sweet and sour vinegar, instead of a \"sauce\".  It didn't coat the chicken well and all it did was turn my white rice to red.    My coworker was not that impressed either.  She said she has had much better and probably wouldn't come back.  I'm in her boat!  This was some of the worst Chinese takeout I have had in a long time.  Even with prices being so cheap ($5.25 lunch combo, $3.50 rice bowl!), I can't see myself coming back. Service was friendly on the phone and during pickup.  The service and the egg roll were the 2 winners of the day!  The quest for a good Chinese place near Bell and the 17 continues!  Hope I can find somewhere great!"}
{"text":"Wow! I know this place has been there for awhile but we always stuck to the usual place we get delivery from. Gonna have to change places now. Food is great, better selection."}
{"text":"First time ordering and i enjoyed it. Got an order of crab puffs which were amazing. Sesame chicken and the honey garlic chicken and both were really good as well. Oh and the delivery was prompt"}
{"text":"I don't know if this place change ownership, or if some of these yahoos have selected the wrong location for the review.   this is one of the best small and independent fast food chinese food restaurants in Phoenix.   I and my family and friends are regulars. it is ridiculous that some people believe that they are able to assess a place in a single visit just because it wasn't perfect. they are friendly, the food and vegetables are fresh and hot, and the prices are great. want-to-be food critics need to realize that no restaurant or magazine or television food critic evaluates a place good or bad in only one visit.  this is a five star place for the type of restaurant it is.. I encourage anyone who has only had one visit, especially if it was two or more years ago, to either revisit or I hope that the intelligence of the reader is able to discern the difference. I love new Asia kitchen"}
{"text":"got to my house in less than a half an hour which was great! i ordered general tso and sesame chicken. they had both tasted like a tv dinner."}
{"text":"Moved back to Glendale from downtown Phoenix and one of the first things we got in the mail was a coupon for New Asian Kitchen. We were excited about it, because it was close, already had a 4 star review, and seemed to have a good potential to be our new take out place. So we saved the coupon.  We both had long days today, and really didn't want to cook at home. So it was time to try it out. I called in and ordered the orange chicken, teriyaki chicken (both with fried rice), and crab puffs, and used our coupon for free egg rolls.  They were very nice over the phone. Our order took about 15 minutes and was a very reasonable price.   The orange chicken had good flavor, but seemed to be missing a little something. It seemed like it may have just needed a little more sauce, so we will probably order extra next time. The teriyaki chicken had a little too much of a ginger flavor for my taste, but was not bad at all. The fried rice is just a basic rice and soy sauce mix, but had just the right amount of flavoring. The crab puffs were a little overstuffed with cream cheese, but can you really complain about too much filling? We probably won't order the egg rolls again, but we were happy to have the coupon to try them.  Overall this place is exactly what we had hoped it would be. It's not the most amazing place in the world. But it seems to be very reliable. We definitely enjoyed our meal and will order again soon."}
{"text":"We love New Asian Kitchen! The food is always fresh and delicious. I personally love the cashew chicken but I have tried other things and they are wonderful too. We ordered our food and 15 minutes later it was at our house! You could tell that they just made it because it was so hot that we had to wait a minute for it to cool to eat it! I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"when we want chinese this is the place..we have never been disappointed..we have it delivered and the drivers are always friendly and the food is hot and delivered fast...have recommended to friends that have enjoyed as well."}
{"text":"First time here; tonight for dinner. The service leaves little to be desired.  Our server wasn't pleasant at all. He acted as though he was doing us a favor.  The food wasn't bad. I certainly wouldn't call it stellar but it was eatable.  I think we will continue to look!"}
{"text":"Yes, this is a good, even very good place.  I found it and went there because of Yelp and the reviews here.  I wanted won ton soup and shrimp lo mein last night, so I decided then to find a good, classic Chinese restaurant out here in northwest (sort-of) Phoenix.  I loved the Wor Won Ton Soup.  However, New Asian Kitchen is only getting four stars (not five stars) because the Shrimp Lo Mein I ordered was on the sticky side and not dry enough (as compared to many of the other Chinese restaurants I've patronized).  I may upgrade my assessment if I am later impressed by other offerings.  However, my initial assessment stands, at this point: it's a very good place."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers for getting us here...  My husband is not fond of Take-out joints and presuming this place to be one of that kind we always drove past this...One fine afternoon, my daughter insisted to eat Fried rice and so we landed up here.   I must say, a very small yet decent place. Calming ambiance, great food, great price and good portion size. I would definitely recommend this place for dine-in and take-out."}
{"text":"This is our second time getting take out and we have not been disappointed.  A lot of food,  good flavor. This is one of those places that you know that they care what they t serve you. When they see you they make sure your taken care of."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The deliveries are always CRAZY quick, the food is hot & fresh. Generally I get the Veggie fried Rice- has a TON of broccoli and other veggies in it, not all bamboo shoots and water chestnuts like some of the \"other\" joints in the area. My kids love the orange chicken, or chicken fried rice, and the hubby is a huge fan of the house chicken.  You get a TON of food, and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! We come here every time we want Chinese take out. They have excellent customer service and their food tastes great. We usually get lo mein, orange chicken, white rice, fried rice and beef and broccoli. Better than usually getting Panda Express."}
{"text":"The waiter was really nice and attentive.  He even brought us a fortune cookie to give to our dog since we said she loves them and hadn't had one in a while.     The restaurant was very clean. The meals were priced well   The food we had was plentiful, but not very tasty.  It seemed to lack the deep flavors, the sweet and savory sauces that we love.   I had the chicken and cashew and hubby had the chicken and broccoli and they both tasted the same.   His wonton soup was just ok and his egg rolls were sparsely filled when he broke them in half."}
