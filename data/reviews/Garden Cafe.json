{"text":"I've driven by this place multiple times during my lunch break and never gave it a chance. Maybe its just hidden so well, or perhaps it looks a bit quiet and uneventful (never go with your first impression, because its usually wrong!). I finally decided to drop by after eyeing the place forever. Since I've had beef shawarma before I wanted to explore something different, so chicken shawarma it was! Also slightly hinted by the waiter. The order was made fast, price was reasonable, and the shawarma was outstanding for an order out. The chicken was super juicy (herbed and spiced out) the pita was thin and crispy, and everything was just wrapped perfectly.  I will have to do a second tour of this location, hopefully a dinner event with SHAWARMA LOVERS."}
{"text":"Wow, Killer Kabob Trio-dish.
The pita served hot at the table with olive oil dipping sauce gets me coming back for that alone. Friendly staff greets you with a smile and service is excellent.

Dog friendly patio"}
{"text":"Me and my workmates slummed to the Tropicana to see the Bodies Scientific Exhibition and got hungry before we had to jet out of town.  The Garden Cafe was the only place that seemed reasonable and was open at 5pm.

WHAT A MISTAKE!

The decor was repellant.  I felt like I was waiting for the Golden Girls to shuffle around the corner.  Ordering was a real ordeal, as the server didn't seem to understand his own menu.

THEN, THE HORROR BEGAN...

Two tables over, a woman gets up and starts projectile vomiting.  She starts to lumber toward our table, which was inconveniently nearest to the loo.  Her hubby seemed completely uninterested and didn't even look up from his plate.  We nearly jumped out of our skin trying to avoid the ersatz Linda Blair hulking down the aisle.  Of course, right when that trauma was over, our server comes over to offer us some soup.  Yeccch!!!

The servers didn't attempt to clean up the mess despite our repeated requests.  Repulsed, we moved to another section to avoid the stench.  The hostess actually had the nerve to come over and to order us back to our table.  EXCUSE ME, MISS?  CAN YA CLEAN UP THE BARF FIRST???  

Disgusted, we bolted instead and vowed to NEVER EVER step foot in such a wretched place."}
{"text":"The lentil soup is DELICIOUS and so are the kabob plates (although not a fan of the garlic mayo dipping sauce that came w/ the kabob plate that I mistook for yogurt sauce). Also, I was totally impressed by the warm flat bread & dipping olive oil (w/ herbs & sesame seeds). It warmed my belly. We are definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Ok good, but service was slow...maybe because I am a single woman...ignored by the waitress for 15 minutes the 1St time..10 minutes..this time..."}
{"text":"We went to this place on a Sunday morning.  They were only serving the breakfast buffet at the time, which is what we wanted anyway.  It was very good and had a decent amount of selections (the buffet) for a small, locally owned place.  The Garden Cafe even has a omelet bar that was very good.  The price is excellent for what you get.  I would much rather come here for a small buffet then go and spend another $3-5 more per person at Golden Corral for a lot of stuff I will not eat anyway.  Plus, eating here helps a local business.  We will be coming back a lot!"}
{"text":"Great lunch special, so yummy. Don't leave without trying the tiramisu & baklava!"}
{"text":"The Garden Cafe is on the end of a mall row right off South Eastern and Just past  Warm Springs. The Cafe is well lit during the day by big windows. The place isn't cluttered or small. There is a lot of room. We were taken by the sparkle. The entire place was scrubbed clean and shiny. So, our first impression walking in the door was that \"These Folks really take their place seriously.\" believe me they sure do.

The menu was very well laid out. It was easy to read and the colors brought many of the items to your attention. When it comes to Mediterranean food I judge by the Tabbouleh. If a place can't put together a well make fresh Tabbouleh we just take out tent down and go home. This wonderful salad of parsley, tomatoes, onion and mint is traditional. At the Garden Cafe it was spectacular. The absolutely freshest and flavorful concoction I've ever had. The base was mounds of chopped parsley, green onion, mint, and tomato. I believe I detected a slight back ground taste of garlic. To this mixture they add fresh lemon juice and olive oil. Tabbouleh (tabouli) is a favorite of mine and there for I speak with some authority when I tell you it is the best I have ever had.

Libby ordered Chicken Kabobs and I the mixed kabobs of beef, chicken, and kafta. Both our platters came with a tasty rice mixture, tomato, onion, and a thin slice of dill pickle spear. The crowning glory of this meal were the pitas. These were perfect, fresh made, puffed, and browned. It was a pure pleasure to put Tabbouleh, onion, tomato and my kafta into a half of a pita and savor the fine combination of flavors. All the meats were hot, juicy, and spiked with flavor.

Our service here was quick, as quick as anything made fresh to order can be. The staff folks were friendly to the point that I really want to go there again just to feel so wanted and among the wonderful people.

Our next trip here will be very soon. I intend to start with some Baba Ghanoug (ghanoush) (eggplant) and then on to more Tabbouleh, and probably Shawarma beef. Maybe I will get to some of the luscious looking Baklava.

All you \"round the world eaters\" don't miss this it is at the top of the list for Mediterranean cuisine or any other cuisine for that matter."}
{"text":"This place is closed as of 2/12/2011.  Really sad to see it go, as it was the only Taiwanese place in Cleveland.  Could it have killed them to offer better service?!?!  I went at least once a week for 4 months until I couldn't take the crappy service anymore."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding, fresh and tasty.  The owner makes fresh pita bread right in front of your eyes and it arrives at your table light and warm!  they have very unusual dishes and the food is unusually fresh.  Everything is very good quality.  The atmosphere is we decorates and clean.  The owner is a very genuine person too."}
{"text":"Food is very good although not as spicy as I would have liked. The service is excellent and they play various middle eastern music videos which are a riot and hip for the culture. We go to this restaurant every time we hit Vegas!"}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if possible. I showed up at 2am with two friends. There was a group of 3 seated and that was it. We were going to order food, but there wasn't a waitress in sight. Finally she asked us our order, so we place our order and asked for a soup to go since our friend was sick  w/ the flu and we wanted to get her soup. Our waitress said \"what are you going to put the soup in, a to-go box?\" We said no, how about a cup. She said that they don't have cups. We asked, \"what does room service use then?\" She said that room service is different. We said the hostess said it was okay for us to order to go. The waitress then walked away and asked the hostess. She returned and said that it was okay so we ordered a cup of soup. 15 minutes later she returned with a styrofoam CUP of soup (the tiny ones). My smart ass boyfriend asked what a cup of soup was and the waitress snapped back, \"I measured it, and this is a bowl of soup.:\" So we complained to the hostess and asked for a manager but there wasn't going to be a manager on duty until the morning. The hostess apologized and said that the cup was the only thing that they had. The food is typical for a cheap casino and thankfully I didn't pay. LOL. To be female :)"}
{"text":"I live in the area and my mom had said that she went here a few days before with my dad and was really good... Nobody acknowledged us as we walked through the doors. We were really confused on what to do,there was no sign to seat yourself or wait to be seated... Then we walked up to the huge menu they had on the wall and two men behind the counter continued on whatever it was they were doing... No hello or wait one moment... Nothing... I work in sales and my husband works at wolf gang puck.. So I'm very big on customer service... You don't have to be perfect at customer service but I mean come on... The grown men there could have said hello? I'm sure the owner wouldn't appreciate how they treated us... So I finally asked \"do we seat ourselves and wait to order or order then seat ourselves?\" And the one man said \"yeah\".... An I was like \"yeah we seat ourselves or yeah we order first\".... Still very confused and annoyed by that point ... Then the man said \"order first\"... Then we ordered the guy took forever and was horrible at taking our order... He didn't even smile or look at us in the eyes... Nothing...we ordered a few things on the menu and the total was about 21 dollars... The man still did little things that bugged me while ordering our food on the computer... Like I asked for just two waters for our drinks and he was like \"ummmm okay that's free....\"I was just thinking Okay??  Like okay i dont care if its free or not? i want a water?... Anyway we finally sat down .. Food came out pretty quickly... Food was amazing!!! We got two salads, humus with bread and some fries... VERY GOOD...nothing about it we didn't like... My mom told me that she was waited on my the owner the last time she had came and he was very nice.... So I'm sure it was just these two men working that in my opinion make the restaurant bad... Costumer serious is \"key\" in my opinion... It made me never want to go back here just because of it...I mean its not that hard to put on a smile and say \"hey what's up guys how's it goin today\"... Is it? Like I said... I'm sure the owner wouldn't be to happy how he treated us..."}
{"text":"Really lovely place. I have been to many Middle Eastern eateries and the proprietor is so kind and accommodating, the place is spacious and clean, the kabab plates are really delicious and all the food is halal. 

I have to eat gluten-free and he made sure to accommodate my disease as much as he could, but beware the rice. The rice has noodles in it and I am unsure whether they are rice noodles or wheat based ones. I ate a few bites before I realized; regardless, it was delicious :) The rice with noodles are actually the ones I prefer when it comes to taste, way better than yellow rice usually served at similar restaurants.

We ordered the kafta kabab plate and the beef/lamb shawarma plate. I preferred the kabab. We also ordered the chicken kabab plate, fetoush salad and hummus to go. The chicken with the garlic sauce was delicious as well.

Loved the traditional pickles and tomatoes that come with the plates. A little bit too much parsley over everything, but that's tradition. Definitely get the pita with the hummus, it you can, and skip the fetoush salad. The salad was kind of sad with few vegetables and mostly iceberg. Overall everything else was so tasty that I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is outrageous, i had a party of 10 people and we were the only ones in the place. The owner i presume takes our order but decides to NOT WRITE it down so he doesn't mess it up the order. instead he just tries to play it by memory.

we wait at least 30 minutes before we get our food, and of course when the food comes out its all the wrong order. the FOOD its self was a very small portion I had the beef and lamb Schwarma which was dry and not enough meat was put in. i paid $2 extra for fries and received literally 7 fries, i counted.

and even when the guy messed up the order and we told him and he still billed us the wrong items. HORRIBLE service, FOOD is over priced. DO NOT GO."}
{"text":"I'll be the happy reviewer and review about my good experiences!

Garden Cafe sells diner type food. So don't expect too much, especially since it's a 24-hour restaurant (not a fancy, up-scale restaurant) Don't even think about bringing your date here if you have a special date planned out. It's a diner like place where hungry people get their munchies on. And especially since it's TROPICANA! Come on, there are nicer hotels than this one, you think food here would be great in a run-down hotel like this??

A lot of my friends got sick of eating at this place, mainly because they ate here 5 times in a row and were too lazy to venture off to some other restaurants. But what do you expect if you keep eating the same type of food 5 times in a row??? Especially at the same restaurant.

Anyway, this place was quick to accommodate a group of .. I don't know how many... a buttload?? 15 people?? 

My waitress was very sweet, friendly and very attentive.

My boyfriend and I shared a Country Fried Steak. And OH my WOOOOORDDD That gravy was DELICIOUS!!! Damn, I hella dipped my biscuits in that gravy because it was BOMB! And that's all I remember from my first trip...

The second trip I ordered a BLT with a side order of scrambled eggs because I felt like havin' some scrambled eggs for brunch. Both were good. My boyfriend ordered a Cream of Mushroom soup, that was very good. I dipped my fries in it, ugh.. so good.

See guys?? This place isn't so bad.. you just have to order the right things.... or maybe you did but you went on a bad day. :0("}
{"text":"Went here today during lunch break and was VERY impressed. The quality of each item we ordered was really outstanding. It's one of those places you go, and literally anything and everything you try is amazing--every item is a perfect specimen of its type--down to the crunchy sweet onions or the flaky fresh bread. And surprisingly, each item costs less than you would get it most anywhere else. I even pulled up some other similar places that I go to often, and as I thought, this place was consistently a few dollars cheaper on every item. I don't know how they can give such good quality for cheaper than their competitor's. I hope a lot of people come here and keep it open, because this place is awesome and I want to try EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"Having now sampled most of the menu, I can now say that the Beef Noodles is the best dish available here.  I can probably wander around the menu and guess at what else is good and what else is just fair...  

I'll definitely be back for another home cooked meal, but there are a couple standouts and a lot of averages... if you know what you're looking for, this place is a 4.  Overall, 3.5"}
{"text":"Ah, the only Taiwanese style restaurant that I know of in Cleveland. One of my favorite menu items is the Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup. It's just one of those staples of Taiwanese cuisine, and it brings back many good childhood memories of summers in Taipei. Good flavor & seasoning.

I gave this restaurant 3 stars based on the menu, which is fairly Americanized. If you ask for the right things like the fried eggplant and deep-fried shrimp, it's bound to be tasty."}
{"text":"I tried it again.  Great food, love their beef and chicken."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast. Door was open and allowing a nice breeze to come through. Got an omelette and toast and ordered a cinnamon role but the waitress forgot to write it down, which was fine cause I had no room for it. Cook delivered food to a table and got it wrong and yelled and complained about it behind the wall. It wasn't a big deal but he was very rude to the waitress and customers could hear him."}
{"text":"I came across this place one day while running to Walmart Neighborhood market and being that I'm a huge fan of Greek food....I went in to check it out. The setting is simple and for very casual dining. The atmosphere is comfortable and the coast is clear for you to bring the kids as the clients are not pretentious. Now for the real reason people read reviews... the prices are wonderful, the food is spectacular and the service is good. Again, this is a casual dining restaurant, however if it is good food your looking for, this is the place! It beats many of the other high priced Mediterranean eateries. Oh and do try the Baklava, wow I was not a fan of this dessert until I ate it there."}
{"text":"I ate here not wanting to wander too far off before my shuttle to the airport arrived. I knew it would be crappy food and the Garden Cafe delivered! It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The decor of the cafe is just as humorous as the rest of the Tropicana.

I didn't, however, order anything out of the ordinary. Chicken Fried steak and biscuits and gravy is what I stuck to. I think if you order anything fancier at a joint like this--you might be suicidal. Naive? Optimistic? One of those. Order safe!

I thought the service was fine. The servers were actually very nice to me. I think it makes a difference if you're not drunk off your ass, 'cause they were a little more severe in their dealings with drunk people that came in. Fascinating theater if fate is smiling on your timing while you eat here!"}
{"text":"OMG, I'm the first to review this place.  My accountant is nearby, so we stopped here for breakfast.

Let's just say I won't be going back - for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Who ever heard of ala carte breakfasts?  Order eggs and toast is a dollar extra?  Juice glasses are a bit larger than a shot glass.

It's now after 1pm and my stomach is still gurgling!  Time for another dose of Pepto!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food and very fresh. They make all their pitta bread from scratch in the restaurant. They even deliver till 10pm. Great for lunch specials under $8."}
{"text":"This place rocks  me so hard. If you don't go check it out, you are missing out on a fantabulous restaurant.
I love Amena and they have the best pita bread, but it turns out Garden Cafe's home made pita bread is right up there with Amena.
They also make fantastic vegetarian food including lentil soup, fuul (omg, yum!), and the best baba ganoush I've ever had. In fact, this place gets lots of superlatives from me.
The only thing I've had that I didn't love was the hummos.
They have backgammon boards and free wifi.
Yum, yum, yum! You will not regret your visit!

p.s. great desserts too!"}
{"text":"The garden cafe was a pleasant change after years of being stuck with Kady's at the Riviera for the last 5 years (organizing a conference doesn't leave a ton of time to escape the hosting hotel).  The biscuits were great, fresh soft and fluffy every time I ordered them.  The meatloaf was nice and juicy, and the accompanying gravy was awesome.  

All in all it was pretty good diner food, without having to leave the hotel, and It's open 24 hours.  The service was kinda of slow, but compared to Kady's, it was great!"}
{"text":"2 Stars for being 24/7! First, I knew not to expect the best or even an average meal. This spot is good for a quick bite, to fill your belly, and in general just for a par to sub par meal. You shouldn't expect the best here. Second, the service echo'd that of a Denny's and same goes the food. I would have rated this 3 stars but to be honest its lower than average. The food will not kill you here so no worries. The diner looked fairly worn. It has seen better times but overall to be open 24/7 you can't complain, I guess."}
{"text":"My experience here summed up in one phrase (spoken by my husband):
\"This tastes like Chinese food my mom tried to make.\"

Hmm (ouch!).  Well, I haven't really tried his mom's cooking, but judging by the actual amount of cooking done back at his parents' home, that's not saying much for this restaurant.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by Taiwanese food in California (and back at home), but the dishes I had were just OK, nothing spectacular, and for the same price I think I could get a lot more (portion-wise) at Siam Cafe or Wonton Gourmet.  Perhaps I should have tried the beef noodle soup instead, but until I do, 3 stars for Garden Cafe."}
{"text":"I agree. This place is good. I have been here a few times and the food is always fresh. I love the Gyros and I have had the plates also. They have good salads. I have had the pizza which is fair and I say that because it is your typical Med-type New-York style pizza which I don't personally care for. So others who like that type of pizza might think it is great. The restaurant is newer and clean along with the bathrooms (another way I judge the restaurants). It is worth a try!"}
{"text":"This Mediterranean restaurant looked to be closed as we arrived, but a waitress indicated it would remain open for another hour.  The interior is large, plain and was totally devoid of customers at 9PM on the Wednesday evening of our visit though one other customer arrived for take out.  I also noticed there were additional tables on the outside patio.  

I ordered the mixed kabob platter, but was told they were out of beef.  We ended up each ordering chicken kabob plates that included rice, pickle, a mayonnaise/lemon sauce and house baked pita bread. The small pieces of chicken were not on kabobs, no ever had been, and the longer we lingered, the drier each tiny morsel became.  The fresh baked pita and service were probably the highlights of our meal."}
{"text":"My b/f and I  ate at the Garden Cafe because we were at the Tropicana and in a rush to eat something before a show, so it was solely out of convenience.

I had a salad that was drenched in soupy dressing.  If you ever get a salad here, do yourself a huge favor and please ask for the dressing on the side.  Otherwise you will probably be fishing pieces of lettuce out of a bowl of dressing.  

My b/f had the meatloaf, which was o.k.  However, we both thought that the mashed potatoes tasted a little strange.

The staff was friendly and served us quickly because we were in a hurry.

I would probably not eat here again unless it was my only option late at night."}
{"text":"I have come here many times while I'm in Vegas since it is close to where I gamble.  The Garden Cafe has excellent, juicy burgers.  This time, we tried the blue plate special of the day and it was fish and chips.  The fish was flaky and excellent, much better than the one I had at Farmer Boys.  The service could use some improvement.  The waiter was excellent at the beginning and then seemed to disappear for 15 minutes.  The bus girl saw that our cups were empty but didn't ask if we wanted refills.  But the food is always good....Service....ummm questionable...."}
{"text":"I just started a job in this area... I went out at lunch to find the good eating establisments.. I was craving a gryo and saw this joint off eastern ave.  I ordered the gyro 4.99 and stuffed grape leaves...  The owners are very nice and accommodating...  The food was ehhhh,, not very good in my opinion...  The gyro was tasteless,, the cucumber sauce was bland and way runny,  they do make a fresh baked pita,, that was ok but overall i was disappointed in the gyro...  The grape leaves were 5.99 for 6, dollar a piece not worth the money... Again the food was bland...   All in all, i was not impressed with this restaurant from the 2 items i ordered...  I would not recommend this place to yelpers..."}
{"text":"1 star for the fries that keep me coming back like a bad itch. Plus one more for the 24 hour bit - for the pure entertainment watching people passed out over their booth. Awesome."}
{"text":"Just had Garden Cafe for lunch and it was really good. The chicken shawarma sandwich was deelish!! It was pretty quiet, but the staff was very nice and personable. I'll definitely be heading back.."}
{"text":"\"What Dust???\"

I am stuck at the crappy Tropicana Hotel here in Vegas on a TKD tournament.  Of course crappy hotel equals crappy restaurants.

Last night after a few drinks my friends and I went here to grab a bite...while we were eating the waiter starts VACUUMING around us!  I understand we're not eating at the Bellagio or Wynn but come on even Denny's don't pull this kinda crap.

So I politely asked him if he could wait until we were done with our meal which he replied, \"Well I have to finish this area.\"  The Manager came (old, crusty white lady) and when I told her the vacuuming caused dust and ruined my meal she said, \"What dust?\"  WHAT DUST!?!?  The crap I'm breathing in between my bites bitch!  Manager then said, \"He needs to work his shift and finish vacuuming\" and basically didn't care about customer service.

I could've raised hell but I decided to save my breath.  I plan on writing a letter to the hotel restaurant department as well as the health department instead.

STAY AWAY!  There's a Deli in this hotel that is tucked away in the corner that serves pizza, hot sandwiches and stuff...and the workers are SWEET and POLITE!"}
{"text":"Kind of thrown off because it was completely empty but everyone's missing it haha! Yum!"}
{"text":"So far, so good.  This is a nice, quiet casual restaurant, and it's in my area.

I've been here a few times and had the following so far:

Combo kabob plate - steak, chicken and a seasoned ground beef. All were well seasoned, moist, tasty .Served with very tasty rice. The dipping sauce looked and tasted like mayo, plain not seasoned, mayo. What the ??!!
Anyway, I got over the shock and enjoyed the rest of this meal.

Another time, I had the falafel and they were perfect to my taste. The tahini sauce was very good.

Their pita was hot from the oven fresh and was served with a olive oil flavored with thyme and sesame seeds."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. We sampled many items. Loved the baba ganoush and the chicken kabob plate was amazing! We will be back soon!

We've been back a few times and still love the place. They have the best kunefes I've ever had! Everything is made from scratch in-house and you can taste it!"}
{"text":"Great friendly Staff. Always a smile and coffee when we sit down. This is not fine dining but  just plain good food. Sunday brunch is well worth the price. (especially the garlic macaroni!) For a local strip mall place to eat, this is it!"}
{"text":"Tried the mixed kabob plate...  excellent flavors.  The server was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Garden Cafe, despite working in the area. We were looking for a new restaurant to give a whirl for lunch so I pulled out my trusty Yelp app and we decided on Garden Cafe. 

We arrived around 12:15 and the place was pretty empty. More people trickled in after we ordered but it wasn't too crowded. My coworkers ordered the gyro lunch special. I set my sites on the lamb schwarma sandwich but at last minute I decided to try the soujouk sandwich with fries and diet soda. The guy taking my order (I presume he was the owner) promised I would like the soujouk and highly recommended it.

Our food came out quickly and everyone was pretty pleased with their meals. I felt the portion size was a little slim for the price, but I definitely didn't feel cheated. The sandwich was tasty, but not the best I've ever had. I'll had to try them again to see if I like any of their other food better. I'd definitely skip the fries next time and opt for a salad or some rice instead. They were definitely lackluster. 

Overall, we had a good meal and I am still looking forward to trying some of their menu items and giving them another chance."}
