{"text":"We've been to this location four times since its opening and it seems like the food and service is faltering. The food quality is inconsistent. The service is inattentive. It's bad enough that soft drinks are not refillable but bringing a second paid drink at the end of the meal is simply unthoughtful. And not once has Lebanese coffee been available. Is this a Lebanese restaurant? I think I'll wait awhile before I return."}
{"text":"I absolute love the Yonge St location. I was so excited when I found out that they were opening another location at Bayview Village. I have been here twice now. The first time, the experience was not very pleasant. The waiter got into an argument with me over what Mill Street Organic beer was, and what he brought me was not it. The food was okay, but the portions were small, compared to their Yonge Street location. I wanted to give them another chance and took my son and his fiancé there for a late lunch. It wasn't that busy, as they were getting ready for dinner service. Service was horrible. It was slow, and it took quite some time to get water, and then to get our orders. While we were waiting for our food, we were expecting the pickle plate and bread. Clearly that was not happening. In fact we had to call our waitress to ask if we were going to get some bread. She said yes and left. We got our food before the bread showed up. They were faster to clear the plates off our table than anything elae.  The Yonge Street location has always been an enjoyable experience. This not so much, which is too bad, as this is a more convenient location."}
{"text":"I have been to this new location three times since it opened a few months ago and I absolutely love it! The Tabule team has done an outstanding job with the decor and of course the food is delicious. Most recently, I had the Fattush salad with chicken and I can honestly say that it was the most flavourful and juicy chicken I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Best chicken liver ever! Finally I made it to Tabule to break my fast me & hubby. We ordered Hummus, Baba Ghanouj, Falafel, chicken liver, lentil soup, Tabule salad, akkawi cheese salad, and main course we shared the Lahme (beef kebob plate). Everything was delicious. Chicken liver better than the ones I tried in Lebanon. The decor is beautiful. Loved the picture of the men in the traditional coffee shop. The bar is definitely a highlight. It gives a nice modern vibe to the restaurant. Service was good, server seemed a bit tired not too chatty or excited but did her job excellent. I like happy waiters, they alleviate your mood. My husband on the other hand is the opposite. He does not like chatty waiters. So it us definitely a preference. Lastly the Morrocan Tea was great with the Mohalabiyi dessert. Loved the tea pots. Very nice touch."}
{"text":"I got the Fattoush salad and added grilled chicken. The add on on the menu is approximately $5 for the chicken but the waitress also mentioned that you could pay more for the skewered chicken. I decided to get the cheaper option - but that was a big mistake. Someone else ordered the skewered chicken with the rice, and it was significantly better.  Both types are white meat, but the skewer chicken is a lot juicier and tender, so don't make the same mistake as me!  As you can see, the salad doesn't have lettuce or anything. It's all chopped vegetables like cucumber and tomato - I thought that this was kind of different. There were pita chips that was an added bonus. Without the chicken, I personally would have found the salad a bit plain. I also got the baba ganouj, and I'm not much of an expert, but I thought it tasted pretty good!   Lovely environment. I went there for lunch but I think they do dinner as well. As it's located inside of Bayview Village and there are people passing by it does have a bit of a casual feel but the sitting area is really nice and comfy.   The waitress was also very friendly and welcoming to us, the service was great."}
{"text":"Came here couple times for dinner and I was very impressed with this place. I see a lot of reviews talking about the service, but I didn't have too big of a problem during any of my visits. They could be a bit slow when it's busy, but not enough to annoy you.   We always get their falafels. It's definitely one of the better ones I've had! It's nice and crispy on the outside.   We tried the kafta and the grilled shrimp this time. They were both really good and really filling. I usually don't like how much rice these dishes usually come with, but they make the rice really flavourful here."}
{"text":"I came here after trying out their restaurant in leslieville . This location is a far cry compared to our experience at Leslieville. The first thing you will notice is how noisy this restaurant is. It was loud! I was literally shouting in order to speak to my guests. The next thing is this location seemed cheap in comparison. They skipped out on small things like bread, pickles, dips and yogurt. The only saving grace was the food which was good and on par with Leslieville ."}
{"text":"I really, really wish I could give this place 5 stars because the food is always impeccable, but they are extremely disorganized here. I get that it's a new location, but it's been a few months now and takeout is still an absolute nightmare. You wind up waiting at the counter when your food should already be done for another 20 minutes while they try to locate your order, then neglect to also provide cutlery. Clean up the takeout process (and have people on the phone taking the orders who aren't rude and snappy), and it's 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"Service was really bad. We asked to delay with  our mean course it came before we finish our appetizers. My husband asked 3 people for another drink. No one came and asked how was our food or fill our water classes. Beside the food was just ok. We will not be back. And i would not recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been to two locations out the three. As far as the appetizers are concerned I liked the trio, Tabouli salad, Baba ganoush, and Hummus which is delicious...for the main dish I had the Lamb Kabob, I've had better but it was decent nonetheless. All and all it's a good restaurant especially the one in the Bayview Village but a bit overpriced"}
{"text":"Visited Fri Feb 24 dinner for 2.  This place just opened a few weeks ago after being under construction for several months, this location is not even listed on their corporate website yet! You're hearing about it on Yelp first!  We sat on the patio area, which is like a dining area in the hallway of Bayview Village. The inner dining room was packed and it would have been a 30 min wait. There was a mix of people of various cultures eating here which was very surprising. There is a large bar in the centre of the restaurant.    Pros Tabule - very fresh and tasty. One of their signature dishes since the restaurant is also named Tabule.  Fried eggplant - comes with 6 pieces, they looked really dark/burnt. Once you bite into the eggplant, it melts in your mouth. Kefta - comes with 6 pieces of meat, very tender and flavourful.   Cons The noise level is a bit high since it's open to the mall. Some of the menu items were very foreign to me, so take your time to ask questions about the menu.  Not sure why ice cubes came in a separate cup, usually ice water just comes with the ice in the water.  Not much privacy on the patio. You wouldn't believe the number of shoppers that would be eyeing the new restaurant and the interesting food we were eating.  Location has been very busy, may be tough to get a table during peak times.   Protip - Watch as they pour water from the traditional ibrik.    Damage = $33 before tip."}
{"text":"Took my family here on a Friday night, no reservations between 6-8pm on Fridays so keep that in mind. We decided just to walk in and ended up waiting 30 mins so wasn't too bad and were seated by 6:45ish. Just go earlier the better for larger groups  The best part of going with more people is trying a lot of the menu at one time! It was our first time so everything was a new experience and this is what my review is based off of.   We started with the sampler platter of hummus, babaganuj, and labni. The labni was the wild card and ended by being everyone's favorite! Should definitely try!   Followed up by falafel (6 pcs app) which everyone loved. Super crunchy exterior which I liked. Then there were the garlic shrimp in a spicy tomatoey sauce. Only 5 pcs, was good but norm worth $13.50.  If you ordered mains Only, you might be in for a long wait. You migh want some apps to keep your stomach from eating itself.   For mains we tried the kefta, tawuk (chicken), lamb, and fish of the day (sea bass). Kefta and lamb were the best IMO, chicken was a bit dry, and I personally don't like fish with small bones when I'm hungry. It was good though with crispy skin and good flavour. The buttery rice and grilled veggies with the mains were to notch!  We tried the VEGAN LEBANESE RICE PUDDING and MÜHALABIYA, no one particularly enjoyed it - better off getting ice cream at Laura Secord, but YMMV.  Overall, a great place to try something new!"}
{"text":"pretty good.  my family and bf enjoyed our meal.  to be honest it was good food.  presentation was alright.  ive seen better in comparison other restaurant food decor.  overall a good experience but im being a bit kind with the rating.  the dinner proportions could have been better...more veggies less rice but the taste was good."}
{"text":"I mean, the prices aren't astronomically high, but they aren't super cheap either. I eat a lot of Middle-Eastern food in Scarborough, where it's authentic and cheap, so I'm not quite sure what I was expecting from here, other than nicer ambiance than I'm used to.  Between five people, we ordered the sampler platter ($14.95), the hallum salad ($10.95), the ma'anek ($7.50), the grilled salmon kebabs ($18.95), the lahmeh ($18.95), and the eggplant main ($15.50). We weren't starving when we left, but we weren't particularly full either.   The sampler platter sounds more impressive than it actually is. You get to choose three out of the four items: hummus, babaganoush, tabule, and labni. We got the first three. For $14.95, I'm not at all impressed with the portion. The hummus was alright, but I prefer Me Va Me's. I like the babaganoush here more because it's got a more smokey eggplant taste, but my dad preferred Me Va Me's. I can't comment on the tabule because I was on a strict no-sour no-bitter food diet that day, so I played it safe. The platter did come with an endless supply of whole wheat and white pitas, but that only does so much to impress me when the sit down Me Va Me at Bathurst and Steeles does an endless supply of freshly baked laffa. I'm comparing this to basically the exact same dish at Me Va Me, if you're wondering why I keep dropping that name. There are more options there to sample from as well...  The hallum salad was arugula and cheese. It's the least attractive salad starter I've seen at an establishment of this caliber. More color and texture would have helped a lot. The hallum was the saltiest I've ever had. I love arugula so I can't complain there. My aunt rather enjoyed this. I did as well, but it could have been much better.  The ma'anek is marketed as ground beef with Middle Eastern spices and pine nuts. They're cocktail wiener sized little sausages. They were tasty, but for like 6-7 sausages, they're rather overpriced. The predominant spice was cinnamon here.  We substituted the rice that came with the salmon kebabs for salad. Bad idea. Dad said the salad was really sour. The salmon wasn't dry, but it doesn't stand out for being amazing either. Two skewers here, if I recall correctly.  The lahmeh, two veal tenderloin skewers, came with rice and grilled veggies. There could have been more rice. All in all, a very solid dish, but I could get similar for at least $5 cheaper, so I expected to be more impressed.  The eggplant was our favorite of the night. It was drizzled with tahini and came on a bed of mujaddara (lentil and onion rice) and topped with pomegranate seeds. This was rather pretty. The eggplant is fried straight up, and it's juicy and delicious. I'm a sucker for fried eggplant. The mujaddara was a hit with everyone. We could have ordered a few more of these. This was alright for the price, I think, but it still could have been significantly cheaper.   With my cousin's Caesar, we came to about $110 before tips, I think. Not including the Caesar, I think I could have had a meal of a similar caliber for about 3/4 of the price elsewhere, but for the location, I suppose it's alright."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch soon after they opened. This location is conveniently located at Bayview Village so there's ample parking. Also, I doubt you'll ever need to wait for a table since there are so many other restaurant options close by.   We didn't make reservations but were still seated quickly. We got the hummus to share. My friend got the chicken and I got the tenderloin kebab. The chicken came with lentil rice, which was absolutely delicious. If I could have got a plate of just the rice alone, I would have been happy. Despite the awesome rice it came with, the chicken was dry and lacked flavour. My tenderloin, on the other hand, was good but the rice side it came with was bland.   Overall I don't think I will be back. Unless I'm already shopping at the mall and craving Middle Eastern food, I would likely go elsewhere. It's not a spot to visit just for the food.   Service was friendly. I asked for hot sauce and received it promptly, so no complaints in the service department!"}
{"text":"It is kind of difficult to find in the mall, considering there's no entrance from the outside. It took us awhile to get around.  The staff was super friendly. The place had a soothing ambiance. We decided to share several dishes between the two of us. Tried the roasted cauliflower, barbecued meat, hummus dip, and cabbage rolls. The prices are fairly reasonable if you decide to go the shareable route, otherwise, dishes for one can be on the pricier side and not as filling. I think this experience is meant for trying a variety of foods.  Nonetheless, it was a good first experience trying Middle Eastern food. The first of many."}
{"text":"I would give this location a much lower rating than the downtown location. For the most part, their small plates were consistent. Fried cauliflower and hummus were good, but the pita was not warm. However, pretty hard to mess up these two things...  We also had the eggplant main with mujdarrah. It was not good (and it normally is amazing at the other location). Vegetables were BARELY grilled (I.e. Huge chunks of raw onions = very bad news). The rice was way too over cooked. I regret not sending it back.   Please, step up the game. It's offensive to your loyal customers and your brand."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"catch of the day\" and i got a tiny sad  3 ounce fish with some cold fried rice and literally 3 pieces of vegetables  but that is besides the point because when the bill came the fish was $28 every other fish on the menu was $15-18 what made this tiny fish $28 is beyond me. Super disappointed with the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I'll start be saying that this place has WiFi but refuses to provide the password to customers.  How cheap can you be?  We were told to use the mall's WiFi - WiFi which we weren't able to connect to at all - or use the next door neighbour's WiFi - which while it connected, for some reason was extremely spotty in connection.    Food quality could use improvement.  The salad and entree veggies should have been washed better, as there was sand/soil in them.    Coffee - nice flavour and they had soy and coconut milk selections (good!), but was served luke warm.    The beef/lamb meat in the entree I ordered was overcooked and dry."}
{"text":"Food okay, service bad!!! Our waitress took 15 minutes to come and take drink orders, and then another ten minutes for her to bring water only for one person and wine for me. Don's restaurants give water to every single person sitting on the table?. I won't go again even I live just across the street!"}
{"text":"Much to my surprise, their drinks list was good and their  dishes were flavorful, even without spice.  I am not a Mediterranean cuisine person,  and  definitely not a spice lover,  but there were more than enough choices for me. Their dishes with  meat on skewers rice were very good.  The  meat was  not  dry and  the rice  was  flavourful.  Service was a tad slow but I had my wine so that was OK.  Busy place.  Right fit among tables."}
{"text":"Really love the food and vibe at their restaurants. I've been to the one downtown and this recently opened inside Bayview village. Ordered Kubbe and hummus , both were well seasoned and delicious . Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Fast service, pretty tasty food, and a nice atmosphere for a restaurant situated inside a mall with no windows."}
{"text":"I took my friend here for a birthday lunch and I won't be returning. From the moment I entered, the vibe was snooty and unfriendly. Besides the fact that it is very over-priced for what you get.....4 bucks for tea....are you shitting me!!! Our server was bordering on rude. No correction: she was rude. When 2 of the items my friend asked for were unavailable and she was perplexed by this, the server raised her voice and said that the reason for this was that all the food was fresh. I thought this was a given in a decent restaurant. She should have been offered a rain check never mind a lecture. The food was OK.  Very small portions for the mezze. Not meant for sharing as if customary in most Middle Eastern places. Then, when I gave the server, $60 on a $35 bill + 20% top,  she had the nerve to come back and accuse me of only giving her $40. Guess I didn't look hoity toity enough for this less than middling place. I hope they took my photo because they'll never see me again."}
{"text":"Tabule has been around in Toronto for quite some time, and I've never had the chance to try to eat at one because their 2 other locations were not exactly convenient for me. Now that they have opened one up right at the mall I live next to, I officially had no more excuses and was very much looking forward to the meal I had tonight given all the good things I have heard about them.  The restaurant itself looked ok, decor is modern but unremarkable. I chose to sit at the bar area given I was dining alone. I ordered a pint of Beau's Lugtread (overpriced at $9/pint), and based on the recommendations by the bartender/server, I had a falafel starter with some whole wheat pita bread.   There were 6 falafels per order ($6.50). I was immediately disappointed when I took the first bite - the falafel had an overly crunchy shell, with very hard rough bits that gave a somewhat unpleasant chew. Inside, the chickpea was bland and the tahini did not add any flavor. It was very much a case of \"I wish I had ordered something else\". The whole wheat pita bread was cold and hard - I definitely have had way better elsewhere.  For my main course, I ordered the lamb chops, their most expensive item at $26.95 (this was before I tasted anything). I was hoping that by ordering their most premium item, I would get to see how truly great their food is. After the disappointing falafel, I was really hoping the lamb chops would be better.   The lamb chops themselves came medium rare, just how I ordered it (good). The chops tasted like it was grilled with a flame and had a pleasant taste (good). The rice, onions and zucchini it came with are quite ordinary. Overall, I found the dish \"ok to eat\", but I had expected better at that price point - it would have been a much fairer price if it was ~$23.  Overall, I found Tabule (at Bayview Village) to be rather \"meh\" and somewhat over-priced for what they are serving. It could totally be a case of them still trying to find their footing given how new this location is, but personally I am not going out of my way to try the other locations on the off-chance they \"might\" be better.   All the good reviews associated with this Tabule seem to be with the cold and hot mezze dishes. I am open to trying this place out one more time to re-evaluate. But until then, this would be a borderline 3-star restaurant for me."}
{"text":"I've come here 3 times and it's simply because we were in the mall and didn't want to go far for lunch or dinner. The first time was for Mother's day. The prix fix menu was very good. However, after that event I kept becoming more and more disappointed about the food.  The Hallum salad was too salty and the cheese was burned! The service is always alright and the waiters have been friendly and helpful.   The is nothing special about the dishes anymore. I tried the shrimp, and Mezzas, then asked myself why did I come here again. The only edible dish in my opinion remains the lamb chops, but I've definitely tried better lamb chops elsewhere in Toronto. Sorry to say that I'm no longer a customer here."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and the place was packed! The server was extremely slow and a little rude but would smile after being rude .. it's confusing .. He needs to get fired! The food was delicious!  We got falafels, lamb skewers and salmon skewers! The rice was so flavourful!  For dessert we all got the toasted honey ice cream.. and as I'm typing this my mouth is watering!! The reason I didn't give 4-5 starts is because of the service! The food took forever and the staff was rude!  Also.. if your serving tap water for your guests maybe don't make it so obvious that's what your using ... I watched them put tap water into fancy jugs all night .. yet they were stingy filling out glass up with the water!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with friends and enjoyed their food.  Their cauliflower appetizer they had was really good.  I had the falafel plate and love the rice that comes with the meal. It's thin and good.  The portions are good too. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"The whole experience did not begin well. The reception had not entered our 1.15pm lunch reservation. Thankfully there was space.   The service today was very slow although the restaurant was not full for lunch.   The arnabeet was undercooked, and the appetizer soup came very late.   Overall, the service needs a re-boot. The Yonge Street location is so much better."}
{"text":"Sample Platter, $14.00, served with warm pita bread.  Which consisted of Hümmus (chickpea purée, lebanese tahini sauce, fresh lemon juice & a touch of garlic), Babaganüj (puréed BBQ eggplant mixed with lebanese tahini, garlic and fresh lemon juice), and Labni homemade (Lebanese yogurt cheese mixed with garlic & topped off with za'atar). I was pleasantly surprised that my favourite dip would be the Labhi.  Tabülè (hand chopped parsley salad with whole wheat bulgur, tomatoes, onions and a hint of mint tossed in a light lemon & olive oil dressing).  We got to sample a platter of grilled meats consisting of Tawük (grilled marinated chicken breast that is hormone and antibiotic free), Lahmeh (Ontario veal tenderloin), and Grilled Lamb Chops. Everything was served with rice and house salad, the rice was nicely flavoured and fluffy, I could be buckets of.  We ended off the meal with some Middle Eastern tea and sweets.  Baklavas are bite-sized sweets made with phyllo pastry, honey, pistachio and cashews, $5.75. It was my first time trying Künafa Ashta (phyllo pastry layered with custard and topped off with rose water syrup), $6.95, at it was absolutely delicious. I am 900% sure I polished off the plate by myself and I would definitely revisit Tabülè just for this dessert alone.  The space is gorgeous and inviting with touches modern elegance and splashes of colour and gold all over, a super Instagramable room! The front of the restaurant has table seating as well, giving you the feeling of sitting on the patio without all the elements of the weather. The atmosphere, service, hospitality, food and drinks were amazing - I can't wait to be back for a fancy relaxed meal."}
{"text":"Have been a fan of their Yonge and Eglinton location for awhile so was looking forward to finally trying at their mall location.  Only went for lunch so difficult to compare entrees.  The atmosphere is a bit sterile but the food tasty.  Our table had fatoushe salad, eggplant and vine leaves.   Service could use a bit more polish (if you ask if we would like pita and we say yes don't forget to give it to us).  By far surprisingly one of the best things I had was a fantastic cappuccino!  Definitely will go back but one major flaw. They do not take reservations. Mall or not I don't want to show up to find out its a long wait."}
