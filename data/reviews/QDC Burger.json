{"text":"The burger was like heaven in your mouth!  If you're in Montreal this is a must check out place, only here do they do high end burgers in a back alley and do it so well.   Cheeseburger was awesome and the poutine was good.   If you need a snack before your late night dinner reservation in Montreal, then I suggest coming here for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Located behind Queue de Cheval this is the \"kids' table\" version of its more upscale predecessor. You'll barely find this burger bar and only because of the  EDM blasting into a backstreet alley... doesn't get anymore hipster than this. You can even dine right next to the dumpster to channel your inner hobo-chic.   You order off a paper menu with golf-pencil sized pencils (they're not actual golf pencils)... Mostly out of necessity since you can't really hear anything at the counter from the speakers blasting the EDM. But that's just all part of the fun! Once you're done soaking in the experience and get over the fact that you're in a backstreet alley basically in a parking lot, you can get to the food... Steakhouse quality meats without the sticker shock!  Don't be fooled by its bare bones concept, this burger bar hosts a robust menu with very enticing burger selections. They also offer poutine and non beef options such as chicken, ahi tuna and salmon burgers. I opted for the ahi tuna burger which came with a generous piece of ahi tuna topped with seaweed salad, cucumber, tomato chutney, mushrooms and wasabi aioli (which I skipped since I have hypersensitive tatste buds). This was a solid option-  a huge chunk of ahi tuna with the perfect blend of toppings (I admit, I'm a sucker for seaweed salad).    My husband had the Jefferson- a burger topped with short rib and an egg! (oh yea and sautéed mushrooms, cheese and Bearnaise).  How is that even possible? It's probably only legal in Canada, so if you find yourself in Canada, don't miss out on it! The sound that came out of my husband's mouth after the first bite was pure bliss!   We paired all of this with poutine- not the best I've had but it hit the spot. This will definitely make our list of \"Musts in Montreal\". And I echo the sentiment: thought of not reviewing just to keep it under wraps (or hidden in a dark alley in this case)."}
{"text":"I had a salad. It was the worst I have ever had. A head of lettuce cut in 5 or 6 big chunk a few slice of cucumber and a bit of dressing over it. Simply awful. Considering the price, I call this screwing people."}
{"text":"The burger patty is over-spiced that it masks all other flavors. The burger is very messy and difficult to handle."}
{"text":"Wow the burger was amazing! First off I had 4 people in front and still received my burger in under 15minutes. When I first got it the wrapper was nice and warm from the toasty buns and the I didn't add any basic condiments... obviously! I put extra garlic aioli:) then first bite juice dripping but not to much. Meat bursting with flavour and the caramelized onions with the pork belly! Not to thick just perfect! Just add a dr.pepper to that and you'll be good! I had the lefty! You will not be disappointment. Also had the onions rings very good I would have rather had smaller ones but still amazing! Thank you! Next time adding that black truffle."}
{"text":"Where do I start?!?  This place blew my mind and my tastebuds!!!  I have so far just tried three burgers and they are all the best burgers I have ever had! The quality is unbeatable and for such reasonable prices!  The service is also great! The guys working here are friendly, polite and so efficient!  A MUST TRY while in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I would have never found this place if not for yelp. It's really in a back alley, but quite a cool place.   I just went for a vanilla milkshake, which was good. The guy behind the counter was not very clear at communicating what he was doing (turned out he went for the ice cream), but he wasn't unfriendly.   I'll probably go back to try their onion rings and perhaps a burger."}
{"text":"Yum  Quick easy and delish   The window staff are funny personable and adorable.  Very helpful suggestions.   Bun is crazy good!! Crazy!  Check it out you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for business and thought I'd pop out for a pizza. Couldn't find a place in the area that fit my mood, and became a little frustrated. While walking through a parking lot a saw a small crown and some benches so I checked it out. Parking lot burgers? C'mon now I said to myself. That's crazy talk. Then the guy behind the counter asked if I'd ever been. \"No\", I says to the guy. He hands me a menu. The prices scared me off a little, but hey, since I couldn't find pizza what did I have to lose? I ordered a 1/2 pounder with fries, and hoped to hell I didn't have buyer's remorse over a parking lot burger. A couple who was also getting a bite said that the burgers here sell for something like $50 in the restaurant that is attached to this little parking lot storefront. Pondering this, I went back to my hotel.  Once inside, I realized I'd missed the Jays scoring 4 runs and I cursed. This burger better make up for what I missed. The first thing I noticed was the smell. The bun, complete with a branded steer on the top, was garlic buttered and lightly toasted. The burger itself was moist and tasty. I had another bite and suddenly didn't care if I took a breath, as long as I got more of this delicious burger. Wanting to look forward to more of it, I turned my attention to the fresh cut fries. Man, they were fried in clean oil and lightly sea slated. The paper bag they came in was also a nice touch, especially considering where I purchased this meal. Now back to the burger....bite after bite, with the words, \"Goddamn!\" being uttered, I finished it off. I was now wearing some of the burger juices but I didn't care. I'd have to do laundry anyway. The important thing was that I'd discovered a hidden gem in a parking lot in Montreal I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is legit! We shared five burgers, two fries, and poutine between eight people and it was fatty nirvana.  The restaurant is a walk up concept with benches and squatty tables all lined up outside the storefront. Beautiful!  I can't really make a recommendation because I'm convinced every burger option is excellent. Count on it being a little messy, beautifully dressed, and topped with atypical extras like fried eggs, shrimp, and pork belly.  For lunch or dinner or fatty snack, QDC is a must stop for those traveling in Montreal."}
{"text":"Even if the burger I received was not dry, overcooked, and tasteless, and even if I was able to receive my full order instead of only getting one out of four items ordered after waiting for forty minutes, and EVEN IF I was able to get a full refund for the food I ultimately had no more time to wait for instead of getting ripped off by a penny pinching manager - nothing on earth could save this place from the abysmal service we received.   It's rare that service actually enrages me, but this happened here. It's not that staff are incompetent either; they simply lack any sense of consideration, tact or customer service. We watched as dozens of other customers waited around, frustrated, that no one was even trying to get orders out to them. As we waited for our refund we actually found out our burgers were just sitting there, and no one had thought to serve them to us. As soon as the guy who took our order saw we were getting a refund from the manager, he demanded \"You don't want em?\" and immediately called his friend over to take them off his hands. Classy.   It's no wonder this is a \"hidden\" burger joint - if it were better, people might actually care enough to talk about it. QDC should be ashamed to that this is what their name is attached to these days."}
{"text":"Surprised that this place had so many ravishing reviews. We had a lot of expectations from this place but we were greatly disappointed by the taste of the burgers.  I had the Surf n Turf Burger ($15.99+tax) which had 1/2lb steak patty and shrimp. I found the burger to be extremely dry for my taste. It had no cheese or sauce and literally tasted like bunch of fried protein in a salt. No flavour whatsoever. And the bun was so dry that the ceiling of my mouth is chaffed.   We also had Poutine with Short Ribs.($9.00+tax) which was extremely salty to say the least. If there's anything like a bad combination of ingredients, this would be it.   My boyfriend ordered a \"make your own\" which didn't work out for him as well but since wasn't QDC's own recipe, can't say much about it. The bun was dry obviously.  I also wanted water so they gave me a tiny, liliput sized EVIAN water bottle which cost $3.50+tax.   All in all we ended up spending around $30 each including tips which is so NOT worth it for a place like this. Especially since Montreal has a lot of nice Burger joints. The only thing I liked about this place was its shack-like ambience but they have truly horrible food quality!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to getting my burger fix. I still need my burger fix :( mediocre 10$ burger. The same if it was 5$. I had the chef's burger with Lettuce, tomato and pickle. I'm about the burger not the dressing. To make a long rant shorter... \"Meh\" not worth the money and didn't satisfy the craving for a burger."}
{"text":"Had the short rib poutine.  Nothing great.  Lots of gravey, but it made the fries too soggy.  At least it wasn't too salty.  The meat was like finely ground beef.  Not at all what I expected.  It was not worth $14.99, but everything at these airport food venues were $$$."}
{"text":"This review is going to be short, but, accurate ;).  A definite must have burger!  The meat itself is so flavourful that once the burger was 75% eaten, I came to realization that I haven't even put a drop of condiment!  And I'm usually a ketchup queen!  And the shortrib poutine was out of this world!  Just mouth-dropping, insanely good!  This place has earned its crown with me as the best burger in town!    I was expecting the food to be salty, but, nope! Well done! *thumbs up"}
{"text":"Best burger I can remember ever having.  The mob burger is a must get.  Also the poutine is solid too"}
{"text":"Stuck here for 24 hours during the snowstorm so naturally we had lots of time to walk around and explore the restaurants. The large number of burger options stood out to us and we ended ordering two Leftys and the Jefferson.   Both the burgers came out in about 10-12 minutes and were pretty good considering this is airport food. I was going to order the steak and frites at first but was told that all burger and steak meat had to be cooked well or well done and couldn't be medium rare. And that the steak portion is a mere 4 oz. In Texas that's unheard of and we can't even order a steak that small, but of course we're not in Texas anymore.  The patties had good flavor and the sweet sautéed onions and thick cut bacon was the highlight of the burger."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero star review I would give it. Let's not even talk about ambience because this place isn't meant to have any. You are literally eating in a parking lot on a bench. It's okay. I can handle that, it is part of the \"charm\".  We had tickets to a show at 8pm. We arrived at 6:45, we ordered by 7:00. That is, at 7:00pm we handed a guy at the cash 7 pieces of paper with 7 names and 7 SIMPLE orders! At 7:00pm we paid $120 for 7 burgers, 1 poutine, 2 fries and 7 drinks. Now the money isn't an issue because of the food is good, I'm okay paying a higher price. I mean just because you are eating in an alley doesn't mean the food should taste like it came from a dumpster right?   Around 7:30 we are starting to get frustrated. Literally no orders are coming out. We went up to the window numerous times to get an ETA and we get no response. Finally they give us 6 burgers (apparently of their choosing because it certainly wasn't what we ordered and they shorted us one),1 fry, and a poutine. Now I go to the window and give them back 3 incorrect burgers and explain that my burgers are wrong and missing. Manager asks what's missing. I tell him. They start making my burger and the manager goes out to talk to his friend who shows up at 7:45 wanting a meal! The line cook asks what I want, I tell him (although I just told the manager), then another line guy asks what I want. As I'm explaining what I want the manager yells out to his cooks \"I need these 2 burgers ASAP\"! Guess what? He wasn't talking about MY burgers he was talking about his friends burgers!!!! At this point it is nearly 8pm, there are dozens of people waiting for their food and the manager wants to pass his friend in front of me? A cook asks \"where do I start\" and I yell out \"with my 3 missing burgers\" and I gave my order for the umpteenth time that night.   At 7:55 I am shovelling a burger in my mouth. Somehow even after saying my order as the guy is making it, it's still wrong! It's dry, the bun is over cooked and the entire thing tastes like what I imagine rank ass to taste like. Into the garbage it went as I walked to the Bell Center. Hell, who needs a comedy show when you can just watch QDC fail miserably under pressure.  $120 for an hour long wait, horrible and dry burgers that came all wrong. Next time McDonalds before a show because this place was a huge let down! I still can't get over the fact that while there are angry, frustrated, hungry and paying customers who have been waiting for an hour at at your window complaining a MANAGER shouts out that his friend's order has priority! No thanks. I would have asked for a refund but I doubt the manager would be able to figure out how to do that either."}

Quand tu sors du bar le vendredi à 3AM, et que tout est fermé sauf ton estomac qui est bel et bien éveillé. Il fait un gros soleil et tu n'as pas envie de t'enfermer à l'intérieur pour luncher en faisant ton shopping? Ou tout simplement, tu veux un burger? Histoire de bien saturer ton estomac, rends-toi dans le parking du Queue de Cheval et fait connaissance avec les burgers les plus décadents de l'histoire. Le concept est parfait: T'as un trou dans un mur, avec un caissier et un cuisinier, et ils te donnent le choix de construire ton burger selon tes envies ou de savourer l'une de leurs créations. Le pain est étampé du logo du restaurant, la boulette est plus grosse que ta main, et la qualité de la viande est incomparable. Le side de frites, partage-le à deux, parce que je te promets que tu auras pas assez faim.

{"text":"AMAZING!!! I happened to come here based on a random search for a good Burger place. Your first visit here should be anything but random, this place is literally a hidden Burger treasure. The staff are great and the burger combinations have been put together by a chef with a discerning palate. I enjoyed the  Surf and Turf Beef, Spicy Shrimp, Caramelized Onions, Garlic Aioli, Arugula and Tomato Chutney! This was a flavour explosion with perfectly balanced and complimentary ingredients. I tend to try a lot of burgers but QDC burger is my favourite Burger spot of all. Do yourself a favour if you have a gourmet burger craving, check out this spot... WOW!"}
{"text":"Food - 4 Service - 4 Price - 3 Atmosphere - 4  I just cant put my finger on it but It seems like burgers in Canada are so much better than at home. Shout out to Veronica because the Lefty Burger was off the hook. I wish they didn't run out of foie gras because I think that would have been a great addition to a burger. I know its an airport burger but I really thought it was good. Pricey but good."}
{"text":"I was fortunate to discover QDC based on a beautiful picture posted on a Facebook. My friend was kind enough to share the secret - QDC, back alley.   I don't recall what I ate because it was a full year ago, but it was memorable enough for me to recommend to a friend heading there very soon. It was messy, delicious, and perfectly filling. Fries were great too, though some fell. Lucky pigeons."}
{"text":"Talk about disappointing. First of all they screwed up our order and couldn't find out original order form. If I say that you made my burger wrong, it shouldn't even matter what the order form said.   Got the 1/4 pounder with egg and braised beef. Braised beef turned out to be just shredded slop. Burger had no flavor and might be one of the top 10 worst burgers I've ever had in my life.   Don't fall for the hype folks."}
{"text":"Pizza, shrimp, brisket-- All can be on your burger-- Eat livin the dream.   Every single burger is delicious and different and amazing. You can't go wrong.   The poutine and the fries were the best I had in Montreal.  The ambiance... well... It's more like a place you would get mugged while hiding the fact that you're stuffing a giant delicious burger in your face right after your crossfit workout.   I was only sad that I didn't get to eat here twice."}
{"text":"Burgers are pricey, but they are top shelf. Great taste, great variety, friendly staff. I go once a week when the weather is warm.   UPDATE: Came to pick up some burger this evening, very excited for this luxury. The guy in the window was such a downer. No smile, didn't speak, I asked him questions and he maybe spoke 3 words to me. Really rubbed me the wrong way because normally the person in the window here is full of positive energy, and this knocks the experience down a notch. Please train your employees, and to the window guy: lighten up."}
{"text":"Good airport food. Casual setting. Meal took about 15 minutes to get to me. I recommend the KONG. Obviously it's not cheap because you're trapped in an airport. Besides that standard problem with all airport food pricing it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Three stars for the exception well service! Burger was bad When we got there, we found it that the take out window was closed and it is now served in queue de Cheval restaurant.  The service was so attentive!  However, I got the pepperoni burger, it was super salty, I couldn't even finish half of it. Ad the onion ring was really odd, really big.  I wouldn't go back for the burger, but maybe for the steak at Queue de Cheval"}
{"text":"QDC Burgers opened its doors at Pierre-Elliot Trudeau airport last March 2016 & is located inside the airport after passing customs. They have a menu of 8 burgers with different variety flavors for the meat lovers. You have the possibility of adding more to the burger but with more cost of course. I hadtthe opportunity of tasting three different burgers & I have to admit they were all deliciousss but pricey. If you're on a budget abstain from going there. More & more restaurants are opening at the airport that are pricey but worth the stop. This is not your average burger place, you need to wait a bit to get your food.  Good eating..."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Ingredients are good but the burger is poorly crafted and the bun was cold and soggy. Didn't even finish the burger... the poutine's gravy is not good."}
{"text":"Not a bad burger but not exceptional. Service was good, price was slightly expensive as in every airport restaurants. We got a 20% discount as there was a promo going on, otherwise this place is quite expensive.  Had Jefferson burger (patty short rib fried egg) plus fries and milkshake.  Value is 3 out of 5"}
{"text":"Had The Mob burger -  pepperoni, sautéed mushrooms, mozzarella, Spicy harissa tomato sauce and truffle oil.  Wow far from your traditional burger but a must try.  Fries were excellent as well"}
{"text":"My flight got delayed and I was walking around the new International Terminal and found this gem across from Montreal Bagels. It didn't seem special at first, but after reviewing their menu on a small piece of cardboard paper, my mouth started watering up and knew this was the place to be! I wasn't too hungry so I made a Classic Burger with an extra pan fried egg ($1.09) and added Garlic aioli ($.99) - it was one of the best burgers I've had! Being in an airport you would expect over priced food, but this was priced just right. My burger came out to $10 plus tax which is descent for being in the airport. My friend got the KONG Ahi Tun burger and it was intense, it was a bit more expensive ($15.99 + tax) but well worth it (that's what he said). From looking at the ingredients embedded within his burger, I regretted not getting the KONG. It came with Grilled yellowtail tuna, Asian marinated cucumbers, wakame, tomato chutney, oyster mushrooms, wasabi aioli. Would definitely be back during my next airport visit. Apparently they have another restaurant in Montreal, so you can try their delicious burgers without buying a flight ticket."}
{"text":"(Dined 08/05/16 F @ 8:00pm): \"Give me a 'Q' (QUALITY); give me a 'D' (DELICIOUS); give me a \"C\" (CANADIAN) - what does that spell...!?  Along with my oldest niece on a several-hours layover from Los Angeles to Rome, I sought out properly-prepared Canadian poutine and came across QDC Burger. I was amazed that none of the other eateries in this wing of the airport served any! Having been disappointed with the majority of poutine offerings here stateside, would I make a beeline in this direction again if I were to fly out of this terminal!?:  Molson Canadian Lager Beer 5.0% ABV ($9.48 CAD) - A 341ml (nearly 12 fl. oz.) bottle, this light golden brew was as lifeless as a linguini with nary a body to caress, a faint nose, and a barely-memorable sweet finish. But hey...I had to try this in its native land! https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4GtQZXJvNYCOC8nuGAiCeA&userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw  [ONION RINGS/STRAWS/STRINGS ALERT - 3.0 of 5.0 STARS] Onion Rings ($6.00 CAD) - Covered in Jack Daniel's beer batter, the portion size was three --- yes, ONLY THREE --- large and thick onion rings! This extremely small portion size came out hot, the darker brown crunchy batter was lovely and didn't crumble, and each onion ring (not sweet Maui) stayed intact when bitten into. I playfully imagined these stacked atop each other as steam spewed through a volcanic flume! This \"blew\"...but only in the sense that I wish there was more to eat!  Regular Poutine ($9.00 CAD) - Because it was still a \"no-meat Friday\" for me, I passed on the short rib version which I would've preferred. Thankfully, this was more than sufficient based on the portion size and amount of ingredients. The fries were thick golden brown potato pugil sticks covered in squeaky squishy cheese and hot slightly-salty syrupy gravy sauce. Each bite was tres magnifique! The only recommendation was that the cheese and gravy be evenly-distributed between the layers of interlocking Lincoln Logs of fries so everything was covered. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=c3QvJY9VGWBcpRRcoEyeYg&userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw  1/3 lb. Burger ($9.99 CAD) - My niece order this very simple burger that consisted of a 1/3-lb. beef patty, a large tomato slice a la Tommy's in Los Angeles, a large leaf of lettuce, half a pickle, a slice of Swiss cheese, all contained by a puffy round toasted bun a la Umami Burger also in Los Angeles. The buns were egregiously burnt such was Joan of Arc which left a charred taste in my mouth and smoke-screened the rest of the burger. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=CgyEYier9dNL_cIpGjS-1A&userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw  Service - Our female bartender and server was totally friendly, informative about the menu, and joked around with us as she helped us decide what to order. She was quick to get our drinks out, and once we decided what to eat, our food came out in about 10 minutes. She checked on us periodically, and once we were done paying was a breeze. Merci beaucoup!  Parking (Varied; FREE this instance) - We were laidover, so a non-issue since this was inside the airport past security in the departure gates area.  Atmosphere, décor, ambience - A no-walls open welcoming layout with a large \"C\" bar, clusters of chairs and tables, and a few more relaxed loungy-style seats along the periphery. It was all about the massive amount of electric ceiling lights although very small amounts of natural lighting barely made its way from the glass windows down yonder. There were several muted but closed-captioned TVs on each wall but no background music.  Attire - Totally casual, so I would normally be in a t-shirt, boardshorts, and flip-flops.  Overall, I'd return to QDC Burger if I found myself again in the Air Canada terminal in Montreal...but probably by default because the other offerings didn't tickle my fancy. It went without saying that food prices at the airport were outrageously high, and I felt this was no different. I found them similar to The Counter with it's quasi a la carte way to order a burger. The menu was very limited https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=HYGsdF7XmEi_US3uzecfxg&userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw. Although they served alcohol, beer, and wine, the selection was kept to a minimum. I found fairly good value (the poutine was what kept this rating this high) based on the prices, service, and experience noted above (TOTAL paid experience was around $41.00 CAD BEFORE tip). And, they accepted my credit card of choice...AMEX! 3.5 STARS"}
{"text":"Thanks to fellow yelper Diana C. for tipping us off to this back alley burger haven. Yes it is a little sketchy, you feel like you might get jumped but in the light of day it's not nearly that intimidating.   We ordered the onion rings, 3 in total, so savor each bite. They were good though. Crispy enough, savory.   I ordered the surf and turf, which was phenomenal. 4 huge shrimps served under a delicious beef patty and grilled onions. There was also arugula, a garlic aioli sauce and zesty tomato chutney. Even the bun was delicious. Not an afterthought but rather it held its own.   My husband customized his burger which was equally good though I was partial to the one I ordered.  Definitely a no frills kind of place. For me not quite a five star place. There was a bench for seating but not much else which normally wouldn't be a problem except the burgers are super juicy and super messy. Definitely not a place you want to go on a first or second date because you can't eat these burgers gracefully. A tip for the ladies, bring a hair tie because there's an alley wind that will make it hard to keep the hair out of your way.  The burgers are wrapped in paper and it would have been nice if there was some sort of plate or carton to eat it out of. But now I'm just being picky I guess."}
{"text":"Faut pas bouder son plaisir. Évidemment c'est un peu cher mais c'est drôlement bon.  Le Jefferson est dégoulinant de bonheur avec son uf au plat et sa béarnaise. Le Lefty marie avec brio champignons et aïoli, avec une vraie tranche de lard épaisse qu'on n'ose pas appeler bacon. C'est devenu une étape obligatoire de Dorval pour moi!"}
{"text":"Burger used to be decent when they were located in the back alley. Now that it has been integrated in the queue de cheval menu, it is terrible. The burger is dry and tasteless. There is no lettuce or tomato or onions... All drenched in mayonnaise. So many good burgers downtown for same or lower price. Stay away.   Positive notes: decor and service are good."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write this review as I don't want all of your cramming up my place, but here goes: So head on down the alley on de la Montagne street, between St Catherine and Rene Levesque, and behold what are some of the best burgers I have ever had! Great music is always playing, there are benches to sit on and the guys making up your food are so much fun and super helpful as the choices can be a tad overwhelming.  This hole in the wall is run by the guys behind the restaurant Queue de Cheval, so you know that the meat is gonna be good; I however, had the salmon burger here, and it is TO DIE FOR and the fries are cooked to perfection and the milkshakes are super yummy as well with rotating specials.  The burgers are huge, messy, and come with all sorts of toppings (hello, sunny side up egg!)...they even provide hand sanitizer as they know that you're paws are gonna be a mess. Your mama may have told you that alleys are dangerous, but this one is well worth taking a stroll down."}
{"text":"I got the ahi burger, otherwise known as the \"kong\", definitely was not impressed. Actually to be quite frank it was the worst ahi burger I've ever had. Not to mention service was terrible here, and the servers seem upset with a 5%tip. You're lucky you got anything after that terrible service and meal. Work for the tip, don't make me tip for the work."}
{"text":"Amazing little burger shop sort of hidden in a parking lot! Their burgers are the real deal! I got the Lefty - bacon, caramelized onions, mushrooms and swiss cheese - and it was so good! It's definitely an unexpected place to have lunch with friends if you're strolling around downtown! Also, there's barely any lines since they're a bit hidden and not obvious."}
