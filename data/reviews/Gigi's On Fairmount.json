{"text":"Great little spot. I stopped in for some wine and eats and was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is spot on and has a laid back feeling. The particular wine I ordered was fantastic but the food was what impressed me. Even the simple bread board was awesome. Some olive oil on the side with some sunken balsamic .... yum. The lardon bruschetta board was unreal. The homemade mayo spread was creamy and dilish. The owner Jim introduced himself and was super friendly. I'm really diggin this joint and plan on returning soon. Clev Hts needed a non Lee Rd'ish spot like this."}
{"text":"We decided to try this gem this past Saturday night. What a find! The ambience is fantastic - I felt like I was in NYC. Food was equally as good. I had the filet mignon with carmelized onion risotto (amazing) and my husband had the seafood bouillabaisse, which he loved. I really like that their entrees change each day in order to provide the freshest food. It also allows the chef to be creative and mix up the dishes. Sadly, we didn't get a chance to enjoy the lounge next door as it was reserved for a party, but it looks fantastic. I'm looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Rose is amazing and the food was top notch.  Great wine list, delicious food and  nice atmosphere.  Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Have eaten at Gigi's numerous times. great food and drinks. Beautiful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to Gigi's for our anniversary.  Wonderful food, terrific service!  Jim the owner was very hospitable as well!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere was even better with live music - great place to grab a bight, hang out and not feel rushed. 

The evening specials always make the menu more interesting.  I love the wine selection.  I have tried all of the bruschetta boards and loved them all."}
{"text":"The service was good and the décor was inviting. Unfortunately the seats were quite
uncomfortable. The pannini I had was not good because it was extremely 
salty. If you order a salad do not expect to get bread or crackers with it unless you are willing to pay $4.00"}
{"text":"Simply fantastic! I ordered filet mignon, my wife had the trout. Both were amazing! Great ambiance & staff as well! Home run!"}
{"text":"It's a little expensive if you want to try a little of everything, which is what we do when we go to Gigi's. Bahn Mi sandwich with a fresh green salad, lemony chick pea soup and my wife had a variety of their fresh - and off the hook - bruschetta boards. The bartender has special skills...just ask him to make you an Aerial. It's purple and perfect.  Reminds me of little Parisian cafes I found in France, nice outdoor patio and separate bar."}
{"text":"Take some aspirin before going here! The restaurant is split into a night bar and dining area. The bar is ok, but the dining area was so crowded and loud I couldn't hear a thing my fiancé said. I had waitresses' butts in my face and hitting me multiple times. The service was slow and seemed to favor older & richer looking guests. As soon as we sat down a menu was flung on our table with no introduction. 10 minutes later the waitress finally took our order informing us that they only had one entree left. That is something that you should tell guests before they sit down to eat. Not to mention the bolognese sauce tasted store bought and was 25.00 a piece. This may be more of a place for friends definitely not a date spot."}
{"text":"Service was very good and fast. Surprised by others saying big portion sizes-the panini was tiny and the accompanying salad was just a cup of greens. Tried to catch a glimpse of other diner's meals and they seemed to be decent size but don't know the prices to make a comparison. Thought the cocktails were very expensive at $12 in a skinny tall glass and watered down. It is nicely decorated but extremely loud and very, very hot in August. Tables were kind of tight, too-our waitress just fit between ours and the one next to us. Not what I was hoping it would be based off other reviews."}
{"text":"First time visiting.  Had one of the best dinners ever!  The bruschetta boards were delicious and had many options to choose from.  Very generous portions - enough for 4 to have as an appetizer.  The specials that evening were prime rib & scallops.  Both men in our party said the prime rib was one of the best meals they've had in a long time.  My daughter-in-law and I had the scallops which were served with asparagus & fingerling potatoes and, again, excellent.  Scallops were done to perfection!  Service was attentive and very friendly from the hostess Rita ( who made us feel like we were old friends), our server ZaZa, and to the owner herself GiGi who greeted our table and welcomed us.   The wine list is extensive & we loved the whole atmosphere.. Wish we lived closer (we're west-siders) but will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Very expensive, 10 dollar plus salads that are very bland, sandwich where half decent, service very slow would never go agian and do not recommend"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner last night and the bone in pork surpassed my expectations. Friendly service making it a great evening that continued next door."}
{"text":"Gigi's defines the neighborhood gem.  Awesome atmosphere, great food.  I saw someone else describe as 'simple and sophisticated', which is spot on.  great wine list that was diverse but not needlessly huge.  all the appetizers were top quality - i had each of them for a meal one night. The bruschetta is every bit as great as they claim. Owners were present and friendly. I'm not sure what else you could ask for, I'll go again and again. A must if you're looking for great food, drinks and boutique atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been visiting my sister in Cleveland and she suggested we try this new restaurant. This was a Monday and they were presenting a special wine pairing / 5 course affair. 
Everything course was better than the previous and the wine pairings were spot on. Shout out to Owen Roe wines. 
I am looking forward to going back there and tasting the food from the regular menu. 
The owners, Gia and Jim, were a delight and very welcoming, as was their staff! 
Please try this place out! 
It was quite the find!"}
{"text":"I have called several times recently before going there, to ask what their specials are or what their soups are and have always gotten a recording which says what their hours are etc. but have never spoken to a person.  This didn't used to be the case.  Are they so busy now that they can't even answer their phone or so short staffed?  It seems like it would be good for business to answer the phone or don't they care.  I'm not calling to make reservations."}
{"text":"Great place that is only excelling and getting better and they are adding a bar next door!! Chef made amazing food, best I've had around so far! Great ambiance and atmosphere. Very kind, sweet and inviting owner/staff. The owner is very nice to chat with."}
{"text":"Had our first meal here tonight. We had the specials: Gorgonzola encrusted prime rib and Duck Confi. Delicious.  Love the atmosphere, music, wait staff and hostess, and wine. Looking forward to many more meals here.  We were so hungry that we forgot to take pictures before we started eating. The plates looked great. So glad this place opened up."}
{"text":"Great place for a glass of wine and a light meal.  The menu has nice salad and soup choices, but there are heavier options for people who want something like a steak.  As an east sider I like the location since I can stop on the way home from downtown."}
{"text":"Another hidden gem in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.....I visited here for the first time 10/09/2015...if your looking for that lounge feel with the perfect dimmed lights, window seating, fire place, great drinks and food well this is your spot.....Our bartender Eric was awesome in his recommendations....I absolutely fell in love.....I normally don't like sharing when I find a great spot but honestly this is to good to keep to myself so I'm sharing it with you....I believe that you will not be disappointed because I sure was not!!!"}
{"text":"We broke with our routine and tried the dinner entree specials by Chef Jeff. Awesome! Remarkable creativity with successful flavor blends.  Better treat yourself to this rare culinary treat before some haughty Chicago restaurant snatches Chef Jeff away from us.  He's a real treasure."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Simple and sophisticated.  The decor is cozy and intimate with colorless pendant chandeliers at low lighting and small tables.  Bar next door and music are not too loud, allowing my friend and I to catch up over a long dinner.  Waitstaff are friendly and attentive.  Crowd is mostly salt and pepper with a few younger couples out for a nice dinner.

My friend got their John Dory (sp?) special on a toasted slice of bread and sliced beefsteak garnished with microgreens and a sweet herby pesto. I had only a small bite but it was perfectly seasoned and well executed.  I got the lardon frissee salad with poached egg to start. Light but flavorful and balanced.  Then, the bruschetta plate: lemon/ricotta/honey, duck confit/brie/cherry, lardon/truffle oil/tomato/microgreens, and proscuitto/dried fig/marscapone.  The duck was a little greasy.  But maybe I waited too long to eat it.  I think if the bread was toasted the crunchiness would have offset the heaviness of the duck.  Otherwise, I loved everything and I wasn't even that hungry.  Coming from NYC, I was really impressed by the quality, price, and creativity.  This chef clearly puts a lot of thought into the menu and its execution.  Would definitively come back, especially since the  entree specials change daily and they've proven to be very capable with the few things I've seen and tasted here."}
{"text":"I'm so lucky to have this chic spot in my neighborhood. The service and food are top notch. It's a great place to catch-up with your girlfriends or enjoy a romantic date night. My go-to's are the fromage and bruschetta boards. By now, I've tried over half of the bruschetta options and the sopressata, white bean and kalamata, prosciutto and fig, lamb and feta, and duck are my favorites. They also make delicious soups and if you want to just have a bottle of wine and snack, try the \"all of the above\" board with bread, olives, cheese and charcuterie. 

Gigi's also offers 3-5 different entrees each night that change based on what's seasonal and fresh. They're typically pricey $27-32.

Also, the patio is one of my faves in the summer and the bar next to the dining room has a sexy, sophisticated vibe."}
{"text":"Finally getting around to reviewing Gigi's after having been there many times.  It is a true gem of Cleveland's east side.  

We typically enjoy a bruschetta board where you select 4 flavors of bruschetta from a list of about 10-12 options.  Each selection is cut into four smaller slices.  This is NOT your typical tomato/basil bruschetta with intricate options such as prosciutto/fig/mascarpone, smoked salmon/Boursin/capers and chicken liver pate/shallot ham (they are all awesome but the chicken liver is the absolute best).  

While a bruschetta board is usually enough for two people, they also have two or three daily chefs creation entrees.  I've had the feature a few times and it has always been delicious.  They also have prime rib on Saturdays (until they run out).  

Their wine list changes seasonally and offers many interesting options that they will gladly offer suggestions/pairings with food on.  They also make a mean manhattan! 

If you are in the mood for just drinks, the lounge side of Gigi's is a great spot.  They often have live music and is the perfect place for a date or small group.  

Lastly, I know Gigi's has had Saturday and Sunday brunch.  I have not been for it yet but will definitely be going soon."}
{"text":"Great location in Cleveland Heights. I ordered the Scallops with Risotto.....the BEST! So good, and the bartender was really nice. Great conversation and great service. I'm really glad I decided to stop here for dinner and drinks!"}
{"text":"Great, lively ambiance  Amazing neo-Mediterranean cuisine and a killer wine list. Friendly, knowledgable staff will
Help guide you through the plethora of choices. If you haven't visited yet, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!   Loved all the little details too!   Very \"Jim and Gia\"- specials were incredible as well as the bruschetta boards.  Way to go, Gigi's!!"}
{"text":"I have relocated here from Chicago about a month ago, promising friends and family to join yelp so they could see Cleveland's fabulous dining scene. Sadly, I had to leave a 3 star review for Gigis twice now and they are my first reviews since I live so close! I called last week and had a really unpleasant phone conversation, let a few days pass and decided to try it again. I had been in before with my puppy and the owners allowed him on the patio and even brought water! The inside is decorated beautifully, the food is so good I actually crave it. I came in last night with friends visiting and our dinner was so good I could have licked the plate clean, I'm not exaggerating whatsoever. The problem is the service. I have come in now three times in total and had a really bad experience on the phone (as i said) and now a bad experience in person. I'm not a fan of naming names but the girl was very short with me and in general very loud. She interrupted me when I had questions and seemed to really be put out by us. We were seated outside near what I can only assume is the cocktail area and some people wanted food (not knowing they couldn't eat there), she yelled at them to see a host in a very demeaning sort of way. I cannot be sure, be she sounded very much like the snippy girl who was rude to me on the phone. I do not want to put her name on here or ruin a reputation but I would think in a place of that caliber the service would be impeccable? We also waited for water, waited for our plates to be cleared and had the desserts rattled off to us so rapidly I couldn't even understand them. A blonde woman (I believe a host) working actually came over to help us more than once, which we appreciated. I have met the owners and some other staff in the past and they are fantastic people. Again, the food is of a quality and freshness unmatched, the decor comfy and fun. I spent a decent amount of money last night and want to continue to patronize gigis but sadly will not if the service doesn't improve."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the 3 stars isn't for poor service, bad food or poor wine selection. I just wasn't overwhelmed by it like some are. The Kale Caesar Salad was just ok, the dressing very bland. The entree i chose was the daily special and it was one of the only 2 choices...a prime rib sandwich or homemade pasta with bolognese sauce. I chose the pasta. Just ok. Look, the place is neat, the staff is awesome, the owner deserves to be successful. But for me, the food was just ok. Wine selection is VERY good!"}
{"text":"Not so much a wine bar, more like a sit down restaurant. The wine list was pretty extensive. Menu consisted of small plates, soups, salads, panninis and bruschetta. Only 2 entrees offered which were the specials. Bruschetta board was good and lots of choices."}
{"text":"Very chic little bistro, good for a date night or girls night out. Had martini's and apps. Very nice decor. Dressy or casual attire."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to spend the evening with a special friend? I highly recommend Gigi's On Fairmount to anyone looking for a place with unbelievable ambiance, and super friendly staff who are willing to go above and beyond! Not to mention unbelievable drinks. 
If you are looking for a ridiculously tasty drink you should look for Martin!!! This guy is a rock star. Seriously, he is quick, cordial, and so much fun to talk too. 
This was my first time at Gigi's and I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to the lovely shopping strip in Cleveland Heights. This is what we've needed in this neighborhood for years. My husband and I came in for dessert and wine on a cold, snowy Saturday night. Our server was unbelievably kind and friendly. The restaurant is cozy and charming. Wine was delicious. And the dessert, one of the best we've had in Cleveland. We shared the homemade granola ice cream sandwich. Yum. Reminiscent of baklava with honey, homemade granola \"cookies\" and Jeni's pistachio ice cream. We kind of wanted to lick the plate. I can't wait to go back for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & very cozy. Nice wine list too. 

The menu was a bit limited. The two specials sounded good, but nothing available for non-meat eaters. 

The roasted red pepper soup was not bad but it was lukewarm at best. 

The bruschetta board was great, the salmon was excellent.  The cheese board was very good, but a bit small. 

My biggest disappointment was the lack of service. We were still hungry so we would have ordered more food if our waitress would have checked on us more than once. I had to ask the hostess for a refill on my coffee. I finally tracked down our server on my way to the bathroom to ask for our check. I want to like this place so I'll probably give it another shot, but I hope the service is better or I won't be back."}
{"text":"Gigi's on Fairmount is just what this neighborhood needs.  A nice dinner with a great selection of wines served by friendly, super-attentive folks!"}
{"text":"We visited GiGi's to finally witness what all the hype was about. Well, it didn't disappoint!!  The entree special was complex and so tasty!  You can add a glass of wine from their wonderful wine list or a cocktail expertly crafted to compliment anything on their menu. The service was extraordinary and the atmosphere was perfect. My compliments to the chef and the entire staff. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Limited options available. Sandwiches salad soup and bruschetta. It was very good. Had soup and bruschetta. Bruschetta was outstanding. Small with a bar in separate room which opens at five. If dinner food matches lunch you won't be disappointed.  There was a waiter whose pants were way too low  we saw his crack. Asked that he be told to pull them up. He didn't or they did't stay up. Very unsanitary. Only drawback is no parking. Street only. No lots."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great wine list, delicious food, and a lovely atmosphere. It was the perfect place to grab a drink and some nosh before heading to the Cedar Lee to catch a movie. I will definitely go back next time I'm on the east side."}
{"text":"This was, hands down, the most mediocre meal I have ever eaten. I don't think I've ever been insulted by food before, until this evening. The menu doesn't list any entrees, and the entree \"specials\" listed by the waitress were uninspiring, at best. Instead, the bulk of the menu consists of Specialty Bruschetta. I happen to love all sorts of bruschetta. But topping soggy toast with  plain roasted red peppers and tossing some goat cheese on top does not mean you've made bruschetta. The brie, fig, honey, & apple bruschetta was actually just (soggy) bread slathered with sickly-sweet fig jam, minuscule pieces of brie, and raw apple slices. Nothing I ate this evening was \"bad\". It was just horrendously boring,  tasteless, and less than average. I've had better chicken liver pâté from a roadside shop. (And please don't tell me you're topping it with a shallot jam and then serve it wit poorly caramelized onions instead.) I will happily never eat here again.
The 2nd star is solely because the service was decent."}
{"text":"An absolutely charming, warm place to go for dinner, brunch, whatever.  Friendly, accommodating staff, Killer good bruschetta!!  A tiny gem."}
{"text":"Gigi's is wonderful. I went here twice in one week, so that's saying something. From the general appearance of the place, without the patio seating area, it has the vibe of a salon. I think it might be the lips and sparkles in the name branding, but every time I passed this place, I wrote it off as a hair salon. That changed when a friend suggested we go here for some wine and a light meal. Looking at the menu, I was a little scared. I don't know anything about wine, I have no idea how to order it--I just know that I like drinking it. Luckily, my friend helped with a bit of her knowledge and we ended up with a really tasty and refreshing bottle. Now for those bruschetta boards. WOW. The amount of food is perfect for two if you're not famished and the flavors are fantastic! Between the two times I was there, I had the prosciutto, fig, and mascarpone; smoked salmon, boursin, and capers; brie, apple, and walnut; white bean and kalamata olive tapenade; and pea, feta, and mint. All were super tasty, but I have to say the brie and pea ones were my favorite. Just writing about them right now is making me want them again...

As for the service, I feel like I had two very different experiences. The first of which was not the best, so it's a good thing the food and wine are so stellar. The minute we walked up to the place, we were a little confused and ended up trapped on the patio because a server was standing in the doorway. That same server very brusquely told us to go inside...but didn't move. When we went inside and requested a patio seat, we settled in and were thankfully greeted by another server. Unfortunately, this server was a little disinterested and I think she really didn't appreciate our decision making skills or little side jokes. The second visit was a different story, with at least three servers happily tending to our table, making jokes, and engaging us. I think that first time around was just a bad combination of staff, so I'm hoping not to encounter them again..."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at Gigi's last night and it was amazing.  It was my first time there and I will definitely be back.  We sat outside and the patio is really cozy and has a great atmosphere.  We split everything so it gave us the opportunity to try more things on the menu.  We did the kale ceasar salad, the bruschetta board and the crab stuffed salmon, which was probably some of the best salmon I've ever had.  And last but not least, the chocolate peanut butter torte was to die for!  The staff was very friendly and attentive and we had a great experience there.  I highly recommend trying it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was cute and the staff was friendly and helpful.   But,  I'm old school, and the lunch salad I had was primarily very thin tiny diced up radishes with other vegies.  The salad was very small and it was not inexpensive.    I prefer a lunch that has more substance or less cost.   I'm not saying I would never ever go back, I would just be very careful with the menu."}
{"text":"Back again last night for my anniversary, turns out in was their one year anniversary. Had an excellent meal again. Again had our favorite server, she sold us one special and even one to take home. We had a seafood newberg, kale salad and my daughter a panini. At home we enjoyed the lamb, really exsquisite. I also loved how our server recognized me and I had only been there one other time. Congrats on your anniversary- kudos to the chef as well and the great service staff."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!  We had a group of 4 girls during our dinner there.  They don't take reservations but we went on a Monday night without problems.  Gigi's is a small, quaint, charming, fun place.  The ambiance is dark and dimly lit with a touch of Parisian flair.  The menu focuses on salads, paninis, 2 soups, and a customize-your-own bruschetta board.  There are also 2 entree options.  So think:  SHARE  Large and respectable wine list for a small little place such as this.  The owner came over and asked us what we were celebrating and we told him my engagement.  He com'd my meal for the night.  Super nice touch.  Just go.  Gigi's is a keeper!"}
{"text":"Not my usual cup of tea, but it's right up my wife's alley and she raved about it. We got a bruschetta board and a couple glasses of wine. I enjoyed it, but she talked about it for the next week. Would be a 4.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"We went there with friends.  First time.  The waitress was forever slow bringing the driniks.  Hey doesn't she want to make some money.  Aren't they a wine bar?  My hubby would like some beer...The food selections were different and interesting.  The presentation was good.  The place is trying to cram as many tables in 1000 sq ft as possible.  You can totally hear three other conversations around you, while maintaining your own conversation.  You kind of feel like a split personality... The prices are fair.  It's amazing how one waitress/waiter can influence your experience."}
{"text":"Went to Gigi's on Fairmont after seeing a segment with Gigi on New Day Cleveland. My mom and I went for lunch and ordered a bruschetta board and a dessert (both were amazing). We mentioned to our server that we had seen the show, and Gigi herself came over to our table to talk with us! The entire staff went above and beyond in service! Not to mention the bruschetta board was DELICIOUS! Will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"I really love the atmosphere at Gigi's. The owners are great, always fabulous with service. They let us sample wine before we settled on a bottle and it made all the difference. The food is good, had the Evelyn panini which I've ordered before. The side salad was nothing special. The ambience and service makes the place - check it out!"}
{"text":"Incredibly average food combined with friendly but poor service. We went for lunch and really loved the decor and atmosphere. The service was a bit too casual, as the waitress took 10 mins to give us a menu, then didn't have a pen when we were ready to order. Other things like getting served on wet plates, only having two sets of individual tea servers, not remembering who ordered what (we were only a party of 5) and forgetting to bring the requested sauce really surprised me. I think it's fair to expect exceptional service at these small boutique neighborhood restaurants, but I think I've gotten better service (and not that different of quality food) at an Olive Garden. 
I do appreciate the gluten free selection, and the butternut squash bruschetta was delicious."}
{"text":"Everything is excellent and almost everything comes with a small salad on the plate. Try the lavender honey with your cheese when you order the cheese plate. It's awesome."}
{"text":"We had a lovely evening at Gigi's, Gigi was there and was a terrific host. She smiled non-stop, suggested some wonderful wines and checked in on us periodically. The atmosphere is more than pleasant and the menu sufficient. Not gourmet, which is ok by me, but perfect for date night or dinner with the family. I've heard mixed reviews around town but i can now vouch for Gigi's! Loved it."}
{"text":"So I just asked Siri what was a good place to eat and this is what she recommended. I must say this was a excellent choice. Great service and the owner James was very attentive. I got their bruschetta board and the pork chop. I would definitely come back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Gigi's was recommended to us by more than a few people, and we decided to try it out on a Friday night. Upon arriving, there was a wait, so we grabbed a drink and a sampling of the prosciutto, mascarpone and fig bruschetta. The cocktails (I got the gimlet and he got the Moscow mule) were well balanced and refreshing. The bruschetta was on wonderful bread and had excellent flavor. Service was a bit slow, but they were busy.

We were quickly seated at our table and decided upon two of the featured entrees for the evening- the filet mignon and red snapper. Both were excellent. Steak was tender and high quality and the snapper was excellently prepared. The wine list is also impressive and worth a look. 

Additionally, our server was attentive and knowledgeable. The decor and overall vibe inside Gigi's is fun too-warm and jazzy, and instantly makes you feel like you're in a special place. I'd highly recommend checking this place out in the future. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding (the bruschetta boards are incredible) and the drinks are strong and delicious. The decorum inside is extremely cozy and the patio is great during the summer."}
{"text":"Great little spot in The Heights! Love coming here on a Friday night after a long week and unwinding with the great cocktails and wine list and a bruschetta board! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Guys guys guys! This place is the best. They have gluten-free bread as an option for their bruscetta and paninis! And everything is delicious. I'd recommend the lardon, trout pate, or chicken liver pate bruscetta (more like open-face sandwiches). The Cuban is great as well. Also, they have a good wine list, which is hard to come by in such a beer-centric city."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful cosmopolitan dining adventure! Luv the new bar addition!
Excellent bar service. Eric the Bartender. Best Cosmo yet. Deliciously prepared Halibut with Risotto. A+.
Friendly service. Inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is an absolute hidden gem! A wonderful neighborhood spot. If you can, I highly suggest eating on the patio, it's very relaxing and has a bistro vibe to it. 
The prices are very reasonable and the portion sizes are just right- actually a consumable amount of food- healthy portions, you won't leave feeling hungry. 
Dinner entrees change daily depending on what the fresh (local) ingredients the chefs get every day. 
For dessert I split a triple chocolate torte with my boyfriend but I totally could have eaten it by myself which is unusual since I always find chocolate either too bitter or too sweet - this was very smooth on the pallet."}
{"text":"My new favorite place. Beautifully prepared food, great ambiance, superb staff. Great for just a glass of quick glass (or three) of wine with some bruschetta or for relaxing meal. A must try on the east side!"}
{"text":"You must try the House Made Chicken Liver Pate, Shallot Jam Bruschetta - it is positively amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm giving four stars because the environment and quality of food are wonderful. If you have food allergies, please be careful. I was assured multiple times how happy they were to accommodate me. In the end, no matter what I tried to work out, I was told no substitution could be made for an item in any entree to which I was allergic, so it was left off my plate and I was charged full price for two thirds of a meal.  I left an expensive restaurant feeling hungry. I hope they can expand their options in the future, especially at a somewhat premium price for my neighborhood, so I can enjoy a meal worry free."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks on a Monday night with friends. The dining area was packed! Good vibe. We opted for the bar which was quieter. Mod ambiance with fab updated 60s style seats and chandeliers. Our waitress was super sweet.

The drinks were ok - I think the bartender was starting his first week there. The menu is quite limited on the drinks side - most of it is bruschetta with various toppings. One wooden slab, about 5 pieces, was $4.50. The food was a little underwhelming but I would come back for the lounge for sure!"}
{"text":"Our party was uncomfortably cold and felt the music was too loud. Even though we were the only people in the restaurant, staff wouldn't adjust the temperature or the volume, so unfortunately we had to leave."}
{"text":"First time there, late valentine's celebration. Food was great, atmosphere great,  and our waitress Jenna was a sweetheart."}
{"text":"Sat our big group in the seperate side room. Really adorable bathrooms, great food, but a little pricey for brunch. Great atmosphere and a good spot in Cleveland Heights, and if it were a bit more affordable I'd give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: The following review is only for their Saturday Brunch.

I wanted to try out a new place to get brunch, just because I usually end up going to the same places (ie: Lucky's or Inn on Coventry), and I found Gigi's on Yelp. I had noticed that pretty much all the reviews were not for brunch, but I went ahead and came anyways.

On stepping into the store, you can tell it doesn't really have a brunch atmosphere, as the restaurant is pretty dark inside. Our waitress initially sat us at a table inside, but we asked if we could take the window seat--which was really nice.

The menu was French inspired, and doesn't have a ton of what you would expect for brunch. We ended up ordering the Lox, Challah French Toast, a Huevos Wrap, and a side of Rosemary Potatoes.
+LOX, this is like a bread board with lots of toppings you can mix and match. I was personally not a huge fan, and felt like the flavors leaned towards the sour side.
+CHALLAH FRENCH TOAST, this looked super delicious, but taste-wise was just average. I would prefer a normal french toast from somewhere else.
-HUEVOS WRAP, this came in a pretty small portion. It tasted fresh and flavorful, but pretty average. It also doesn't seem to fit too well with the rest of the menu.
-ROSEMARY POTATOES: I am still bitter about these. Our waitress asked me if I wanted to add the truffle and parm, and (blame my own stupidity for not checking the menu) I agreed. This adds another $3! to the price. The end result is not even impressive. The potatoes are cut into the tiniest little squares and I could barely taste, let alone see, any evidence of the truffle/parm. 

Overall the food was not terrible, but if you want brunch, go somewhere else. I may come back another day to actually try their normal food (like that bruschetta board!)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing... I had first tried Gigi about a year ago and was impressed then but how it's improved.. 

First the space has doubled in size and they have an outdoor patio out front.. The bathrooms have the best decor very romantic and the atmosphere is so chic 

The wine list is great and tons of options by the glass... We went with a seghesio Zinfandel which I thought complimented the bruschetta board quite nicely 

For dinner they have salads, soups appetizers, paninis and bruschetta options. They do offer a couple entrees that change daily. We tried the four choice board and went with the duck, pork, Apple Brie and prosciutto with cheese.. All were so delicious and looked so beautiful when presented...

All in all deserves 5 out 5 stars and I will definitely frequent this place"}
{"text":"Great spot for tasty small plates, cocktails, and ambiance. For the \"foodie\" reviewer that brought 10 people - next time do your research. This is an intimate local venue. Try it."}
{"text":"The hair came with a food ! Lousy service and they charged me for the food they forgot to bring."}
{"text":"Great wine, delicious bruschetta platter (loved the brie/apple and the smoked salmon especially), and the granola+ice cream was one of the best desserts I have ever had in my life. Owner Gia is a gem. Great vibe here."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Saturday and had a wonderful experience. I sat with a friend on the patio. Disclaimer: The weather was perfect. 

I had a peach bellini to start, which was a perfect mix between tart and sweet. To be honest, I could barely stop myself from guzzling the whole thing in one sip.

Soon after, my food arrived. I had the french toast. This particular restaurant has a beautiful crispy crust on the French toast that adds great texture. The mixed fruit on top was perfectly ripe, and the homemade whipped cream was delicious.

Overall, I had a great experience here and will definitely return on another Saturday or Sunday for brunch, and I look forward to trying out some of their weekday dishes."}
{"text":"Jim and Gia have created a wonderful, welcoming atmosphere.  Loved the bruschetta board and the wine list is divine.  A perfect neighborhood spot to relax and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This has become our go to restaurant when we visit our daughter at Case Western. We order the bruschetta (at least 2 boards) and then an entree or two to split between the three of us. The service is fabulous, the wine selection is fine and the food is always great!"}
{"text":"Went on a bikeride with a friend on Saturday and needed to stop for something cool when we discovered Gigi's. It's on a cute stretch of Fairmount, surrounded by charming little shops and a delicious bakery. We enjoyed a tasty glass of sangria on the patio. The service and ambiance were great. Definitely want to come here for food next time!

Awesome for a fancy drink on the patio"}
{"text":"Love it! What a sweet little gem. My dad has been on a French kick and my friend from Duo Home raved about this enchanting new spot, so we stopped opening weekend for lunch. They have a great selection of panini sandwiches and bruschetta. Also, I would ask about the soup du jour. Today it was white bean and pulled pork. Delicious. We split the turkey panini and ordered the bruschetta board trying the trout, chicken liver, brie and sopressata. All were impressive and if you check out their menu, you have plenty to choose from. Chocolate cake and Jeni's ice cream to finish with. Coffee was good but will try the French press next. The wine list offers a nice variety and on that note I'm already plotting my return with friends. Ps don't forget to check out the cute bathroom and say hi to the owners! Congratulations on opening weekend!"}
{"text":"I've driven past this spot for years... never stopped in.   Today was the day!  First off, the decor is very nice and could go so far as to be called upscale.  Very inviting!  We were immediately greeted and seated by the hostess and had our choice of indoor or outdoor seating.  We opted for inside as the weather called for rain.  Our orders were taken promptly and coffee was served up fresh and hot.  The entrees were delivered quickly and not only looked great on the plate... but were delicious.  They both came with a salad that was already lightly dressed in a light vinegar dressing.   I had the corned beef hash and eggs that was prepared perfectly.  The seasoning on the potatoes in the hash was perfect and everything was the correct temperature.  The wait staff was efficient and pleasant keeping our mugs and glasses full.  I would highly recommend this as an easy stop for brunch... and I would imagine their late night fair would probably hold up to this standard.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Gigi's is an instant East side favorite. I am obsessed with the decor, quaint feel and overall vibe. The drinks & food are great and I love the unique bruschetta menu. You get to choose 4 and the different combinations & flavors are really fun to try. There were also a lot of other options on the menu I would have been willing to try, as well as a number of daily specials...all fresh. Their bathroom is even super cute! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"A very New York style restaurant right on the edge of Cleveland Heights. This is becoming a favorite of mine for date night. 
-Wonderful food
-Great wine selection
-Amazing atmosphere and music 

Try the Charline!"}
{"text":"I have a couple issues. Firstly while the drinks are quite good, it did take a while to get a 2nd round,  secondly, I ordered the corner beef and hash with on over easy eggs, the corner beef was great, the egg however was over hard, didn't eat it,"}
{"text":"My new favorite locally-owned spot... just 10 minutes from my house! GiGi's husband, Jim came out to greet us personally say hello and welcome us. 

Cocktails are well crafted to Perfection and served in a variety of beautiful vintage cocktail glasses.

We were told to order the bruschetta butcher block and man, did they deliver!  You have a choice of 4 of 13 amazing selections of bruschetta.  Everything on themenu is homemade and either locally or organically grown and they support the local bread.

Or the bruschetta, You can't top the roasted pulled pork w/ cilantro, sea salt and lime... the Apple Brie and fig Jam, the white bean and & Kalamata olive tapenade and last but definitely not least the sopressata house-made pesto and head shaved parmigiano!!!
On my agenda,for next visit, but the apple should be a lil thicker and the brie more visible. . Anyway. ..
Loved them...

Finished with the Spanish Chicken and Rice soup... excellent and full of veggies although I would have preferred the veggies al dente and the rice soft...it was visa versa...

They always have 3 special entrees not on the menu and if I had a larger stomach,  would have tried all three!!!

Our first visit in three years but definitely not our last!"}
{"text":"Still great food and décor. Attentive owners are essential to a great restaurant.
Try the bruschetta is terrific. 
I will be returning. Thanks Jim."}
{"text":"Great, warm, cozy atmosphere; great wine by the glass(and bottle), and unique light menu.  Everything we ate was delicious from the bruschetta to the soup and sandwich.  Except for the dessert, prices were very reasonable.  We would have liked to see more entries, more than one soup, and more diversity (i.e. chicken and salmon or other fish options--even with the salads) to pair with the nice wines.  I would love to come to a place like this every other week but don't generally like sandwiches or light salads for dinner when I go out--intending to enjoy some nice wine."}
{"text":"We started our dinner with the bruschetta platter. The prosciutto was amazing! The menu is simple but everything is done very well. Atmosphere is nice and service was very good. Recommend giving GiGi's a try!"}
{"text":"Loved Gigi's. Great food , wine selection and server! I had the bruschetta, a salad and a fantastic Italian wine"}
{"text":"I went on a weeknight for a light meal.   I ordered the mushroom bruschetta and the French onion soup, and was underwhelmed.  The bruschetta was especially disappointing.  The bread was untoasted, the muushrooms were canned, and the whole thing was a cold mushy mess.  When I asked the server to take the order back, she argued with me, claiming that this was the way bruschetta \"was supposed to be.\"  She did, however, take it off the check.  Another type of bruschetta I ordered was edible, however the bread was again untoasted. The onion soup was okay, though more beefy than oniony, and very skimpy with the cheese.  Overall, I was surprised, after all the rave reviews."}
{"text":"As a regular visitor to Cleveland, I've witnessed its restaurant scene become lively and sophisticated in recent years. But I was still delighted and surprised to encounter Gigi's--polished on all fronts, from superb food and inspired decor, to attentive service. On a sunny October afternoon, we sat outside for a memorable lunch. A kale Caesar was served with succulent, tender lamb confit, and studded with tangy white anchovies to punctuate the richness of classic Caesar dressing. If ever a salad was made for an autumn day! The sun lured us outside, but indoors is lovely, especially the lounge, with its fabulous vintage cocktail bar vibe. Have also been back for late afternoon wine and cheese, perfectly decadent, runny fromage. A new favorite for me in this town."}
{"text":"Impressive chicken entree ($23) and almond cake ($9). Chicken was soft, with a hint of lemon and butter. Truly enjoyable, and probably the best chicken I've had. Almond cake had ice cream and a strawberry on top. Soft, lightly sweet, and perfect combination. It's right in the middle of a small neighborhood, and surprisingly busy even during a storm. Great service too. Interesting thing is there's no service for AT&T in this restaurant, which keeps people talking. I'd definitely come back for this."}
{"text":"The service was incredibly slow. We got to the place at 7 on a Thursday, and it was admittedly pretty busy. Drinks took over 20 minutes. Our appetizers 1 hour and 10 minutes after arrival. And our food (sandwiches) 1 hour and 45 minutes. When I asked the waitress where our food was she said they were super busy because they had a party of nine, and no joke she said 'you guys ordered FIVE sandwiches, so it will just be a while'. It's a restaurant! How is that too many sandwiches for the kitchen to cook?

The appetizers and soup were pretty delicious. The sandwiches were a bit greasy, but admittedly yummy. The ambiance was cute. I just will never wait 2 hours for a sandwich there again."}
{"text":"Love the paninis!! Fantastic homemade soups (typically offers three choices).  Enjoyed the ham panini and stuff potato soup on the patio! Great way to start the weekend"}
{"text":"I had the best gluten-free sandwich I have ever ate, thanks to Gigi's! Tried the Sonni without the tomatoes and it was so good!! 

The bathroom was very warm - very welcoming on a cool, fall evening. 

I hope to return sometime."}
{"text":"We stopped here when we first got into Cleveland, to have some \"brunch\" type of meal. Parking was pretty easy (there is a huge lot in the back). The menu was a bit light, maybe because it was a brunch? I had the crab-cake salad while my wife had a veggie frittata type dish which sounded ok on the menu but she found had goat cheese in it while eating it (it wasn't listed on the menu and she hates goat cheese). We swapped the remainder of our meals and they were good but still not what we wanted."}
{"text":"Had a couple cocktails there last night - sexy vibe! Ooo La La! I ordered the Gigitini and a Prosecco. Both sweet and delicious! Wonderful people and fantastic, sexy, cozy, and chic ambiance. I'd love for my own place to look like this!"}
{"text":"I loved my food and martini! The bruschetta selections were awesome. This is a nice addition to my neighborhood."}
{"text":"In a city seemingly over run with well-known chefs, and districts known for their culinary treasures, it is hard to imagine a new restaurant could open that would be note worthy. But with Gigi's you get more than just a place to recommend to friends. You get an ambiance not often felt in this part of town. Less bar and more fine dining, this tapas style eatery serenaded us with soft jazz as we enjoyed bruschetta, olives, and an amazing dinner special of crab/lobster confections. My wife's favorite bruschetta was the proscuitto & fig, followed closely by the Lardon bacon. And the wait staff was extremely courteous & attentive, and accommodating of our six year old. Even this seemingly \"adult oriented\" late-night find was both appropriate and delectable for our mature school-age child. We loved our meals and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Honestly great.  Cute little set up, and the bruschetta boards are the bomb.  Can't say I 've tried anything else on the menu only because when Im there, all I crave are the bruschetta boards.

Good wine, knowledgable servers, and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great lunch here- they have a nice patio you can sit out at, surrounded by beautiful flowers and trees. The street is pretty quiet too so you feel like you have good privacy. The lunch I ordered was the Italian panini sandwich with side salad. The sandwich portion size was rather big but they seasoned it well with the pesto, pepper, and ample amount of meat. It was a bit salty for my taste though. The side salad was just greens but tossed with perfect balance of dressing and oil. Their cheesecake dessert was also delicious and plated beautifully."}
{"text":"As far as wine bars go, this is my favorite place in the Cleveland area. The atmosphere works well for a romantic night out or for catching up with friends.  Their moscato is amazing and they let you sample the wine before buying a bottle. Glasses are reasonably priced. I've had their bruschetta board twice. Both times I had a variety of cheeses and other toppings.  It is a little cramped on the inside but that's my only complaint!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. 

The first time I got a smoked salmon salad; my friend got a sandwich. Something went terribly wrong because all of the other tables around us who ordered after us, received their food before us. This is not normally an issue for me, but I had an appt. directly after and this made me late.

This turned me off and I didn't go back for almost two years. 

Luckily, word travels. Their brunch has been talked about extensively within my circle of friends. So, of all days, my birthday fell on a Saturday - I decided I'd like to have my birthday brunch here.

LOVED it. I got the special that day - my boyfriend got french toast. We were so pleased with our brunch. The portions were huge, the coffee was fresh, and this waitress was extremely attentive. 

The biggest draw back for me is that Gigi's isn't open on Sundays - Saturdays are busy errand-filled days for me. My hope is that Gigi's provides Sunday Brunch in the future."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at gg's. The staff was very friendly including the owner and namesake. Their wine list was more than the usual distributor stock that you see at every other restaurant. It is clear it is a labor of love rather than another corporate theme. 

We had the Fromage with a excellent selection of cheeses with house made jam. Stone Oven bread was an excellent accompaniment. The cucumber and yogurt soup was original but could have used more time in the purée. The Jon d'ore fish was well prepared but with a little too much rice.  

They make the most of a small space. All in all satisfying experience worthy of a return engagement."}
{"text":"I was running late to meet up with my friends so my time here was a bit faced paced, but I would love to go again and try a more causal experience. Gigi's is this a cozy chic space with a cool, relaxed, sophisticated atmosphere. Four of us ladies were there for a drink and bite to eat before a show in Coventry, but I also think Gigi's would be a perfect spot for a romantic date. For parking I did not see a lot, but you could definitely snag a spot out front or along the side street. 

I do not remember the full menu, but two of us got the famous bruschetta board $20 (roughly 10 different kinds to choose from!), one got a panini looking sandwich with side salad, and the other opted for a bowl of soup. We all enjoyed tasty cocktails, albeit they are a little pricey at $12. No issues with service. Super tiny bathroom though! 

I would come here again and I recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"I came here with two of my girlfriends for lunch. It definitely wasn't what I expected. The photos are very deceiving as I was totally taken back by how small the place actually was. Cute, but small. We first sat in the little cubby by the window but it was way too tall to comfortably eat from, so we moved to a table. The service wasn't great, average at most. My panini was fantastic as was the cheese board. My girlfriend ordered a salad with fish as an add on, but instead of freshly grilled fish she got a glob of fish salad...besides that, the wine list was great and the place is very cute!"}
{"text":"Panini's taste wonderful, full of flavor. Great atmosphere as well. Would definitely recommend this place. Full wine bar too"}
{"text":"Bruschetta is fantastic, atmosphere is charming.  A little misstep on the order but, such a pleasant staff and with a busy hour, it was quickly forgotten."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch and was overall happy with the experience. I had the omelette, which was cooked perfectly. This place also had a really cute vibe. Somewhat limited menu for brunch, but the food was pretty good. I definitely think the atmosphere is pretty cutesy and girly--maybe a little much for my taste, but I would return."}
{"text":"This restaurant has easily become my go-to place in Cleveland Heights to go to chill out.  I enjoy going there to order a bottle of wine (occasionally preceded by a cocktail) and order some flavorful items from the menu.  They always have a selection of soups that change frequently.  They are all freshly made and hearty.  Their salad selection is very good. They are light, flavorful, and made with seasonal ingredients.  They have a selection of bruschetta, that really is unique.  You order a selection of four.  Each is cut into four pieces.  One board is enough for two people.  If you go early, this plus a salad or soup makes a meal.  The selection changes and is seasonal.  There are vegetarian, vegan options.  Entrees are not on the menu, and are decided upon each day around 5 PM and presented as specials.  There are usually a seafood, beef or pork and chicken or duck option.  All we have tried are flavorful and presented well.  For dessert, their selections are very good.  Add the background music, and we are reminded of cafe's we have visited in Paris.
They do not take reservations, and parking can be a challenge.  There is a lot around the corner on South Taylor that can be used, as well as street parking.  Coming early helps, and weekdays are usually a little less busy.  They have added live jazz music on Tuesday nights, but I have not yet tried it.  We have had friendly service, and appreciate that freshly made entrees take time to present.  It is a local gem."}
{"text":"You have to try this place at least once! It was a little out of the way for us but so worth it. It's a cozy little gem of a restaurant. I recommend the bruschetta board - it was more than enough for my husband and I to share. There are so many other things I want to try so we will be back :)"}
{"text":"Had brunch with a group of friends. It was pretty good. The Croque Monsuer was decent, nothing that wowed me. One thing that really rubbed me the wrong way was the 8 dollar order of bacon. It consisted of 3 small pieces of what tasted like normal bacon. 8 bucks, geez."}
{"text":"Go here for the atmosphere.  It's such an adorable place.  There's a cozy section for dinner with hgtv style decor and then there's the bar/lounge section.  The third seating area is the patio in front of the restaurant.  The bruschetta boards are very popular and the 4 pieces are enough for two people to share for a meal.  The paninis are delicious grilled sandwiches that come with a substantial side of greens tossed in a refreshingly tart dressing.  They always have a few specials and 2 fresh soups.  The dinner options are usually 10-20$.  They have a huge selection of wine here."}
{"text":"Gigi's has such a great atmosphere. Chic and romantic at night; trendy and casual during the day. Their menu is constantly changing based on the season and what's available, so you know what you're eating is bound to be fresh and interesting.

I was at Gigi's last night and am still dreaming of the scallops. They were pan seared to perfection on a bed of risotto that was so flavorful. Oh, and I can't forget about the burrata. You might not think mozzarella and tomatoes with balsamic could be anything new, but it IS at Gigi's!! It was so flavorful! The cheese seemed so very fresh and I felt like I was given the best tomatoes - who knows, maybe they'd been picked that day?

Anyway, Gigi's is a great date spot or girly spot to go with friends.

PS. Gigi's also has a fab patio!"}
{"text":"Margaux is one of the best servers ever. This place is tight but the flavor is large.  On a busy day you couldn't negotiate a military contract here but you'd certainly loosen up tight Pentagon lips after some smashing bites off this trendy but impressive menu. 

The neighborhood alone relaxes you and makes you feel like your away from the stress of the city."}
{"text":"My mom, who is also a foodie, has a bit of a different taste than me.  While I like to pound burgers and inhale chicken and waffles, she likes to enjoy a nice glass of wine with a charcuterie board.  Therefore, when she told me to try Gigi's, I wasn't so excited, but it definitely stood out from the normal California cuisine restaurant.  

We went for lunch, and the place was empty.  We ordered two paninis.  The Turkey  came with Granny Smith apple slices, Brie cheese, and fig spread.  The Cuban was a Cuban, with ham, pork, mustard, pickles, and Swiss.  Both of these sandwiches were INCREDIBLE, but the turkey takes the cake.  Both were served with a light, fresh mixed greens salad on the side.  

Located on a main street on Fairmount, you'll easily drive by it if you're not paying attention.  I advise you to stop here for lunch or dinner if you want great food and nice atmosphere.  Oh, and stop by On the Rise after while you're there."}
{"text":"I love Gigi's! Especially the patio, which is the perfect place on a nice afternoon. My main complaint is that if you do sit inside, it is incredibly loud (with conversation) and almost impossible to have a conversation without shouting. And I'm in my 30s, so it's not age-related hearing loss. If they could put up acoustic tile or something, I would go way more often, as now I really only go if I want to sit on the patio. It is also quite expensive for the type of food (salad, flatbread), but if you're wanting to treat yourself to a great experience, it's worth it. Cocktails are also great here!"}
{"text":"Great service, cute ambiance good looking food coming out! The coffee was excellent and even though the cups were small, they were promptly filled with piping hot brew throughout our brunch. We saw so many appetizing dishes go by that I only wish this place was more convenient to my house. 

On our visit we tried the Serrano ham and Gruyere cheese frittata and the French toast with a side of bacon. The frittata has quality ingredients but was a bit dry and lacked flavor. The greens were crisp and lightly dressed with lemon and oil. They were perfect. The toast was yummy. They stand it up so it doesn't get chewy... that's a thoughtful touch! The French toast with berries and fresh whipped cream was delightful. It wasn't overly eggy or sweet and had a nice crumb coating on it. The side of bacon was generous with a delightful maple syrup with pepper flakes. The combo was heaven!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They only have 3 meal options for dinner and they're different everyday so it's always a surprise when you go there. They have one meat, one fish, and on vegetarian option. Ive gotten the fish option both times I've been and it was amazing both times. The atmosphere inside is relaxed, cozy and chic, with dimmed lights. It'd probably be a great date spot. I've also always have gotten their crab cake salad app which I love.  If comes with 2 really big crab cakes. It's a little on the pricey side but the food is always great."}
{"text":"Had brunch here multiple times, and it's always solid. Croque madame is fantastic, especially with rosemary, Parmesan and truffle potatoes. For those with a sweet tooth, challah French toast doesn't disappoint plus they serve with warm maple syrup (match). For those on the healthier side berries with Greek yogurt and granola is delicious, and they've got a great take on Lox. Bloody Mary's also on point .

While food is fantastic, I wouldn't come back so often if it weren't for all-star staff. Ate there recently with my young daughter and they were more than accommodating."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in here is incredibly sexy.  We sat at the bar and our bartender was attentive and helpful in suggesting drinks. We were short on time and she recommended items that would meet our timeline.  Our food arrived quickly, as promised,  and was also delicious.  This is definitely on our list for future date night outings."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance and very good food, this was my first visit. Service started slow, but I believe that was an exception. We had one small issue with the food, the manager promptly came over, and made it all good. I would definitely go back. Pleasant atmosphere, great back ground music."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend who moved to the area and we were not dissapointed.  The food was amazing especially the Flatbread sampler there were so many choices and new combinations to try.  We both had their seasonal apple cider whisky mixed drink and it was fantastic.  I will be visiting again for sure.  I highly recommend you try this place you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a romantic evening or just lunch.  Great menu, good selection of smaller plates and bruschetta boards - however they also have dinner specials too.  First time I went here with a business associate for lunch - we ordered way too much food and ate all of it!  It's a little gem!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! The food, the drinks, the service, the atmosphere. I am thrilled I found this hidden gem. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I had an even better time last night hanging out in the lounge. The bartender knows how to make a mean cocktail and the vibe is upscale, yet relaxed. I'd call this a \"lite\" version of the Velvet Tango Room. I had a Moscow Mule and a Mint Julep and bother were pretty damn fantastic.

I was able to try out a couple of the vegan appetizers, too. The olive tapenade was fantastic. 

If I lived closer, this would be my go to bar."}
{"text":"I attended a private party in the back bar room recently and was pleasantly surprised by the space! It is a comfortable, eclectic room with various seating options. For a bachelorette party, this was ideal. We could mingle around the room and sit on couches or around a table. The food was phenomenal! They brought out trays of perfectly, bite-sized morsels of yumminess. I'm a big fan of grazing. This was grazing at its laziest. I sat and chatted while being offered a bite periodically. Mimosas and the best chocolate mousse dessert make me want to come back for brunch very soon!"}
{"text":"Personally, I feel that Cleveland is lacking in brunch spots. But what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality. I have tried several dishes and loved them all! I'm actually craving the croque Madame at the moment...opens in 47min...count me in! 

Warm cozy atmosphere
Lovely music
Delightful staff
And the food...spot on! 

Also been by for their drinks (not dinner though...yet). Very very good too!"}
{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood spot.  Great wine list, attentive service, and friendly owners."}
{"text":"Delicious food and an intimate atmosphere. The service was great too. I enjoy trying local places when I travel, and this was a hit.  I only wish there were tables available outside, as it was a little warm and cramped sitting near the kitchen."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service ..great collection of wines :) the bruschetta board had some great options !!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Cute atmosphere- small but cozy and trendy. It's great for a date or girls night. The menu is light- at least in am the summer- but great for summer. The drink menu is great there are plenty of options. The main thing on te menu are the bruschetta- we loved the prosciutto fig! The Brie was just okay (wish the apples were fresh instead of cooked)."}
{"text":"Our favorite bar in the area...great drinks and very cool atmosphere...we have tried a few of the small plates but haven't tried dinner yet...if your in the mood for a drink and driving down Fairmount this place is a must stop"}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars because I like the decor. The food is ok, but definitely not deserving of the price. I had the turkey panini, the turkey was cold... I thought paninis were hot?
It was ok, not memorable. I also had the red lentil soup which was good, also not memorable. My main complaint about this restaurant is the staff. Everyone looks like they just rolled out of bed.... messy hair and extra casual clothing. One server was walking around with sunglasses on his head at 8:30pm. The bartender looked like she was doing laundry and going to walmart casual. When I spend a decent amount of money on food, I expect the staff to at least be clean cut and care about their appearance. It really just turned me off. I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I had dinner with a couple of people there. Ambiance is great, server was good, the water server shoved the jug in my face inadvertently as I sat talking to the person across the table and she was trying to fill my glass;  perhaps a smaller jug or better training maybe in order.

Onto the food; my kale salad was fresh however the lemon dressing was a little overpowering. The steak I ordered looked great but was not flavorful and the sides nothing to write home about. The best course was the chocolate soufflé which was excellent.

Did not meet my expectations for the price paid so I cannot recommend it unfortunately but the location and ambiance maybe worth more to others."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  The atmosphere was wonderful, comfortable, the service perfect and the food amazing!  I hung at the bar after dinner and had a great time til early hours of the morning...well early for me at least. I will come back!  Loved the area as well. Weather...no so much...LOL"}
{"text":"I sincerely hope last night was just an off night as I have been here twice before and had great experiences.  Last night was not one of them.  Three problems -1.  the white bean and kale soup was thin and under-seasoned - very weak/watery.  It was a  rather bland broth with a handful of beans and some chopped kale.  I realize it may have been a vegetable broth but something was seriously lacking.   2. The bruschetta bread was not grilled or toasted - it was just the bread brushed with oil.  3. not that big of a deal but usually they have two or three entree choices - but tonight they only had one.    I love the location, vibe, and staff - and the owners have been very nice and gracious in the past - they were not around last night that I could see.  I just hope it was an off night.   We had out of town guests with us and were in a hurry so we didn't say anything at the time and didn't have time to re-order.  I would expect that would have graciously fixed things or refunded a portion.   Please stay on top of your kitchen guys!  I want to keep coming."}
{"text":"Best wine list in Cleveland and the bread boards are addicting!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is a hidden gem of Cleveland! It's been open for three years and I always have passed this place and now found a new favorite! 
It's very Parisan themed with everything in the decor to the decor of the bathrooms! 
Came here for brunch with two friends for their birthdays. Got the lox plate and two bloody Mary's (can you blame me? They were delicious!) we got the challah French toast to split as well. Everything came out on a reasonable time and we were able to enjoy a new brunch spot! Honestly, there aren't many around this area, so I'm happy I found this one that my friends and I could enjoy! Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Not surprisingly, this place was packed, but the service was still great and seemed very efficient and friendly. The food was quite good and so was the atmosphere. I will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"First thing I have to say is I have never written a review for  a restaurant and I have been to plenty of great restaurants the past 50 years. I'm writing tonight because the  food was outstanding at GiGis.  My friend from Shaker told me to try this restaurant and I am glad we did.   My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary.  I had some bruschetta as an appetizer.  My wife had some too.  Excellent. Then the entree my wife had was a mac and cheese with truffles and peas.  Just one word. Unbelievable. Then I had a braised short rib that was very tasty and tender. Everything was great.   The entrees rotate each night so I'm not sure when they will have the same food the same week. The restaurant reminded me of my days in Lincoln Park (Chicago).  Great vibe, food and service.    Just a fabulous night!"}
{"text":"We went to Gigi's for Saturday brunch based on other Yelp reviews, and we were not disappointed!  I had the melon/prosciutto board, while my husband enjoyed the lox board; both of us had a bloody mary.  The restaurant is small and charming, and the food was beautifully presented with perfect flavor.  The server was really nice and was there when we needed her, but didn't over-check on us.  We never felt rushed or crowded. It was a great experience from start to finish.  We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I live in the Heights and this was my first visit to Gigi's. How have I never been here before? It's a super cute place. My husband and I decided to try Saturday brunch here and it did not disappoint. My husband had the French toast and I had the Mexican breakfast. Both were fresh and delicious. I especially loved the crunchiness of the French toast. Our waitress so nice and attentive. She made us feel so welcome and was very knowledgeable about the menu. Everything is cooked from scratch in their small kitchen, but worth the wait. We will definitely be back to this great Cleveland Heights gem!"}
{"text":"How lucky are the people in the neighborhood as well as in greater Cleveland to have this restaurant?!  It is charming, good food, a great bar, occasional entertainment, and surrounded by other interesting shops and a great bakery next door.  And Paul Hamlin interiors on the other side has unique items with a fun proprietor, Diane Martini.

The soups were varied with both a garden pea with crème fraîche and a hearty split pea, ham and potato.  And the meals were as varied and interesting.  Reasonable, too.  Good wine list.

It isn't the first time we've been there because we can walk from my sisters when we're visiting, and it will not be the last."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was adorable... Very cute. But interesting groups of people dining. From families to young professionals. 
Food was delicious..we got the bruschetta board with brie, trout (surprisingly good), proscuitto and pork..all delic. Between everyone at the table we had the sea bass..amazing...and lamb sandwich pretty good. 
For dessert split a creme brulé and a stuffed French toast. All very good. 
Service was okay... They tried hard but could use some work. 
Overall will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great brunch and ambience.  I want to go back and try lunch, dinner,
chill in the bar.  I highly recommend for gluten free consumers as well."}
{"text":"Couldn't ask for a better addition to the dining scene in Cleveland Heights! --And right at the end of my street. It's always been a good bet , but , lately, it's been great!  Love the booths in the bar, and the extra seating in the back with a view of the bar \"scene\" ."}
{"text":"I was compelled to write this review for two reasons; one, I was blown away by the  careful and talented execution of the food and also by the loving and warm nature of the owners. August M's lashing of these two as \"savages\" couldn't be less accurate! When you come to GiGi's, I promise you will find a welcoming and professional atmosphere and will definitely want to come again! 

Me and my husband shared their famous brushetta boards and were not disappointed. The house made pates lived up to all the praise we've heard from our friends (a food critic and also a restauranteur visiting from Seattle). And to top it off, my mother in law received special treatment from the enchanting GiGi herself when she learned it was her 75th birthday! She stopped in the middle of dinner service to give her warm wishes and a healthy scoop of jeni's ice cream. 

This place is a class act!"}
{"text":"Gigi's is one of the best restaurants in cleveland. Their food is amazing and their drinks are strong. The ambiance is quaint, and the servers are attentive. The only reason I bump it down a star is because of some of the prices. While I understand they cater to an older crowd, $14 for a cocktail is pretty high, and without prices listed on the drink menu, one assumes that a drink isn't more then your meal."}
{"text":"Gigi's is every bit deserving of 5 stars and a top-class rating.

First Off: Gigi's dinner entree menu isn't constant (and thus not online) - however, don't let that deter you.  Every day they have 3-5 delish and amazing entrees artfully crafted from local ingredients.  On the night my wife and I ate here for our one-week wedding anniversary (woo!) the options were all so amazing it was nerve racking to decide! We ended up ordering the Filet Mignon and Sea Scallops entrees, respectively.  Both were prepared in top-chef fashion, came out quickly, and were absolutely amazing - the flavors of the dishes were so forward and perfectly balanced.  Absolutely amazing - probably the best Filet Mignon and Sea Scallops we have had.  Boom.

The wine-list here is fantastic as well - many great standards to choose from: If you happen to be a red wine lover and Scotch drinker, try the 'Barbera' - a wonderfully fruity yet surprisingly smokey and amazing red wine.

The ambiance is perfectly romantic and nicely lit - you can't pick a better date spot.  Everyone who worked here was incredibly friendly, nice, and helpful as well.  Those details round off the excellent wine and food at Gigi's - a 5 Star dining experience on the East Side."}
{"text":"This place is really, really cool to grab a drink at and soak in the vibe of the neighborhood.  We stopped here for a drink in the summer and fell in love with the eclectic interior and the specialty drinks they had on their menu.  There was a long line to get in for dinner but a spot at the bar was easy to find and we were able to walk right in.  The bar had more high-end drinks and wine selections, $20 for 2 for a glass of wine each.  The bar staff were nice enough but it was hard to get their attention with so many patrons and just one person behind the bar, serving both them and the restaurant.  We felt like we were waiting forever and there could have better service, more servers... something to keep up with a Friday happy hour crowd.  We left after our drink, which was perfect and delicious (after waiting 30 minutes to get it) and then headed on our way.  I would be interested and willing to give the food side of things a try and chalk up our experience as something not normal, but time will tell."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Gigi's, yes I did!

Gigi's is the small wine bar off of Fairmount and Taylor, right next to On the Rise. I had seen reviews of this place, and since it seemed interesting, we decided to go on a Friday night.

For a small restaurant that seats only 40 some people, the place was super packed when we arrived at 7pm. We were fortunate to get seated and started ordering- a couple of Italian wines and then some good food. The bruschetta board is GREAT at GIgi's- 4 different bruschettas (from like a list of 12 you pick from) and they are delicious! We got the liver pate, the chicken pate, a marscarpone fig one, and one other. Nonetheless, they came out and were absolutely delicious. Usually, when you order bruschetta boards at restaurants, it's usually a rip-off, as it's not filling and quite expensive. Not at Gigi's! You definitely get your moneys worth, and it's enough for a meal.

While he got the bruchetta board, I ordered the slow roasted lamb shank on olive bread. Whew-y, that was one good and heavy sandwich. The lamb was so moist (slow cooked for 12 hours), and it was a good size sandwich on delicious bread (all their breads are supplied by Stone Oven).

Overall, it's a cute restaurant. It's definitely a place that is filled with Cleveland Heights locals, but I liked that vibe. I also heard that there's live music on some nights as well. The tables are rather close to each other, however, the people who go to Gigi's are all friendly, so it's fine. We ended up chatting with an elderly man for a while as he went to our alma mater. Nonetheless, it made great dinner conversation and we enjoyed our friendly table neighbor.

Overall, Gigi is a great spot to be at, and I loved how warm it felt and the cool, cozy feel to it, despite it being small. Good food, drinks and atmosphere while having that overall close neighborhood feel makes it a winner in my book."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I had the bruschetta board.  Extra greens were a must. I got the salmon, trout, pork, and chicken pate. Next time I think I'll get the prosciutto instead of the chicken liver pate."}
{"text":"I am so glad that I went to this place! This place on first sight, looks like a little modern restaurant in paris. It's very well decorated and I feel very fancy yet relaxed dinning there. Service was average but their food was amazing. First of all, they have a great selection of wine. You can really go through their wine list and find a million kinds that you would want to try. Food wise, we ordered the bruschetta board. I didn't like the trout as much because I couldn't really taste any trout flavor - the fish has a very mild taste to it and can be very easily overpowered. But i liked the lamb, salmon and liver. I thought I would hate the lamb and liver because I usually couldn't stand their taste but they made it very tolerable to me. The lamb was not too overwhelming and the liver has the right amount of sweetness and savoriness to it. For entree, I ordered the white snapper. It was delicious. Plating was very well done as well. The micro green and the tomato side really enhanced the fish flavor. It was also perfectly carbonized - has a golden color to it. My bf liked the steak they offered. For dessert, we had the chocolate devil with chocolate cake, chocolate ice cream and whip cream with chocolate sauce. I thought I will be overwhelmed by so much chocolate but I was wrong. The cake was very spongy and all three together was not that sweet and disgusting at all! decently surprised. I would highly recommend this place, if you feel fancy and don't want to spend too much on food. Perfect place for your first or second date ;)"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, okay food, VERY mediocre service.  We were a bit dismayed to walk into this dimly lit space for the first time and find the hostess stand unattended.  After waiting a couple of minutes, I walked up to some young ladies who were towards the back of the restaurant chatting and got my party seated.  The somewhat annoyed waitress (who never gave her name, BTW) took our order of cocktails and a glass of wine, we ordered a bruschetta board which was easily the most enjoyable part of our meal.  When the drinks came out, we were informed that the bar was not equipped with apple pucker and therefore my companion had to choose another cocktail to enjoy.  Again, the server was not rude but was very 'short', not friendly or helpful at all.  Another cocktail was ordered and then entrees of prime rib and a dinner portion of salad.  The seasonal soup we wanted to order was also unavailable at 8:30 pm.  The prime rib was simply decent.  Not the best or worst I've had, and slightly chewy.  The salad was above average.  Based on the recommendations of my friends and the fact that it's in my neighborhood I will definitely give Gigi's another go, but for the prices and indifferent service I won't be rushing back anytime soon.  Also, at the end of our experience the server rushed us to pay the check when we wanted to linger over our drinks and chat a bit more.  My companion discovered that the first cocktail (the one they couldn't make) was still on the bill, and alerted the server.  
That $12 was taken off expeditiously, although with no apology or acknowledgement.  I really wanted to like this place more."}
{"text":"Wow- Didn't say anything bad about your place. But thanks for the professional attempt at an insult. I dined at Le Bernardin twice last month, as I do whenever I make it to NYC. So, no- not looking for a cheap meal. But thanks for pointing out that your server may have overcharged me."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! The food, atmosphere and sweet servers were all top notch. Great place w affordable delicious food."}
{"text":"We have been here before and had a lovely experience but we were disappointed last night. We arrived around 8 pm on a Wednesday. Patio was full but we had lots of tables to choose from inside. It did not seem overly busy. Chose the bar lounge. We sat in a booth that had been cleaned but had no set up. We ordered Arnold Palmers. Our waitress (who never gave us her name) then took our orders for 1 soup, 1 small bread board & 3 salads (1 with crab cakes). Our waitress went by a number of times helping others and bringing them their flatware wrapped in cloth napkins. Still none for us. I had asked for flatware but nothing came. Then we were given water, a bit later some b & b plates but still no flatware. All 3 of us felt it was too long a wait for what we ordered. We were never asked if we wanted the soup and bread board first and then after 40-45 minutes ALL the food came at once AND STILL NO FLATWARE. We asked for flatware again and waited a bit. Finally received a knife and fork but she brought those loose in her hands (mind you, she has been clearing plates and used flatware with those same hands) and didn't carry napkins with her at the same time!! For some reason, our flatware was not the usual rolled in a clean napkin set-up. The food was tasty but the service was so lacking. Then I overheard our waitress ask another girl ( both standing at the booth behind ours) if she wanted to take over our table and that waitress said ok but we never ever saw her and were never told by the first one that she was handing us off.  We finally paid and as we were leaving saw 20-25 sets of silverware wrapped in napkins on the patio service stand.
As I said, the food was tasty but the experience was unpleasant and ruined. When she asked us how the food was, one in our party responded, \"...good but so very slow\" and our waitress just moved along with no response. Gotta say that we are torn about going back."}
{"text":"Since it doesn't have its own page, I have to say that Gigi's After Dark (the cocktail bar next door) is outstanding and so swanky and perfect. It makes me slightly sad I no longer live on the East Side. 

The cocktail list is a little short but definitely solid. The ones we had were well crafted at delicious. The wine list is very extensive with a lot of interesting by-the-glass options. 

Where this place is really exceeding, though, is the atmosphere. Cool yellow stools with grey beautiful printed wallpaper and crystal lamps. It's just a cozy, great space. The crowd is a little older, which I have no problem with but just something to be aware of if you're looking for a wild and crazy singles bar. ;)"}
{"text":"Went there Tuesday night.  Waitress very slow bringing wine. Did they go to store to get it or what? Fish amazing. Different foods. Tables are very close together. Need reservation. Soups great. Parking is problem. Walk  far from car to restaurant."}
{"text":"Another amazing dinner at Gigi's! Soup was superb, bruschetta board is always a favorite, dinner entree was cooked perfectly. Every meal here just makes me want to come back! And we will."}
{"text":"We had a great time trying the various bruschetta - I think the liver was my favorite, but they were all great! We also ordered a side of broccolini, since it seemed to be a special that night and it was perfectly cooked- not too mushy! 

Wine service and drinks were great! 

Can't wait to return to try the prime rib special on Saturdays!


This is an update to my last review, which I guess I hadn't posted! 

We came to Gigi's this past Saturday night (June 8) with a friend from South Beach. I sent the menu and website over in advance because she has some odd dietary habits. She was super excited! 

We got there late (for Cleveland standards) and sat at the bar. Everyone was super accommodating- but were out of most things she would eat (fish is ok, no dairy, no eggs...) but that's our fault. The specials go quick! 

The staff accommodated our bruschetta board with both vegetarian options- cheese removed- and made some extra things for me (I'm a goat and love all of the things there!) 

A bit later, she fell trying to get my glasses that had fallen on the floor. The owner was so extraordinarily nice and wonderful and purchased a round of drinks for us (I should have stuck with my hot water) and called and paid for our Uber. 

I will never stop going here- they care about their food, staff and customers. Thank you."}
{"text":"Spectacular service, great food and an awesome vibe! The staff was super friendly and made a great recommendation for a panini sandwich that was the best I've had. Would totally recommend to anyone looking for a unique spot with the best service in town! Priced very reasonable for the service and great quality of food! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I went here with the bf for a Friday evening dinner.  The place is totally cute, and I wanted to love it.  But I didn't really love my server, and that can leave you a little disappointed with the place.  But for the review...

4* Food:
They have a bunch of paninis, bruchetta platter, and some appetizers on the menu all the time.  They add 2 kitchen specials to the menu daily for dinner.  When we were there, they had a trip steak & a lobster special.  We got one of each.  The steak was cooked nicely, as requested (hate when places overcook the steak). It was seasoned well, and served with a yummy roasted potato and baby carrot side.  It was a nice dish.  Not stellar, but very nice.  The lobster was a whole lobster, out of the shell, sitting on top of a polenta cake.  The polenta was over cooked and had a strange texture, I typically love polenta, but not that night.  The lobster was cooked nicely, not over-done. It was sitting on a nice creamy sauce (that the bf loved, but I can only tolerate a little bit of cream sauce before it gets too rich for my taste).  It was a yummy dish.

We wanted to try the bruchetta platter, but the other reviews say it's a giant portion and we already had ordered 2 entrees.  So we got the charcuterie platter as an appetizer.  We both love charcuterie.. and it was pretty good.  Not the best I've had... they used some cheaper options... not the best quality, especially with the proscuitto.  But still tasty.

3* Service:
Our server was rather abrasive.  She didn't seem able to answer any of our questions about the dishes. She gave me a feeling like I was somehow being a nuisance to her by being there.  Maybe she was having a really bad day.  But at least she got our order right...

I would try the place again on another night and hope the service is better.  If not, it may kill the deal in terms of going back.  So many options in the area to tolerate rough service.

-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a busy Saturday night....we could not get a table so opted for the new bar.  It is a beautiful space! Warm, nicely appointed, lots of seating options including couches near a small fireplace (maybe electric?).  

We really wanted soup, and I knew the bar had a limited menu....but \"no soup-for-you\"...in the bar....bummer.

We had the cheese and bruschetta boards and they were great as usual.

My only negative comments would be that the high top tables are just too small if you order the boards.  We barely could fit them on the table with our drinks....we ended up putting the drinks on the boards....so, I would suggest finding another way to serve them in the bar, or if space permits getting bigger tables. Also, while the tall seats are beautiful, they have some kind of scoop in the butt area and are rather uncomfortable.  Maybe once they get the bar up and running for a while, they can replace them.

I will still make this a regular stop!  I love the ambiance and food!!!"}
{"text":"Three of us had brunch here on a Saturday morning recently. It is a lovely setting with friendly and attentive staff. There were enough menu choices to please everyone. The food was very good - we were all happy with what we ordered. The only drawbacks are: parking - street only, which is a challenge on a weekend, though we were all three able to get within reasonable walking distance; and as good as the food and coffee were, it all came lukewarm instead of hot.

We would go back."}
{"text":"My mum in-law is great friends with the owner so we came in since my husband and I were new to Ohio and this place did not disappoint!! They have entrees that the chef prepares according to what he feels like cooking (so neat)! I had the salmon with rice pilaf and carrots in a delectable sauce! It was so delicious and I ate every last bit of it! We also had some bruschetta which was AMAZING! They have a selection of brews and a fantastic selection of wine that won't disappoint :) I highly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a classy place to go but is also budget friendly :)"}
{"text":"So I've been here many times for brunch and it's amazing...came here for the first time for dinner tonight and it was awful! And I mean awful. Portions are tiny and overpriced. Food was so-so. Service was AWFUL. Our waiter never showed up (Steve) to check on us...especially when my order was wrong. Not coming here for dinner ever again. Atmosphere is what I gave two stars for."}
