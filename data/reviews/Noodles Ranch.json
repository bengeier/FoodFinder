{"text":"I love this place! Pho is one of my favorite dishes and I tried many other Vietnamese resturants before finding this gem. Now, I don't go anywhere else because Noodles Ranch is the best. Excellent food, fresh quality ingredients, great service. I feel great after eating here, not at all sluggish. The spring rolls are amazing, we usually get a few orders. The jasmine iced tea is fantastic. The owners are sweet and passionate about their business, they even have a cookbook out and available for purchase there."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service and them ripping me off was awful. I ordered 2 Pho soups and an appetizer and 2 drinks. My total was $42.10. I paid with a $100 bill. My change was $56.90 and they took my copy of the receipt. Okay so they missed a dollar, not a big deal. I let them know I needed a copy of my receipt and that they shorted me $1. Again not a big deal, I understand people make mistakes. These people are straight thieves. They brought me back a receipt for $43.18. I knew and my wife knew how much it was exactly. I even showed them the change of 56.90. If it was 43.18 the change would have been different. They pretended they didn't understand and that they had the right receipt all along. I wasn't going to fight for $1 and I even left a decent tip because I know karma will come back and get them harder than I ever could. Please review your tab and make sure your change is correct. They tried to take advantage of my wife and I because we were busy with the kids. I honestly will never eat there again and I will tell everyone I know to boycott them. It honestly wasn't about the money, shit if they asked I would have gave them the stupid dollar. It was all about their scam that bothered me. I hope other people read this and they are careful when dealing with these scam artist."}
{"text":"What a great place. Was in the neighborhood for work and was craving some moms home cooking. Lunch crowd was pretty busy.  I ordered canh chua ca and it was delicious. Doesn't taste like moms but it does hit the taste buds just right."}
{"text":"Quality pho at a good price!  I highly recommend the pho tai chin.  After the first time I came here I went on pho kick and came back twice the next week.  Perfect for the colder weather.  

Service was fast and friendly!

I agree with what Cindy S. said below which is that the size of the iced coffee is a bit small.  It's delicious but small."}
{"text":"Great food the pho was very good, not too fatty and. Well spiced. The chicken salad was excellent, the dressing being just spicy enough."}
{"text":"I've been going to Noodles Ranch for years and it's still my favorite Scottsdale Restaurant.
The food is uniformly excellent -and I've tried almost everything on the menu -made with fresh ingredients, it's healthy, very reasonably priced and the service is friendly. 

Who could ask for more?"}
{"text":"Vietnamese is my all time favorite kind of food. And Ive enjoyed it at almost every place where it is offered... besides this place. If you decide to go here expect any sort of experience or uniqueness. And while this restaurant wasn't dirty in the seating area, the extremely cheap attitude towards the customer and product caused me to second guess the way they take care in the kitchen. the atmosphere was very desolate. It's definitely a place for people to get food quickly if they don't want to travel too far from their neighborhood.  Every other place that carries these specific dishes, does it better in every possible way. The meat was literally all fat. I LITERALLY HAD HUGE GREY GLOBS OF PURE FAT FLOATING IN MY DISH. ....this place could be enjoyed I must say, but only by a palette of a pig or dog. The woman behind the counter was sly in her comments when I asked about my dish. As if I wouldn't understand she was being sarcastic and rude. When I asked my friend if her being unbelievably rude just really happened, he looked in disbelief and nodded his head. TRAVEL THE EXTRA FIVE MILES, THIS PLACES ENTIRE PRESENTATION ISN'T WORTH YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY."}
{"text":"Terrible pho. The broth was bitter. Tai meat was overcooked not tai at all. The place was nicely decorated and waiter was friendly. If you do go here, have something other than pho."}
{"text":"Don't let the strip center location at Thomas and Scottsdale roads fool you, Noodles Ranch serves outstanding, fresh Vietnamese food. I've been going there for over a year now, at least twice weekly. I always order the crispy egg rolls with fresh greens. Yummy, yummy, yummy! I never seem to get sick and tired of it. 

The Pho soups are all delightful and full of flavor. I can honestly say, after eating nearly every item on the menu, you can't go wrong with a majority of the dishes. The Jasmine iced tea is also a winner. Plus, the owners, Andre and Noel, always come by and chat. Noodles Ranch is a winner!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for pho in the area. Always tastes super fresh and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"Being from California, I am pretty snob when it comes to Vietnamese foods.  Noodles Ranch could be the best one in Scottsdale, but it's ok by my CA standard.   Price was pretty decent, and settings are beautiful!"}
{"text":"Personally,  I thought this place was pretty boring. I asked for a shrimp and chicken dish, and I only got two pieces of shrimp, and minimal amount of chicken. I have been to plenty of Vietnamese restaurants, and this was definitely my least favorite. If this is what arizona has to offer for Vietnamese food, I will just have to pass."}
{"text":"Excellent Vietnamese fusion dishes for a great price!"}
{"text":"Last Saturday my boyfriend and I discovered the Noodles Ranch (that's what she said!) The Noodles Ranch is located on the Southeast corner of Thomas and Scottsdale Road in the Albertson's shopping center. From the outside it looks much like any other strip mall - hole - in -the -wall restaurant but from he inside it's quite apparent that this restaurant has a lot more character than most. 

The decor is what you would expect from a Vietnamese restaurant but with a more modern and upscale twist. The music that was playing while we dined was extremely relaxing and made the experience that much more pleasant. I was even really impressed with the presentation of the food and the dishware. I love the dishes that look (even if they aren't) hand glazed with deep rich blue hues (with all their bubbly imperfections). 

The food itself was extremely satisfying as well. Both my boyfriend and I shared an egg roll appetizer (we debated between this and the spring rolls which also sounded quite tempting). The egg rolls came with fresh lettuce (to wrap them in) along with freshly chopped carrots, cucumbers, sprouts, a special sauce with a bit of a tang to it. For the main course we both ordered a bowl of the chicken Pho with broccoli and bok choy. Pure deliciousness. I'm a huge fan of Pho and often go to Saigon Nites up in Scottsdale with my coworkers every couple weeks but I thought Noodles Ranch offered a product that was far superior (especially with the slight twist to such a traditional plate with the addition of bok choy and broccoli). The appetizer wasn't much more than $5.95 and the bowls of soup themselves were about $7-8. An overall very good value for all the food you get. The bowls of Pho were HUGE but I did notice on the menu that you can add more noodles (the restaurant namesake) for $1.00. 

I was also feeling a bit under the weather that day and I think Pho was just what I needed to clear out the sinuses. Nothing a bit of chili paste, hoisin sauce, and some steeping jalapeno peppers can't cure! 

I will definitely be keeping this place in mind next time I'm in the mood for a quick bite of asian cuisine, and it's so close to my house!"}
{"text":"This is a better looking restaurant than most Vietnamese restaurants, and clean, but the food was mediocre.  I ate here twice when I first moved here a year ago.  The first time I had a banh mi with salad,  a lunch special.  It was good and  priced at $7.99, no bargain but doable.

The second time I went I had pho from  the menu,  with slices of beef. It was hugely disappointing.  The broth was weak and almost tasteless.  On top of the vapid quality of the broth, it was expensive at over $10.00. I've been to tons of Vietnamese restaurants in different parts of the world, and this place had one of the worst and most expensive  pho broths ever,  The quality of a Vietnamese restaurant's pho is a benchmark of the overall quality of the restaurant; therefore, two stars is all I can give to this restaurant.  

Do yourself a favor and go to  more authentic Vietnamese restaurants.  They might not be quite as attractive, but they'll spend more money on the food,and make things taste right."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best Pho place in this state of Arizona and maybe even the best I have tried. 

We always order the Pho Tai Chi (which is regular pho with sirloin and brisket). The combination of the beef with the soup and noodles make it heaven. The staff is also extremely friendly and nice, the owner constantly is walking around asking how the food is and always greets us with a \"Hows School\" (We go there too much!!). I highly recommend this place if your ever in the area or have the craving for Pho; I only gave it 4/5 stars because this place isn't good with groups, last time we went in a big group of 7 we ended up waiting a good 30-45 minutes for our pho to come."}
{"text":"Nearly half a decade ago, a man's fantasy became reality in a form never seen before: Scottsdale, Arizona. The motivation for overhauling the city's master plan was to create the greatest feast for the senses in the American Southwest. Everyday, reputations are on the line as master chefs pit their artistic creations against each other.

If my memory serves me correctly, and I think it does, the French first colonized Indochine in hopes of seeking access to rubber. And the greatest beneficiary of this decision would be the brothers Andre and Edouard Michelin, inventors of the world's first removable pneumatic tire. To encourage automobile sales, and by extension, their tires, the Michelin Company begin to print free travel guides at the turn of the century with recommendations and ratings systems for restaurants, hotels, and attractions throughout France. These ratings are still the most influential culinary grades in the Western world. It should come as no surprise that as controversy about the Michelin system has grown, Vietnamese cuisine has finally seen the rubber hit the road.

A recent addition to Scottsdale's culinary universe is Andre Nguyen. Having migrated to America near the end of Republican Vietnam. Arriving in Seattle, Nguyen attended culinary school and met his wife, Noel. But despite the lure of of other cuisines, the chef stayed true to his roots and opened Andre's Eurasian Bistro in the suburb of Bellevue. His success was almost derailed by a fire that gutted the place. Ngyuen however used the time as a sabbatical, improving his craft, and re-opened his restaurant. Local journalists likened it to the Greek mythological creature of rebirth , the phoenix.

But as luck would have it, he and his wife sought out to leave soggy Seattle for arid Arizona for a different Phoenix. At the end of 2005, they took over a hole-in-the-wall called Pho AZ and named it \"Noodles Ranch\". Here today, Chef Andre rules the roost with impressive skill.

The interior decor flatters the otherwise mundane feel of the strip mall in which it sits. Andre has been careful to use color and light to accent various pictures, newspaper clippings and other decorations. But what will surprise the visitor is the degree in which Andre takes this so seriously as to neglect not even the bathroom from this regime.

His menu is a mix of predictable, authentic Vietnamese dishes and his own creations borrowed from other cuisines or his own imagination. Chef Andre is not a reckless auteur, but his more audacious dishes may have fewer fans than his bread and butter. 

As the Chef takes many of the orders personally, guests often might assume the service to be poor, undercut by Andre's own seemingly curt personality. But this ignores the fact that in authentic Asian restaurants, servers often seem more distant and unpleasant than Denny's. Do not let Andre's intent become lost in translation.

Finally, in standing with his other bretheren, the Chef achieves this all with low prices. Now Chef Andre, \"the Giant\", after years of success in the land of gray skies face your greatest challenge yet. Hold your own against the city's most eminent gourmands, not just for you but for the good of all Scottsdale."}
{"text":"After all of these 5 star reviews, I was super disappointed in my meal. The pho was mediocre at best. I found it to be seriously lacking in flavor and depth. I think it could use more anise. For all of you that gave a rave review and for anyone reading this, go to Cyclo in Chandler or Khai Hoan in Tempe. They're both worth a farther drive."}
{"text":"Fabulous neighborhood resteraunt!! Great Pho! 
I love their curry and rice noodle with veggies
I will always continue to come here"}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend for lunch - and to be honest I never even noticed this spot. It's located near Lo-Lo's, which is where my attention always seemed to be drawn. (Who would have thought?)

They have great lunch specials, so I opted for that. The cashew chicken stirfry was AWESOME. Everything was cooked and season just perfectly. Even better, it came with a cup of soup and a potsticker. I love bonus goodies! 

Will definitely be back - so many other fun menu items to try."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Vietnamese in Scottsdale, then don't go here.  But if you're craving general Asian flavors and don't mind a touch of grease in your food, then Noodles Ranch may do in a pinch.

The banh xeo (Vietnamese crepe) came across more thin omelet than crisp crepe.  While the filling of pork and shrimp were quite generous, the flavors were much more Chinese than Vietnamese.  The catfish dish tasted pan fried (with a generous splash of oil) despite the menu description of \"grilled.\"  Heavy use of turmeric also made it taste vaguely Indian.

Overall, not a bad pan-Asian food place, but the flavors just didn't fulfill my craving for Vietnamese.  Next time, I'll take the drive to Da Vang."}
{"text":"Love this place, very nice inside, good food:) perfect area:) only thing I wish they would have delivery:) spring rolls r the best:)"}
{"text":"I've had Pho all over the valley and this is my favorite place.  I especially love the Chicken and Vegetable Pho with broccoli and bok choy.  I love that they serve cilantro on the side plate.  The jasmine green iced tea is yummy as well.  Be sure to try the BBQ Pork Spring Roll!  Service is always fast, even at busy lunch hour.  The older gentleman (he might be the owner?) remembered me after only one visit and takes the time to explain details about the food.  It's a couple dollars more than some other Pho restaurants, but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Grilled pork and egg roll noodle bowl is delicious.  We also tried the chow fun and it was excellent."}
{"text":"We can't get enough of this AWESOME place!!! Chef Andre' and Noel are wonderful, the staff is always pleasant to us and they remember us every time we come in for lunch or dinner....during the Fall/Winter months we are regulars (the Pho tastes SO much better in the cooler months, for some reason)....we consider the food to be Comfort Food and we love supporting a local restaurant.

We start with the Iced Tea (Jasmine) and Spring Rolls, as usual....they are filled with cold rice noodles, shrimp, pork, fresh mint and lettuce. They are accompanied by a house peanut sauce for dipping. Traditionally, we get this appetizer every single time, without fail, every time they are wonderful.

For entree's we are creatures of habit....I always get Pho with meatballs & tendon....I love all the garnishes they supply: love the fresh mint, cilantro, bean sprouts and fresh lime for a citrusy zing. The hubby always gets V-6, Grilled Pork with Rice....the pork is always perfectly cooked, very tender and has a wonderful aroma when it comes to the table. We truly love Vietnamese food and came to love it because of Noodles Ranch!"}
{"text":"I'm out picking in this area...this spot is always a win for me ..!!!! Love the decor & music, and family run biz. They r very sweet and  food always lovely deliciousness!!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  The service was fast.  I had the chow fun,  and my husband had the house fried rice.  We love them both.  This is a great place for lunch.  It is very casual and in a strip mall.  We will be back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"The wait time is ridiculous! Took forever to be seated, and even longer till we even ordered a drink. The waiter (probably the owner) went to take an order to a table that had arrived 15 minutes after us. This is my first time here and honestly by the time our food arrived I knew this would be my last."}
{"text":"The dining room is filthy and the way they store their product in guest areas if tacky. Also the base boards have ugly black mop stains like a ring around the interior. Ewww

The food is just ok at best. Warning do not watch the employees eat or look at what they're eating. It will make you want to quiver."}
{"text":"I have been to noodle ranch once so far, food was great, fast, cheap and fresh. Place was a bit dead for Sat at lunch but since it is right down from LoLo's chicken and waffles I can understand it. People go for the 'hip' not necessarily the best food.
No question about it, I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Okay, so I\"m not a Pho aficionado. I haven't tried Pho Noodles in Vietnam or Thailand so I don't have the original to compare them to. Some people are really picky. I'm not one of them. 
But I HAVE tried Pho noodles in several different settings and we really enjoyed our dinner at Noodles Ranch. 
My mother in law was with us and had never tried Pho noodles. She IS pretty finicky with her eating at times. She loved them. She and my wife ordered the Chicken noodles (P5).
I ordered the P3 (Sirloin and Brisket) noodles and thoroughly enjoyed it. We had a party of 4 and also ordered some Spring Rolls. They seemed fresh and tasted good as well. 
The only minor disappointment was that the toppings plate didn't have cilantro. We got sprouts, basil and jalapenos and apparently parsley instead of cilantro. We love cilantro. 
The ambience and inside decor was hands down WAY better than most Viet noodle shops I've been to. Tinted walls and attention to detail. A well maintained and decorated restaurant is likely to be better maintained in the kitchen for cleanliness as well.
I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys Pho noodles. 
It's not PF Changs, but I'd rather support the little guy anyway. The prices were very reasonable as well. Don't hesitate to give it a try. We're going back."}
{"text":"Great Pho for lunch.  We tried the spring rolls which had excellent peanut sauce.  Also had the chicken pho and pho with sirloin & brisket.  This place filled up just before noon on a Wednesday so plan your visit accordingly. Fast and friendly service, too."}
{"text":"Nice service and nice decor.  That's probably the best thing going for Noodles Ranch.  It's clean, unlike most hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese restaurants.  However, the food is below average compared to the usual Vietnamese restaurant.  The pho broth is bland.  Egg rolls and spring rolls aren't bad but aren't fantastic (i.e., average).  The rice dishes and curry noodles dishes are also too bland.  Also, the price is high for Vietnamese ($9 for a bowl of pho?!).

The food quality is a 2-star because it was just too bland for the usual flavorful Vietnamese dishes.  However, the nice service and the cleanliness earn it an extra star.

As other Yelpers suggest, this is probably a good place to introduce people to Vietnamese food, but if you're looking for authentic/flavorful dishes, you should pass."}
{"text":"try the pho is super good!! i feel like a food critic but im qualified because i was a chef :) this place is a legit vietnamese food restaurant! for that reason reason they get 5stars from me Alex P"}
{"text":"We love their pho, so much so that we eat here almost every Friday. The spring rolls are fresh and tasty. The peanut sauce is delicious too. It doesn't have that watered down peanut butter taste and texture as many other establishments. The friendly service is consistent. The restaurant is always clean and the decor is warm and inviting."}
{"text":"It's good Pho. I'm not the hugest soup fan, but you add a little spice to it and it's pretty good. Prices aren't that bad. The non Pho dishes though are ok. Maybe a good place to come if your sick. Service is on point though. They're quick with things. Only complaint is they close at 8:30pm on the weekdays and I usually like to eat late. I know some people who would eat here every week, but this a once a month place for me."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go. I get the vegetarian pho, And veggies dumplings! A little hot Jasmin hot tea EVERYTIME! Best I've ever had! They know us well and treat us like family!!!!
Fee fi PHO yum!!!!"}
{"text":"I am originally from southern california and live next to little saigon. It's safe to say that i know my pho...  i came here thinking that with a 4 star rating, can't go wrong.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed.  Their Pho Soup base was bland.... their thai milk tea tastes watered down..   sad to say, if this is 4 star, az is missing out.."}
{"text":"I figured I should write this while I'm still full of Pho. My husband and I are able to meet here for lunch, as it's in between our two work locations. Noodles Ranch is simply the best lunch compromise ever. The service is friendly, spot-on and I've never been disappointed with the food. Quite the opposite, I'm ecstatic over it. Even while I'm sitting here full, I'm thinking of the leftover Pho I'm going to have for dinner tonight. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Some of the best Phó in the Phoenix metro area. And the owner is from Seattle, doesn't get better than that!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch. Super friendly staff and very fresh food. Definitely recommend for a quick and convenient meal!"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings. I like the food. The broth was slightly sweet.. and the veges didnt taste fresh... But i am speaking from a girl from california where these a pho restaurants around every corner.
I would visit again."}
{"text":"This is a review that is long overdue..I have been eating here for two years and have tried most of the menu..

The pork bahn-mi is perfect! Soft French bread, fresh veggies, grilled pork with a little mayo..Yum!! 

The pho is delicious! Actually, I have yet to find a pho that I haven't loved. 

The lemongrass noodle dish is light and very flavorful.. Maybe the best dish there!!

Ginger limeade is a wonderful way to wash everything down.

I highly recommend Noodles Ranch!"}
{"text":"There was a line to be seated and the wait staff were just mid ing their own business cleaning tables. That's fine, but it was several minutes before anyone was seated. 


We were finally seated and no one came around for our drink order. We waited a good nearly 10 minutes before someone came to the table and we ordered our food. 

Another couple came in after us, we're seated, got their drinks, and their first and second appetizer by the time we got our first plate. The couple seated just before us was already finished eating by the time we got our soup. 


The food is excellent, but the service (or lack there of) is enough to keep us from returning."}
{"text":"Yesterday evening i and a friend ate at the Noodles Ranch. Our meal consisted of the fried egg rolls and Beef Pho with sliced eye of round and brisket. The egg rolls did not come with an adequate amount of herbs to wrap with the lettuce and the Pho had 1/3 the amount of meat of any of the Vietnamese restaurants serving the same dishes. 
I informed the owner's wife of this and she asked me if i knew the price of beef these days and then suggested i eat vegetarian or just deal with it. I was astounded by these unbelievably rude remarks paid the bill and left. The Pho was not a real beef Pho, but mostly a noodle soup. 
Beware diners. Although he flavors may be good and the location convenient for those of us living in Scottsdale, this place is a rip off and the management is down right rude.
I have eaten here for quite a while now but this will be my last meal there. 
Beware Noodles Ranch. Your customers will catch on to your tricks   Most importantly beware diners, you will not be getting what you are paying good money for at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Reliably delicious Pho

The staff is always very nice and also efficient!

Thanks Noodles Ranch!"}
{"text":"Very good experience,went with my girl friend and i had the chicken pho soup omg was so so good I'll definally come back and take my friend to try"}
{"text":"Bottom line, over priced for what you get.  

The spring rolls are very good and the Pho has a nice broth, but for what you are paying they really skimp on the meat and vegetables(which you are paying extra for).  Mostly broth and noodles.  Reminded me of my college days on the all ramen diet.

Three stars for flavor and the very good spring rolls."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good pho.  More expensive than what is typical for pho in Southern California, but for Scottsdale it's probably normal."}
{"text":"Red umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. Ginger lemonade with fresh pieces of cut ginger floating inside. Perfectly organized tables and exquisite attention to detail in your meal. 
This is just the start of the experience you will have  at Noodles Ranch. It's the type of place you'd drive right by and not even notice, but once you make it inside, you'll be ever grateful you did. I love Vietnamese food and a very rare thing happened to me when I ate here, I forgot I was in the States. From the lemongrass chicken to the fresh crunchy egg rolls, everything about my visit was great and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Their pho is traditional and tasty! Comes with all the goodies you would need to assemble your very own pho! 

The outside looks a little questionable but the inside is very clean and cute!

My order was ready right away and nice n hot. It was made exactly how I wanted it.

I will definitely be back to this place! The other menu items look promising! 

Yay!"}
{"text":"Customer service on point! Great people and even better food. The eggrolls were delicious and the broth in the pho"}
{"text":"I'll admit it freely - I have a SERIOUS addiction to Pho.  I can't go more than two weeks without it. 

When I lived and worked in Old-town Scottsdale, this was my lunch spot at least twice a week if not more!  Their Pho is delicious and their broth is amazing all on its own, not to mention the plate of fresh herbs, jalapenos, limes and sprouts.

The staff is super nice too - the first time I ordered crispy spring rolls, they not only brought it super fast, they also taught me how to eat it properly, wrapped in lettuce with more veggies and a yummy light sauce.

The strip mall they're in is a little sketch, I'll admit, and the first time someone brought me there I was worried, but the food is delish and I eat there every chance I get!"}
{"text":"Hey Yall....Superior Customer Service....Awesome Chicken & Meatball Pho....Small and Quant...Tastee Desserts and and a Prickly Pea Tea that will knock your socks off!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place so hard. 

V1 order the V1 why are you still reading this?!? you're mad!

seriously though, V1. get it. 

Apparently they have the best pho in the state too. I don't like pho in general but I have gone to this place with at least 20 different people. All leave phofilled, both physically and mentally. 

They are unbelievably consistent and never disappoint."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something, they make the best PHO in the valley period! Feel free to order P3-\"double meat\", great!  Everything else is very good as well, and the prices are very reasonable.  Make sure you get there before the lunch rush otherwise be prepared to wait for a table."}
{"text":"it has taken me 2 trips here to actually realize just how bad the food and the service really is.

i have order many different dishes and have found them to be tasteless.  there broth always seems the same no matter what is ordered.

anyone who knows good asian food knows that this food is totally uneatable."}
{"text":"Food and service were great. The stir fry is a must. Ordered two dishes, asparagus, spinach, shitaki mushrooms,and tofu with rice. Second dish was greenbeans, carrots, onions, rice noodles, and chicken in a curry sauce. Both were so delicious. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love this place. I usually get the chicken yellow curry on rice noodles. My drink the ginger limeade is the best. For desert the banana coconut bread pudding is to die for. I usually don't get deserts but get this everytime I go there. Prices are very good. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for really good asian food."}
{"text":"I don't think you can really expect to find authentic Vietnamese food this close to Old Town, but they do a fine job here.  Everything I've had here is good.  I did have an appetizer with shrimp and sweet potato (if I remember correctly), and it was a little greasy for my taste, but still not bad.

Part of what I love about Noodles Ranch is their ability to provide fast and tasty take out.  They package it right, so it's still hot and fresh by the time you get home.  This may not be a big deal for most people, but when you live so far away from civilization, like me, this is an impressive feat.  

The Service is always good, and often interesting.  I wanted to know if their coconut water was fresh once, and you should've seen the look the server gave me (hilarious!!!).  They must not get that question very often.  Another time, the owner gave me a history lesson on the origins of Thai iced tea.  Call me a nerd, but I dig stuff like that."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Noodles Ranch now and I think it's absolutely awesome!!!  You can tell this place is family run, exceptionally clean and they take pride in all the menu items!  Spring rolls were delicious, I ordered the lunch special cashew chicken stir fry and it was insanely tasty, even the vegetables which I'm usually not super fond of.  My wife gets the steak pho, she is still eating and hasn't said a word to me in 10min, must be good :). Service is awesome also, really nice people!"}
{"text":"Great place to get your lunch-time pho fix. Ordered the chicken pho and was surprised at how good it was, given that this place seems less traditional than many Vietnamese places I've been to. There seemed to be more noodles than I normally get and the chicken was very good. The meal was plenty for 7.95.

The \"Vietnamese Iced Coffee\" was comparable to that of McDonald's iced coffee and was given to me in a glass. So I had to either continually mix the tastes of coffee and pho or finish it all right before I went back to work, which I did. 

My biggest gripes are that pot stickers aren't on the menu and the lack of more than maybe 3-4 smoothie options. I don't think boba was even on the menu. A single pot sticker is available, however, if you get a lunch combo, so I was confused by that. Oh yeah, none of the lunch combos contained pho or any noodle bowl. That seemed strange to me considering the place is called Noodles Ranch and how popular pho is.

But I'll be back one day to get my quick $7.95 pho fix in an area of town that seems to be surprisingly lacking quality Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"I went here on a suggestion from a friend. Understanding that this is in Scottsdale, I expected to pay more for a bowl of pho.

I ordered the pho tai and a Vietnamese iced coffee. Veggies brought out were stingy (literally, a single sprig of cilantro on what was to be shared between 2). The beef was overcooked and I could taste it in the otherwise bland broth. 

My pho judgment is based on how much I have to doctor up the broth. Maybe it is because I was raised on Southern Vietnamese tastes, but I squeezed 5 or 6 pieces of lime and two spoonfuls of hoison sauce and it still was very \"meh.\" That's relative to the 2 lime pieces and maybe a small squirt of hoison I add at either at home or other Vietnamese spots. Oh, and I also got charged the same price for a small bowl for a regular bowl.

My iced coffee also was pre-brewed. Perhaps another cost saving measure, but it was much heavier on the French coffee side than the condensed milk side.

As my friend put it, this place is for people who just don't know any better about Vietnamese food. There are places far more worth your time."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here for years. It saddens me to think that the only reason I am writing is because of dissatisfication. I love P7 on the menu, but with P7 we always order the large (3) spring rolls. However, the size of the spring rolls are getting smaller and smaller.  They taste so good, but quality is going down. Aside from the menu, the service is horrible! If you plan on eating here allow for an extra 30 minutes. First it takes them forever to seat you, then it takes them forever to take your drink order. Then they take your drink order and they forget a drink! Service is slow. I like this place, but they need to change some things before I go back."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for a few years. They made a point to know my name and it gives me the warm and fuzzies! I would say everything is good except I am not a fan of cold spring rolls. I love the presentation of the pho...you get a friggen salad to make your own little creation. The mango chicken is awesome and something I crave often. They make a great Mango spicy shrimp salad that rocks with a little kick. And their Chicken fried rice has ruined me for so many others. It is so good that I can't eat it anywhere else! Great for Carryout or dine in."}
{"text":"The pho is probably the second best in the valley. I typically go to the egg roll factory in Chandler but when I'm up in Scottsdale this location is not only the busiest but the tastiest pho. So spring rolls are good but the peanut sauce is not sweet enough. I haven't tried the sandwiches yet but the FO is good."}
{"text":"I've grown up with Asian food my whole life, so I can say that this food is quality. I love that they take health into account while preparing food; using minimal oil and fresh ingredients. The Vietnam Basket is fresh, satisfying, and even healthier if soft tofu is substituted for fried. My favorite item so far is the Tofu Asparagus Five Spice Special with brown rice but I still plan to try many more dishes. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have to start out by saying I LOVE pho. I search for it everywhere. This place is extremely underwhelming. 

I ordered the spring rolls and pho ga. The spring roll was fine, nothing special. The pho was where my disappointment was. The broth was a beef broth, not chicken, which was the first mistake. It was also lacking flavor. In addition, the sauce choices aren't the usual, they basically only have soy sauce or Sriracha and were very stingy with the veggies to throw in.

Overall, there are a lot of better options for pho in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I love this place!  My husband always orders the Lemongrass chicken and i tend to get the chicken curry.  We just can't get enough!  the food is perfection!   We also enjoy the thai tea and the spring rools and are dying to try the creme brulee (coconut i think?  yumm!!!)

I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am so glad that I found Noodles Ranch. I have dined in a few times, but I typically grab take out for dinner on my way home from work. Great customer service and the pho is delicious!"}
{"text":"Noodles Ranch is run by Andre, a friendly Vietnamese gentleman who gets to know all of his regulars. The food is very good, and the pricing is very reasonable for the quality and portion size received. My wife and her family are all Vietnamese (and excellent Vietnamese cooks) and they eat here regularly. Andre is not trying to create a high-end Vietnamese experience such as Slanted Door in San Francisco, but rather a reasonably priced family restaurant that people will visit several times a month. His pho is quite good (although it loses something when purchased for takeout), and I always recommend the bun dishes, and also like the eggrolls. Noodles Ranch is a great Vietnamese family restaurant with friendly staff and good healthy food. I warmly recommend it for the quality and the value."}
{"text":"Although hidden in a dumpy little strip center on Scottsdale and Thomas, this place has GREAT food. Chicken and vegetables were very fresh (and I am REALLY picky about meat in these types of restaurants). Thai iced tea is delicious. They only serve beer and wine (I think they have wine, they def have beer). Very casual and good service."}
{"text":"No brown sauce out of a can here--as found in too many Asian restaurants.  Homemade meals with sauces that taste like they are made from the juices of the ingredients. I've had the Pho w/shrimp(the stock is delicious), the Curry Seafood w/rice, the Crispy Eggrolls and the Mango Chicken. Thumbs way up for all four. The Spring rolls are good but have too much lettuce.   Best Asian food in Phoenix for the price."}
{"text":"Third time was not a charm.   I had been here a couple of times for lunch so when a friend suggested it for lunch I said okay.  The first two visits were not memorable in either a good or bad way.  

I suspect there was no adult supervision on my third trip.  The drinks came out quickly and we got our four orders in with a few minutes of being seated.  We ordered 3 lunch specials and a bowl of pho.  Two salads and pot stickers came out for the lunch specials in another 10 minutes along with the herbs/sprouts for the pho.  Salads were OK, pot sticker was cold.  It took flagging down a waiter two more times to get the third salad to arrive.  We are now about 30 minutes into our 1 hour lunch.  After another 10 minutes we track a waiter down to find out about our order he said another 5 minutes.  Later, about 45 minutes after getting seated we go to the counter to find out about the order.  We were then told we were next up, but they could not say how long.  We paid for our drink and ran over to Lo Lo's for a quick piece of chicken instead.

If my first two experiences were a lot better I would try this place again.  It would have been quicker to drive to Tempe and go to Khai Hoan Restaurant, which really deserves the four yelp stars they get."}
{"text":"Any place that has in it's entryway a cookbook written by the guy who's in back cooking the food is with a try in my opinion.  I stumbled on this place years ago and have been introducing people to it ever since.

I grew up in New York where people are accustomed to good Asian fare.  That, like many things, did not follow me out west.  Enter noodles ranch.  This place is small and unassuming located in an Albertson's strip mall, but the food is deserving of a much less humble setting.  Every dish I have had here so far has been dynamite.  Dish are flavorful without being over-sauced and the ingredients always taste nice and fresh.  

I have been on a Pho kick pho a number of years now and find it, accompanied by their coconut water (with real bits of coconut so you know its working) , to be the ultimate hangover cure.  

Service can get a little backed up during a heavy lunch rush, but the staff is friendly and the food more than makes up for the wait.  Try the P3 add meatballs and bok choy.  The crispy eggrolls are a great starter but  you have to make sure and use all the accoutrement."}
{"text":"Average taste but on the pricey side for pho. Also smaller portion than most Vietnamese places. Service was fast and there were a lot of people eating there."}
{"text":"I had the beef Pho and a Thai Iced tea. The Pho broth was standard and good. The portions of noodles, and bean sprouts were small. They do include celantro and basil. The Thai Iced tea was good too. Over all I was just disappointed in the portion size."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. Way less meat then normal. Way less herbs. Wrong broths. Gave me beef broth for a chicken soup. Over complicated a simple order. There are way better places. Regret going and paying"}
{"text":"So my boyfriend had been talking about this place and finally took me, and I was a bit iffy because I am quite picky about any asian food, for I've had some bad experiences...
I did have pho from another Vietnamese restaurant and it was ok, pretty much flavorless, but I tried it from here and I totally fell in love. I'd be the happiest if I could eat here everyday...
They also have the best egg rolls i've ever had in my life..
not to mention the customer service is great!

This is the cleanest and just yummiest(if that was a word) Pho place ever.
:)"}
{"text":"As a vietnamese food lover, the pho soup of this place seems a little bit modified to me. Not a huge fan. But Their Bun is very tasty. Love it!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the service is a little slow. I would come here again for the bun which was excellent and the best I have had so far. The spring rolls were okay but I have had better at other places. The Pho was decent but they did not have limes, only lemons, even though on the menu it says limes. I am starting to be of the opinion I need to start bringing my own limes into places since this seems to be a recurring theme. The portions were very large and left plenty to either take home or to just share amongst friends. I like the decor inside with the photos from Vietnam. The staff, even though the service is slow, is very friendly and helpful. Overall, a solid place that I would visit again."}
{"text":"well, i went today with my wonderful wife to spend a little time together and our favorite (Da Vang) was too far away. ordered spring rolls, summer rolls, and two bowls of pho. now i maybe spoiled being half Vietnamese, but we didnt enjoy the food. the spring rolls were ok, but the fish sauce sauce that they serve it with hardly tasted like fish sauce. one piece of  lettuce and a sprig of cilantro or two. very stingy with the cheapest things in the place. the summer rolls were ok. rolled on small rice paper and cut in half to look better, but there were not any shrimp in one of the rolls. did i mention the Vietnamese iced coffee that tasted like it was instant coffee with sweetened condensed milk? worst i have ever had. now already we wanted to leave but i asked the wife to be patient cause we really wanted pho. we both got the p3 with rare sirloin and brisket. there were 4 pieces of beef in my bowl of soup. the broth was bland except for the cinnamon that overpowered the dirty water tasting broth. now i know they are in scottsdale, but scottsdale people want to eat tasty food too. right? this place is by far the closest Vietnamese food to me, but i will not go back. the customer service was great, but not enough to fix the bad Pho. i even told my wife to write in to restaurant impossible to help fix them. too bad"}
{"text":"I'm a New Yorker, I have high standard in Vietnamese food. The pho wan't good at all. Spring roll not fresh. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Interesting reading all the hype and finally realized it was all coming from Americans. The food is ok, not mind blowing like some people make it out to be. I will come back as my expectations have been reset. Their appetizers are not so great but the Pho was good. Flavourful and and aromatic. 
Staff - ok, family run business is my take. Owner cane by yo make sure i was good, which is nice."}
{"text":"Excellent food as usual I  try to eat here at least once a month the pho is great but all their food is great they even have desserts. And by the way the portions are good sized I walkout full"}
{"text":"I had the meatball pho. The broth has a nice, hearty taste. They were accommodating when I asked for more bean sprouts. A little slow on service but they re nice and come around often. Good food for good price."}
{"text":"We eat here often and the food is always very consistent. You will have a small wait during rush hours but it is worth it. Unfortunately they don't have much of a waiting area so usually you are standing by the front door. We enjoy the P1, pho, very good! The servings are sort of small but the prices seem to match up well. Good food and we will continue to visit regularly."}
{"text":"Best freaking soup ever. Never mind the pho- just do yourself a favor and try the Tamarind soup with fish. It's ridiculous. And if you're felling noodles, the yakisoba with shrimp is the best I've had. Hands down the best place to get Vietnamese food, probably anywhere in the U.S."}
{"text":"The broth need more flavor. I have taste better. The meet need to be more tender. When you have to add to much sauce  is because something is missing on the pho. The spring rolls are too dry. Othet than that is a nice looking placr. Goof atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Very fresh food. Always friendly staff. I've enjoyed all the dishes I've tried.  I usually add
 the Arizona fried rice to the table to share.  The Crème Brule was very good for desert."}
{"text":"Never had Vietnamese food before, but I really enjoyed it.  I recommend their specialty drink, its a Ginger Lemonade.  I also HIGHLY recommend their fresh veggie spring rolls with a peanut dipping sauce, I liked these so much I came back 2 days later and order 2 to go, one for dinner and one for lunch, then we had some pork pattie and pickled papaya over some noodles, it was amazing, and very light on the stomach, not to be confused with hunger, I was not hungry still, but I wasn't Hometown Buffet stuffed either. Go!"}
{"text":"I go here regularly for lunch. The P1 (pho with tendon, tripe, brisket, and meatballs) is the best soup. The lemon grass chicken is also amazing. Don't forget to try the green tea creme brûlée or banana bread pudding with coconut milk. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop in here while I was visiting Phoenix and it did not disappoint! The seafood pho was phenomenal and the spring rolls were tasty. I wish I had a Vietnamese restaurant like this one back home in Miami."}
{"text":"I like this place. Service is bit slow during lunch. Been there so far dozen times and have not disappointed with food yet.  I wish they had whole coconut.."}
{"text":"I can't write a review about their food, never got a chance to taste it.  Here's why:  I walk in to order take out.  Late afternoon on a Saturday.  I go up to counter and wait to order.  All sorts of people in and our of the counter area but nobody even greets me for about 7 minutes.  Then some old dude takes my order and says it will be 20 min.  20 MIN.!  A little on the slow end but I said fine.  Went and put gas in car, got a smoke, came back 18 minutes later.  I sit in chair at table directly in front of counter.  Guy that took my order sees me but no acknowledgement.  I wait, and wait, and wait.  Nobody bother to acknowledge me or give me status on wait.  It has now been 35 minutes since my order.  At which time they lost my business.  I step outside, got on phone and called Unphogetabble (which is on my way home) and put order, they say 15 minutes.  Take 12 minute drive and pick up already waiting food.  Go home and enjoy food.  Will never step back in Noodles Ranch.  Nobody should be left not knowing about their waiting, left ungreeted while waiting so long at the front counter.  I hope somebody got to take my food home.  I saw all the great reviews, I guess if you got oodles of time the Noodles is alright.  I'll never know."}
{"text":"Great noodle house. I ordered the vermicelli noodles with beef and veggies (V2 on the menu) My hubby got the M2 - whatever that is (noodles with chicken). The staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean and the service was well, honestly slow (busy Saturday night). Weird drawings in the bathroom  (bucktoothed Asian ladies). Affordable and yummy, will go back but probably close my eyes in the bathroom. See for yourself!"}
{"text":"Why do people like this place? Every time I go (3 or 4 times now), I think \"well so many people like it, so it must be good!\" And maybe I just ordered wrong, I'd think.  But after the last time I've given up!  These Scottsdale people just don't know what's up with good asian food! There is so little of it in Scottsdale! Drive a bit further and go to Tempe, or Chandler or Mesa!"}
{"text":"I love coming here! The food is great and filling! I always get the P3 and with cilantro and jalapenos with siracha sauce you can't go wrong! I just wished it wasn't so hot in PHX or I would be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I'm addicted. I eat here at least once a week. I've only had the pho but it is so good! It never disappoints. 

I'm not a regular of Vietnamese cuisine. However, I really wanted to try pho and I found Noodles Ranch.  They have a large gluten free menu, including all their pho. Both the service and the food was great! My boyfriend, who loves pho, said it was one of the best pho places he has been too. We got a take out menu as well for next time!"}
{"text":"I am surprised at the bad reviews for this place. My bf and I absolutely love coming here!
Service: it can get very busy here and you may have to wait an extra few minutes to be seated (worth the wait!) or to get your check but they have always been very friendly and attentive. 
Atmosphere: cute little place that is nice and clean!
Food: love it all. We always start off with an order of the crispy egg rolls and the veggie spring rolls. They are both so tasty! I normally order the veggie pho which has broccoli and bok choy in it and I love it!! Comes out steaming hot and in a huge bowl. I have tried a couple of their rice dishes and those are great as well but the pho usually wins when I'm deciding! My bf always orders the sirloin pho and loves it as well. He likes to add the extra noodles and meat to his. 
You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars! The food is delicious and the consistency is 100%! Wish they where closer, but will have to visit again as it's been a while!"}
{"text":"Very fresh & clean restaurant. Nice prices for the serving size. Got the pork with egg rolls. Everything was piping hot and extremely flavorful. Nice decor & ambience."}
{"text":"Talk about some great food!  We walked into the restaurant and it was packed (we had to park what seemed to be a good distance away from the restaurant).  The spring rolls were good but I was blown out of the water by the GREAT pho.  The service was a little slow and confused a bit which would be better.  Overall though, I will eat here again many times!"}
{"text":"Pho really good, fresh, and flavorful.  But the green tea crème brûlée is great!  Winner"}
{"text":"Ordered spring rolls and there was no sliced pork. I ate them anyway but advised the waiter. They acted like I was making the whole thing up then I ordered bun. Anyone who eats traditional Vietnamese food knows the noodles should be room temp. The noodles were boiling hot and instead of beef they brought me pork. The waiter agreed it was pork and the owner said it was beef. I know what pork looks like and tastes like...then I was accused of not wanting to pay for a meal I did not eat. I have been coming here since they opened and have an autograph cook book from the owner. I ask you why would I want this relationship to end? Poor customer service and misguided accusations just lost them a great customer that has introduced quite q few people over the years. It is still a good place to eat, I will never enter those doors again as a result of the owners wife's handling of the situation. Unfortunate situation for both of us really."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the Pho here. I usually order chicken with broccoli and bok choy. I recently opted for their lunch special and enjoyed the sautéed chicken with cashews. It was good, but I think I will generally stick to the Pho."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Such great service, good clean food, so many flavors mixed in. My new favorite place. They have a gluten-free menu also! And they are very accommodating. Perfect for a quick or long lunch."}
{"text":"Top-notch Vietnamese food! Better than most any you will get anywhere in California;which is the capital of Vietnamese food. Pho is well above the norm,the broth is exquisitely seasoned. Desserts are excellent!"}
{"text":"Everything is amazing here! Our favorite springs rolls and peanut sauce in town! Amazing pho, any noodle dish is great, love the ginger lime aid and you have to finish off with the green tea creme brulee!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch special I think $7.95 for a soup/salad egg roll and entree'. Service is good enough but mainly focus on how good the food is :)"}
{"text":"My coworker introduced me to tjis place and I was so glad she did its fabulous!! I got the chicken curry with rice noodles its on their blackboard...i love.to add lots of siracha sauce b/c I love spicy...we also hot yje crispy spring rolls and it was so good!! The jasmine iced tea is the perfect refreshing drink to go with it...its just a great place that has good authentic vietnamese cuisine YUM!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great atmosphere, excellent food!!  The Lemongrass Chicken rice dish is so awesome.  We also had the Veggie potstickers and they were good.  I would highly highly r commend the Lemongrass Chicken though because I just don't think you can beat it."}
{"text":"Suki suki nowwww... Time for some Pho!

Can you say delicious in Vietnamese?  WHO CARES?!  This place has got the best soup in town and unlike its neighbor, LoLo's Chicken and Waffles, this is healthy stuff!  

I have ordered the Chicken, Broccoli, and Bok Choy Pho twice now and have no complaints.  They bring out all the fixins too... Bean sprouts, basil leaves, cilantro and lime mmm.  Rice noodles, chicken, broccoli, and Bok Choy are simmered in a mouthwatering broth sprinkled with herbs to boot!  If you haven't gone yet, you better put that fried chicken down and check yourself!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  So good, friendly, fast, inexpensive!"}
{"text":"As far as Vietnamese food is concerned, this is by far the best that we've found in the Phoenix area.  We've tried a few different dishes, all of which were great, but judging by the quality of what we've gotten, it seems to be the kind of place where one could safely order just about anything on the menu and not be disappointed.  

Our favorite items are the veggie spring rolls and the vegetarian Pho with tofu.  The spring rolls are made of tofu, cucumber, bean sprouts, and mint wrapped in rice paper.  The ingredients are so fresh and delicious and there's just the right amount of mint to add the necessary flavor to set these veggie spring rolls apart from so many others.  They're served with a peanut hoisin sauce and we like to add a bit of the red chili sauce to it to give it a bit of spice. The Pho (item P7 on the menu) is so flavorful and in addition to the rice noodles, has baby bok choy and broccoli in it.  It's served with a plate of bean sprouts, thai basil, cilantro, jalepenos, and lime and is some of the best Pho that we've ever had.  

It's certainly telling that the restaurant is busy even when we go for a late lunch at 2pm.  If you're looking for excellent Vietnamese food, this is definitely a place that you shouldn't miss!"}
{"text":"Last day of my vacation, so I figured that I may as well treat myself to a delicious dinner! Off to Noodles Ranch!  

I started with the cha gio (A1 - crispy eggrolls), as per usual here. Minced chicken and veggies in a light wrapper, served with lettuce, thai basil, cilantro, bean sprouts, pickled carrots and cucumbers and a dipping sauce. 

I decided to mix things up for my entree. Normally I get the ga xao xa ot (R1 - lemongrass chicken rice plate), but today I went with the bun ga xao xa ot (V5 - noodle salad bowl). Wok stir-fried chili lemongrass chicken, vermicelli rice noodles, cucumber, lettuce, carrot, bean sprout, basil and mint. 

Finished it all off with their \"Phoenix chocolate\" desert. Warm chocolate lava cake baked in-house and topped with vanilla ice cream. Not a traditional lava cake in that the center of the cake is molten, but it is very moist and the berry sauce that they put on it is very nice as well. 

I did also try their ginger infused limeade. It's very good, but you really can't beat their jasmine iced tea. Honestly is the best I've ever had. Very clean, floral taste and the clarity is superb.

That covers the food.  As for the establishment itself, and the folks who run it, both are beyond reproach.  The restaurant is always very, very clean and organized - all the way back to the unisex bathroom, which is also supremely clean and well kept.  The ambiance during lunch and dinner is always very comforting and relaxing.  

The owners and their staff are very warm, kind, polite and very approachable.  They are always happy to strike up a conversation and take very good care of all their patrons. 

If you haven't tried them, do so.  This is my absolute favorite place to eat in the valley."}
{"text":"I drove from Cave Creek to the Noodle Ranch, in search of good Vietnamese food, and I was not disappointed.  I got take out and brought it all the way home and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Very fresh and delicious.  Good size portions doesn't hurt either!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm!! Ran across this little place and decided to stop in with the bestie for a some veggies and noodles! I'm a big fan of cute little whole in the wall places so this was right up my alley =). It was so good we decided to go twice in a period of 3 days! If we lived in Scottsdale, that would totally be the spot!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh food! I have eaten here over a handful of times and I am always impressed by their quality of fresh veggies. The food is seasoned and cooked perfectly. Never soggy veggies. I've had the Pho, bowls, spring rolls, stir fry and dessert and love them all. You will not be disappointed with the quality of food and service. I love supporting small businesses! Go enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here since they opened a few years back and have NEVER once been disappointed.  Everything is super fresh and they are the nicest people ever.  I am glad to see this place thriving.

My favorite is the old reliable Pho Tai.  I also love getting the crispy eggrolls.  They come with lettuce, cucumber, carrots, basil and mint to create little eggroll burritos...  Man I am hungry!

Even if you order your food to go, they take extra care to pack everything nice and when you get home it is as good as you would have in the restaurant!

My first review and I chose Noodles Ranch, that has got to say something!"}
{"text":"love this place and the service.
they have vernons too! yummy"}
{"text":"What exactly is a noodles ranch? A ranch that wrangles noodles? If so, I want to live there. It always makes me giggle as I think of the Cuttin' Corral, where Napolean Dynamite gets his haircut. 

I also admit to knowing nothing about Vietnemese food before eating here, but I'm so glad to have discovered it!  So fresh, always consistently good. The menu is enormous, my favorites being the spring rolls in peanut sauce, the Bun bo xao which is beef stir fry in vermicelli noodles and the combination Pho soup. All the drinks are good, including the Jasmine iced tea, the Ginger limeade and the Vietnemese iced coffee.
Sadly, I agree the portions are rather small for my fat american ass...but that just means more room for dessert!!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and always enjoyed the food and friendly staff.  Just got back from Vietnam so needed a Pho fix and some spring rolls.  Not quite what we got in Hanoi but not bad - spring rolls were fresh and tasty and the Pho was quite good.  This is a nice little neighborhood restaurant - we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"All I can say is delicious and likely one of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've frequented in a while."}
{"text":"Pros: I went for the P6 Pho (Chicken, broccoli, bok choy) it was good. The 2 sauces on the table is just right. Comes with a plate of sprouts, cilantro, mint?, lime, and jalapenos. I was pleasantly surprised at the decor and cleanliness of the place for being in a strip mall. 
Cons: Minus one star for the price. $28 for 2 sodas, two Pho, and a 20% tip is a little much for lunch."}
{"text":"Tried this the other day.  It was very tasty.  I didn't know it was Vietnamese at first by the name.  I was hoping for all sorts of different noodle dishes so that was slightly disappointing but I go some good pho and was very happy with it.  I had to add some spicy to it though which I thought made it better but it's a good price for a very sizable portion.  

Great choice is you're looking for some good pho and are in the area."}
{"text":"Wow! I tried Pho for the very first time, and I am in food-heaven! It was so yummy and hit the spot of everything I was hungry for! And to top it off, the staff here are so, so nice! I called my order to go, and my husband went in to pick it up. Both on the phone and in person they really impressed us with their kindness, thoroughness, and friendliness. I can't wait to go in and enjoy the sit down area next time!"}
{"text":"Best Pho you're gonna find! Amazing and fresh as ever."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Their canh chuah with fish is the best thing on the menu (maybe the best thing in the world), but everything is good! And the owner Andre is a sweetheart. One of my very favorite restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Service is always friendly and attentive. I will admit the prices are slightly higher (maybe $1 or so higher) but the portions are perfect and the meat is never oddly colored or mysterious cuts.  Chef Andre, the owner, picks out quality product to make quality food and will never accept anything but the best for his customers. I'm glad we finally live within 15min of this place instead of driving 45min each way... which we have been for the last 7 or so years.  We even had them cater our pre-wedding event about 5 years ago."}
{"text":"I've been to most Vietnamese restaurants in Scottsdale and I think Noodles Ranch is probably the most authentic. There Pho Tai is great and it is all I order when I get Vietnamese. This is my spot for Pho."}
{"text":"Oh wow!! Best pad tai I've ever had! We went somewhere else as our first stop but it was closed on mondays, came here for our first time as a backup plan. And wow we are so happy we did!! Definitely going to be back"}
{"text":"My family and I are staying near by at a hotel. We stumbled across this gem and were glad we did. We walked in and it smelled like fresh herbs and deliciousness. We ordered grilled pork summer rolls, chicken pho, and pork vermicelli. All was delicious. The service was prompt and friendly. Our drinks were never empty and our table was bussed as needed to be. We were glad we stopped in. It was busy and for a reason. The place itself was pretty cute with a good feel to it."}
{"text":"My first time trying vietnamese food was a great success. I absolutely loved it. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love this place, I've ordered here a couple times. The veggie pho is so good! Plus, it's nice and clean inside. Great service too."}
{"text":"Love this place, spring rolls are so fresh, crispy and yummy! Pho tai my fav! Wanted to try something different but always order the same, so yummy"}
{"text":"I don't have much time to write this, but I do want to say a few things. 

I had four things so far here. My friend and I both enjoyed them immensely. I paid $16 + tip. 

I had the [A1 - Cha Gio - crispy egg rolls ] & [A2 - Goi Cuon Thit Tom - spring rolls] to start.

Oh man was this delicious. The first thing I loved when I walked in was the ambiance. Dim lit and let the sun do the lighting - very zen - if you're into that. I felt very comfortable here.

They had four sauces on the table. I have no idea what they are, but the one with red pepper flakes and oil -- the darker one -- oh wow. If you like heat added to whatever you're doing -- wow -- this stuff is for you! I loved it. 

Then I went with the Pho tai - sirloin soup. [P2* - Pho tai] - wow - broth was amazing. Everything was. 

For me, enjoying food means I need a few things. 

First - awesome food
Second - ambiance
Third - presentation

They had it all. I was very impressed by place to the plates. Don't change a thing. I hope  your business is very prosperous!"}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese I have ever had. Very authentic menu (not even in English). Great service and knowledgeable staff. The ambiance is lackluster, but this is typical with Vietnamese food. 

Great for dining in quickly or taking home."}
{"text":"This place got such great reviews on Yelp so my son and I went to check it out. We both ordered Pho because it's our favorite. The beef and tendon was nice and soft. The broth was very average and the noodles were really sub par. Too bad. We wanted so much to find our new 'favorite' place to eat Pho. We are new to Scottsdale and will keep looking. Not good enough to go back unfortunately. :("}
{"text":"Been here several times, always delicious. Service is pretty good. The place I go for pho in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Ordered some takeout, and their pho was really great! Having just moved from New York City, the Asian food hasn't exactly been the same, but this place seems pretty authentic. Great flavors in their pho..tried the seafood and the chicken/broccoli/bok choy one. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Dinner took 45 min to arrive despite few customers in the restaurant.  How long are you willing to wait? Staff kept saying it would be ready soon. Will think twice before going there again."}
{"text":"Rolled the dice one day and stopped in for lunch - payed off, big time.

They have great Vietnamese soups and vermicelli noodle bowls.  Family run place - nice people.  The owner has a cook book he co-authored on display at the front too - I'd like to try my hand at some soup one day.

The chocolate lava cake is most excellent."}
{"text":"Amazing Pho at this place, which we discovered by accident in a strip mall.  Don't let the location fool you - this is totally worth it. I find myself craving their pho a few times a week!"}
{"text":"In A Nutshell:

-Noodles Ranch is a nice little Vietnamese-Asian restaurant tucked away in a strip mall in Scottsdale, AZ.
-The owner, Noelle who is a Pacific North West transplant was very friendly and we had some great small talk.
-My brother was very happy w/ their pho.
-I ordered the Bun Thit Nuong which was pretty good too.

Overall, I like their happy hour b/c you get IPA's for only $3!  Cam on chi Noelle!!!"}
{"text":"Best fried rice I've ever had, easily. I also love their Pho and their spring rolls. Very fast and friendly service too. I've been back several times."}
{"text":"Yes, I came to Noodles Ranch for a rushed lunch a few weeks back.  It was really good and I wished I had more time to spend here.
I ordered the cashew chicken curry lunch special with a Thai iced coffee.  Everything wasgood, again I had to go to the counter and pay before they could even bring me the check, but I was impressed with this place and I'll gladly return!"}
{"text":"I have been a Noodle Ranch Regular for about the last 7 years. Great quality food and service!"}
{"text":"No wait at 2pm on a Tuesday. Lunch rush was over. Pho was decent... Broth flavor was alittle blend had to add a lot of hoisin sauce and sriracha but love the noodles strain... Thin and soft. Their shrimp spring rolls was on point. Clean and inviting environment. :)"}
{"text":"The lunch specials were really good. I had the lemongrass noodles with curry chicken and it was amazing."}
{"text":"We have been back 4 times. The Pho is out of this world. The chicken with vegetables Pho is great. Their fried rice is great, so are the spring rolls!! My son got the pad Thai and it was awesome. They are so nice. I highly recommend this place great value too!!"}
{"text":"The location is convenient and the restaurant was clean.  The food quickly came out  just as described.  My one issue was that once my friend and I were done eating, the service basically stopped once the check came out.  So no one came by to refill our drinks or asked if we needed anything else.   The service was good up until the check came."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have only had takeout from Noodles Ranch, although when I picked up my food, the inside of the restaurant looked cozy and was pretty busy for a weeknight. I LOVE pho and was amazingly surprised to find a Vietnamese restaurant near Old Town Scottsdale, not to mention one with very good food. I always find it somewhat humorous when a \"Vietnamese\" restaurant also sells things like Pad Thai and Chow Mein, but my husband seemed to like the Pad Thai a lot, so I'm not one to complain. 

I shared the spring rolls with shrimp, pork, veggies, and a side of peanut hoisin sauce with my husband, and they were very refreshing and flavorful, especially the sauce. Despite the fact that it was a \"balmy\" 105 degrees outside, I was in the mood for pho, so I also ordered the Pho Chicken, which was a huge portion. I was so pleasantly surprised to see the broth, the noodles, the chicken, and the fixins' (bean sprouts, chili pepper, Thai basil, jalapenos) packaged separately, to avoid overcooking the chicken and noodles and overall sogginess. I doused my soup in hot chili sauce after adding in all of the ingredients and I must say - it pho was delicious!!!! I was sweating when I was finished, but it was my fault and SO worth it. 

I will definitely go back to try some of the other options on the menu. Or maybe to just get another bowl of the pho. I am a creature of habit, after all..."}
{"text":"First time here while in AZ, love pho and this place didn't disappoint....broth is phenomenal here."}
{"text":"I'll give it a solid 4. The crispy rolls were excellent. I didn't care for the tripe in the combo Pho but the rest was just great. Highly suggested."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and great service. I love the pho! Been here a few times and I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Vietnamese food is so comforting and Noodles Ranch has never failed me in the value/meal size ratio so I think they deserve a solid 4 stars. I just had my second take out lunch from NR yesterday, a huge order of Pho (P7 with broccoli and bok choy, $1 extra for tofu) that I wasn't even able to finish. 

When you order take out the Pho comes in a styrofoam cup, the sprouts, jalapeno, basil, siracha and lime are in a baggy, and the noodles and tofu are in the takeout box. I had to separate about half of the broth out of the cup because it was filled to the brim and there was no room for the other goodies. Then I went to work adding all my treats and created a massive pho that was just spicy enough with the little cup of siracha. No I will say that the siracha has some brown sauce mixed in, like soy sauce or something with high sugar (fish sauce?). I wasn't wild about the sweetness that lingered because of that. 

What more can I say? It filled and warmed my belly, burned my esophagus and staved off my 'i haven't eaten lately' crankiness."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst of  Restaurants I've visited.   The food was poor, service was very poor and the manager was rude whom had a very bad attitude.  

When I informed the manager that the food and service was difficult to adjust to as a patron he told me that he didn't need to change anything because he gets enough business being in a busy shopping plaza.  He furthered that some people like and some people don't it was not his concern.  

The soups had poor quality product which was clearly appearing to farmers aged market goods.  I saw wait staff take things off the table that should have been thrown away and recycle to the next patrons offerings. This would be a good place for a health inspector and a city ghost guest. There was plenty of seating available and the wait was ridiculous and when I said I could take mine to go the manager told me that that would take an additional 25 minutes.  I am concerned about the place meeting appropriate standards for the health department."}
{"text":"From the first time we visited, I have been impressed with this restaurant. Pho places are not common in our neck of the woods and I am very happy we have found one that serves great food and provides good service.

While pho itself usually has beef broth in it, the owner has been happy to make ours \"veggie\"--vegetable broth, noodles, herbs and vegetables. Delicious! Soup does the body (and soul) good and it is definite comfort food for me. The veggie spring rolls are also very good. 

We've never had bad service here and until something drastic changes, we will be frequent customers at this little strip mall joint."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp!!  Another awesome road trip find while passing through Scottsdale.  You know you found a gem when after you find them on Yelp, you rock up and they have a \"People Love us on Yelp\" sticker in the window.

The food was great and really affordable (coming from California).  The pho was good and I loved the veggie spring rolls. They we fresh, minty and light and we were served a good portion.  Wish I lived in the area to go back and see what they were like on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I'll give a carryout spot 1 star for doing at least these two things:
1. Being located directly on my current route
2. Serving edible food

This place passed those simple requirements and then blew my socks off, so they get the other four stars too.  

Chow Main was great and not too greasy or heavy. Pho soup was exactly what I expected and the fried green beans were a nice finishing touch. 

I'm looking forward to working my way through the rest of the menu, from what I've read you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the Pho chicken or beef soup ($8-10 bowl) perfect if your feeling congested. Lots of flavor and fresh ingredients.  Shrimp spring rolls are delightful with peanut sauce !! Check it out :)
Clean restaurant and fast service"}
{"text":"Their beef pho is very tasty and also their spring rolls. Very clean and excellent service, definitively one of my favorite places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"Because of all the great reviews, my wife and I had high expectations. First, this restaurant is located in a strip mall. Not that we have anything against strip malls but we usually go there to shop - or grab a quick bite. Don't be fooled by the N Scottsdale Rd folks, this ain't Scottsdale fine cuisine material.  

We went for Saturday lunch and while we could hardly find a parking spot, the restaurant was half full. Reception at the entrance is sluggish, no eye contact, no welcome. We just stood there for a few minutes and eventually we were shown a table. Very casual setting, nothing authentic. We sat and were given menus. Andre came and took our orders. No problem there. 

Now on with the food.

Portions are small... and at first we were thinking \"quality over quantity\" but this wasn't the case. In general, the food was ordinary at best, way too sweet. My wife is Vietnamese and she did not appreciate her pho at all. My papaya salad had fish sauce in it and I could not eat it. Cyclo's papaya is FAR FAR better. My son liked the egg rolls. At first my daughter liked the sweet potato fries but eventually she bailed out. They were cold and dry. 

The restaurant is clean and overall the service is adequate. But the food isn't compelling enough for us to return."}
{"text":"I have given this restaurant FOUR tries and they have failed every time.  Today was the last time I even attempt to patronize their restaurant.  Their food is not that good, and their service is ABYSMAL.

We arrived shortly after they opened for lunch.  There was a single party of five in the restaurant.  While we waited for even a drink order to be taken, the other party was served by all three people working (couldn't spare one for us?), AND another party came in and got their order taken.

Repeatedly they walked by us, and ignored us.  We waited 10 minutes then left.  Each of my four experiences there have been like this.  I will never return.  I really hope the owners read this.  They were there today and completely ignored us."}
{"text":"I eat here because it's the most local Pho spot I have found. The quality is pretty good but it's not the best I've ever had. I go back because of convenience and location. 

They have a fruit ginger soda that is really good and refreshing. So try that if you go."}
{"text":"This is our second meal here and it was excellent just like dinner last night.  Last night it was chicken curry bun and today for lunch a seafood curry rice plate.  

Excellent service, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was feeling under the weather last night so naturally, I was craving some Pho! I called in my order and picked it up within 15 minutes. It was all ready to go! I highly recommend calling in because they get a TON of to-go orders so this helps with the wait time. 

I always get the Chicken Pho with extra mixed veggies. I LOVE extra veggies in Pho. Extras include green beans, carrots, bok choy, cabbage, broccoli, onions, and more. YUM! Even though just the Pho is MORE than enough food, I can't leave Noodles Ranch without ordering their fresh shrimp and pork Spring Rolls as well. They're honestly the best that i've ever had. The peanut sauce served with them is so dreamy. 

Noodles Ranch, you've made me feel so much better during many illnesses and for that, i'm forever grateful! See you again soon {hopefully not to cure an illness}. ;)"}
{"text":"There seem to be two kinds of Vietnamese places in the U.S.:  Those that have some truly authentic dishes made with weird animal organs and very little vegetables, and those -- like Noodles Ranch -- which are all about very fresh veggies and \"clean\" preparation.  Noodles Ranch represents the best of this type of Vietnamese restaurant and I consider it a real find.

Upon entry you can feel that there is a \"lightness\" to the energy here.  Refreshingly quiet, there is no television.  The staff appear to be family and are efficient, professional and peaceful people.  

My girlfriend is celiac so this means she not only has to avoid wheat but is also physically sensitive to food quality in general.  Noodles Ranch passes with flying colors for her.  

I highly recommend a visit to Noodles Ranch."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised on the quality of the food here. Vietnamese cuisine happens to be one of my favorites from my childhood and the food here is great! So far I've only tried the Vietnamese noodle soup and the lemongrass chicken entree. I would recommend both as the noodle soup here is one of the best (if not already) in the area and the lemongrass chicken entree was very tasty with lots of flavor. If anyone is looking for some great Vietnamese food in the area please give this one a try, it was a very solid option for me. Looking forward to my next visit here!"}
{"text":"My GOD! This place is probably the best PHO I have had in Arizona. It's clean and warm and great after a night out on the weekends (if you know what I mean ;)) 
Service was spectacular and I loved the environment. 
The owners are really friendly and welcoming. Their workers are especially nice. My waiters name was Dunstan. He's kinda good looking too with great taste in shoes. I would recommend this place to anyone. 5 STARS!!!"}
{"text":"Ok spring rolls, slivers of glass in my cup, and Pho with two chopsticks full of noodles in it. Wow! The standard for Vietnamese food is low in scottsdale. Why, why, why."}
{"text":"The slowest service you could ever imagine. I love pho so I gave this place 3 chances and it progressively got worse, it also has a bad smell to it and I once had an egg roll that tasted like dog food not even kidding. Never going back, service is very important I can get pho else where"}
{"text":"I  THIS PLACE!!! It's my first time here and the moment I walked in the door I was already in love. It's warm and inviting with trendy decor. The place was packed (good sign) and we waited about 5 minutes for a table. Our server was the owner and you can tell he passionately loves serving his customers. He recognized my boyfriend as a regular, however he hasn't been here in almost a year! Our server was incredibly kind. 

The food and drinks came out super fast and it was all DELICIOUS! I loved every aspect of our dining experience and look forward to being a regular!"}
{"text":"After having found my goto dish of lemon grass chicken recently I stopped in for a light snack and found an uninspired pair of spring rolls consisting mainly of rice combined with iceberg lettuce, and a sliver of shrimp.  These went from favorite list to I'll not order them again."}
{"text":"I had ordered here off doordash. The portion size was really generous. The broth was clean and had authentic flavor."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the Scottsdale area and was looking for a place that had really good pho. I saw the great reviews it had here so I thought I would try it. Forewarning I'm Vietnamese myself and have eaten plenty of pho so I had my expectations high coming to this place. I ordered a pho tai and it came out very bland with very little to no seasoning. I am not sure if I got a bad batch or what, but it was probably the worst bowl of pho I have had in a long, long time. They did have really good service, but as for pho I was not impressed by any means."}
{"text":"We so wanted to give this place more stars but a few things things regarding the food won't let us do it. It is a solid 3.5 stars for sure, for 4 stars it would need to be a tad better.

The dining room is very nicely decorated with a soft lighting that makes it very comfortable. The owner comes out to visit every table and makes sure you have enough water and to see how you like the food. Service is very, very good.

We only ordered three dishes so we can only rate the food on those. The Spicy Pork Spring Roll special had tender grilled pork however it was not at all spicy and the sweet dipping sauce was just too sweet without enough tartness.

The bun tit nuong cha goi (vermicelli noodles with garlic pork and crispy egg rolls) is basically the go to dish at an authentic Vietnamese place and this one hit on two and missed on two points - the meat was tender but did not have enough flavor or char notes and it was a small portion of meat as well. The second hit was the crispy egg rolls - very tasty and very crispy but there was no appropriate sauce for dipping. That was the second miss - the nuoc cham dipping sauce served with it - it was so watery! A good nuoc cham will be somewhat strong and have noticeable lime, garlic, fish sauce, sweetness and hot chili flavors in a well balanced mix. This one tasted a tiny bit sweet, with a hint of garlic and barely any lime or fish sauce notes - it was just too bland. The only offer sriracha and a hoisin like sauce on the table - no fried shallots, rushed red peppers or pepper oil as they do in Vietnam.

The only side veg they offer are green beans on garlic black bean sauce. These were really tasty with a nice coating of the sauce and topped with crispy fried shallots,

Perhaps we should the pho next time as the bun (vermicelli) noodles are just too boring."}
{"text":"SKIMPY portions on the pho! Especially since we ordered veggies only. We found two pieces of broccoli and even less baby bok choy. They charged $1 xtra for tofu to $7 bowl of non meat pho... Kind of a rip off!  Bad pho in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"OK. I live a quarter of a mile away or so. Partially due to proximity but mostly due to their excellent food, I eat here at least a few times a month. 

This place is a fantastic mom-and-pop place owned by a great couple that care about their food and their customers. The waitstaff is attentive and friendly. If you're not familiar with Vietnamese food, this is a great introduction as there are \"easy\" things on the menu and they serve beer and wine. For those of you that are used to eating pho and weirder things, these guys add extra tendon for me at no extra cost, which makes me drool with happiness!! 

Pho is a little pricey for the valley at about $10 for the combo bowl. I am happy to pay though for the convenience, the quality, and the ambience of the restaurant. The place is clean and comfortable, the ingredients are fresh, the food tastes great!"}
{"text":"If your looking for freshness this is not the place I came in during the lunch hour order something from the lunch menu and the chicken tasted old the vegetables seemed dehydrated they must of just defrosted these skinny little green beans. The rice was not fresh either. Potsticker was fried and dry. I will not ever return here again.  Panda express would of been better."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch with a friend.  Tried the pho lon xao again and was again assured that it was gluten-free.  But, again about an hour later (now), I'm having some not so good reactions.  I can't be positive that it is the pho lon xao, but I don't think I will be ordering it from now on just to be on the safe side.  But in any case, I will still be heading to Noodles to satisfy my cravings for pho, spring rolls, and papaya salad."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch while in the area and fell in love! I'm always searching for great noodle places, and this one fits the bill! I wanted to try everything on the menu, but settled for chicken chow fun noodles and a half order of fresh spring rolls. Both were amazing! I loved that the noodles came packed full of crunchy veggies-My favorite! The broccoli, sprouts, onions and bok choi were phenomenal! Even their iced tea tasted amazing! I only wished I lived closer to this gem!"}
{"text":"How is it possible I have not written a review for this place? From the check-ins, tips and uploaded pictures, I could swear I moved a cot into the front space of the restaurant to camp out. It's obvious that Pho/noodle houses are a rarity in Scottsdale. I'm not talking about fancy schmancy because any Asian or noodle lover knows the authentic noodle houses aren't about the pretty packaging. It's what is inside. This gem hands down is consistent good food, good service and a price tag that doesn't dent your wallet just because you live in the most livable city of AZ. 

Pho is the perfect warm, hearty meal when you seek comfort. You get abundant fresh veggies consisting of the usual basil and sprouts, fresh homemade noodles and flavorful broth. I will note that even the veggie pho is incredible with the baby bok choy, broccoli, and just add tofu to the order for your protein substitute. My other go to dish is the item V1, grilled pork and shrimp noodle salad bowl. The grilled flavor of the meats scream such goodness. The egg roll and veggies are perfect crunch. With this kind of healthy and taste that doesn't disappoint, I can't imagine picking greasy food over this kind of option. Let's be honest, the only time grease is an option is for those late night outings. Pho is the perfect hangover cure!!

Like any place that offers attentive service and food that never fails to please, you will have a crowd. But the staff is always efficient in cleaning tables and turning it around in time to be out the door to punch in your time clock if needed. I do adore how the entire family and staff take pride in this love nest. They want you to stay and you are never short of a friendly personable greeting by anyone. Why would you eat anywhere else?"}
{"text":"Always good food and clean. We have dined here many times and I will say some of the staff is not as attentive as the owners were in the past. I understand that is a variable that is constantly changing. Very good spring rolls and a great spot to stop if you are in south Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Hands down best Vietnamese food in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. The Pho is spot on, and the rice and noodle dishes are also great."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have not reviewed this place.  I live just a mile away from this place and I stop there on the way home from work quite often.  The service is great, the food is delicious and when I order to go it is fast and the order is always correct.  I have never had Vietnamese food from any other place so I don't really have anything to compare it to, but I have loved everything I got from here,  even the tripe in my Pho!"}
{"text":"This review is a comparison to Californian pho. After seeing the good reviews on yelp, I thought this would be a good place to stop by for dinner. However, this place sacrifices efficiency for aesthetics to keep the \"simple\" look. There are a lot of things missing on the table including utensil holders and napkin dispensers and for some reason they have artificial sweeteners on the table?? We ordered 4 bowls of Pho and they only gave us one plate of vegetables. We ended up having to ask for a lot of things \"extra\"  like black pepper, more limes, and more napkins when they should have come standard. Also the servers all seemed kind of confused when we asked for something, so we ended up having to ask them twice. As for the pho, the broth was quite decent yet everything else was lackluster."}
{"text":"I really love this restaurant and I have for years. I've recently rediscovered this little gem.  I worked in the neighborhood years ago and I would frequent Noodles Ranch for the Pho. OMG, seriously good Pho.

I recently was able to talk my extremely picky husband to try it.  I got him to try the spring roll.  And he tried a dish with lemongrass and chicken that he was really happy.  Score! 

I had the Pho with tofu.  I was very happy (especially because I wasn't feeling all that great and the Pho was so soothing and delicious).  They provided me with copious amounts of lime and mint upon request and I was one happy girl.

I will admit, I've only ever had the spring rolls and Pho, but I've never been disappointed.  

The ambiance is surprising, it is in a strip mall.  But you walk in to a really airy and comfortable space.  The decor is unique and fresh.  

The staff, other than the owner that ended up helping us, is a little lacking the service skills, but hopefully that will develop with time.  I hope they crack the whip on the sitting on the counters by the register, talking on their cell phones, and the lack of attention (hence the reason the owner took over, I assume)."}
{"text":"This place is not cheap. I've never paid so much for a bowl of pho ($11!!!) before but I guess those prices are allowed considering it's located in Scottsdale, aka the bougie part of Arizona. I mean it's the first time I've ever seen an Asian restaurant charge for hot tea ($2!!!). I'm actually surprised they didn't charge for our water! Luckily the food was not bad at all, otherwise I would've been pissed.

We ordered the pho dac biet (combination pho) and the bun cha gio thit nuong (egg roll and grilled pork vermicelli salad bowl). The pho broth was fragrant and semi-sweet. It certainly is not closed to being the best pho I've had, but not the worst either. It's okay. It tastes very \"clean\" if that even makes sense. The vermicelli salad bowl was nice and refreshing, a great alternative if you are not in the mood for pho. The pork was marinated and grilled to perfection, it had great flavors and was very tasty. The egg roll was not too shabby either, not oily.
 
Noodles Ranch is fairly modern looking restaurant with bit of a cheesy Asian twist. It definitely caters to the more American crowd as I did not see a single Vietnamese/Chinese customer in sight, so I'm not sure if that makes it any less \"authentic\" (since, you know, you gotta have one to make it so! Haha). The restaurant appears very clean. The workers here are very friendly and hardworking, especially the busboy.

Overall, I think the food here is respectable and actually pretty good. I do, however, think it's a total ripoff."}
{"text":"Absolute best fresh spring rolls in the greater Phoenix area! I have tried every spring too in a 10 mile radius of here & they are hands down the lightest, fluffiest & most tasty ones around. Never tried out, funny or chewy. Always perfect! 

They know gluten free too! They have an extensive gluten free menu too. Try the Arizona fried rice! I don't know what or how they do it but the tofu is amazing. 

Their chili oil is actually spicy too.

An absolute must try place!"}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood family owned place!!  The spring rolls are very fresh and delicious.  The Pho is amazing...when i am sick it always makes me feel better.  I get brisket only Pho :)  The brisket is a little more tasty than sirloin.  The pork fried rice is tasty! and healthy portions!  Tamarind soda is nice quench thirster... if you have never had it or heard of it... its a must!  The service is a little relaxed but very courteous and nice.  
Only downfall is they do not serve alcohol and they close a little early...8:30pm."}
{"text":"I really dig this place!  But I have to say, every 3rd or 4th visit to this restraunt is a miss.  Not sure why- but it is most of the time spot on.  I love the Pho- but the noodle dishes are what is off.  

Either way, the owners are super sweet and nice and it usually is never too busy.  Service is good, carry out is great as well.  Just be careful in the noodle dish category, becuase if your really hungry, (in my experience) it may miss the mark.  Order pho to be safe!"}
{"text":"I just moved here from Los Angeles where Pho is rampant! It is definitely one of my favorite dishes. After being somewhat disappointed in Pho in the valley I feel so fortunate to have stumbled upon this gem! 

The broth is just right and their juice selection is on point! The one thing I would say is that the size of their iced coffee is pretty small and they go heavy on the ice, so if you're going to order it ask for a big glass or less ice!"}
{"text":"I think noodles ranch is truly awesome Vietnamese food.  It's a small menu, but everything is well done, and it is probably the only place you can find vegetarian pho with a meatless stock.

If you're looking for cheap Vietnamese, there are definitely cheaper places.  If you're looking for a place that is clean, friendly and good, this is a great choice.  I typically eat here once a week."}
{"text":"I had the pho here once, it was good but nothing spectacular. It's close to my house is the reason I went. I came in again tonight to place a togo order and I was standing there for awhile and nobody acknowledged me, but as soon as a couple came in they were seated... I stood there a few more minutes at the \"wait to be seated\" signed right at the entrance and walked out after having made eye contact with employees and still not helped. I guess I will have to be driving all the way to Tempe now for pho because I refuse to give my business to this place."}
{"text":"My daughter and I both had Pho - I had the P1 Combination (all the usuals including tripe brisket & meatballs), my daughter had the P3, sirloin brisket. The broth was delicious & fragrant, my meats all tender & tasty - tripe is not always tender, but here, it was! I had the fresh Ginger Limeade, just right. And we then shared a coffee/chocolate creme brulee. I wish we had ordered one for each of us!  This is the first time I've been in a Vietnamese restaurant with good French-influenced desserts, although having been to Saigon I know that it's entirely possible.

I had often passed by Noodles Ranch on my way to LoLo's 2 doors down, had no idea what a fantastic pho cafe it is. Clean room with a spacious contemporary feel, nice young waiter. I thought the pho portion size was just right. Will be back soon now that it's \"winter\". I'm glad I don't have to drive all the way down to Mesa or Chandler for good Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"I was NOT too impressed with this place but...  it was good for Phoenix, where I am starting to realize there is NOT an abundance of people who look like me.  =/   LOL! 

Flavor-wise I thought it was pretty good.  Don't be misled by the spring rolls...  Even though it says they serve them in 3s...  its 3 that are cut in half...  so you get 6 pieces.  This is pretty good if you're looking to share with someone.  I did not get a lot of lettuce and mint, though and ate the last two pieces by themselves.  I was a little disappointed by this.

I had the combination Pho...  (YES i braved SOUP it in HOT ASS ARIZONA) and it was not too bad either.  The broth was nice and clear, just portion wise...  was not as extra large as I expected it to be.

When the bill came, I ended up paying about $18 total which included tax and tip and no drink.  I think the Pho was almost $10.00 and the Spring Rolls were like $4 and some change?

I think this place is cool but would not be my FIRST choice when it comes to pho.  (Trust me...  I've eaten a LOT of pho)  I just don;t think the price vs. portion is worth what you;re paying.  This saddens me to say too because, I am ALL about supporting small Asian businesses.  

Oh well..."}
{"text":"My favorite pho soup. The broth has amazing flavor. I have tried many other places but this place has them beat hands down. There ginger limeade is also delicious.for appetizers  Try there spring rolls they always taste light and fresh they also have crispy rolls that are delicious. The coconut curry is to die for. I would highly recommend stopping in to this place for dessert try the chocolate lava cake !"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I go to Noodles Ranch at least once per month and every dish I have had here has been quite good.  The prices are reasonable, the service is good and we can get in and out in a reasonable amount of time for lunch."}
{"text":"My family and I went here because we were in town for a graduation. We got a mixture of food, pho, rice, sample platter, and the lunch special. The food was less than okay. Yes, even though we are from Orange County, we didn't have that high of expectations from this place. The food did not taste how it should. The pho had no beef broth flavor, it tasted like meat and noodles... We ordered com thit nuong and it was not good. The nuoc mam looked like dirty fish sauce...tasted terrible. Even the sub par places in Orange County tasted better than Noodles Ranch...sorry!

The owner was nice though! But $92 for Vietnamese food for six people is too steep. They charged us 18% gratuity!"}
{"text":"Favorite PHO place in the valley because the food is amazing and they have VEGAN options."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I have never had a bad experience and the Pho is some of the best in town. Really recommend."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite Vietnamese restaurant!  The owners are so gracious and have remembered us since they opened, thanks Andre! I have seen it become a huge success with a packed house most nights. They close a bit early in the evenings and are not open on Sundays, but good for them...people need a night off!  I switch off and on from the Mango Chicken, Chicken Veggie Pho, or Mango Shrimp Salad.  The Mango Chicken (my go to dinner) has some coconut milk with a salty delicious thin sauce that I just soak my rice in with crunchy fresh veggies and yummy chicken. The Chicken Veggie Pho broth is so good too. it is huge and I have never in my life eaten the whole bowl in one sitting.  If you get takeout, just realize they separate the chicken/noodles/veggies, and fresh basil, jalapeno, lime, bean sprouts plus combine siracha/plum sauce, as well as the broth. I always get extra lime FYI The Mango Shrimp Salad has a Spicy salad dressing that is sure to have a little fish sauce so you have to be prepared for an authentic salty, spicy, & sweet Vietnamese taste.  My son doesn't deviate from the chicken fried rice, veggie potstickers, or spring rolls. They are all delicious and to this day I have never tasted fried rice like this ever. It is craveable!  I would recommend going to the restaurant before you get takeout. Be patient and enjoy every little extra they put in front of you to make your Pho your own. Much love for this place!"}
{"text":"if you love dropping large amounts of cash and getting appetizer sized portions, then this is your place.  very cool artsy asian-fusion decor, the owners are very attractive and welcoming.  food tastes great and you won't be stuffed to the gills or bored with eating the same thing all night.  it reminds me of the sample carts at costco haha.

go there if you want to look cool in a stylish place ;)"}
{"text":"The food is so plain here. I came here twice and wasn't impressed on both of my visits. The second time i came, i brought my parents and uncle and they didn't like the food either. The food doesn't have much flavor. Basically, i won't be back here for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I love this place. I typically get take out orders when I'm feeling like some pho or spring rolls. I have never had any issues with my service, my food is always ready within 15 minutes of ordering & for a fair price too.  I like everything I have ordered here and the Thai tea at least once in your life is a must. I love ordering from Noodles ranch when I want something light but filling. Also, when I'm getting sick or coming down with something pho has so many antioxidants that it's my theraflu remedy... and now I want Noodles Ranch"}
{"text":"Service is great and so is the food but there is another pho place I enjoy over this one. That's the reason for the 4 stars."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place! The staff is attentive and friendly,  the food is always consistent and delicious, and the atmosphere is calm, ambient and clean. 

My favorite dish to order is the Pho vegetarian- many Vietnamese places around the valley offer this dish, but Noodles Ranch serves the best bowl by far. They never skimp on the veggies and have an incredible vegetable broth. 

Try their chili oil- it's what dreams are made of."}
{"text":"We ran into this place as a little hole in the wall, but Oh My Lord, it is outrageously delicious. Everything we have had the opportunity to try has been exquisite. We will continue coming here and sharing our experience with everybody and anybody we can. Try it all, it is mindblowing,  not to mention flavorful. Thank you."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Thai tea to go so good luck on the food. Hope it's delish!"}
{"text":"A great place for pho in south Scottsdale, of which before this place it was severely lacking.  They have many other dishes besides this prized Vietnamese dish, but why pass up on a specialty?  Their choices within the pho category were smaller than most places I've been to but every choice is primed with great ingredients.  My favorite one so far...chicken, broccoli and baby bok choy, never found such a combination elsewhere and I search for it constantly.  I must say that the seafood pho has much to be desired as the mussels are either over or undercooked and wash out the delicate broth flavor.

If you end up with a sweet tooth afterward, try the 3-color dessert, it's something to say you've had at least once with sweet beans and green gelatin coated in sweetened milk and ice.  It's delicious and enough for two to share."}
{"text":"I'm by no means a Vietnamese food expert but the dish I had... I really liked. 
Bun Bo Hue was very good, service was good, place was clean. I didn't feel as though it was overly priced for what I got... Nuff said."}
{"text":"Have only visited Noodles Ranch once, but my first experience was very satisfying. Their shrimp fried appetizer was delicious. The pho soups are also great in serving, quality, and taste. The restaurant is also very clean with much seating. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Lifeless food. Spring rolls had barely any shrimp & pork. Pho Tai was all broth, I had to get extra noodles. Nouc nam sauce for egg rolls was fishy & salty, I had to add a packet of sugar. Would give 1 stars, but gave 2 bc service was good and it was very clean. I'm used to the whole in the wall dirty Vietnamese rest in San Jose, Ca, hehe! But damn those rest are the bomb"}
{"text":"In my opinion best Pho in Phoenix Metro.  Delicious, great service and very nice owner.  Come here and try it out!"}
{"text":"I cannot go 5 stars here, it was good, but just short of superb.   Bun Bo Hue and Pho where delish.   I have had better, but they were very very very good and plenty of meat and spice.  No Pork Hock here , unfortunately, for the Bun Bo, but good stuff.  Decent prices, great service!  almost 5 stars, but only 4 STAR stuff....fawesome!"}
{"text":"Every once in a while, the second time is the charm. And fortunately for Noodles Ranch, I am writing a review based on my second visit to this Vietnamese restaurant in South Scottsdale.

The first visit (months ago) was doomed from the beginning. My girlfriend and I were looking for an alternate to Chinese and found Noodles Ranch. We were impressed by the decor and how busy they were. We waited patiently for a table to open up. In the meanwhile, we were never acknowledged or told how long the wait was. It's not that often that I walk out of a restaurant for any reason. Being ignored is one of my pet-peeves.

This past week offered redemption for Noodles Ranch. One of my co-worker foodies suggested Vietnamese. I'm glad he did because I've enjoyed this cuisine before, just not at Noodles Ranch... 

The service was better this visit. It wasn't perfect, but that's probably due to the lunch crowd. We were greeted and seated very promptly. The lunch special featured a pot sticker, miso soup (or salad) and a few entree options. The plum and lemon-grass chicken was delicious. Everything was nice and hot and the portion was perfect. Clearly, our meal was cooked to order, so I can forgive the time we waited for the food to arrive. And kudos for providing only chop sticks in the place settings. I am sure they have forks, but those should be by request only.

Seeing how Noodle Ranch redeemed itself, I will be more than happy to visit again for another healthy, delicious meal."}
{"text":"Always our go-to place for pho. Can't quite put my finger on it, but this place edges out the competition for taste, service and atmosphere. Food is consistent and reasonably priced. Even at lunch rush, service is fairly speedy. 
My biggest complaint is...it's too close to Ahi Poki Bowl! Ah, decisions, decisions!"}
{"text":"We tried spicy pork summer roll, chicken rice, and beef noodle.
Roll was good, but chicken was salty, and forget the noodle (Vietnamese style but soup is not up to standard & beef is too dry). Chopsticks that they used made my lip not comfortable after the lunch (bad quality).
I wouldn't recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"This is my favorite little spot in Scottsdale.  Its casual, friendly and delicious. Everything I've tried here has been fabulous! You can't go wrong with pho! The spring rolls are also excellent."}
{"text":"Delicious !!! Noodle ranch was highly recommended by a friend of mine and boy was he right. Great customer service and delicious fresh food. I had the chicken wok stir fry and pho. This is the place to go if you are looking for authentic Vietnamese cuisine. I thoroughly enjoyed noodle ranch and will be dining there again soon."}
{"text":"We love Noodles Ranch.  One of our favorite Scottsdale places.  My husband always gets the pho and is never disappointed.  Great food.  Quiet and relaxing atmoshpere.  Excellent service. We look forward to our return visit next year."}
{"text":"I absolutely love small family owned restaurants and I happened to stumble upon this little gem ! The staff is friendly and location is always clean, if you love fresh ingredients I defiantly recommend you try this place out. Me favorites are the lemon grass chicken and beef yakisoba... Yum!"}
{"text":"Was there yesterday. Place was pretty crowded for the lunch setting, the food was very good service was also very good. Pricing a little bit high I thought $9.50 for a not huge bowl of soup and $3.50 for an iced coffee. Overall a good experience i will go back and recommend for a good Vietnamese experience."}
{"text":"The ideal spot for those of us that want to feign an interest in eating healthy without sacrificing flavor.  Good service and good price point. There's something amazing about how Vietnamese cuisine can taste so vibrant and filling without giving you the cheesy chimichanga what did I just do to myself guilt."}
{"text":"Noodles Ranch has a mom and pop shop ambiance with a menu that's to die for! If you're ever in the area you have to try this restaurant. So far I've tasted their spring rolls, fried rice, tenderloin pho and Vientamese iced coffee all of which I highly suggest ordering."}
{"text":"Love this place.

A low key, local spot to get some authentic Vietnamese.  Not sure why there are such harsh complaints posted here.  I've been to the restaurant several times and the food/service/price have been spot on!  Even though it's called the \"noodle\" ranch, I usually get spring rolls and some entree... I am not one of those that judges Vietnamese spots by the Pho alone.  I've ordered their Pho and i've enjoyed, but there is much more on the menu to try.  The Thai Tea could be a bit sweeter/richer -- but maybe it's a good thing not to guzzle down liquid sugar.

P.S To the poster who claims their broth is bland: You can let the waiter know if you want extra heat ;)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their Noodles are the bomb. I have gone several times for lunch and am always pleasantly delighted with the Thai flavors and customer service. I love their Green Ice Tea and anything w/lemongrass."}
{"text":"P6 a9. Hard to find. Glad I was Persistent. Food was super fresh. Well balanced. Eating healthy just got easier. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"It was Asian weekend at my house last week...not a taco in sight.  There's a first for everything.   We opted to have dinner at Noodles Ranch and dine in.  The restaurant was busy on a Saturday night, but we were seated quickly.  

That was the only thing quick about the experience.  Actually, our orders were also taken quickly, but service went downhill from there.  Our spring rolls arrived, and I had to ask for napkins as there were no utensils on the table.  The food runner almost looked confused and brought over a few pathetic scraps of paper usually found in a dispenser.  So I was off on a rant over that...especially when I looked down and saw a full-sized sucker on the floor.  I guess we weren't worthy.  Food took forever, but when it finally arrived we realized again we had no utensils.  My husband spotted some chopsticks and took matters into his own hands to retrieve them.  No one ever came by to check if we needed anything, and my husband who by now should have put an apron on, found soy sauce for me.  The check arrived slowly and without an offer of dessert.  

Why four stars you ask?  Because I really did enjoy the food.  The spring rolls were okay, but our entrees were great.  My husband ordered a special of noodles and yellow curry with chicken.  The curry was spicy and flavorful.  I was sort of jealous.  I had the Yakisoba with seafood. They skimped on the shrimp, but there was plenty of chicken and pork (the pork was my favorite anyway) and lots of veggies.  

Will definitely return, but maybe only for take-out.  If we dare eat in again, I hope the service is better...don't make me strip another star off of my review!"}
{"text":"I've only ordered take out at this place. The food is great, always fresh and the portions are good sized. So far it's the best Vietnamese I've had since I moved to this area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend developed quite the pho addiction over the past year while visiting me in CA. I thought it would be cool to try some AZ pho, but it was easier said than done as there are probably more pho restaurants in one block in Westminster than all of Arizona. 

Fortunately we had a good experience at Noodles Ranch (despite the awful name). My pork and eggroll bun was quite good and the pork was well seasoned. The pho broth was also delicious and the bf said they were generous with the meat. The ginger limeade was pretty mild and could have used more of kick. 

I had to dock one star because my Viet friends have trained me well that Vietnamese food should be pretty cheap. Compared to LA prices, I think Noodles Ranch is $1.50 to $2 overpriced. But since this is the first good Asian restaurant I've been to in Phoenix, I will happily pay $7.50 to eat pho on a 95 degree day."}
{"text":"Wow, I've been here before but couldn't remember the why I did not like coming here. Came here today for lunch and now I remember...Stingy Rude owners! Wow can I get a word in when I order, the female would not let me talk and then had the nerve to talk on the phone when I tried to order. 
If you want to order for me I think you should pay as well... part of customer service is actually listening to the customer.
I won't be back, food is ok."}
{"text":"I loved the vegetarian dishes! Would highly recommend  the vegetarian pho and vegetarian spring rolls."}
{"text":"Three doors down from Just Relax.  After a soothing 45 minute foot massage I carried the Asian theme to Noodles Ranch.  Cool interior with blue walls, upside down red umbrellas and old photographs of Vietnam.  

Since this was my first visit I opted for the $7.50 lunch special with a pot sticker, a green salad and stir fried chicken with peanuts plus added a pot of hot Jasmine Tea for another $2.  Attentive service and good value but average quality food.  The stir fry vegetables were hot and tasty but I was not impressed with the texture of the chicken.  I would have preferred all white meat.

Next time I get a foot massage I will try ordering from the menu.  On my visit there there were  quite a few patrons who seemed to know what they wanted.  Hence, the need to venture away from specials and go with the good karma from the foot massage."}
{"text":"The best way I can express myself on this restaurant is frustration.  This place was soooo close of having it done right, but just missed the mark and here is why.

I don't know, maybe it's because I'm Asian or maybe because I'm a chow-hound at heart, but I like my ethnic foods \"ethnic\" and \"real\".  I am not insinuating this place isn't, but I don't like my food to be slightly \"watered down\" so the masses can enjoy.  Unfortunately Noodles Ranch ever so slightly muted out what wonderful flavors Vietnam has to offer for what I believe, is pleasing the \"Scottsdale\" crowd.

This is how I came up with that conclusion: 1. there egg rolls and fish sauce, 2. the place was way too clean for a Vietnamese restaurant, and 3. I was the only Asian patron.

Like your typical Vietnamese style egg rolls, it came out nice and warm with that crispy skin you expect, unfortunately I thought the filling was a little on the bland side.  Also, I thought it was slightly oily for a fried egg roll.  A paper towel would have taken care of that.  But it needed some help with a little more salt and pepper.  No bold flavors coming out from there.

It came with your standard lettuce, a few herbs, julienne pickled carrots, and a few raw bean sprouts.  They were all fresh as they should be, but it was the fish sauce that started to get me thinking they might be \"watering down\" the food.  I don't know about you, but I'm used to slightly salty, slightly sweet, sour/tangy, fishy fish sauce with pepper flakes and julienne sweet and sour pickled carrots and dikon.  Their version was saltier than usual, did not have the pepper flakes and julienne pickled carrots.  The sauce wasn't very fishy either.  Very bland, almost catering towards the Scottsdale people in the area.

The Pho, was status quo.  Nice and warm beef broth with all the goodies such as sliced beef tenderloin, Vietnamese style meatballs, tripe, and other goodies, totally hits the spot on a rainy AZ winter day.   The noodles were roughly 5 minutes overcooked.  They broke apart too easily and I wish they would have given just a little bit more of the sliced beef tenderloin.  One of the owners did ask me if I wanted more soup even before I started which was a nice gesture, I just wish they would have given me more up front.

The middle aged couple who owned the restaurant were extremely nice and the service was great, especially for a Vietnamese restaurant.

The decor was very tasteful, bright colorful Vietnamese umbrellas dressed the ceiling.  I was impressed by the openness of the restaurant with its high ceilings.  The walls were attractively dressed with dark purple and muted blue with large black and white photos of old Vietnam, probably mid 20th Century, with an assortment of bamboo sticks and other trinkets from the \"old country.\"  The only thing I couldn't't get over were the booths which lined the side walls of the restaurant with stripes of this sparkly, metallicy electric blue and sandy tan color that dressed the booths.  

I must say that I enjoyed the fact that the restaurant was so clean.  Unfortunately when it comes to Vietnamese restaurants, it seems the dirtier and dingier the restaurant, the better the food.

For Vietnamese food , it was priced high, probably anywhere from $1.00 to $1.50 higher per dish.  That probably has more to do with reflection of rent than anything else.

Last thing why I believed this place was a little \"watered down\"; I was the only Asian patron during their lunch rush.  As many of my friends have said (White, Black, and Brown), \"You know how I know what Asian restaurants are good...The ones with all you Asians in it.\"   Enough said my brothas from different mothas.

I'm not saying I won't come back here, because I will, but when I want the real thing, you know where I'm going, where my Asian peoples are at...my dirty dingy Khai Hong in Tempe."}
{"text":"I met my girls here for lunch one Friday and man was it packed! I have been in this strip mall a couple of times and never noticed this place. One of my friends wanted came for the \"Pho\" which everyone seems to be raving about. I was not in a soup kinda mood so I decided to order the half of sandwich and salad lunch special. The sandwich was just ok, it was grilled chicken on some sort of wheat roll, and some sauce that tasted a little off, the best part of the meal was the cilantro on the sandwich and my salad, whatever kind of dressing they used was delicious. The service was extremely slow good thing we were not in a rush; it appeared as though they weren't prepared for the rush of people that came in for lunch. My friend loved her Pho of course so I decided that the next time I eat here I will have to try this Pho everyone keeps talking about."}
{"text":"I came here by myself for lunch. It was a cold, drabby day which is unusual in AZ and I was in desperate need of PHO. I got the Pho with chicken and broccoli and it was out of this world good! It was busy during lunch and parking was a bit of a struggle but all well worth it."}
{"text":"a much better meal than last time! after taxes next door, we stopped in for a meal. 
i opted for the vegetarian Pho. it was a heaping bowl of noodle goodness. filled with broth soaked vegetables and tofu chunks, i could just feel my body being healthy. 

add to that a papaya salad with shrimp, and i could be unstoppable. i have had papaya salad in laos, thailand, and various other asian countries. it is usually very, very, very hot to the palate. noodles ranch...not at all. we actually had to add siracha sauce to give it kick. maybe they've \"westerned\" it up a bit, but it still tasted fresh, cool, and crunchy. 

now i'm a fan! yay for Pho!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. Ambiance is wonderful, they have a great diversity of dishes and everything is done nicely. I am basically a pho-ologist, so that is what I will review. They definitely have one of the best broths if not the best I've tasted in the valley. Saigon Nites, Pho Thanh and Angelina's Pho and grill all are close in the broth category, but I thing this may be the cleanest richest one. The meat is also very fresh, and their meatballs are easily the best. They almost taste homemade and are tender. Usually this is where most bowls of Pho fail easily, with hard nervy meatballs. The drawbacks would be, they overcook their noodles before they put them in the broth, so they fall apart easily. This could easily be fixed. Also the bowl for the large size could be bigger (roomier), allowing the noodles more room, so they don't soften so much from the intense heat. Finally they are stingy with the herbs and you have to ask for the straight fish sauce. So that is why their pho isn't the best, but rather a tie with those other places. For different reasons. Happy pho day!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for four years now, and every time it takes care of my Vietnamese craving.  The owners are so sweet, the servers are always great.  This place gets crazy during the lunch rush, so come early or late to avoid a wait.  Lunch has great combo specials, especially the Banh Mi sandwich which is a must try.  They also have some of the best pho in the east valley.  A hidden gem for sure!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time here & it will for sure be my last. I went for dinner with my girlfriend & my mom but none of us were happy with the food or service. It took us at least 10 minutes just to get water. The server started to take the order of a table that had been seated way after us, but we spoke up about it. Even though he stopped & took our order first, the other table still received their food first. The food didn't have much flavor. I had the Chicken Pho & was extremely disappointed after waiting for so long."}
{"text":"Okay so we went again. Got an off menu item, the Atlantic salmon, and bf got the the noodles with meat and chopped up egg rolls. His dish is standard and was good but heavy on greens which is just something he doesn't prefer. 

My salmon was ok. The sauce wasn't carmelized or anything, though it was supposed to be. It's soy based (or just all soy) so it's pretty salty. The vegetables were steamed and bland bland bland. They used a tiny cup to make the rice shape. Neither of us were full, just barely a step up from being hungry. 

Now what knocked the rating down further was that they were completely out of desserts. Our service was terse and brief. Also we were told at the end of our meal that the credit card machine wasn't working and if we had cash. Now after we came in and sat down and waited for service, I thought I heard something about credit cards from the waiter to the other table but I assumed it was something else. That meant the issue already was happening before we ordered but they waited till we were done to say it was cash only??"}
{"text":"Fantastic little place! This restaurant is delicious and has a variety of different kinds of Vietnamese foods to try and some new twists on old favorites. I've been here twice now and had fantastic experiences both times.

Positives:
-Fun \"off the menu\" items that changes with the season
-Long menu with lots to choose from 
-Tasty food and (non-alcoholic) drinks 
-Good prices for a large portion.

Negatives:
-Service isn't the best

Overall, great place! Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. If you're wanting and needing healthy eats, this is your place. They're  always busy and everything is great! This is our go to for take-out. Thank you Noodles Ranch for consistently being AMAZING. Eat here today!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome....The nicest husband and wife staff...Very clean and tastefully decorated..casual and comfortable atmosphere..The food is great, my favorite is the Pho p6. along with the crispy eggrolls.  Try this place, you will love it. They go out of their way to accomodate you if you call ahead.."}
{"text":"Love this place... have been going to lunch for years. Everything is always delicious. 

Also, its family owned and operated!"}
{"text":"There are only two places in the area I go for Pho and this one of them. Between the two this is the better as the broth has more flavor and they do not skimp on the chicken. The spring/summer rolls are pretty decent. Note: sit on the right side when walking in - weird smell -  but it does not seem so bad when you are on that side."}
{"text":"Every now and then my Vietnamese side craves for PHO...are you surprised!?  Noodle Ranch is my local Pho joint.  I can literally walk to this place :)  Okay, the Pho Tai is great here....I got the combination once and it wasn't as good.  I love the decor here lots and lots of old photos of Vietnam.  Service is always good here and I've been here when their busy and when it's slow.  If you need a Pho fix I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is really amazing! We had the V6 and R1 and I'll for sure come back to try the other list in their menu"}
{"text":"I had a great time at the Noodle Ranch. It was recommended by a coworker, so we went for some pho after work. We got some spring rolls and all ordered the Pho. The bowls were huge and they brought all the toppings to add to the bowl. The inside of the restaurant was small but they use the space well. For a drink I tried their prickly pear lemonade. It was quite tasty. I get the craving for pho every now and then, and I'll be sure to be back for my next fix."}
{"text":"Great service, server was very polite and helpful with suggestions! Pho was hot and steamy and just what I needed to satisfy my cold and my liquid diet requirements! Decor very traditional, elegant and clean! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back and eat here again! This little gem is hidden away in an Albertson's plaza with an unassuming \"Vietnamese Food\" sign on top. 

The service here is minimal, a sign of a true asian restaurant in my book. However, they've done a great job decorating with red umbrellas on the ceiling and photos of Vietnam on the walls. 

The food is fresh. Its not that greasy/sweet americanized flavor. 
I had the Pho Tai which had a surprising kick to it, and I tried some of my dad's chow fun noodles which were amazing. 

Prices are really cheap too!"}
{"text":"We were greeted when we walked in. It's nice nice to be acknowledged. The first thing I noticed was the cleanliness off the restaurant. We had service at our table promptly. The food was served hot and quick. It had a nice presentation on the plate with garnishes. It made it look very appealing. The portions were just the right size for lunch. I enjoyed the flavor of my curry. We will return."}
{"text":"I'm not timely posting my reviews and it's been awhile since we've been back. Nonetheless, my husband and I love this place. No matter what we order, we consider the portions perfect and enjoy our meals whether its soup, salad or rice dish. I just wish they were open on Sundays."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful for a nice, affordable, sit down restaurant. My go to dish is the pho w extra noodles and veggies, but when I'm not in the mood for soup and noodles, the menu offers curry, stir fry dishes and many other Vietnamese dishes which are excellent as well. Its a family run business, and you can tell. Their attention to customer service and quality makes me come back time and time again. They do serve wine and beer, but i always go for their jasmine tea. It can get kinda busy around dinner time, but I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed lunch, dinner, and take-out from Noodles Ranch, so I finally feel ready to write my review...

The service is always attentive and Alan (who has been my waiter every time) is more than willing to make recommendations for me.  I've had the following dishes and highly recommend any and all of them:

A2 - Goi Cuon Thit Tom - Spring rolls - the kind that are not fried - I get them with shrimp / no pork and they are delicious and light!

A5 - Banh Xeo - Crispy Happy Pancake - unique flavor - tastes like an egg crepe... great if you are seeking something different!


M4 - Yakisoba mi xao - a tasty yakisoba noodle dish with veggies and your choice of meat

T2 - Bombay Veggies - Wok stir-fried tofu and veggies with curry coconut sauce

B3 - Stir-fried mixed veggies - just a side order but perfect to fill your veggie minimum for the day!

R4 - Thit xao rau xanh - another veggie and rice dish

Basically, you cannot go wrong at Noodles Ranch... I can't wait to get back there soon to try the Pho - it looks pho-nominal!

This is another go-to place in the new hood; just make a mental note - they are closed on Mondays!"}
{"text":"I think this is my favorite pho place in the nearby area. The broth seems like it's made fresh, the meat and veggies are definitely pure and fresh. They provide decent service and I'm always satisfied when I come to eat here. I love the coconut water, it actually has the meat included in the juice! Definitely my favorite"}
{"text":"This is not the best pho in the Valley. I hate to write a poor review of a business but don't get your hopes up if you're a pho enthusiast."}
{"text":"The food was okay. I'd go back just because it's on the few vietnamese joints close by where i'm staying.

*edit*
I went there the next day, and instead of packing up my leftovers to go like I asked, the waitress threw it away. Knowing this had happened already, the waitress still kept the extra rice I ordered to go (to eat with my leftovers) in the check. I was definitely irritated that they didn't at least offer to replace what they threw away or at least just taken out the extra rice I ordered immediately. I don't know if I'd come back again."}
{"text":"We love Noodles Ranch!  It is our \"go to\" place when we don't feel like cooking.  The food is always delicious and the owners are very friendly.  Lunchtime can get pretty busy, so go early if you don't want to wait for a table during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"I \"Go For The Pho.\" Opted for the \"Sirloin and Brisket Pho\" as it was recommended in the many reviews I read. Very nice broth, not as robust as I might like but nice flavor with lots of noodles, sirloin and brisket. Will go back eventually to try the \"Seafood Pho\" as it looked terrific on someone else's table. Bowls of Pho were priced at $7.50

Spring Rolls were excellent, translucent but much too much (6 of them) for one person."}
{"text":"I love this place because of these reasons!!! 

1. The decor was soo awesome if the beautiful paintings and creative carved wood table!! 

2. The fried rice was sweet and super duper delicious!!! Also the spring roll( non-fried ) was really amazing!! There was a fried rice noodle dish that was my personal of all the BEST in all the dishes!!!

3. The service was great!! The server was absolutely nice."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious!!! Service was great and food was awesome. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pho in Scottsdale. In my opinion, the flavorful complexity of their broth gives them a slight edge over their local competitors Pho Cao and Pho King Kitchen. Also their iced green tea is nice."}
{"text":"PHOnomenal! Best pho in the valley! Their chili sauce cannot be beat and they really don't skimp on the veggies in the veggie pho. The atmosphere is great- they NEVER play stupid music, it's clean, energetic and really makes you feel good. I PHOfucking love this place!"}
{"text":"Came down with a cold today and in the past I've always had luck with spicy Thai noodle soup helping me feel better. Unfortunately I haven't fallen in love with with a Thai place in Scottsdale yet, so I decided to give Noodle Ranch a go instead- and I'm so glad I did. The hot and spicy noodle soup was the PERFECT remedy to my congestion and soar throat (even if only temporarily). It was delicious and a large portion with just enough spice. I can't wait to return and try their pho and other menu options."}
{"text":"The name of this place is a little odd to me but I came here anyway for dinner with my daughter.  

I enjoyed the delicious food and the quick service. Loved the summer rolls and the saigon bun. Didn't try the pho yet because it's just too hot for soup right now.  Everything looked and tasted freshly made with lots of salad greens accompanying both our appetizers and entree. The service was quick and very polite. I'd love to come here again. 

The atmosphere was low-key and although the restaurant was full, it wasn't noisy at all. The kitchen is open so you hear all the pots and pans rattling around and the kitchen staff will get loud sometimes but overall it was a comfortable place to eat, almost like eating at home."}
{"text":"It was good. A little too pricy for what you received, and I don't know if it was that day or every day, but they were quite busy and I the food arrived way late 30min plus.  I ordered the vermecelli and eggroll. 

The decor inside was beautiful.

Service, almost non existant. You had to hunt them down."}
{"text":"Noodle's Ranch I have been going to for 7 or so years now and is the very best Vietnamese place that isn't too far from where I live. The people that work there have been there for years, their food is priced well, huge portions and everything is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"$7 chicken Pho is a good price in Scottsdale!  The Pho was delicious and I am a bit of a Pho snob as I eat it every week.  They even added Bok Choy to my chicken pho for 75 cents more and it was excellent.  Good service and atmosphere.  Family run business....mom and dad at the counter and looks like a daughter waiting tables.  Very friendly...definitely going back here next week!"}
{"text":"We went to this place twice now and won't go back again.  The Pho is bland, but the pot stickers are great.  We tried four different meals altogether, and the descriptions of the specials weren't quite what we ended up receiving.   Also, the portions are small for the price, especially compared to traditional Vietnamese restaurants.  I gave it two stars because it isn't dirty and the food isn't horrible, but I also don't have any great reason to go back."}
{"text":"I had the T4 vegetarian Phó with shrimp. It was fantastic!! The only complaint is $3 to add the shrimp and I only got 2. Flavor was the best I've ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered their pho and creme brûlée and need some room for improvement. The pho was pretty good enough. Creme brûlée needs more sweetness because I have a strong pallet. The staff was awesome and friendly. Overall, it is a well recommended pho place if you are close to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"good Vietnamese restaurant....not my favorite type, but wife and daughter love Pho."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was very flavorful. The sampler appetizers were spot on. Soup was fantastic! We'll be back"}
{"text":"We were in the area because we wanted to eat at a nearby restaurant for lunch, but there was a long line that we didn't want to wait in so we decided to come here. We were seated right away and were given menus but it took about 10 minutes or so for the gentlemen there to take our order. 

The restaurant is nicely decorated compared to the Vietnamese restaurants I've frequented in Central Phoenix and the vibe seems more relaxed where the employees are nice. The prices are a little on the higher side - not higher based on the average plate price for lunch (around $10), but higher compared to most Vietnamese restaurants. 

There were lunch specials highlighted on the menu, but I decided to order off of the regular menu and got the seafood pho which included scallops, shrimp and mussels. Hubby ordered Vietnamese coffee and the Vietnamese sandwich. I enjoyed the pho and hubby enjoyed the sandwich, but the coffee was really strong and it wasn't as sweet as I would like. 

Overall, I think it was good, but not sure I would venture out this way specifically for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"There is always a first - and this was my first experience with Americanized Vietnamese food.  It didn't taste awful, it just wasn't very authentic.  We ordered a bun dish, a tilapia dish and a bowl of pho.  I may possibly go back for the pho, but that would be about it."}
{"text":"We Love Noodles Ranch! 

I first came to this restaurant six years ago for the Pho. I was single at the time, I am now married and a mother of two and this restaurant is a family favorite. My daughter's favorite item is the crispy veggie pot stickers, while I can never resist a big bowl of Pho, my husband orders the t5, (chicken, tofu and asparagus rice plate). Their chicken teriyaki is the best I've ever had and don't forget to order the pork summer rolls! The food is always fresh, not too oily, packed with delicious veggies and fresh flavors."}
{"text":"An authentic Vietnamese restaurant that serves pho, vermicelli noodle salad bowls, and rice plates. I have tried pho, rice plates, and egg rolls so far. Loved all of them.

Some specific comments on the pho -- The soup base delicious. However, the noodles came in a big lump and eventually broke apart into short sections when I tried to separate them. Most likely the restaurant precooked the noddle to accommodate busy lunch crowd.

Good price range, clean, and comfortable seating. Overall, a great lunch place with friends and colleagues.

Note: Restaurant is not open on Sundays"}
{"text":"The food is not good. It is pricey for just beef pho. The broth is sweet and when we pay....it added 18% tips for a family of 5.   It is kind of ridiculous."}
{"text":"Excellent way to end a round of disc golf by having a yummy meal!

I had the bun bo xao - wok stir-fried beef, lemon grass, onions and peanuts with cucumber, lettuce, bean sprouts, mint and dipping sauce. Delicious! I wish the beef was a little more tender and I wish there was just a bit more mint, otherwise it would be 5 stars.

My son had the beef chow fun described as \"fresh wide rice noodles, veggies, and black bean sauce.\" He kept ranting and raving how good it was. \"Definitely going to bring the wife here!\" (He lives in Phoenix metro, I don't.)

Nice interior, good service. Will be back myself. I want to try their pho, their fusion ginger limeade, and their homemade desserts."}
{"text":"Have been going to Noodles ranch for years - essentially since they opened. I do take out a majority of the time. Andre (the owner) is extremely friendly and always remembers me/us when we return, even if it has been months. This is truly my favorite Pho Tai have have eaten. Have tried many many places. Mostly in the San Diego area. Their garlic pork vermicelli is also a favorite of mine. Service is excellent but sometimes they get slammed with all tables full. They really do their best with just a couple servers. Don't miss their pho!"}
{"text":"I've only had the pho here, but it's the best. Service is quick. The parking lot is a mess but worth it for the pho! Totally a hidden gem!!!"}
{"text":"I am glad that Noodles Ranch is my very first review.  I absolutely LOVE their Pho Soups.  A five star ratting is exactly what this restaurant deserves.  Very unassuming location, humble service and owners, but extraordinary Pho.  There was one week that I ate lunch at Pho EVERY day.  It is just that good and I can never seem to get enough.  I highly recommend Pho for the food, service, and atmosphere.  Comfort food at its finest."}
{"text":"The owner of this restaurant is not honest.

I have been to Vietnam a couple of times.  I have mostly enjoyed the trip, but always had to be careful for the locals providing the wrong change, trying to over charge for the food, and cut corners.  I thought this would be different since I am in America.  I was wrong!

I paid for extra broth and noodles which was $1.50; however, they didn't provide extra noodles or broth.  I saw the order already waiting when I ordered extra food; I thought they would add something to the cup or add an extra cup, but they didn't.  When I got home I was surprised to see how little food there was.  My wife had to add extra ingredients to try to make it filling.  

Also I paid $2.00 cash for the extra broth and noodles that cost $1.50 and when I checked the change it was a quarter and a nickel not 2 quarters.  When I called to explain the owner just said \"oh bye-bye\" and hung up the phone.  That is somebody that doesn't care about customers.  How can he run a business?

I can only recommend this restaurant if it doesn't bother you to support people that are dishonest cheaters and cut corners in life.



**As Yelp doesn't let me leave a public review on the owners comment I am also posting a response to his comment here:

I didn't go there earlier this year and leave a $1 tip and say I was pleased as the owner posted in the comment review.  I just moved to Arizona about 1 month ago.  

One more time the owner lied and is continuing to act in a dishonest manner.  

When time comes only god will be the judge.  If you continue to act dishonestly and not respect customers, you can't stay in business any more."}
{"text":"4 of us came for dinner, p6 noodle bowl,  fried rice w/chicken, lemongrass chicken, chicken wok...all were delicious, fresh ingredients, good prices, clean and friendly. We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was flavorless, service was non existent and overpriced...they also have very limited vegetarian choices.  I will not return.  The server basically dropped my food off at my table and never returned until it was time to bring the check.  Surprised they are still in business."}
{"text":"Pho-nomenal!!! I come here every Monday with my roommate- it's such a feel good meal. Get the Chicken Pho or Beef Pho (P2) and Spring rolls and you are golden.  Service is quick and friendly and prices are awesome!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of amazing noodles and fun fusion dishes, so when a friend of mine told me about this place being his favorite joint and invited me to go, I jumped on it like white on rice. Noodles Ranch is located in the Bashas complex on Thomas and Scottsdale Rd. next to LoLo's! Twofer! I am so glad I can come to one place to get my foodie on hardcore. 

Upon walking up, nothing much to see, there are basic booths and tables with a casual Eastern theme going on. We sat in a booth and the owner said hello upon recognizing my friend from his innumerable visits there. I looked at the menu and gawked at the prices that are easy on the wallet... I then asked my buddy what he recommends. I like everything Vietnamese, so it's a tough call for me to choose. I was in the mood for a veggie dish of some sort. He said the Goi Ga was fantastic-- a cool, zesty chicken salad: shredded white meat with cabbage, carrot, mint, chopped peanut and chili lime dressing. I couldn't even look at anything else. Done. Ordered. My buddy ordered the Bun Thet Nuong: Grilled garlic pork and vermicelli along with veggies. They both arrived quickly. I could eat this salad every day. There is nothing wrong with it, it is c'est magnifique! Perfect combination of peanut and light citrus with fresh greens and plenty of chicken. The Bun was juicy and tender and rich in flavor. I wish I could order five dishes at one time here, but that seemed excessive.  

I am excited to continue coming here for the prices, flavors and service! I hope it continues to flourish!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my Pho.. Great people very friendly. My very picky boyfriend also enjoyed his meal."}
{"text":"Excellent noodles...love the pho...would give it a 5 but I've had better and some similar in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food I've ever had! Everything is incredibly fresh and tastes as such. Traveled here from Seattle and sought this place out. The vermicelli noodles are the thing to get. The coconut curry or the beef with peanut are rockstars. Definitely need to try to macha green tea creme brûlée to finish and amazing meal."}
{"text":"Now I'm not an expert on Vietnamese cuisine but I do consider myself a fan (frequented several Vietnamese restaruants across the US) and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food at Noodles Ranch.  Maybe it's because the location is not prime (strip mall with a Taco Del Mar next door) but for some reason I didn't have high hopes.  The wait staff is a bit quiet/reserved but I prefer to not be bothered by a waiter asking me 50 times if things are ok.  I have ordered the Mango Chicken and the Curry chicken as well as the sampler appetizer.  I'm not proud to admit this but each time I go I practically inhale the entire meal before I realize it.  I also tried their Fusion Ginger Limeade which was very refreshing."}
{"text":"Got takeout here last night for my sick boyfriend & I and I was really happy with it! We both got Pho Ga (chicken) & it was perfect! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Nice people and good food, but I had a bit problem finding this place even though with my gps. The first thing that I see was the sign of Vietnamese restaurant but I didn't see the name of \"noodles ranch\" because it was a small sign.

I had vermicelli noodles with chicken and it was good but wasn't wow!

Overall was good quick place to eat."}
{"text":"This place was packed when I went here last night! Based on the reviews I've read and the crowdedness of the place, I was very excited upon being seated. I'm sad to say I was let down though.

We started off with the shrimp springrolls - but our server completely forgot to put in the order, so our appetizers came out with our main meal. Strike 1. We were starving too, so a little bothered. The springrolls were just OK. The rice paper was a bit dry, but I did love the peanut sauce. That was fabulous! I got the Happy Pancake as my meal and still, not impressed. The pork was a little rubbery and the meal overall was fairly bland. The dipping sauce almost seemed pointless. I started using the leftover peanut sauce to make it more tasty. Meh. Staff was friendly and apologetic, but it wasn't enough to overcome the boring food.

I think I am just in love with Pho Avina's in Glendale. It has tainted all Vietnamese restaurants for me. That place is bomb. Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"The pho and spring rolls were great! The staff was very accommodating. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pho I've had. Their egg rolls are also incredible. If your looking for a place to eat pho stop and just come here. Seriously!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go the other day. I ordered pho to go for my husband with the lean sirloin and brisket. The broth was ok, but I wouldn't say it's anything to get excited about. I also ordered spring rolls and egg rolls. They were were ok. I felt like they were lacking in flavor and the sauces didn't really make much of a difference. Also ordered papaya salad, it was nothing like what I'm used to eating back home and I've pretty much given up trying to find good papaya salad in AZ. I got teriyaki chicken with rice for my son. It was pretty basic, my son didn't rave over it like he usually does. The service I did receive at the counter was pretty good though and they did pay attention to detail. I requested they put the peanut sauce in separately since my son is allergic. They put it in a small bag for me. I can't say much for the waiters since no one greeted me or even approached us when we entered."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Always good food and service. I love their seafood curry with rice noodles and the spring rolls. The fried rice is also delicious."}
{"text":"Mediocre pho. Over priced. It is Scottsdale but there is cheaper and so much better pho places in the valley. All I had was the pho and the spring rolls. Ok at best."}
{"text":"Very decent place for some Vietnamese fare! I've probably been here around 5-6 times now and everytime (regardless of day or time), it's busy.

I always get the Spring rolls, Egg rolls and the Seafood Pho - yes, I know this isn't very adventurous, but I'm happy w/these items. Alwlays friendly service in a relaxed environment.

Wish they would be a little more generous with the condiments - or maybe I'm just a freak who likes a lot of sprouts, cilantro, lime juice/jalapenos in their Pho? Mmmm...

All in all - def worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant I have visited so far.  Great atmosphere, awesome cuisine at great prices too.  Highly recommend to anyone who appreciates Great food."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food for Scottsdale. Scottsdale is not particularly known for having great Asian cuisine options. This place is great for lunch. Sometimes the service can be slow but the owners and staff are very friendly so it makes up for it. 

I eat a lot so if you are a hearty eater I recommend ordering the big bowl of pho with extra noodles for a buck or two more."}
{"text":"I've said it before and I'll say it again, this is an EXCELLENT restaurant. The food is clean, fresh and delicious and the owner's are very friendly and gracious. My favorites are the spring rolls and Pho (P2). Yummmm!!!"}
{"text":"I guess I just don't give stripmall restaurants enough credit.  Noodles Ranch is fantastic.  I love Pho, and theirs is great.  The owner/chef even has his own cookbook available there for sale (that's a good sign!).
The spring rolls are also delish, and the mango salad is worth a try if you're looking for something refreshing."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with this place! The price was good, but the service was poor to say the least. The pho seemed like the noodles had been sitting in the bowl just waiting for someone to finally order it. They skimp on the phone toppings also. I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"incredible pho.  great food.  not the best atmosphere, but food is reasonably priced and exceptional"}
{"text":"I have been here several times for lunch, and this was my first time for dinner. Same menu, so that makes it easy.  Lots of choices. I have a shellfish allergy, and they are very accommodating.  We had the veggie spring rolls with peanut sauce. Yum. 

Love the noodle dishes. I had their Chow Mein with chicken. The noodles were perfect!  A little Sriracha makes it perfect.  A big portion, and hubby finished the last third for me. 

My husband had the brisket Pho, and he also enjoyed it but thought there was a seasoning that made it hard for him to eat the entire bowl - but he couldn't place it - maybe cinnamon?  But that way I have enough for lunch tomorrow.  Yum. 

We tried the banana coconut bread pudding for dessert. It was just okay flavorful but a bit mushy.  

Service was great. The place was clean. However they need to pay a lot more attention to ensure the menus are spotless. 

It was my hubby's first visit and we will be back!"}
{"text":"The Pho is pretty tasty and so are the spring rolls. I have to say that everything was pretty good for a pho place in scottsdale. The prices are a lot higher than I am used to at almost double what I normally spend on Pho but I guess its just Scottsdale for ya. 

I would go here on days where I don't have time on my breaks to make it over to my usual spot. Just have to save up for the week to do so though. Or maybe if someone else pays lol. I fly you buy?"}
{"text":"\"Good for Newbies / Whiteboys...Average to the Viets / Foodies\"

Noodles Ranch by name alone, should be a good indicator that they are aiming to attract the culturally timid. All joking aside, I highly doubt that a Vietnamese restaurant with a typical name like; Pho Thanh, Pho 54, Da Vang, Bin Minh, etc. would attract as many newbies or uncultured Americans, which are in great abundance in this metropolis.

With that being said, this is a good place to send your mother, or someone who does not yet have a mind that is developed enough to venture to a place that caters specifically to its originating culture.

I will not give this place a bad rating, as they do a great job, and make people feel welcome. They play their business model very well, and I am happy to see some Viets venture down this road and survive as long as they have in this town. They will bring you a fork and spoon as a standard protocol to keep you from feeling intimidated by chopsticks.

As for the food, again, they tame things down a little bit to cater to a simplified American palette. The prices are a little higher compared to most hole in the wall Pho restaurants, but you have to consider the location and the clientele. 

I wouldn't go here and expect to have the best bowl of Pho in town, but would go without a high expectation now that I understand their business model and targeted demographic.

Just as we might hit a lower end hamburger joint, like \"Five Guys\", we are fully aware of the fact that this is not an authentic hamburger, it's a modified and tamed down version to cater to a greater mass of people.

Go support these guys, and don't give them a bad review if you aren't happy with their food. This is a training ground for the simple minded and unadventurous."}
{"text":"the food was delicious but service was reallllly slow.  they were quite busy during lunch and it appeared they only had 2 servers and 2 back waiters staffed.  our server recognized and apologized for the slow service which was nice but gladly the food was good & I would recommend their pho!
the pho broth was extremely delicious and the banh mi sandwich had a sweet sauce that was different but yummy!"}
{"text":"I kinda like ths place, My issue is that there is a variability in product. I go one week and the chicken in the Pho Ga is dry and chewy, next time, it is velvety perfection. One month I order the spicy vermicelli soup and its just perfect,  then I order the SAME soup again and the ingredients are different, including something I won't eat. I have had, with success, spring rolls, dumplings, salad rolls, and the bread pudding (which was good twice, eh once). I am like Pavlov's dogs, though, I got the good stuff once and I will keep coming back in the hopes it will be there again, becasue GENERALLY this place rocks."}
{"text":"Noodles ranch always delivers.  The best Pho and all the dishes I've tried are delicious and healthy.  Have to try the green beans, coconut water, and thai iced tea.  Spring Rolls are amazing.  Definitely have to try."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant that I've found since moving to Arizona.  We get to order lunch every Tuesday at the office and I have turned my coworkers onto this place and we order from here regularly now!  My favorite is the pork and egg roll b?n!  So yummy and highly recommended!  Their lo mein looks good too!  My coworker got it last time and really liked it.  I will definitely be trying it!"}
{"text":"Very solid Vietnamese food at Scottsdale prices.  Service and ambiance are usually great.  Better Vietnamese \"street food\" available in Mesa, Chandler, and Tempe."}
{"text":"First time eating here. It was fantastic and our server was very kind and considerate of my 81 yr old mother. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here so many times, and it gets better and better every time. My favorites are the Spicy Pork Vietnamese Summer Roll, the Grilled Pork Banh Mi (Vietnamese sandwich), and the Pho Ga Va Rau Xanh (P6). Everything I've had tasted super fresh and flavorful. The entree portions are a perfect size for me (with room for dessert, obviously) and the service is extremely friendly, as it is family owned. The desserts are all home made and you won't be disappointed with any choice you make. I got the chocolate lava cake, and just thinking about it makes my mouth water. The atmosphere was great and I would recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch to try this place out with Jessica F.  The restaurant is conveniently located very close to my office.  Yes,  I'll admit I was a little apprehensive of their strip mall location; one would think after living in AZ for a while I would know that strip mall restaurants can be good.  This is some of the best Vietnamese I have tried in Arizona! We ordered the spring rolls, which were made with shrimp, pork and just a touch of fresh mint.  I also ordered the Chow fun which was a very hearty portion of wide rice noodles stir fried with chicken and vegetables in a light sauce.  The service was very quick and attentive as well, our server was very nice and suggested my dish.  I will definitely go back to Noodles Ranch again!"}
{"text":"Loved the broth for the pho and the egg rolls were really good as well! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Solid Vietnamese option in south Scottsdale. Specializing in Pho and offering 10 varieties, including vegetarian broth. Has a few other Vietnamese and Chinese noodle and rice dishes, and occasionally offers banh mi but it's not on the standard everyday menu. Inviting space and good service. Only reason I can't give five stars is the pho can get a little pricy if you customize...want more meat? 3 bucks. Want three tiny shrimp? $4. I feel like the prices are a bit high when you take into account the sit down service that you're already spending 15-25% more on. Still that doesn't stop me from coming in. Good place, check it out."}
{"text":"I go here quite a bit for Pho Tai and Bun Bo Hue. Both are good. Not the best I've had, but certainly not bad at all. The Bun Bo Hue is full of different types of meat, and I love it.

Every time, though, the wait to get your food is incredibly long:/ I hope it's because they make-to-order!"}
{"text":"We went here after a day of exploring the area.  We were hoping for good pho an were absolutely happy with this place.  The teenage boys in our party ordered pho with extra noodles with broth but they had huge appetites.  I found the large to be very filling.  The broth was rich but not overly so, strong meat flavor.  The brisket and beef in my pho were tasty and well prepared.  
The spring rolls were delicious as well
I would go again should we come into this area in the future.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Scottsdale used to bill itself decades ago as Western Town USA, or Cowboy Town USA or something like that, to convey a clean, wholesome, western spirit to itself, and bring in tourists to see it's, well, Western-ness. 

Not surprisingly, Scottsdale was built, grew, and expanded on old ranch lands, and the names of them are still in the buildings and developments off Scottsdale Road. 

McCormick Ranch....
Gainey Ranch.....
Noodles Ranch......

Wait a minute Noodles Ranch?
Huh? 
Have you lost your Noodle?

No, actually, I found it!
At Noodles Ranch, off Scottsdale Road! 

This Vietnamese restaurant has been here for 6 years, not long after I left the Valley of the Sun in 2004 back to California. If it was here back when i was, I would have been a regular! 

Unlike the divey Viet diners of San Jose or Westminster, where decor is dominated by plain tables and standard issue stackable red chairs, and service is by a grumpy old Viet dude who doesn't speak English or smile, Noodles Ranch is perfect for Snotsdale, er Scottsdale.

It has a very pleasant decor of painted walls, tasteful artistic symbols of Vietnam artwork, large red, hanging upside down paper umbrellas,  4 cooling ceiling fans, a decorated cashier counter in front of the kitchen, and better quality table and chairs than their Little Saigon counterparts. 

Scottsdale prefers looks  over substance, so it likes nice decor in favor of good food, as exampled by the many large, formula restaurants with million dollar decors but mediocre food. And remember, PF Chang's, that popular faux Chinese chain, the epitome of Decor upstaging Taste, was started right here in the Valley  of the Sun. 

So seeing the tasteful decor, and seeing all the non-Vietnamese in the restaurant, kept my expectations very low on the food taste-o-meter. 

But I was pleasantly surprised! 

Now I lost count, but this is close to the 100th different Vietnamese restaurant i have eaten in all over the country in the past 4 years! 
(see my Wanugee! lists for Pho and Vietnamese for details.)
So I have tasted good and bad and everything in between. And granted, I was starving from not eating all day, and here it is 7:00pm. 

But when I ordered Cha Gio (egg rolls), the 6 little crispy rolls came out beautifully plated on a large, quality made and decorative platter, and unlike most orders for this in those dives, which usually come out on a plain little white saucer plate by themselves, here, they were accompanied by several large leaves of romaine lettuce, pickled and julienned slices of cucumber and carrots, sprouts, basil leaves, cilantro and of course Nuoc Mam (fish sauce) to dip them. 

Now most of the customers in here at the time would have dipped the rolls into the sauce, and probably poured the leftover sauce over the veggies, mixed them, and eaten them like a salad. If this were PF Changs, that is what they probably would suggest. 

But I took the leafy lettuce, put an egg roll on top of it, and sampled the veggie ingredients on top of that, rolled up the lettuce, and dipped all of that fresh tasty goodness into the Nuoc Mam. This is much like how you might eat many other Vietnamese dishes in a Vietnamese restaurant, be it Nem Nuong, Banh Xeo, or even parts of Bo Bay Mon. 

So I was impressed and happy with the refreshing mix of fresh veggies, crispy rolls and tasty fish sauce exploding into my mouth! Loved it!

So I figured that was for show, however, to impress the Low Fan (outsiders) with a $5.95 fancy appetizer, with Scottsdale pizzazz. 

Mais, au contraire mon frere! 

The Pho Tai Nam ($7.50) I ordered was very good! I always try the broth first, and this broth had a very rich, complex flavor! Perhaps a little sweet for the Low Fan, but very beefy, savory, and not too mucked up with masking ingredients to distract from the true flavor. The meat pieces were whole and higher quality than most I have had, with good tenderness. I had to ask for the separate condiment dish, where I mix the half Hoisin and half Sriracha, to dip my meat into, so as not to destroy the flavor of the broth. 

I was smiling after this meal! I even called up my Viet friend in San Jose, who could tell I was smiling over the phone, which they usually only notice after I have had good, authentic Japanese sushi or tasty and cheap KBBQ!

I would recommend this place highly! It is a little more expensive than those $5.50 bowl dives on the coast, but the decor and quality of food, and the service from the owner, all combine to make a quality experience. 

They offer all the usual Viet diner foods, like Goi Du Du, Goi Cuon, Mi, Com, Bun, Bun Bo Hue, etc. They also offer two of my faves I will have to try another time, Banh Xeo (crispy pancake) and Canh Chua (sweet-sour lemongrass soup).  

So this is perfect for Scottsdale, with the nice decor, but with the added bonus of tasty, quality food! They even play smooth jazz, something you would find in another Scottsdale staple - the SPA!"}
{"text":"Great Customer service... Food tasted fresh and delish.... My only dislike is the water...."}
{"text":"It was a cold night and since it was my choice of dining out, I selected this restaurant 'cause we both love Vietnamese food. We started with the spring rolls with shrimp and pork. It took them a while to bring it out. Don't know if they had just made them or what. It hit the spot. 
We followed that with Pho...wife  had P2 - Pho Tai, lean sirloing and I had P8 Pho Hai San, seafood which had couple of shrimp, mussels, calamari and scallops. The PHO hit the spot and wife took home the rest of her PHO for her lunch the next day.
If this restaurant wasn't so far away, I would frequent it more often."}
{"text":"Noodles Ranch is a nice little place that most people in the valley complain doesn't exist.  But if you look, you'll find out there's plenty of them.

My girlfriend and I ordered take out from here last Friday night. Ordering from Noodles Ranch is great. The menu (which is easy to find online) has a simple letter and number code. I know this may sound uncultured, but since I cannot pronounce the names of most Vietnamese foods, I like this. 

We had the A7-Grilled Salmon Salad Rolls. Fantastic. The Tamarind dipping sauce was a little too hot for my girlfriend, but perfect for me. 
We also ordered the M2-Pho lon xao / Chow Fun (with chicken) and M1-Mi xao / Chow Mein (with chicken). Both meals were good, very similar, just differently prepared noodles. 

I do feel a little guilty about only three stars. The food is really good, not priced too bad, but it's not all that filling. Even after finishing a starter and our meals, I still had a craving for something more (guess we should've ordered a dessert). The wait for the food was also pretty long. We were told on the phone that it take about a half hour. We arrived a little less than 30 minutes later, and still waited in the restaurant for a good 10 minutes. The staff was very accommodating, and let us sit at a table while waiting, and apologized many times for the wait. I really want to try this place again, maybe the dine-in experience will up it to four stars."}
{"text":"It was good but not the greatest Vietnamese restaurant I've been to. But they were busy so lots of other people seem to like it."}
{"text":"Not pleased. Bad service, generic noodles and broth, and steep prices for pho. I waited to be seated at 2p on a Monday, then waited to order, and waited for a water refill despite empty tables throughout. I also asked for fried tofu but received steamed. Pass."}
{"text":"Great selection of gluten free and vegetarian dishes. I got the curry and thai tea and it was really good."}
{"text":"This could possibly be the WORST Vietnamese place I've ever been. Just ate there, slow service, stinky fish sauce(I know, it's fish sauce but I know GOOD fish sauce when I see it, smell it. My wife is Vietnamese) The people next to me were starring at the waiter trying to get his attention so they could order. Painful experience.

Vermicelli noodles dish was very small. What do I want for $10.00.

I asked for some mint and they brought me something that was CLEARLY not mint and I told them \"this is not mint\" and a few min's later another man came over and told me that it was in the mint family. OK, uhm no. A Vietnamese place that doesn't know what mint looks like.............Oh my.

Also check out the pic of the sign telling customers that to-go container are 35 cents. Cheapskates!

:(
Never again! Head to Chandler for some REAL Vietnamese food.


Hmm, they wouldn't allow me to upload the pic of the to-go warning sign*****"}
{"text":"Listen.. I'm not going to do the jitterbug around this... Noodles Ranch is the Bees Knees. I order the pho, and let me tell you it was PHOTASTIC!! We enjoyed the Spring rolls and the wine was super. We will most definitely be back! Thank you \"Pho\" (from) the bottom of my heart!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best pho in Phoenix. I get the chicken & broccoli and it's amazing, it will also cure any sick feeling."}
{"text":"I love this place. Very clean, nice music and ambiance. The noodles are delicious. My fav is the veggie spring rolls, sirloin pho and Thai iced tea! There desserts are delicious too. They do carry out also"}
{"text":"So I finally made into Noodles Ranch for dinner last nite with my wife. I have eaten the Ban Mi (vietnamese sandwich) here in the afternoon a couple of times and it is tasty enough and I was craving Pho and didn't want to drive across town to Maxim. 

We started with the veggie spring rolls. They were tasty and very clean with a nice minty flavor. Very decent portion. We both got the Pho tai (sirloin) which was good but not great. First time I've ever eaten Pho where there is more meat in proportion to noodles. The broth is decent but not great, the noodles are the same. Overall a very decent Pho spot that I would come back to since it's around the corner from my house. 

Biggest issue is that after the apps, the two bowls of pho, and two ginger limeades (very tasty), and tip I was 40 bucks lighter. Way too much money for Pho, and the service wasn't impeccable either..."}
{"text":"My first time at a Pho restaurant and I will defiantly be back I had the Chicken bowl with noodles and spiced it up.  Great flavor perfect for a cold night or your fighting a cold.  Very clean restaurant with nice decor.  The owner came by to see how our lunch was. We loved it.  Cost around $10 per person.  Kinda of pricey but you are getting very fresh ingredients with high quality."}
{"text":"We dine here every time we're in Scottsdale. This year, we ate here twice in our first 3 days because the owners were going on their annual vacation and we didn't want to miss out on their fabulous food.
The food is incredible--vegetable rolls, pho, lemon grass chicken, etc., etc. The service is great. And the wife-husband owners are extremely friendly, accommodating, and professional.
This continues to be one of our very favorite restaurants anywhere!"}
{"text":"So many things that are yummy here! I'm a huge fan of their chicken pho. I've sampled other items on their menu like the delicious ginger drink (totally forget the name but it's so worth drinking). Their noodle dishes are flavorful and filling. But trust me, the Pho is amazing. It's a huge order as well for the money. You can easily share it with another person. The decor isn't anything fancy but the staff is super sweet and have offered me so many different tastes to try. Never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Don't really know what all the great reviews were for, ...the dishes we ordered were very bland. The noodles and sauce were just ok, the chicken on all of our dishes was rubbery. None of the 3 of us finished our dishes, ...we went at lunch time and the service was slow and the waitress had \"attitude\". \"So sorry to have asked for a knife to cut my rubbery chicken!\" Also she never bothered to ask us if any of the dishes were ok, then we would have had the opportunity to be truthful and tell her that they were not good. You would think when she handed us the check she would have noticed that the plates were full??? Well I'm sorry to have to give a bad review, but people should know before they spend their money there. Maybe their dinner items are better then the lunch items we ordered. There are so many really great Vietnamese, Thai and Asian restaurants in the Valley to choose from, this one won't be on our list."}
{"text":"I used to go here for lunch with coworkers every once in a while when I worked in Scottsdale. I recently visited for the first time in years and it seems like the food and service has gone downhill. I am not sure if they changed their pho recipe but it was not as good as I remembered."}
{"text":"Came here due to this place being practically the only place to serve Pho in Scottsdale. I know exactly how Pho should look and taste but the Pho was just okay, it was slightly cool when i got it and they don't offer very many vegetables to put in it. There broth really had no taste to it which was disappointing. The restaurant itself was freezing cold. My boyfriend got the coconut curry dish which tasted wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great Pho & the Spring Rolls are bombness. The Shrimp potato tempera wraps are very good also. It does get busy but what do u expect with a place as good as this."}
{"text":"A coworker recommended that I try this place if I was ever in the area.  With a name like Noodles Ranch, I was subconsciously expecting a restaurant the size of about a half-acre.  So, I was pretty surprised at the strip-mall location and relatively small size of the place.  The place was clean, and I was greeted warmly and seated quickly.  I ordered my go-to Chicken Pho, and it was on the table in no time.  I thought it was ok.  I usually jazz-up the Pho with lime, hoisin sauce, cock sauce, and all the other standard accompaniments, but I found myself using a lot more of those items at this place than any other Pho place I've visited.  I even asked for extra limes to get more flavor out of the meal.  That's why I thought the meal was just ok. Too much work on my part to get the taste going, which told me the broth just needed way too much help.  It's all personal preference though.  The service was really good and the staff was very friendly. I know I would never go out of my way to visit here again, as there are other options closer to home that I prefer, but I always appreciate good service and this place had enough of it to possibly make me stop by sometime in the future if I'm in the area and have the craving for Pho."}
{"text":"A friend/co-worker had been trying to talk me into going to Noodle Ranch for months.  Especially since I had gotten pregnant and had experienced a few weeks worth of morning (all day long) sickness.  Well this past Friday, she finally twisted my arm enough into going.  

I've had Pho at a lot of different restaurants.  I've had Pho so much so, that I got burnt out on it a few years back.  Hence, my reason for not really wanting to check this place out.  You've had one Pho, you've had'em all.  

We both ordered the Pho ga ca rau xanh (Pho chicken, broccoli, and baby bok-choy)

The noodles were about par for pho noodles.  The broth was as standard as any pho broth.  There was hardly any broccoli and baby bok.  You're paying .75 extra for broccoli and bok, so I expect to see quite a bit in my pho.  Also, they only brought out 1 small plate (about the side of a bread plate) for the two of us to split of the bean sprouts, lime, chili pepper, and thai basil.    You'd think if both of us are ordering pho, we'd BOTH get a plate.  I will say though, the bowl was huge.  After having a few spoonfuls of the broth and bites of noodles, I ended up just eating the broccoli, bok, and most of the chicken.

We split an order of the spicy pork vietnamese springrolls.   Now, those were awesome!  The rolls were nice and stuffed.  The dipping sauce that they come with, spicy and slightly sweet.  Throw some chili paste on them and they're perfect!  If I had known that the pho would have been such a disappointment to me, I would have ordered the springrolls as my entree.  

Will I return?  I think so.  But just to get an order of the spicy pork springrolls.  :)"}
{"text":"ok, several veggie options, sauces seem to be premade/jarred rather than fresh. check the \"specials\" board for items not on the menu, though they never change."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, Noodles Ranch does the best, and highest quality, pho in Phoenix. 

The staff is great, the atmosphere is clean and welcoming and the food is cooked to perfection every time."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the first time. After reading some reviews I decided to try the spring rolls and the chow fun and was not the least disappointed! The spring rolls were good, the peanut sauce was great and the chow fun was delicious!"}
{"text":"After moving to Scottsdale, I immediately had to find a vietnamese restaurant nearby. Luckily, Noodles Ranch was a few blocks from my place and didn't disappoint. Despite having higher prices than I'm used to for vietnamese food, I will fork it out if the food is worth it. So far I've had the summer rolls, the spring rolls, banh xeo and the bun cha ha noi, and they've all been pretty tasty. The owner is also really nice and went out of his way to recommend some vietnamese markets in the Phoenix area. Can I find cheaper and perhaps better tasting vietnamese food further out in Phoenix? Possibly, but for the convenience, the quality of the food and the service, I'll be back at Noodles Ranch."}
{"text":"Pho was good not the best I had.. owner or manager rude to busser in front of our table"}
{"text":"The lunch special, banh mi sandwich set was delicious and the meatball pho was incredible. Great portion sizes and price balance."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! I really enjoyed the soup I got. I also enjoyed their fresh ginseng lemonade at the convenient price of 3.99 with no refills. I had asked the lady for tea instead, thinking at least I'll get refills. When the lady came back with my drink she brought the ginger lemonade instead.. I thought to myself,\"sweet, maybe she brought this for me to try(if I ran a business I would definitely bring a sample or at least hook it up with a refill of tea when I was finished with the lemonade) so I carried on through my meal. When it was time for a refill (closely to when I was about to finish up and head out) I asked the lady for a to-go cup of tea, thinking that would be fine since I originally had asked for ice tea in the first place. The lady tried charging me for another drink and tried telling me I ordered the lemonade and not the tea and that I will have to purchase another drink if I want the ice tea.. I said are you kidding me? Seriously? And she insisted. So I paid for my meal without the ice tea to go and put all of my change in my pocket. Then I left and told the ladies to have a great day. 
This was my experience here. Too bad cuz the food was great, yet I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Sorry reviewed a different restaurant and wasn't paying attention. Was reviewing Saigon Nites."}
{"text":"Solid, delicious pho. If I lived closer, I'd probably eat here a LOT, but it's a little outside of my area so I might not make it back for awhile. Wasn't able to familiarize myself with the menu overmuch, but they seemed to present a solid menu of offerings. I'd like to be able to write more about it, but all I can say is that I had a great experience with a solid bowl and Vietnamese coffee. Service was prompt and attentive... so there ya go!"}
{"text":"Been coming in here for years...good selection of dishes. I particularly like the various vermicelli noodle dishes (Bun dishes), also the Lemongrass Chicken and Curry Chicken dishes.   The banh mi sandwiches on the lunch menu are tasty and filling.   Good Vietnamese iced coffee."}
{"text":"The food is great! I highly recommend the Pho Chicken Noodle soup. Served piping hot, loads of fresh veggies noodles, meat is tasty. It is around $8 but trust me it is worth it. I am a big guy and I walk out full."}
{"text":"Apologies for the lengthy review. There was a bit of epiphany amid description

OK. I tried this place twice.
1st visit.
Was with my co-workers. Omar, Jesse & his wife Ann. Omar loves this place. However, he had pho for the 1st time 2 yrs ago. Which was take out- off the 101 & Princess Dr.. To me, that's not a proper intro to pho. Jesse, he's a bit of an epicurean like myself. He ate it, while encouraging us to please try his \"go-to-(pho)-spot\". His wife Ann, was just too dang-on sweet to say anything bad about her experience (she saved that for the car ride home). 

We started w/ the greasiest (Cha gio) Crispy Eggrolls i have ever had (...and i LIKE greasy food!). There's not enough lettuce or mint. The cucumbers were Julienne & the Nuoc Mam (fish sauce) was underwhelming. Funny, now that i think about it, It feels like they give the rind of the romaine lettuce. Because there was no leaf to wrap around the roll. If you know cha gio- They're thin. It's not like a fat NY Chinese food egg roll. 

**I got it! I bet the reason the romaine is so narrow is because they use the leaf for the fresh spring rolls**

Nonetheless,
I couldn't quite put my finger on it but something about the pho i just didn't care for. The company was nice. So, the dining experience was pleasant. 

2nd visit.
My sister flew in from our home town of San Francisco. She was hungry for some pho & we were near (no other than) Noodles Ranch. I told her where i was taking her. Name alone, gave no indication it was Vietnamese. We sat for lunch. The staff (as before) was kind, attentive & accommodating. She ordered the shrimp pho & I, the classic beef. 

As we were adding the veg & herbs to our bowl- she noticed something small & rubbery floating. She took it out and asked the waiter. He said, \"I'm not sure. Maybe a tendon?\" ... A waitress came by and said, \"It's crispy onions\". Now, think about it? The broth is lava hot. Steam fit for a facial. Crispy? 

I added my usual amount of Hoisin & Sriracha. Spun my broth & dug into the sweetest broth I HAVE EVER HAD. I tried adding more sriracha, mint, jalapeno, nothing helped. I asked my sister was hers sweet too? She said, \"Yes, it is\" I dipped my spoon into her bowl & it was sweet! 

Boy-o-boy,
I'm now under the conclusion the Hoisin sauce (in those mystery clear bottles) isn't name brand. It's a knock off substituting as a form of sweetener & lacks that punch of flavor. One that only 'Hoisin' gives."}
{"text":"I'm biased about Noodles Ranch as I write this review.  A regular Vietnamese restaurant goer my partner and I found this place on Yelp! From day one it became a favorite.  Andre the owner is wonderful and always a smile for his customers. Maybe we visit too often but I'll wear out my welcome. 

The Bun Saigon which I'm having now is a wonderful mix of menu items. Practically, a pupu platter of main dishes. My favorite is the bun no hue which is a spicy noodle soup.  I've had many different versions of the dishes in different cities and the consistency and flavors here are second to none. Light and fresh meals that feel like real comfort foods. 

I feel like chef Andre's French cooking training comes through in the flavors. They are not the usual flavors. It's definitely a mix of styles that makes this stand out from the rest. It doesn't go so far that you don't recognize the original foods. The style is very subtle and  original.

Highly recommend trying it if you're new to Vietnamese cooking and feeling adventurous , or if you're a fan that's been looking for a great place to eat. Soft and mellow, or hot and spicy... you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've heard that their tamarind soup is phenomenal but I wanted to be adventurous and get something different and you know what, this was one of the times I wish I hadn't.  I had the V6 (one of the vermicelli salad noodle bowls with an eggroll and garlic pork) cause somebody had uploaded a picture of it on Yelp and it looked so delicious.  Or maybe I just thought it looked delicious cause I was starving, so that's what I got.  It was bland.  And I was disappointed.  I don't really have much else to say about this place cause I was just so upset at how bland my food was.  If I ever go back, I will try their tamarind soup, but I'm sorry, nothing else."}
{"text":"Bad sore throat and cold requires soup and this hit the spot. It's good to know that there are Vietnamese restaurants in greater Phoenix and this one is pretty authentic. The seating area is relatively small and there's limited atmosphere which goes along with a storefront in a strip mall. A starter of pork summer rolls rounded out a quick dinner. Although the soup was good and filled with white meat chicken and plenty of noodles, the broth could have been a bit richer.  All in all, if you have a craving for this type of food, it's a decent choice."}
{"text":"I wanna live in this place that's how much I love it.  Best pho I've had...hands down.  If you've never tried Pho and you want to...then look no further, you've found the best pho in the Valley!  
P2 and P3 are my favorite and their egg rolls are so fresh.  Please make sure you ask the server how to eat them...there's a trick and they'll show you!
I love this place...I really do.  I eat here as often as possible.  I've been to 4 other pho places around the valley and none of them can even compare to Noodles Ranch.  Just wish you were open on Sundays. :("}
{"text":"I had the lunch special and fusion ginger limeade.  The chicken stir fry was pretty good and the vegetables weren't overcooked like most places, but the limeade seemed a bit watered down.

The prices are awesome and service is great.  Next time I'll get the pho like other yelpers are recommending."}
{"text":"Let me start this off with: I'm a huge Pho fan! That being said, the Pho here was good. I have also ordered a combo plate (which I can't remember the name) that was absolutely delicious. I also highly recommend the mango- raspberry creme brule."}
{"text":"I judge every Pho restaurant by their Pho Tai.

Atmosphere was okay, nothing to write home about. Got seated at a booth and was immediately greeted not by the server--but by the SMELL OF DIRTY MOP. Disgusting. Whatever. Let's order some Pho.

Took a long time to get served, but I can forgive that during dinner rush hours. The broth was pretty good actually, and the vegetable toppings were very fresh. Had a beer, girlfriend had a ginger limeade (she dug it--they use freshly squeezed lime juice--this is a must have here).

We didn't order appetizers so we could save room for dessert. Ordered the Banana Bread Pudding and it was very hot. Too hot, actually. Verdict? Microwaved. 100% definitely microwaved.

If you can drive a bit, go to Saigon Pho in Chandler (http://www.yelp.com/biz/saigon-pho-chandler). No alcohol there, but much better quality Pho."}
{"text":"I have been going here for almost 5 years and while I realize people have bad days, I seriously question the reviews of some of these reviewers!  I have never in these years of going 2-3 times a month have I ever had bad service or been treated rude!  The food is always great and service friendly and fast."}
{"text":"PHO PHO PHO 
Love Love Love
This little family owned Noodle Ranch is so good. We love the P5 extra chicken"}
{"text":"Yummy Vietnamese food in Scottsdale.

Fresh ingredients, friendly and fast service, good menu selection. Really enjoyed the vermicelli bowl. 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"Why is the broth so sweet and the meat tough? This is nooot the traditional Pho. :( I was let down."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly with my work lunch pals.  One of them is Vietnamese, so we eat here twice as often as we would otherwise.  So I've tried just about every lunch entrée.  The pho is a good choice if you are sick, you are not starving, or you count calories.  I usually order one of the pork items when not relying on the pho.  Our Vietnamese friend orders in a language with limited phonemes and the rest of us order by the easy to use Menu ID system.  We've tried several Vietnamese places in the city and this is the best we've found.  It gets a little busy at lunch, so come early or be prepared for a little wait."}
{"text":"Wonderful and very good Vietnamese restaurant tucked away in shopping center.  In nearly 8 years of frequenting Noodles Ranch for either lunch or dinner the food and service have always been consistently very good.  The owner and his wife are always happy to make a menu item vegetarian for me and always remember to ask if fish sauce will be okay if a dish happens to have it.  Some of my favorite items are vegetarian spring rolls, Vegetarian Pho, Lemongrass tofu Bun (not on the menu but will make it on request), Arizona fried rice and Green papaya salad.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Been here three or four times and doubt i'll go back. The restaurant itself is nice, more upscale than your regular pho joint. Service was better too, but oh the pho...it lets me down every time. There seems to be something added to the broth itself that tastes different, but good. But the meat and noodles just aren't right. Egg rolls and spring rolls aren't worth getting in my opinion, really some of the worst I've had. Like others have said the crème brulee is good tho"}
{"text":"Their beef Pho has an excellent, hardy broth with just the right amount of saltiness. Fresh green onions and basil make it pop right before it gets to you.

Their chili oil is crazy spicy and really delicious!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The owners are so kind and they know our orders before we sit down. Everything is fresh and I swear by the pho when fighting a cold. I love the P7 with tofu and the spring rolls are lovely.  We eat here at least three times a month and love to support a small local business."}
{"text":"Yet another restaurant that makes me wish there was a two and a half star category.... there really needs to be an \"adequate\" rating that lies between two star \"I've had better\" and three star \"A-OK.\"  

We had pho and banh xeo.  The pho was adequate but not outstanding.  The banh xeo was mediocre at best and quite expensive for what you're actually getting.

Not a lot to say about it really.  Fine if you're in the neighborhood and craving a bowl of pho and don't feel like driving to Chandler for better food."}
{"text":"Best vietnamese ever. Outstanding service. Owners even remember their regular customers names."}
{"text":"Located in a small strip mall anchored by a grocery store and a blockbuster, and sandwiched between a water&ice and a beauty supply store and a dry cleaner... this little restaurant is a fresh surprise. If someone blindfolded you and took you here, you wouldn't know you were in a strip mall. The decor is slightly hodge-podge, but a lot nicer than you would expect.

I've been here about half a dozen times and have yet to be disappointed. While it's not my favorite Pho, this place is quite good. They are very accommodating and will pretty much make the dishes however you like. The service is really good - but if it's busy, you may have to exercise a little patience.

I love the egg rolls and the spring rolls were tasty as well. Other Pho places I've been call the fried ones Spring rolls and the non-fried ones Summer rolls, but this place calls the non-fried ones spring rolls. Whatever, just get their sampler platter and enjoy...

There's not much to complain about - it's close, it's clean, good service, and the food is good. I can't explain why I have only been there a handful of times since I've lived about two blocks away from this location since forever. This place doesn't quite make the 5 star mark because I've had slightly better Vietnamese food and because it's located in a spot that should be a Mailboxes Etc. This place deserves a spot among finer dining in downtown Scottsdale... instead it's next to a Subway.

Don't let that stop you - this place is great."}
{"text":"This is my go to when I'm wanting pho & warm comfort food.  Especially good on a cold fall day or when you have a sore throat and can feel a cold coming on.
The broth in the pho is incredibly good and the ingredients are fresh.  Considering it's made to order the food comes out quick. This place is full for a weekday lunch at 11:30.  Service is quick and friendly.  Restaurant is clean and quaint."}
{"text":"Anytime one of my friends says the name \"Noodles Ranch,\" I laugh.  I don't know why really.  Something about the name just makes me laugh. 

Anyways, the food here is great.  And cheap! 

Here are my recommendations in no particular order:
the vegetable egg rolls
veggie spring rolls
crispy happy pancake- it makes you happy, I swear
tofu chow mein or pad thai
vietnam basket (this is really big, for like $7 and comes with a bunch of different vegetarian items, such as tofu, broccoli, noodles etc. etc).
and for dessert: you must get the warm banana bread pudding.  it's sooooooo good. 

Simply put, this restaurant has fantastic food at cheap prices.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with pho a few years back, and can't get enough of it. Noodles Ranch was my first experience, so I've made an effort to branch out to other pho places around town and even while traveling to find comparable or better options. I can't find anywhere else that comes close.

Their broth is so perfectly seasoned and simmered...I don't know what they do, but they are doing it right. I've always found their ingredients to be fresh, the food to be warm, and the service to be good. 

This place is a hole-in-the-wall, somewhat randomly dropped into a Scottsdale strip mall, so don't expect a high-end dining experience. That said, the service has always been fast and friendly, and I've never left unsatisfied from my meal. I also frequently carry out. They package the broth, noodles and veggies/chicken, and their toppings all separately, so the rice noodles stay in tact and nothing gets soggy before you get home. Add some sriracha and go to town on a big bowl of their pho. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Pho with sirlion and brisket for the wife and I, which was very good.  Good texture to the noodles, the broth was flavorful without being too salty.  It came with a plate of fresh bean sprouts, basil, cilantro and hot peppers (as it should.)

Our kids shared some un-fried spring rolls which were pretty good and a ban mi which was very good (though a little too spicy for them).

$34 before tip for two adults and two 3 year olds, seems a little on the expensive side.  We didn't even order drinks.

The staff was courteous and the food came pretty quickly.  A decent option overall, will come again when we have a pho craving."}
{"text":"My go to place for pho!! The servers are the nicest people and very accommodating. They have a large menu that has other options besides pho. The size of the bowl is perfect: enough to fill you up but not large enough to give you a stomach ache afterwards. I have been coming here for months and I love it!"}
{"text":"The appetizer selection is quite good and ever entree I've had has been flavorful, fresh, and enjoyable. The shrimp & sweet potato tempura is one of the best I've ever had and the noodle dishes and the spicy beef salad is excellent. This restaurant has been a favorite of my family's for quite a while and the only thing keeping them from being a 5-star rating is the occasionally quiet atmosphere and the slightly higher cost for some of their entrees. The service and quality of the food remain top notch."}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered this place right after we moved to the neighborhood.  We were waiting for our refrigerator to be delivered so we were getting the less than picky stage.  

It's actually pretty good.  Their air conditioner seems to be broken every time we go in...that's my only complaint.  

My favorite dish is the beef bun bao (not sure on the spelling).  It comes in a big bowl with rice noodles, tasty beef, and lettuce.  I find their food to be pretty healthy actually.  It's really well priced too.  

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've never dined in, however this is my go to take out vietnamese place. I've tried their Pho, spring rolls and vermicelli noodle/salad bowls. Everything here is pretty good. Yes it's a bit pricier than what I'm used to paying in Tempe or Downtown Saint Paul (MN) BUT REMEMBER, you are in Scottsdale. 

The place is pretty typical when it comes to decor for a Vietnamese restaurant, I like that they have a few extra chairs by the hallway to the bathroom to wait for your take out. 

The pho is pretty good, I usually get the combination pho - the ration of sirlon, to tripe and tendon is a little off but nothing to throw a hissy fit about. The noodles as I read in a different review do indeed come in a big lump, but then again I am ordering take out so it's been sitting there for a little before I add to broth - pretty simple solution for me is to throw it in the microwave for 30 seconds. No biggie."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here yesterday and we were pleasantly surprised! The food was very fresh and delicious. Portions and prices are decent. We will probably eat here again."}
{"text":"I love the Beef Pho and would have loved the spring rolls too if not for the overpowering mint taste - my friend had no trouble fixing this problem for me btw. I will be back once it's under 100° again - because seriously, soup in the summer just sucks."}
{"text":"Excellent Pho!   Really good deep tasting broth and all the fixing were delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite place!!!  Very friendly staff, clean restaurant.  The seafood pho and spring rolls are my favorite dishes.  I've had many others and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pho in the state, the flavor is on point. I will drive 25 minutes just to enjoy their soup. Everyone is complaining about price but it is well worth the extra dollars. You get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty average Viet restaurant. I would probably only go again if it were convenient. There wasn't anything wrong with the food but it also didn't leave a lasting impression either. 

Let's go over the goods first. Friendly and fast service, clean restaurant, and good menu options. My biggest critique is that the pho did not have great flavor. The portion was pretty generous but it doesn't really matter if it's not that enjoyable. Prices are also a little high so the value isn't really there either. 

Overall, I would suggest to pass on this place unless you absolutely do not want to drive a few miles for better Viet options."}
{"text":"I cannot honestly recommend this place.... at least not for pho. Being one of my own people, I want them to be successful. But when I feel a restaurant is trying to skim or take short cuts and still charge customers more than other restaurants, it's not fair. Today, I came in for pho...for the last time. The beef was chewy. The broth of the pho should take on the sweetness of the bones. The broth was too brown... maybe too much fish sauce. All I could taste were the artificial flavors. They still do not give enough mint. I did not enjoy the pho at all but did finish because I do not believe in wasting food, especially vietnamese soup."}
{"text":"It's convenient and the food is OK. I had a visitor from Vietnam who really liked it, but he may have been just being nice. Not nearly the best but passable and quick."}
{"text":"My family comes here for Pho every Friday evening. Everything is delicious, they make the chicken egg rolls just how I like 'em. I like how it doesn't get crowded so the atmosphere as well as the food is comforting. I recommend the prickly pear tea, it's refreshing during the warm seasons. If you need something satisfying and good for you, try the pho here."}
{"text":"The best pho in Scottsdale. The owner is great and very welcoming. This was my first time her and I will be back. The lemonade was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Time for an update to my original review!

Since trying this place a few months ago, I have been back SEVERAL times (I am on my second Loyal Customer Card).  I seriously must get take out from here at least once a week.  The Chicken Pho is still scrumptious and delightful and I crave it quite often.  The staff is so friendly too!  Noodles Ranch is a gem in the desert so stop by and try them soon."}
{"text":"WORST VIETNAMESE FOOD EVER!!!! I am having one of those moments when I wish that Yelp had a way of giving 0 stars. 

My girlfriend (who is Vietnamese btw) and I went here for a late dinner a couple of weeks ago, and we were starving.  We started off by ordering drinks and I got my usual Thai Tea; it was completely watered down.  We split the spring rolls and the peanut sauce wasn't great, but that's the norm for most pho places in Arizona.  I got the Pho tai bo vien and something was just off about it.  I've had my fair share of pho, and this was not pho broth.  It was so bad that any amount of adding hoisin sauce or sriracha were not going to fix it.  I had to pay $11 for this...My girlfriend ordered the V1 Bun Saigon - Tom Nuong, thit nuong va cha gio.  She said that the fish sauce was just fish sauce, and that you normally would have something with it to add flavor.  One would think that since the owners are Vietnamese that they would actually know what Vietnamese food would taste like.  

Contrary to other reviews, the service that we had was pretty good that night, after the 10 minutes of waiting to even be acknowledged.  That was the one redeeming quality of the restaurant.  The prices were way too high for the terrible quality of the food.  I do not know how in the world they were able to be considered 4 stars.  We may have been better off staying hungry that night."}
{"text":"If you like Pho, this is the place for you. It's the best I've found in the Phoenix area to date. Their other dishes are all excellent. Great egg rolls as well as Pad Thai. Now for the bad news. This place is fairly small and there is often a wait. Coming here in the middle of lunch or dinner can be problematic. So, get here early or late. Or be patient, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Fair price for the lunch special. Food was \"ok\". Think of a Chinese version of a Vietnamese restaurant. The lunch special included a Thai dish and miso soup. If you're looking for \"authentic\" Vietnamese, this isn't it. Service was good. Parking here was a nightmare."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food. This is my go to pho spot. Not as good as the place with the un-rememberable name on Apache and McClintock, but great for Scottsdale. I'd ask for extra noodles with the pho bowls though. Thanks for the cleanliness and the topped off Sriracha bottles!"}
{"text":"Went on yelp to find a Pho place near my home. I found this one and decided to try it out judging by the reviews and rating. Let me tell you that I loved the place. Very clean, fresh, and quiet. I was greeted right away and my order was out in a reasonable amount of time. I would return there again. It is a little pricey compared to other PHo places but it was delicious."}
{"text":"I was a little shocked to find out that the food is way better than what people reported.  I'm Korean and I love PHO.  The broth was very clean and refreshing -- not too heavy on the beef stock (in a good way).

I ordered the PHO w/ Fried Egg Rolls.  The friend egg rolls were excellent!  Very crispy and hearty fillings!  Would recommend getting this...how could you not?"}
{"text":"The food here was great. I've walked by this place a dozen times while going to LoLo's Chicken & Waffles at least a dozen times with the kids but never stopped in. My wife and I finally got a chance to go and loved this place. Pho was great, spring rolls were very light and fresh, the peanut sauce for the spring rolls was tasty and the ginger lemonade was very refreshing. The staff was very friendly and would have given 5 stars if our server wasn't so forgetful. He forgot about our drinks and garnishings for the pho twice. The first time I flagged him down for these, then after waiting about 5 min, I walked to the back kitchen area to find him. At least he was apologetic and very nice, so no big deal and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"A solid Vietnamese place that's close to home - what more could I ask for? I can't say I'm a total expert on pho or Vietnamese cuisine, but I've always really loved what I've ordered here.

I find myself ordering the Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong (v6) most often -- the garlic pork is yummy and the spring rolls are nice and crispy. I crave it all the time.

I haven't had their pho in a few years actually, but my friends all say it's yummy.

Interior is nice, service could be a little better, but all in all I love Noodles Ranch."}
{"text":"PHONTASTIC!
Best PHO in Scottsdale.. Hands down. I've come here a few times with my dad for lunch and we are absolutely obsessed! I love the family style customer service and the food and pho are so fresh. The owner remembers us every time we stop in (about once a week) and always makes sure we are happy with our order. Of course we are happy when our tummy is filled with yummy Vietnamese goodness! 
This place gets packed for lunch but once you try it you will always come back."}
{"text":"Since I moved to NY I have not missed a single thing from AZ except this place! The owners are wonderful people, the staff is always kind and friendly and the food is amazing. Veggie potstickers and the M2 (Chow Fun Noodles) with Fried Tofu. Will dream of those two items for ever. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Coming from bay area, i think this place has good noodle, small portion, and is a little bit pricey, even compared to palo alto price. overall wasn't impressed and will probably not come back again."}
{"text":"We got some tasty take out from Noodles Ranch. The decor of the restaurant is cute and interesting and while we waited for our food I entertained myself with one of their free magazines. The staff is friendly and happy to give recomendations. 
We started out with the pot stickers and they were some of the best I have ever had. The sauce was tangy yet not over powering. Next I had a seafood curry. I have to admit that I haven't had that many currys solo I'm not sure I was into the flavors. I'm sure that it was prepared well but I just am not sure I'm a curry person. 
Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"My dad and I went here yesterday for lunch at my brother's recommendation, and I must say, it was just ok. First of all, I don't think I ever would have found this place without the Yelper who said it was next to Lolo's (thank you Yelper friend!). The restaurant itself isn't remarkable, just standard booths. The food was fairly mediocre. I had the pho ga... it was severely lacking in flavor. I needed to use extra jalapenos and sriracha to get it to taste like anything. My dad had the chow mein, and it was actually much better than the pho... odd since this is a Vietnamese place. Anyway, I wouldn't rush back here."}
{"text":"So good! Best Phô hands down. The atmosphere is very soothing and calm. Everything is fresh, prices are a little high, but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Pho broth was too sweet.  Possibly from too much MSG."}
{"text":"Food was alright, nothing special. I had pho- didn't like it, couldn't eat it. My Gf had shrimp inna curry sauce along with vigies, that was great and delicious. Service was alright. Place was clean."}
{"text":"I walk in alone for lunch and wait at the front to be seated. Waiters walk past me making no eye contact, so I go to the cash register in the back of the restaurant and ask if I need to order first before being seated. The manager says to me that I should wait to be seated as the sign in the front says. He has a menu in his hand and I assume that he is going to seat me. Although the restaurant in 3/4 empty, he tells me to go back up front by the sign and he will seat me. I go back to the front and read the sign which says, \"Thank you for coming.\" He eventually comes to seat me and I point out the sign, which he then replaces with the one, \"Please wait to be seated.\" Normally, I would walk out due to the arrogance of the manager, but I am hungry, tired, and have little time, so I take the seat where I am directed, order. I should have walked out when the waiters ignored me. The chicken cashew lunch special tasted like last week's leftovers. The thinly sliced chicken was so tough that I could barely chew it and the vegetables were frozen mush. We have a lot of choices in Scottsdale to enjoy Vietnamese food; this would be my last choice, and someplace I'll never go into again."}
{"text":"Yummy food in general. They lost 1 star because during the day they wipe down the place with what smells like bleach and water and it ruins the lunch experience to be sitting in that smell. 
Overall their pho is good though. The fresh spring roll appetizer is big enough for a few people and a fresh healthy option as well. Great location & there's never a wait time."}
{"text":"Let me just put it out there that I'm devoted to Da Vang, but I really liked Noodles Ranch! I love the spring rolls here, they're very fresh and loaded with mint - just the way I like them! I think I prefer the Bun at Da Vang though, since the rice noodles are skinnier (I'm just weird about the width of my noodles though) and their dipping sauce is a little different. The beef at Noodle Ranch was really tasty, well marinated, the portions were really hearty.

The restaurant is small and really well decorated and the staff was fantastic and really attentive. I'll be back again to check out the Pho sometime!"}
{"text":"I LOVE NOODLES RANCH! Noodles is my go to place for a nice hot yummy bowl of pho. I don't frequently go in the summer, but did happen to go a few weeks ago and nothing has changed. It's the exact same, delicious food as it always has been! 
The prices aren't bad and the service, although laid back and sometimes slow, is always accommodating and tries to get to you as quickly as possible. I've even had several occasions when I've been on a tight schedule during lunch break and we'll call while we're driving over (6 minute drive) and they'll have our table and food ready for us when we arrive!!!! Talk about stellar service! Love love love them!"}
{"text":"I had the steak brisket noodle bowl.  Service was quick. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese stop! 
We lived very close to this restaurant so it was a no brainer with all the great reviews. They did not disappoint. My husband had their chicken pho about once a week for five months straight (until we moved) and he STILL talks about how much he misses this place. 

We take out of towers, and first time vietnamese-tryers here and they have all loved it. 

Their pho is out of this world, as well as their sample platter, and basically everything on their menu. You can't go wrong here. 

They also do to-go orders, so if you can't come in and sit but are craving vietnamese, don't hesitate to call!"}
{"text":"I love Noodles Ranch! I was skeptical at first, because the name is so campy and silly! hahahaha. Any way... I only get take out, because I am not a huge fan of the sit down service. It seems like they only ever have one server working, and it kind of takes forever. But the food is delish, so take out it is!"}
{"text":"I ate here Dec 1 with 7 other people in a weekly Thursday Lunch MeetUp, different restaurant every Thursday.  I ordered one of my favorite Asian dishes, beef chow fun.  I was disappointed the quantity was so small and price expensive $9.95.  Not that much beef, compared to other restaurants that charge less.  But in all fairness, other restaurants where I am so happy with the chow fun (e.g., $7.65 for 2 x the portion of Noodles Ranch, at Best Hong Kong Dining in Mesa) and big bowls of pho for $5.25 - $5.99, are not in Scottsdale, they are in Mesa or Westside Phoenix.  My favorite Vietnamese restaurant is Da Vang on 19th Ave, south of Camelback.  I love \"value\", in my food....meaning large portions for low cost, $5.25 for big bowl of pho.    

Another Yelper said $11 for a bowl of the combo pho is the most expensive they ever saw.  And others noted the small portions.  I agree.  I would never pay $11 for a bowl of pho, which wasn't even that big of a bowl at Noodles Ranch.

The other people sitting at my table were not so enthralled with their food either, the lady sitting across from me said she \"is not coming back\", her grilled chicken on baguette, was \"terrible\".  Another two people didn't like it either.  

I was not that impressed with the service either.  They did not take note who ordered what, and so brought the dishes to our table \"who ordered this\", \"who ordered that\", trying to find a \"taker\" to set the plate in front of.  But we were not sure what our orders looked like to claim it, and some ordered the same thing as others, so food service was not efficient.  It took a long time to for the orders to find their way to the person who ordered it.  I remember one person at our table said they were afraid they were eating someone else's order.  After taking our beverage orders, when they brought the drinks, they did not take note who ordered what, caused more commotion and conversation interruption in all of us at the table trying to find who ordered what, to claim it. I felt the confusion of trying to find who ordered each dish or drink that was brought to the table, was an unnecessary distraction to the camaraderie of a social lunch gathering.  I feel knowing who ordered what entree and drink is the restaurant's responsibility, not the customers.  

My chow fun was dry and too salty.  It tasted like it was flavored with soy sauce, only.  

The pot sticker looked baked or toasted and dry.  

My 2 stars are for small portions, expensive prices, not so good taste,and service with no foresight (can't be bothered to take note who ordered what), compared to other restaurants that do not have those issues.  Also we were sitting there for about 15 min, and no menus.  I actually went up to the counter to \"get them\".   Wouldn't eat here, again, even for free. If the servers were rude, I would have made it one star.  The servers who brought the food to our table seemed to not be able to speak or understand any English and had to summon other staff who did."}
{"text":"I love good Pho, and Noodles Ranch didn't disappoint.  After a nice and relaxing foot massage at Just Relax, which is just 2 door down, my girls and I were hungry.  LoLo's had a line out the door, so we decided to try out Noodles Ranch.  I'm glad we did!  Our first impression of the restaurant is that its clean and has nice decor.  That's always a good start.  We each ordered the ginger limeade, which was so refreshing and yummy!  We had the shrimp spring rolls (minus the pork), and they were very good -- comparable with other pho joints in the Valley.  I ordered the seafood Pho, which comes with shrimp, mussels, calamari and scallops.  The broth was delicious!  There was only one scallop, which was disappointing.  The two mussels were gynormous, and not in a good way.  I love mussels, but I don't like those giant mussels, it just grosses me out.  So I ate one of them, but left the other.  All in all, it was a good experience.  I'm not in Scottsdale often, but would definitely come here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great Pho and Spring Rolls!  The place is very clean, service great and pricing is fair.   Eat here a couple times a week!"}
{"text":"I've loved this place for years, but it never crossed my mind to write a review.  The food is consistently great, the prices are reasonable, and the service is always friendly and attentive.  

I am positively hooked on the Mango Chicken, which makes it really difficult for me to try other dishes, but a couple of weeks ago I tried the Pho and Seafood and loved it.  I've really enjoyed their Curry Seafood when I've had it, and every so often I give in and have the Arizona Fried Rice with extra broccoli.  

My choice for a hot summer evening when I want something light and refreshing is the Cool and Zesty Chicken Salad.

There is something for everyone to love here.  I just miss them when they are closed on Sundays and I've got a taste for their great food!"}
{"text":"Okay. That's the best word to describe my experience here. Just Okay would be what I'd used for two words. The food? Okay. The service? Okay. The vibe? Okay. 

Granted, when I went with a lunch friend, we soon realized their A/C was out. Ouch. It was steamy inside, so we asked for our lunch orders to go. A few minutes took longer than a few minutes, but we waited patiently. The server was friendly and professional; he even apologized more than once about their busted A/C. 

I ordered off the lunch menu. $7.50 for a pot sticker, salad and main entree (the spinach salad with spicy chicken.). Most of my entree was spinach (just an observation). The chicken was very tasty and there was a few tomatoes included. 

The pot sticker was good, though a bit too greasy for my likes. 

I think if I ever came back here, I'd have to try the pho. I feel it's unfair to judge a Vietnamese Noodle restaurant without trying their noodles, especially the signature pho bowl. Next time I go, though, I hope they have A/C!"}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese.  My mom makes Pho.  That being said this pho is very well done.  Broth has great flavor, not too sweet or overly heavy on the star anise.  My bowl is P3, pho tai chin (pho with sirloin and brisket).  Yes you can find cheaper quality bowls downtown or on the east side, but we're in Scottsdale yo! Also environment is nice and it's a good place to take Vietnamese food beginners .  Get cafe suh da (iced coffee) and spring rolls with your pho bowl for maybe one of life's best meals."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best pho in the area. Convenient for me because I live very close. I love when good restaurants are in good shopping centers. After enjoying an amazing meal I was able to head to Sally's and pick up some nail polish remover ;). Anyway, Noodles Ranch is not a fancy place. It's very simple decor. Someone does seat you and the service is very good. I have been there for both pho and other dishes. The 5 star review is based on the pho/service/prices. The other dishes would be about 3.5-4 stars. Very enjoyable meal and wonderful when the weather is a little chilly."}
{"text":"The hot and spicy noodle soup is amazing! The service is really good also. I have been a few times and I've never been disappointed. Love it!"}
{"text":"Service was great, but the vermicelli and drink lacked flavor. 

The pho base seemed to be very good."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Pho!!! I've also had the rice salad from here which was equally delicious. 
Because I am gluten intolerant when ever I am sick I always crave Pho... I seriously can not count the number of times we have ordered take out from here. The service is always spot on!!!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Noodles Ranch since they opened.  At the time there weren't many Vietnamese offerings in the Phoenix Metro and the restaurants that were here were mediocre at best.  When I first visited noodles ranch, I was absolutely blown away.  Literally some of the best Vietnamese food I ever had and Vietnamese cuisine is definitely one of my favorites.  I have had Vietnamese fare in very large Vietnamese communities all throughout the US and Canada (Westminster, Chicago, New York, Vancouver, etc), and Noodles Ranch easily ranks up there at the top with these other restaurants.  The pho broth is spiced perfectly and the portion sizes are enough to fill anyone with a hearty appetite.  The bun vermicelli is by far the best in Phoenix.  The banana bread pudding is mind blowing.  
In addition to the great food, the proprietors of the restaurant, Noel and Andre are a husband/wife team originally from Saigon.  They are literally the sweetest people you could meet; to use a cliche, salt of the earth.  Andre is a trained chef and before he and his family moved to Phoenix they owned an upscale Euro-Vietnamese fusion restaurant in the Seattle area.  After moving to Phoenix Andre worked as a chef at the Phoenician but decided to venture into proprietorship again and opened a tradition Vietnamese cuisine which is the establishment this revue is about.  
I currently live in Chandler, but if I lived in Scottsdale I would dine here every week.  
I have pleaded with Andre and Noel to open a location in the East Valley.  One can dream....."}
{"text":"This place is really a gem. The food is always great and really fresh.  Awesome choices for vegetarians too."}
{"text":"YUM with a capital YUM. I was a bit surprised after reading the reviews to find this little gem in a strip mall. It's right by Lolo's, by the way. We walked in and the place smelled delish! We were seated immediately in a clean and comfortable booth. Our waiter took our order and answered all our questions. He did forget to bring our water even though we asked twice, but I forgave him that when I tasted the refreshing ginger limeade. We shared the veggie spring rolls - so fresh and minty! And we ordered three different bowls of pho. Amazingly flavored broths in the veggie and beef  bowls. I love how fresh the vegetables were and hubby loved the spice in the meatballs. My brother-in-law was a bit unhappy with the thinly sliced tendon but it wasn't on the menu initially and they made it all special for him. Thanks Noodles Ranch for putting up with my crabby brother-in-law by the way. Super tasty and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pho takeout!  The meat wasn't super rare but the fact that the onions and cilantro were already in the beef stock made it so flavorful (other place I go included that in the bag of \"stuff\")"}
{"text":"Very tasty food, clean and well decorated, friendly service, one of my top Vietnamese restaurants that I would recommend to others"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Busy but always very helpful and the food is always better than exceptional. I highly recommend this as a great alternative over Chinese food. Much healthier and delicious."}
