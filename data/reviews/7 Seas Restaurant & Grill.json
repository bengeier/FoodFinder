{"text":"This seafood restaurant is a nice addition to the neighborhood! There is not so much variety in the menu, but the food is delicious and the service is very friendly. I never tried lobster thermidor and bouillabaisse soup before and these are really delicious. We also had salmon and tuna sashimi and thai styly red snapper, both very tasty.
We liked it so much that we went twice within two weeks. The second time we were even greeted by the chef, who stepped out of the kitchen to ask how do we like the food. We told him that we love it! We used this opportunity to ask him to add crab cakes to the menu... he told us he'll think about it :)"}
{"text":"We made reservations for 6 adults over the phone and were told there is only a family-style style dinner option for the table because the owner-chef is away that day? The table behind us was a big party with at least 16 adults however all ordered a la cart. 

The cold seafood appetizers were delicious and plentiful. But that's where the positives end.

The service was extremely slow. We waited 20-30 minutes to get the next course which was a seafood platter. While the seafood platter looked fantastic, it was slathered with a thick white cream sauce that ruined the entire dish. I'm all for seafood in a white creamy sauce, but this sauce was absolutely horrible.mouth

Next was another 30 minutes of a wait for the next course. Several times we've asked the wait staff for our food and all we got were apologies. 

When we finally received the meat course it was time to leave as it was simply inedible. I took one bite of the chicken skewer and spit it right out. There was absolutely no seasoning and I'm fairy certain it went bad. Two hours later as I'm writing this review I still have that awful taste in my mouth.

Lots of room to improve here."}
{"text":"I tried this new restaurant with my dad for a weekend lunch as he was recommended this place by one of his friends. The restaurant is tucked away in the Rexall plaza. Upon entering, we were seated immediately as it wasn't busy. A few things I noticed right away were the beautiful decor, the loud-ish live music from a keyboard vocalist, the glasses on our table were wet with water droplets, and the waitress seemed to be a little frazzled. I've been to other Russian-owned restaurants, and live music seems to be a common occurrence.  

The menu had many seafood options with daily/weekly specials (can't remember how often they change). There are several Russian-style dishes, but overall I would say the menu is a culture-neutral seafood menu. There are several types of fish that I've never heard of before, so I went with the recommendation of the waitress. I also ordered the Russian fish soup and my dad and I shared the mussels in cream sauce appetizer. Bread was complimentary and was brought to our table. 

Food review: the food was delicious! I don't have anything bad to say about it. My soup was great, the mussels were fantastic, and my main dish was the winner. It was a lot of food, so I had to take half of my main dish home with me and my boyfriend raved about it as well. 

Service review: the below average service is why I gave this review a 3/5. The waitress forgot my dad's beer order and main dish, and there were only 2 other tables seated. She was apologetic, but that shouldn't happen in the restaurant industry. 

Overall impression: great food with below average service."}
{"text":"Horrendous customer service! Fish was undercooked and sent back. Then was brought to the table over cooked and inedible. The meal was returned. The waitress didn't even offer to bring something different. Bill came at the end and we were charged for a meal that was poorly prepared. The owner came out and said that the \"fish was wasted\" and that it was our problem we didn't like it. And to top it all off, he told us not to return again. This was not our first meal at this restaurant but I can assure you it was our last. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The seafood here is solid,but not anything special. The entr√©es was also kind of pricey"}
