{"text":"Still \"in training\". Waited 30 min after being told it was a 10 min wait. We left before ordering but can't wait to try them out as the menu looks good."}
{"text":"Not quite ready for prime time but the food is good.  There was a bit of a wait for our food but we were told this going in. The servers were friendly. I had the Hercules mac and cheese. It was very tasty. My companion had the Macarena and being vegetarian asked that the meat be removed. It was also delicious.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Myself and a co-worker stopped here for lunch today... More like a 10 minute wait in a hallway, then a 10 minute wait at the table before we decided to leave... never got served, looked at, or talked to.  We actually weren't even sure who worked there, no one had a uniform on, aprons, anything.  Very unprofessional.  While sitting at the table waiting for someone to take our drink order, several people coming in and out of the kitchen area just walked by us and gladly helped other customers.  We were just avoided for 20 minutes.    While walking out, I told the hostess we were disappointed because we weren't waited on and she GRUNTED at us, never apologized or had someone there wait on us.   I will NOT be returning there to eat.  Complete waste of my lunch break.   I'll go to Johnny Rockets.. A real diner with quick service and great food!"}
{"text":"While driving around looking for a place to eat outside of our normal food comfort zone we saw the Mac Diner sign and decided to give it a try. I was skeptical at first since upon entering I did not see any patrons but once we passed into the second eating area we did see other customers. We ordered the Hercules mac and cheese, the original mac and cheese, a hot dog (for the preschooler) and gyro sandwich with a side of grilled vegetables. ALL of us enjoyed our meals. I felt the gyro was a good size and flavor and the grilled vegetables were fantastic. My husband and daughter were very happy with their meals and I was pretty impressed that the hot dog was not the typical teeny tiny buck dog you get from most places.   I will agree with some of the other reviews that the meal wasn't 'quick' but they had signs addressing that it would take awhile so I knew to expect it. I would have liked a few more cups of coffee since it was good but our server wasn't as attentive as I would have liked.   All and all we will be back next time we are on that side of town. It was an overall good experience."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous diner. Every thing we have ordered has been flavorful and large portion. The owner has visited our table each time we have been there. The menu is entertaining to read. The wings are wonderful. Instead of 5 little wing pieces they give you 5 complete wings, which means that you actually get 10 wing pieces. The sauce was flavorful, but I would like a little more. I will be going to this wonderful diner often even if they never have a grand opening."}
{"text":"I am really annoyed by all the negative reviews about Mac Diner., especially by Larry O.  Does Larry read and understand English? It does not sound like he does. What does a sign mean that says please be patient with us while we have an unofficial opening and train our personnel mean? If you are not comfortable with that and do not have patience for people who are learning then you should have left.   I agree that it is annoying when people walk by and clearly see a glass empty.  I think they are just a little overwhelmed since this is all very new. Again have patience. Who's to say all the people waiting tables are long term professional wait staff? Give people a break!   It is a shame someone had a bad fish sandwich because everything my boyfriend and I had here was very good. We have tried the breakfast corned beef hash (if you are a fan of the traditional hash theirs is a little different (light on the corned beef hash and has potatoes and peppers) and at first I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, but the more I had the more I liked it), hot dog, tater tots, mac n cheese, blue cheese burger and meatloaf and mashed potatoes (I do not like traditional meatloaf, but I loved theirs. It has a really great flavor and the mashed potatoes were fantastic).  The owner also walks around to make sure people are doing ok and like what they are eating asking for opinions on the food to make things better. With as busy as she is, I think that is commendable since she is one of the chefs. She is not afraid to get her hands dirty, which I like. A good owner is a person who is willing to roll up their sleeves and make sure things get done.  The point of this diatribe is for people to try Mac Diner, have PATIENCE (which some people on here obviously do not have) while they are trying things out in their pre-opening. The food is good and they are trying to perfect things so they can get it right. Last time I checked no one is perfect the first time they do anything."}
{"text":"I feel like I've been hearing a lot about MAC Diner, so I was surprised when I walked in and the place was empty.  Though I did arrive at an odd time that was between lunch and dinner.  Even so, a few other patrons walked in shortly after me and we all sat at the counter.  The counter itself struck me as odd.  Behind the counter there is....nothing.  No grill or griddle like you'd expect at a diner.  Nevertheless, I found the place clean and welcoming.    I was at the end of a long day so I decided to place my order to go.  Deciding what to get was the difficult part.  I was in the mood for some comfort food, so the pot roast with mashed potatoes appealed to me.  I also wanted to try some mac n cheese since that is their specialty.  And since I couldn't decide on just one, I went with two: Alpine and Cheeseburger.    My Pot Roast was okay.  The potatoes were more smashed than mashed.  And while I was given a healthy side of gravy, there was no roll given with this meal.  Odd, especially when you consider that just next door is a Schwebel's Bakery outlet store.  The mac n cheese orders, both small, were $5 each.  The Alpine was a little stinky but very good with lots of Swiss cheese and ham.  And that small order was more than I could finish in one sitting.  The highlight of my choices was definitely the cheeseburger mac n cheese.  When I opened the container, it literally smelled like a Big Mac.  And even more impressive, that's exactly what it tasted like, too.  It was so amazing, I've been telling everyone who will listen.  I plan on returning to MAC Diner at least until I have tried all the different kinds of mac n cheese.  And maybe I'll get there for breakfast one day.  Plus I saw tater tots on the menu and I am a sucker for tater tots.  I can't say much for the service as I did not dine in, but there were a few servers who were very attentive and had no problem sharing duties.  To make this place even more appealing, it is one of the places featured on WPXI's Just Pay Half Hot Card where you pay $25 for the card and it is worth $50 at local businesses.  Not a bad deal for some delicious comfort food!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today, first time at MAC Diner. Corned beef hash was really good, had  a southwest flair by adding in some red pepper. Ordered the MAC Daddy breakfast, not that great. First toast was not toasted more like steamed. Then my eggs had a hair in them YUCK! And then for the finale i waited 15 minutes AFTER my breakfast came and had to remind the waitress 2x to bring my creme brulee french toast which was not worth the wait. Im still wondering where the creme brulee fit in. This soggy french toast came out in a bowl soaked in jelly and a huge mound of whipped cream. Service was so so, when asking the waitress if she felt the mac and cheese or home fries were better she really didnt know what to tell me. This gave me the impression that the mac wasnt anything amazing and it wasnt. Dont get me wrong it wasnt bad, my 2 year old daughter loved it and i finished it. When ordering it just set your expectations that its a homestyle mac and cheese and not gourmet mac and cheese. I love supporting the small places but dont see my family coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"So I will begin this review  as I do all my others, the negative first and end  with the positive. We had a reservation for 9 people this past Saturday, when we arrived we were quickly seated and drink orders taken. However, the rest was down hill.  Of the  9 of us  all  were of the same impression that we will not be  returning.  One of the guys ordered a milkshake that came so poorly made that the plate underneath it was a MESS and it looked awful. The kool-aid they offered was so week it was barely pink but supposed be be cherry flavored.  We ordered our meals and waited - and waited and waited.  In fact  we waited so long one couple left after waiting over an hour for macaroni and cheese..  but we continued to wait- even though at that point we were almost the only ones there.   Finally(1 hour 45 minutes later)  meals arrived. I  know we were ALL thinking, \" this food better be worth the wait.\" It was not:(  Our group had the following- basic mac n cheese( bland was the consensus) wings( needed more sauce)   the dom( eh was the comment), mac n franks( \" I'll eat it since I ordered it\") a dish from the Oktoberfest menu( the comment here was OMG this looks awful..( pause) it tastes pretty bad too)  a salad with a  homemade dressing that was so slimy and chunky I could not even tell what  it was, and lastly potato pancakes that we had to ask for twice and then ask for the sour cream and apple sauce that came with them.   The good: there is plenty of parking, the place is warm and appealing, the restrooms are clean and the prices are cheap.  However that does not make up for  lukewarm poor quality food served to  you  in to go containers over cork boards that takes almost 2 hours to receive. Also I should mention they are now BYOB, which is great. Not sure of the corkage fee as it  just started the evening we dined there.  I  am so sad to write this review as I love local small places like this. The concept is also so unique. If they use better quality ingredients and improve the  service  it may have a shot.  I sure hope they do make it."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and wanted to give them a chance.   I was immediately seated and greeted by a waitress.   She took our orders and drinks came out quick.    Thankfully they were good with with topping off my coffee while we were there as it took over an hour for bacon, eggs, and french toast for my wife and I.   They were not busy either as I counted less than 13 tables with patrons.  The food when it did finally come out was fantastic.   Hopefully they can get their kitchen times in order as I would probably come back if it wasn't an all morning venture to get breakfast."}
{"text":"My first time there. My wife's third. Eh. Hardly a anyone there which always seems to send up a red flag. I ordered a pick-your-own stuff in scrambled eggs. There were done fine. Ordered the hash in the eggs. Not your ordinary hash since it had peppers in it but it was good. Side on Mac n Cheese came wi it which was fine but cold. Wife's hash browns had the most bizarre taste and couldn't eat them. Waitress was wonderful. Grooves looking place."}
{"text":"I really wasn't planning on writing a review until they officially had their grand opening, but after reading Larry O's negative review I felt like I really had to.  We visited twice during their \"training\" days and there were definitely some kinks they were working through, like waitresses still learning the menu, and limited availability on certain options. But that's kind of the point of putting up the giant warning sign saying they aren't officially open yet and are still TRAINING. By our second visit, although they were still in training, these types of things had improved dramatically.  Both of my meals happened to be great. For breakfast, the corned beef hash is different from what you might expect, with a mix of peppers and other ingredients. Loved it.  For lunch, the meatloaf was moist and flavorful, and the mashed potatoes were buttery deliciousness.  The owner, Nancy, came over to meet us and talk about our experience the first time we were there and was a real pleasure to speak with. Even better, on our next visit she recognized us right away and was very welcoming. We also loved that the staff seemed equally excited and that their families were coming in to check out the place as well.  We're excited to have yet another non-chain, homegrown restaurant opening up here, especially one that offers reasonably priced home-style goodness like this one."}
