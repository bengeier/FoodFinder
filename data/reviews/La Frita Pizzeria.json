{"text":"Best eggplant ricotta hot peppers pizza in town. The cheese on that baby holds the stuff in place and the crust is crunchy. Mmm. Burgers r good too. The person on the phone was very polite. Definitely will order again."}
{"text":"Other than a pizza joint, this place advertises itself as a casse croûte - so poutine is a large part of their menu. They should maybe rethink that.

I popped in for a hot dog and poutine combo, and really regret doing it, as this place has the WORST poutine I've ever eaten in my life. And believe me, I've eaten a lot of terrible poutines. I don't like giving bad reviews, but I feel obligated when I'm served something disgusting. 

The fries tasted freezer-burnt, the cheese curds were old and smelled rotten, and the gravy was possibly the gravy you find in a can of dog food. I couldn't finish it, and I was starving. If I hadn't gotten it to-go, I would have asked for my money back.

On the positive side, the people working there were super nice and the hot dog was decent, so I'm bumping up to a 2-star review. 

It seems that people like this place's pizza, so maybe they do that well. But goddamn, please do something about your poutine."}
{"text":"Had an amazing poutine. This place has super friendly over the top service. Very highly recommended!"}
{"text":"La meilleure pizza à St-Henri! Le  dimanche-lundi-mardi , ils offrent la pizza large all dressed pour moins de 15$ ! Mon copain est un fervent adepte de leurs hotdog. Lorsque vous avez une fringale de junk, ce casse-croûte est là pour vous, c'est pas chère et je le recommande pour les gens du quartier"}
{"text":"You gotta love this pizza. It's everything a pizza lover wants. Their dough is chewy and nice in both the thin and regular version. So I take regular here and leave the thin for less satisfying places.

The toppings are original, generous and delicious. The cheese is abundant and melted right on top where you can see it and feel it.

Adding herbs and garlic is free and makes a nice change in the tatste. Especially when you've been a regular for 15 years.

Go La Frita you have one of the best P'za in town."}
{"text":"Just had their pizza again tonight, and realized that I'd forgotten how good their pie is, and that they have amazing crust."}
{"text":"When the mood for pizza strikes, I sometimes let my mood and my preferences for the perfect pie get in the way of my cravings. 

I'm not fond of frozen grocery store pizza. I never got the by-the-slice pizza craze. And while I have eaten a few amazing thin crust pizzas, something feels wrong about eating them on a patio with a beer, serving them to friends who helped you on a move, or snacking on a thin slice of pie while staring down a blank page when you are way behind deadline.

La Frita Pizzeria get its right, and meets my different moods every time. It is the Songza of pizza: pizza for entertaining cool friends, pizza for studying, pizza for unwinding, and even pizza for waking up gently. 

The crust is thick and bouncy, like memory foam, but with a hint of tasty charring. The tomato sauce they use is thick and spirited, with a hint of coquettish sweetness.

The cheese is melted over the top of your pie, perfectly fusing the ingredients therein and holding everything securely in place, ensuring each bite captures every flavor and your toppings don't topple and slide off each slice. Each slice also oozes with just enough grease, making each bite deliciously unctuous, and not unpleasantly oily or slimy. 

Their pizza is equally good in the morning, cold and slightly congealed, which is another benchmark I have for the perfect pizza. While I do prefer my pizza hot, I have been known to turn leftover slices into an impromptu early morning breakfast, and their pizza does the trick."}
{"text":"Ordered online from Tasty Boom and it was one of the most amazing poutine I ever had. Didn't have time to take a picture I was too hungry for that, because delivery took forever. Not La frita' s fault tho, but the website where I ordered from. Strongly recommended it when you don't feel like cooking and too lazy to go out. Big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"It's really hard to find affordable good pizza in montreal. ordered it for delivery expecting to be yet again disappointed but it was good! my choice when in the south west."}
{"text":"À 2 heures du matin, dans le Sud-Ouest, surtout entre St-Henri et Verdun, il n'y a pas vraiment de places encore ouvertes, mais la fin de semaine passée, on a finalement trouvé un bon endroit pour une poutine graisseuse et fromagée en fin de soirée! L'endroit comme tel n'a rien de trop spécial et on y retrouve pas mal tout ce qu'on peut espérer d'un « snack bar » à la québécoise : poutine, frite, hot-dog, hamburger et pizza. Notre « petite » poutine était pas mal grande, assez pour partager à deux, et même à -10 Celsius, elle est restée chaude jusqu'à ce qu'on arrive chez nous, environ 20 minutes de marche rapide plus tard. Le bonheur quand on a pris un gin tonic de trop juste avant!"}
