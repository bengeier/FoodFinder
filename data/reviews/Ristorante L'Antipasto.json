{"text":"One of the worst take out Italian ever! The Cesar was filled with brown goowee romain and the pasta was mediocre at best! I threw everything in the garbage! A nice  $29 wasted!"}
{"text":"Grilled lamb chops were perfect as was the risotto and mixed grilled fish. The antipasti bar has a nice selection of appetitizers.  White table clothes with good ambience and service. I will be back."}
{"text":"Ever since going to Italy my taste buds have been ruined. Italian restaurants across the city disappoint me often with over-sauced and over-cheesed pasta. Even tiramisu has left me wishing I'd stayed in Florence... BUT, I am happy to say L'Antipasto Ristorante has restored my faith and brought happiness to my taste buds.   The antipasto bar was full if goodies including marinated seafood and a delicious caprese salad.   Then we had the pasta in rabbit sauce. This was a risk recommended by our server who convinced us to make an adventure of the evening. I was slightly apprehensive, however, any doubts faded upon first bite. The sauce was smooth and not acidic nor tart as I have found in many other places. There were fine pieces of rabbit meat that melted in my mouth. I cleaned up my plate with a piece of bread at the suggestion of our server.  It is important to note the service here is friendly and family-like. They are helpful with suggestions and eager to ensure your meal is excellent.  Next up was the Pollo Romanos - Roman Chicken.   At first when I cut it I was worried the chicken would be dry.  But it turns out, the chicken was moist, flavourful and had a good texture. Nothing like the flavourless and loose GMO chicken that is often served these days.  Nor was it powdery and dry, as I've also often encountered. It turns out L'Antipasto orders their chicken and rabbit directly from local farms. It was evident that attention had been paid to the source and quality of their ingredients.   Note:  We also ordered a fish special that fell short of our expectations, but I did not deduct any ratings because they took it back graciously with apologies.   They did not make us feel bad for our honesty!  THAT is service!  Although I had initially been full after the antipasto, every bite was so good I proceeded to indulge, and could't hold back on dessert.    To fully appreciate why I am giving this place such a high rating, you have to understand the context which is that of many disappointments whenever I've tried to find authentic Italian food.  Tiramisu is always a good gage for me - and I have to say it was THE BEST TIRAMISU I've had in Toronto. Some places change up the ingredients or hold back on the cheese and/or alcohol. NOT here. The TIRAMISU was moist, drenched in yummy coffee liquere and true mascarpone flavour. It went perfectly with smooth lattes that had such a wonderful froth on top. Sandro really knows how to make a foam with fine bubbles that have a lasting power. We also had chocolate profiteroles that were heavenly.   I can't wait to go back to try their gnocci!   In conclusion, L'Antipasto Ristorante is the place to go for authentic home-style Italian cooking. It's not high end designer frou frou cooking. Rather it's down to earth with quality ingredients. You can tell everyone working there is passionate about life and the food they serve.   I came here with a group-buying deal and I am so glad to have discovered such a treasure. Since I've never heard of them, I was surprised to find out they've already been open for 7 years now.  It's truly a hidden gem and I will most definitely return."}
{"text":"L' antipasto tends to overbook - particularly during special holidays / occasions.  I have experienced l' antipasto cuisine on Mothers day, Anniversaries and Birthdays and it is elbow-to-elbow.  The various  dishes I have  tried  have always had the potential for excellence : seafood-mushroom risotto ,  lamb/ meat mix, Angel-hair pasta pomodoro, Angelotti.  The presentation is excellent, your eyes are preparing your  palette for the symphony of taste ...  that falls flat once the mismatch in senses is registered.  Undercooked - more akin to food prepared for bulk wedding hall guests ( actually,  I have had better at a wedding hall).   I did enjoy the quaint feel and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just returned from dinner.  Was disappointed in my overall experience at this restaurant. First of all, it was extremely overpriced, I mean sickening expensive! For two people, the bill was very pricey with no alcohol. Secondly, our main entre which was the sea bass, had barley 2oz on the plate, cut into slivers and scattered around to seem as a full portion.  Overall, the food was mediocre and the service was much to be desired.  Lastly, beware the menu had  no pricing."}
{"text":"Billionaires eat here, literally. Sergio is the chef of billionaires. White table cloth; affordable menu with no prices says it all. As authentic as it gets. Real Italians serving real Italian food, even the TV is in Italian the music is classic 1950s you know that if Frank Sinatra was singing in Toronto this would be one of his choices.   Short menu. Know your pasta or ask. Short wine menu too, but they are all equally excellent you don't have to make a lot of choices just a few but when you do it will be something just right, why layer on too many choices? A great date night spot but let her know how special and gifted the owner Sergio is!  I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio. I know Italian and this is excellent."}
{"text":"I have come here several times over the past two years and have never been disappointed.  A classic Italian restaurant tucked away off Weston Road.  The owner is almost always there to greet you and he is always extremely nice.   The food is classic Italian with nothing to spare. Some cheeses and bread waiting for you and a fresh menu on the table from the veal, Fish and pasta dishes that you will find in most staple Italian restaurants.   The food is extremely fresh and is always cooked to perfection.   The wine selection is excellent with great choices from entry budgets to some seriously high end bottles.   The atmosphere is new but a bit dated.  Definitely not the modern style.   I would take a client here and or a family function if you are in for something on the higher end price point.    Great choice for a reliable and classic Italian."}
{"text":"This restaurant is perfect for dinner with friends, family, a date or private function. It's very warm, comfortable and welcoming.  The service was incredible and the food was spectacular. The fresh pasta with a boar sauce was my favorite dish.  The portions were very generous and the wine was paired perfectly with our meal.  It was a little pricy...."}
{"text":"Best Italian we've had at a restaurant in a very long time! My husband is Italian and even he was impressed! The owner greets you at the door, seats you and checks on you regularly... He even shook our hands at the door before we left! We had two glasses of wine (very generous glass!), antipasto buffet, one gnocchi an one penne with sausage (which were both delicious!) followed by espresso and biscotti.... The bill? $87!!!! I was astounded at the quantity and quality of food we had gotten for such a reasonable price! I wouldn't recommend bringing young children though as service and food is served at a very leisurely pace - just like all restaurants in Italy... We rather enjoyed not being rushed as most restaurants usually do. I would highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely return!!"}
