{"text":"So, this was my fourth chicken wing meal this week.   Again,  nothing special about the chicken here.  Boneless little chicken bites covered in sauce.   Also ordered the kimchi seafood pancake here.  It was ok. A little short on the seafood.  The pancake was a little dry as well.     Price was $45 for two.   Will I be coming back... I don't think so.   I'm still in search of a really good wing place.  If anyone can help out,  it will be much appreciated!"}
{"text":"This place used to be a Korean bar that didn't have an English name, and now they have a name AND pictures of what they sell clearly advertised on their front door!   I love Korean fried chicken, and this place has one of the most tasty chicken I've tried. The seasoned boneless chicken, onion boneless chicken and regular fried chicken were what we ordered, all in small size. We also tried their kimchi seafood pancake, which was made thinner than the average seafood pancake, and lacked in 'seafood'.  Complimentary popcorn and edamame were served when we sat down. The interior is small and a little bit eerie - It's designed like a wooden hut, with trees and vines stuffed between the ceiling and the wooden planks. Windows are plastered up, so no outside light could get in (not sure about lunch time) - point is, it's hella dark in there.   Service was also slow - our waitress was sitting on a side table on her cell phone, we had to walk over to ask her for our bill otherwise yell across the room.   The chicken is absolutely delicious, however, pricey. Our bill for 3 small chicken and the seafood pancake came out to be over $75. That's more than what I pay for AYCE, so I'm undecided on whether I\"ll be back."}
{"text":"Surprised this is the first Yelp review here for Arigato Fried Chicken. Just tried this place yesterday after a friend (who loves it here) told me he goes H.A.M. on the soju here. From the outside, you can never tell they even serve soju and it's nothing like what you would expect walking in. The outside has a lot of photos of fried chicken and it looks like a simple restaurant next to an H Mart, but the inside is really quite nice with wooden decor (almost like a backyard patio) and intimate lighting at night. When I went, it was quite busy inside and I'm told it's usually a great nightspot for snack and drinks.   Had the grape-flavoured soju which was good to share with one other person, tasted nice. They also have other flavours such as strawberry, lemon, cherry, and yogourt.   Wasn't there for dinner but the fried chicken being served looked delicious, will try next time. With our order came complimentary sides of fries, edamame, salad, and popcorn. Great for the munchies. Only downside is they close at 2am and I'm usually a night owl."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of chicken but must say the boneless chicken here is prettt good! Other dishes to try are mandu, bulgogi soup with mushroom and their egg soup... sooooo goood!!"}
{"text":"Good yogurt soju. Boneless spicy fried chicken was good. Not spicy at all, very mild which was disappointing. A little too much batter and not enough chicken. Used dark meat instead of white as well. Kimchi seafood pancake was ok. Might repeat if I'm  in the area."}
{"text":"We went for dinner here around 8pm on a Saturday. It wasn't busy so we were seated right away. The interior of the restaurant is definitely unique, but I like it.  For two people we ordered their combo plate with original and BBQ boneless chicken (described as 2-3 servings). For sides we had one order of fries and two bowls of rice.  For appetizers we were brought edamame, popcorn, and salad. The chicken was served with a side of hot sauce and mustard sauce. The mustard sauce paired with the original chicken was really good! The chicken goes well with fries or rice, however you prefer it.  It's not fancy but for the price and food quality, I had a great experience here. I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"My friends and I always walk by this hidden gem that's right next to an H-Mart. We always tell ourselves that we gotta check it out and this time we really did get a chance to really try this place out!  As we entered, we can hear the kpop music playing and smell the deliciousness coming from the kitchen. This restaurant was tiny, cute and very homey. All of the chairs and tables were wooden. The lighting inside was very dim-lit, it was very dark but there was just enough light to see what was in front of me.  The menu was small and the alcohol was pretty cheap here! $3.99 for a beer is a sweet deal and they have many different flavours of soju. The soju was much more expensive than the beers but if you're sharing with a group of friends, it shouldn't be too bad.  Now onto the food, the five of us ordered 2 large plates of boneless korean fried chicken. One was the green onion chicken and other one was BBQ. It was about $20.99 for a plate, it was very expensive for the amount of chicken we got. The portion wasn't too bad for a large but at $20.99 is quite steep. Luckily for us, the four of us shared the two plates and our total came to be $10pp.   Aside from judging the price of the chicken, let's talk about the taste of it. Holy moly, the chicken was delicious. It was flavourful, crispy and soft all at the same time. I love Korean fried chicken but I just wish it wasn't so damn expensive.   Overall, this cute little hidden gem is definitely a place worth checking out but my advice for you guys is to go with a group of 4-5 people and share the bill. It'll save your wallet and you can sample the deliciousness that is korean friend chicken."}
