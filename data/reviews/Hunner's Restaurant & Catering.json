{"text":"A sturgeon staple, The hoagies and chicken strips are delicious. Been eating here for over 25 years Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"This place is very underrated and is all around awesome! Hunner's has been a go-to for me and my family for around 10 years now. They are always so kind and quick to serve you, without being overbearing.   Although Hunner's has poor location for some people, it is a hidden gem for most. Right off of the Panhandle Trail, Hunner's features a sit-down dining area and full ice cream parlor, as well as takeout and delivery.   This is a restaurant that I am quick to show other people. I will never get sick of Hunner's due to the friendly customer service, short waiting time, and of course, the delicious food.  Hunner's features a diverse menu, from pasta to pizza, and hoagies to fish! They always have fresh homemade soups, and their desserts are to die for."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!!  Ok gotta say that the dine in experience is cramped , not much atmosphere, and no cold beer!!!  However if your looking for the best take out pizza in the Oakdale McDonald area this is your place. Give it a try you won't be disappointed.  If pizza isn't your thing the Fish Sandwich is also the best around.   It's out of the way, hard to find , and not much of a dining experience    That all said worth the drive time for take out pizza and fish"}
{"text":"For a small town, I will admit that this place is GREAT! This was my first time, I got their white pizza and breadsticks. I feel like most pizzas are rated by their crust and sauce. Unfortunately I havent tried the red/marinara sauce on their pizza since I had their white pizza but I plan to go back soon! Atleast for their crust, I will say it's been my favorite in a long time! Reminds me of a place in downtown Pittsburgh (Proper Pizza) - this place has amazing potential! My only complaint? I feel like the white pizza could have had more garlic but that's just my personal preference. Their breadsticks are actually cheesy breadsticks.    They have amazing desserts and there's even a little ice cream area in there! My new favorite local spot."}
{"text":"I stopped here with a group riding in the Panhandle Trail for some ice cream.  They sell Perry's ice cream which is a brand I like.  The price was reasonable especially considering the the generous size of a small.  However, the ice cream I had was not fresh. It had the distinct taste of freezer burn."}
{"text":"I just ordered some pizzas and breadsticks from here for a kids party and we all really enjoyed it! The menu offers a nice variety and huge options for a decent price compared to other places in the area. I think you really get a good bang for your buck. We had cheese and pepperoni,and both tasted great. The only bummer is if you want sides like ranch and garlic sauce you have to pay extra. Other than that, I look forward to trying other menu options here again in the future."}
