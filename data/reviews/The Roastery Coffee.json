{"text":"I can't really add much more than what's been said here.  - They do take Interac and Visa now. At lunch time they open a 2nd checkout behind the normal one for card users.  - Ask them to toast your burrito for a while longer if you like it extra hot & melty.  - The Morning Glory muffins are the best. I am only disclosing this fact now because I no longer work in Liberty Village, and so cannot be there to snatch them up.  - The best roast is arguably the Bolivian Organic.  - They have an ATM. It's one of the only ATMs in the immediate area.  - Ask them to fill a large cup with ice (free). Pour in your coffee. Voila, iced coffee.  - The dark haired girl behind the counter during the summer (and some other times) is a total sweetheart and I'm glad to consider her one of the first friends I made when I moved to TO."}
{"text":"Hmm... Should I be concern that I'm on a first name basis here...  The Roastery is a really cool place tucked in Liberty Village.  With a large offering of random food (think: Burritos and pasta together in one place), there's something for everyone.    The Roastery consist of several sections:  - A Burrito station - Sandwich area - Large selection of coffee  - Baked goods - Soups  I go here mainly for the burritos and soup.  The burrito is delicious and I go there a lot (evident by the fact that they know my name in that area).   They have several types of burrito.  Your usual such as bean, beef, chicken, and non-usual... SWEET POTATO.  You can then customize your topping and it's soooooooo delish.  Now, after I receive my burrito, I started this thing where I would weigh my burrito on the coffee bean scale that they have next to the station.  My fattest burrito (which was a small burrito!) was 16 ounces.   When I want a lighter meal, I usually go to their soup section.  They change their soup offerings each day but always offer 3 to 4 kinds of soup.  The soup selection is probably one of the better in Liberty Village (only best by Liberty Market... let me know if you know of others).  I've also tried their coffee.  It's pretty decent... keeping in true Roastery tradition, they also have a large selection of brewed coffee.  If you are a fan of the coffee, they sell the beans so you can brew at home.    My con list for the Roastery: - they don't accept credit card which is annoying - the layout of the place is insane.  If you get a burrito, you have to order your burrito, choose your topping, then go across the restaurant to pay, then take your receipt back to the burrito station, give them the receipt and then you get your burrito.  After all that, you have to make your way to the exit which is near the cashier.   - i don't understand why guacamole is .50 extra.  You can have guac on your burrito but if you want more than one smidge of a spread, you need to pay .50 more.  BTW - I'm only on a first name basis at the burrito section.  My advice:  Give them a fake name.  It haunts me when the burrito section goes... \"Hi Leona!\""}
{"text":"+1 STAR EACH:  * Excellent selection of food -- soups, salads, sandwiches, wraps, burritos etc.  Spicy tuna sandwich was quite yummy (nothing exceptional, but satisfying)  * Good selection of baked goods.  Utterly delectable raspberry chocolate brownie  * Good selection of reading material (Now, The Star, Eye Weekly)  * Nice variety of \"regular\" coffee -- I normally order espresso-based drinks, but I went with an ordinary coffee for a change, and was pleased  * Fireplace!  * Comfy seating if you sit on a padded \"bench\"  * They take debit  - 1 STAR EACH:  * Wobbly tables and chairs on uneven concrete floors, and slightly drab-looking interior  * Ridiculous closing hours, closed on Sunday  * They don't take credit  -0.5 STARS  * Service slightly disinterested (but really not too bad)  TOTAL (if I can still count): 3.5, rounded up to 4 because I was hungry and really grateful to find a cafe that does FOOD.  Long live and prosper, Roastery.  I'll be sure drop by again when I'm back in the 'hood."}
{"text":"This place has the best London fog latte, I always get a large and it comes to about $3 which is awesome! Also it's scorching hot which the best because so many other places serve lukewarm drinks. The lunch options are endless and also very reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Every time I come here they're out of half of their menu. It's like they only stock up for rush-hour (breakfast and lunch) traffic even though they're open until 5:30. The staff is also kind of hard to understand because of their poor english skills... so my order is often incorrect. Grilled cheese, with no cheese..."}
{"text":"I don't come here often, but I've never been disappointed. I think the price is fair - for example I had a tuna melt the other day and it includes 5 toppings. I had that, a medium coffee and a generous sized slice of carrot cake for $10. (Not bad at all!)  It takes a few minutes if you want your item grilled, but grilling is worth the wait. I've not had time to sit and enjoy the atmosphere but I like the lay out of the place and would love to sit and have a coffee here. I bet this place has a lot of regulars!"}
{"text":"I always used to go there for their burritos. Sadly, won't be going there anymore. While they're increasing their prices, their quality is going down.  The burrito I ordered today came in a weird square shape. Needless to say, as soon as I started to eat it, it broke down completely. Should have gotten a spoon..."}
{"text":"I work a few minutes' walk away from The Roastery, so I'm there a lot. The prices are decent - not amazing, but you can get a pretty full, filling lunch with a drink or coffee for about 7 or 8 bucks usually. The coffee is always very good, and they have apple cider year-round that's delicious. I'm a fan of their food as well: the burritos are always fresh and tasty, and they have a nice rotation of different kinds of quiches, perogies, pastas, and salads. I've only ordered a smoothie once, a blueberry-banana, and it was decent, but the banana didn't taste quite ripe yet.  The wait around lunch time, though, is ridiculous. I ordered perogies, which were already cooked and behind the front counter, but they had to be heated up, which was fine. It took 15 minutes? I don't even know. Get there early if you want lunch. It's worth it, but you won't get in and out quickly."}
{"text":"I usually meet at the Roastery when I find myself in the Liberty Village area of Toronto. The staff are nice, they have a good selection of organic  coffee in addition to regular and flavored coffees.   A pretty good selection of desserts and sandwiches, hot food. The owner is very hospitable and accommodating.  They have good bagels (almost montreal style), lox and cream cheese.  The place features some art that is usually for sale, and it's nice that they have a fireplace during the winter!  It's a quaint little place that does a pretty good job of serving to the large number of people working in the area that tend to come in en masse between 8:30 and 9:30 and 11:30 and 1.  It isn't gourmet, but for what it is, they do it pretty well."}
{"text":"The Roastery has a ridiculous number of lunch options: made-to-order sandwiches, a hot table, a burrito bar, soups and chili. Normally this would be cause for concern - many a resto has fallen victim to the Jack of All Trades Master of None syndrome. But the burrito bar does it more or less right - fresh (super-busy, so lots of turnover), decent flavours (though could have better hot sauce), and fast. A large steak burrito can keep one going for the rest of the day. And the lasagna I had before I discovered the burrito bar was quite decent.  There is also a huge number of fruit juices, flavoured ice teas, alternative pops, etc.  But the best thing about the Roastery is the coffee and sweets. Working on the west side of Liberty VIllage, I don't have time to walk all the way to Balzac's, and I'm not sure I would even if it were closer. The Roastery serves a very decent latte at a reasonable price, and the Skor shortbread cookie is my favourite afternoon pick-me-up anywhere."}
{"text":"Prices keep going up. Portion sizes keep getting smaller.  It seems that the ownership is pinching every penny that goes through there. As a result their burritos have decreased in size dramatically. Yet their prices remain the same as the others in the neighbourhood. I'd recommend going elsewhere. You'll get your money's worth there."}
{"text":"More than just a cup of joe.  Don't let the name deceive you... this place has everything from soups to sandwiches to delicious salads. The set up is a bit funny but the food is delicious and reasonably priced for a quick lunch meal."}
{"text":"I used to come here regularly for breakfast or lunch since this place is right by my work. Started coming back again recently after being away for a year and the place has seriously gone downhill. Prices are so much higher than last year, but quality has declined significantly. Toasted bagels are never done consistently (sometimes burnt, sometimes barely toasted), and they are definitely serving bagels well after they've gone stale. The lasagna and garlic bread was good, but now it's half the size it used to be, but at a higher price. And for some reason, their croissants (price gone up to $2.50) have some form of alcohol in them that makes a strange aftertaste. And that's based on both their butter and cheese croissants tasted by several different people. The only good things they have left are their flavoured lattes (too sweet for most people...but I like them that way), which I'm pretty sure are powdered mixed based on how fast they're prepared, and their chocolate chip cookies (when they're not old)."}
{"text":"Not one of my fav places in liberty village, but certainly a staple for some.    Usually have 3-4 soups for lunch, now burritos, sandwiches, various salads and a dozen or so snacky/deserty treats.  They have a nice selection of organic coffees, and hot beverages.    Their prices are acceptable, but I've never been excited by any of their food, so I tend not to go there for lunch, just occasionally for a coffee."}
{"text":"Reasonably-priced, delicious lunches and only a five minute walk from the office! Service is a bit slow due to (what seems to be) a lack of efficiency behind the scenes. There should also be a clear system for people ordering food, paying for food and then waiting for their orders to be called...people just seem to wait and stand around in random parts of the cafe for their food first rather than paying for food as soon as they order. Roastery should set up a system since it gets so busy during lunch hours. Overall, this place is one of my go to spots for lunches - affordable, healthy-ish and convenient!"}
{"text":"so i discovered that there is an extension of this company inside the building I work in making it a convenient choice when weather is unforgiving and time is of essence.  I was starting to enjoy the latte here and was ready to update to a more positive review but alas, not meant to be. I think  the product offering is great and probably why people go back .  Last 3 times I bought a daily special/ salad which is advertised on a commercially printed board as $6.99-7.99 I have paid between $8.99 -9.99 because never mind what the commercially printed, office signage says, the little handwritten sign says $8.99 and that is what will be charged.  For the portion of the food I don't mind paying the price - but  I would have preferred to get bagel with cream cheese and lox ($6.99)if the difference in price was going to be so noticeable,and now I am forced to buy this food because I feel bad changing my mind now that they've put it together.  The clerk told me, when I decided to speak up about it after the 3rd time, that what the sign says doesn't matter, it's the hand written one with its arbitrary pricing, that matters. Then she just started ranting in whatever language spoke which rubbed me the wrong way even more.  One last thing - I got butter chicken and spring mix with fruits - why is my butter chicken so bloody tearfully spicy and raspberry dressing taste like balsamic?  After all this time, its still a no. NO NO NO."}
{"text":"The Roastery is located in liberty village, pretty assessable to a number of workplaces. I had their salad to go; I got to choose two different salads as options:  1) Couscous with chicken - it was fresh, delicious and flavoured really well. I was weary that it would be really dense, but it was had a nice light taste to it.  2) vegetarian quinoa - it was cooked perfectly, worked well with the couscous.  They rotate the salad selection (there was four today). Looking forward to trying their other salads! They also take credit card, which is nice."}
{"text":"Ok, started coming back here a couple of months ago and I can honestly say I am a fan again.  The staff has changed out some and are friendly.  The food has improved....plus they have a burrito bar!  The manager has loosened up and is actually nice now.  And the main register person (female)  is AMAZING!  So friendly and not fake at all.  They have a whole new line-up of iced drinks that should meet anyone's needs or wants.  The only bad thing about this place now is that they are always so busy:)  Great job Roastery!"}
{"text":"You might just miss this Liberty Village café if it wasn't for the colourful murals adorning the front entrance and patio. It was deserted on Saturday morning, which the Girl Behind the Counter (GBC) explained was the norm. This was a bonus for me, as I was there to get some work done. There are lots of places to sit in the painted-yellow brick interior. I grabbed probably the only table near an outlet (that I could see). They also have a fireplace which could prove cozy come winter.  I ordered an egg salad sandwich and an americano. When my sandwich rang in a dollar more than expected, the GBC explained that the board was \"old pricing.\" I wasn't having any of it, but she was ignorant on how to resolve the situation, citing \"there's no button...\" Blah, blah. Filled with ire, I sat down with my sammich.  When the manager showed up later he resolved my pricing issue, but he couldn't get the Wifi working for me. It seems like it's an Apple thing, so take your Macbooks elsewhere. Pretty middle of the road place, though the attention by the manager saved it from being a two-star.  Obligatory Title Pun: Try not to get ROASTED by faulty pricing.  Menu Readability: Man, they have a lot on offer here. Coffee, tea, fresh juice, smoothies, tea, bagels, salads, sandwiches, and baked goods.  Need to mention: They accept debit, but not credit.  What this place teaches me about myself: I hate button-based customer service. Figure it out, you know?"}
{"text":"I want to love you, but I have to leave you. Whoever owns the place, you had a good idea one day.... but the abundance of staff that don't know what they're doing is not verging on; it's fully fleshed out commedia dell'arte. The cash register always knows what's up, yet the non-spoken, Pierrot le fou routine that performs every 20 minutes on the hour behind the sandwich bar is... consistent. Without fail, every day you can expect to play a verbal and non-verbal game of 'who's ordered yet' with everyone in the building, and then proceed to watch the festivities roll out over the next 19 minutes. In a way it's some what exciting, not knowing what's going to happen - if only the third act gave you it's money's worth. -- Two out of five sad clowns."}
