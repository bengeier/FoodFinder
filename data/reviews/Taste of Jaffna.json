{"text":"I tried mutton kothu rotti, it wasn't that good and not even close to jaffna kothu rotti's taste, (too much of eggy smell). Other items are just 'ok' too. Guys please focus on improving the taste to get that 'taste of jaffna'."}
{"text":"This Sri Lankan cuisine restaurant had delicious dishes with a lot of flavour. There is a good variety on the menu. This is definitely the place to go if you're craving food that tastes like its homemade. The service was great and the staff were very attentive. This is my new favourite spot for Sri Lankan food! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Came by the week of their grand opening and must say the food is really good.  Order the kottu roti and it was delicious. The prices are a little lower than most other Sri Lankan restaurants in Toronto but I think this is likely due to the store being new. In any regard, definitely worth a try. I'll be going again very soon."}
{"text":"Good food and service! Parotta roti and mutton curry was decent. Mutton kothu roti was really good Tasty fish cutlets at 3 for $1 and 3 rolls for $2 is a great deal, unheard of.  Definitly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Very nice intro to Sri Lankan cuisine...tasty Affordable eats... may want to take this home to gear up as there's no seating on site."}
{"text":"I went here the other day because of the positive reviews, and I loved it!  As I arrived some of the things were still being brought out, so you might want to time your visit to get there a little after they open.  Strictly a takeout.  Several veggie option, but they also had tandoori chicken, and chicken curry.  Also a fair assortment of snacks and sweets.  Everything was high quality, service was friendly, and the place was immaculate."}
