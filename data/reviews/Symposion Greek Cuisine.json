{"text":"Although I personally did not eat while here at this restaurant I experienced one of the worst customer service experiences in my LIFE! If it was possible to give negative starts I would.     The manager was the worst I have ever seen! Our friends found hair in their food and were told that, this sort of thing happens often, as if it was no big deal! Then she proceeded to yell at me because I wasn't present when the hair appeared and was discussed. I was merely trying to ask if they would be charged for the item as my friends were unsure how to ask tactfully.     Although the owner tried to resolve the issue. The issue of customer service and rude yelling could not be addressed, unless they were to hire new manager, who is capable of communicating with people properly.     If you want quality and RESPECTFUL service. Go else wear . I was told by my friends who attempted to eat here that the food was unimpressive. Hopefully this restaurant will learn a stern lesson, to treat their customers with respect, if they agree with them or not. Customer Relations 101. You are welcome for the free advice!"}
{"text":"This is probably the only (certainly one of the only) non-chain Greek restaurants in the area, and it's been here forever! The place is definitely showing its age though. But despite that, the food is very good and the prices are not unreasonable. It really says something when other places nearby come and go but this place just keep on going."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  Great place.  Great food.  It's a mom and pops Greek.  Not disappointing at all."}
{"text":"Not even close to being as bad as the other reviewer is making it out to be.   I had the chicken souvlaki dinner (Large, 15 bucks) and it came with all the fixings. Rice, potatoes, pita bread, tzatziki, salad, and grilled chicken.   It may not be on par with places like Astoria but Brampton has a severe shortage of Greek restaurants now, so I'm happy this is still here.   Took two stars away because there weren't enough potatoes , the tomatoes on the salad were under ripe, and one of my pieces of chicken was gristly.  And the salad was under dressed  Still, you can do a lot worse IMO"}
{"text":"Ewww!! Very mediocre food. Mediocre service. Mediocre atmosphere. Seemed like their potatoes were microwaved and salads were dunked in water to store. Nothing was good here. Not even the wine. Gross. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I'd give this a 1/2 star if possible. This was a terrible experience. Had dinner here before the Rose Theatre in Brampton. We were a group of 7 & one of our guests had an MSG intolerance. We told the wait staff & was told that \"EVERYTHING that they serve has MSG in it\"!! So we asked for something off menu..,. waitress said no problem but came to the table to say that the chef made a mistake & they had no MSG free food for her. This was 5 minutes before the rest of the table was served!! And to top it all off...they still charged her for the extremely late dinner service that she eventually received!! The wait staff was sub-standard. The bathroom was something outta the 80's & in general the place was run down & dirty. This is definitely NOT A DO-OVER!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what others have experienced, but I have always experienced great customer service. The waitress we usually have is well informed and knows how to serve a table properly. (Ex. We are not all having soup as our dinner comes out) The food is always delicious and well priced. Try the charcoal lamb (any lamb really), the quail, mousaka, everything is great I have never not liked anything. There is so much to choose from. It has been a staple of Brampton for 30-40 years. The decor is dated, but who cares the food is great! You are missing out if you don't have dinner here."}
{"text":"Lots of variety...menu extends beyond typical Greek food.  Delicious food!  Great service. Multiple vegetarian options. Upper scale ambiance. Would definitely return & recommend friends eat here!"}
{"text":"Came in for the lunch menu. Aside from me there was another table that was being served as well.   Service was good but with just me and another table it should be expected. My waitress was pleasant to talk with and was helpful.  I was started off with some hot pita bread with butter. Bread and butter is just bread and butter but it is always great to have it when the bread is nice and hot. It was lunch time and I was in the mood for a gyros sandwich. I chose their \"chicago style\" gyros sandwich with fries. Was less than satisfied. The meat inside the sandwich looked like shaved or sliced sausage. The fries tasted a little better than the sandwich.  Maybe I would pop in one day and try something else and maybe that review will be better. For now I'll just leave it with 3 stars."}
