{"text":"Wasn't terribly disappointed with this chicken but it did lean towards the dryer side for all the foods. Probably won't order again."}
{"text":"I'm a bit embarrassed to be the first person to give Fritou a not so great review, but . . . I live pretty close to Fritou, they like to stick their signs in my condo's lawn areas. I checked them out on Yelp to see people were pretty happy with their experiences there. Mine began with being barely greeted by someone who looked like they hated their job.  It is dingy, but that's not a big deal to me. Some of the best places to eat look like they have the potential to give you food poisoning. No, my beef is with the soggy, bland fries and extremely greasy chicken I ended up taking home.  Didn't even finish it. Also tore out the signs on my lawn. . . Don't think they were allowed to do that without asking the condo board to put them up in the first place."}
{"text":"Ordered 12 pcs hot wings here, for a 15 mins wait, the wings taste pretty good. They arent very oily to the taste."}
{"text":"I have only been to one other Fritou Chicken restaurant before. This one was brand new and very clean and is really close to my house. I was greeted by by a very friendly man. I ordered a 3 piece combo to split with my wife and sat to wait. The friendly man came by and gave me a sample wing to eat while I was waiting.  The sample, and the 3 piece order were all delicious. The fries were also crispy and delicious. My wife is in love with the chunky salsa like dip they include with their meals. I found the chicken not as greasy as Popeyes and much taster than KFC. The fries were also way better than Popeyes and KFC. We didn't try to coleslaw."}
{"text":"The food is quite good here if you have enough time to actually receive it. They make the chicken fresh, so understandably it takes longer than somewhere like KFC but wait times can tend to border on the ridiculous. Parking here is next to impossible, as there are only a couple of spaces out front (usually taken up by the staff). More parking is all the way at the back facing Walmart and down a flight of stairs. Numerous times I have called to order food well after the posted opening times and no one answers the phone. While the chicken here is actually really good, they need to make it easier to be a customer."}
{"text":"This location is now owned by a Pakistani family and is HALAL!  The chicken and fries are great. Don't bother with their chicken burger. For some reason it is always stale, dry and over cooked. Go to the NE branch if you are craving the burger. Also they don't have a pizza menu like in the NE.  Like the NE location, they are a 2 in 1 restaurant. But instead of pizza they have a desi menu under Mysha foods. I haven't tried anything yet. However, I did eat food at a desi party catered by these guys and it was overall very disappointing. Everything was overly spicy and tasted like Shan masala packets."}
{"text":"When I first read Gabe's reviews I thought he was lying. Gabe A a liar? Hardly but he tends to make you solve riddles. So for a while I wondered where this elusive chicken joint was because Gabe kept replying to my queries with coy responses like \"Guy it's where you need it to be\" \"Guy it's where dreams are made out of\"  So when I finally found Fritou chicken I was driving down on the opposite side of the road of Canyon Meadows I immediately cut through traffic, braving the obnoxious honking from those silly cars trying to drive in the opposite direction.  When I walked in and took a look at the menu I immediately got the impression that the place was a mix between an indian restaurant and a KFC. Awesome. One one side of the menu are your fried chicken, chicken sandwiches, etc and on the other are east-indian chicken dishes like butter chicken and tandoori. But don't make the mistake of mocking the identity of this place, THEY ARE ALL ABOUT THE CHICKEN HERE.  I took a 3 piece with coleslaw and fries to go. Simple but it speaks volumes about this little chicken joint. The fried chicken distinctly stood out from what I've usually had in the city (KFC, chicken on the way). It's crisp and salty but the seasoning is light and subtle and serves to compliment the quality of the chicken. Their gravy is MUY GUSTO. At first I found it a bit strange as it instantly hits you with east indian spices, but it wins you over once you get digging into it with your fries and chicken. I'm not a big fan of the fries but thats because I seem to reject carbs soaked in oil but their coleslaw was savoury and provided refreshing breaks between the heavy bites of chicken and gravy.

{"text":"Best fried chicken place in Calgary, they make fresh chicken and service is excellent. The place is very clean"}
{"text":"I prefer not to get fried chicken too often, but when I do, I like this place close to home! It is located in a dingy little corner strip mall off Canyon Meadows Dr, sandwiched between a liquor store and a dojo. What a kooky little area!  Fritou is literally a hole in the wall, with a tiny window where you can catch a glimpse of fried magic being created. It is less greasy than KFC, with better spices, and tastes great when you take it home to eat with some steamed rice and bok choy. You can have your fancy, overblown Chicken-On-The-Way, but I will take Fritou anyday."}
