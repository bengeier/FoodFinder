{"text":"My wife and I decided to do a tour of older places on the southwest side which brought us to Feilers.  We did not know what to expect, but we were pleasantly surprised.   Old fashioned was good and the staff and patrons were super friendly.  Going back soon to try the food.   Will update review then."}
{"text":"I've been to Fieler's a number of times in the last couple years for cocktails and their Friday Fish Fry.  The ambiance is definitely unpretentious, old fashioned, WI-supper club which I love.  Prices are reasonable and service is good.  Continues to be my favorite Friday night spot."}
{"text":"Looking for a traditional Wisconsin Supper Club?  Feiler's is the real thing...its not fancy, its not nice...but its comfy, warm and friendly...have a Brandy Old-Fashioned, sit back and enjoy your Cod..."}
{"text":"I fell for this restaurant immediately, and I do mean fell for as soon as I stepped one foot out of my car I went immediately face down on the ice.  Now just because it begins bad does not mean it ends bad.

Once my fiancee knew I was all right and subsequently she stopped laughing, we went in and enjoyed a really great experience.  This was my first time at Feiler's and I could tell right away I'd go back again.  The decor is very chic Ala That 70's Show.  

We started with a round of beer for me and brandy old fashion for her.  It was Friday night so we of course ordered the Friday night Fish fry, which for both of us meant beer battered perch and hash browns though cod was also an option.  I was disappointed to later find out they have walleye on their regular menu as that is my favorite and preferred fish but none the less, the perch was excellent.  Crisp and not too fishy with a good portion, the perch was just right.  The hash browns were more like small cut potatoes and were not crisp and well done.  I did, however, take them home and cooked them up proper the next morning and they were great.

Overall, I would say that Feiler's is a neat little neighborhood treat tucked in the nowhere land near the beltline.  It will take you back in time for certain and though prices are from the 70's, it won't set your wallet back either.  Good value for the price and we'll definitely keep it on our list!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed here. I was told that Feiler's has the best burgers around, and I love me a good dive bar. Although I've only experienced their burger, I was pretty disappointed; it was bland to the point where it tasted like the meat was cooked in a microwave.

I did like the atmosphere, and the service was just fine. It is definitely the only sit down restaurant in its area, which is a pretty odd location, you can kind of tell that the other stores/businesses built themselves around the old and decrepit Feiler's. 

I'd give it another shot, but I'd have to be wowed."}
{"text":"Feiler's is tucked into a corner of the Beltline and Verona Rd, near Home Depot.  As you enter the property, beware of the cavernous complex of potholes, sinkholes and assorted death-to-car traps.  

Inside Feiler's we were met with a very dark, oddly smelling interior that looked like it had been built in the 60's (It was) and cleaned a couple of times in the 70's (not sure about that).  The hostess was a sign that said \"Seat Yourself\" so we did.

FDR once said that the only thing you have to fear is fear itself.  Maybe my review of Feiler's would be more positive if we could have seen the floor, our table, each other, but instead all is left to your imagination.  Did something just brush my leg?  Are my shoes sticking to the carpet?  Did someone or something die in the corner?  

The paper place-mats on the table spoke volumes. They have a comical drawing of a fancy-dressed couple standing outside Feiler's.  The restaurant is drawn like Hollywood facade of a classy restaurant front hiding a dilapidated shack, garbage, dog urine, a dead former owner, and a child defecating in an outhouse.  A piece of marketing ingeniousness it isn't.  

Our waitress appeared and apologized for our wait (about 10 minutes or so).  Apparently she was the only waitstaff on duty that day - and the place, was packed.

We ordered steaks.  Really, what else would you get at a Wisconsin supper club.  It came with a trip to the salad bar.  We downed our Old Fashioneds (really what else would you drink at a Wisconsin supper club), mustered up our courage and visited the salad bar.  

The money they save on not lighting the place is definitely not spent on their salad fixings.  A bowl of iceberg lettuce, some cheese, a few veges (radishes, carrots) a few empty containers and a half-dozen buckets of salad-dressing looking goop made up the majority of the salad bar.  The lettuce looked like it had been put out that day, I wasn't sure about the rest, so my salad was lettuce.  

The steaks came.  19 ounces of prime cut goodness.... well, technically about 13 ounces of prime cut goodness and about 6 ounces of bulbous fat.  It looked like my steak had a cancerous fat tumor growing out of it.  The person I was eating with, also received a fat tumorous steak, but her steak (and the tumor) was slightly smaller.  

The accompanying twice-baked potato soaked in butter was pretty tasty.  

I'm giving Feiler's a conservative 2 stars.  The ambiance is a 0 (unless you're into horror shows), the overburdened waitress did her best (3-4) and the food was about a 2.  

We won't be back to Feiler's any time soon."}
{"text":"For what it is - a very small bar and supper club that offers steaks, burgers, prime rib, fish, etc. -  Feiler's is very good. Kind of has a home-away-from-home feel, a good place to have a meal on a weeknight."}
{"text":"Food is so tasty. Love the homemade chili and soups. And the Friday fish is the best around. Oh and the twice baked potato is all the reason you need to come back."}
{"text":"I was here the second to last day that it was open.  Nostalgia outweighed the quality of the food.  It is amazing that it has been open for 50 years.  Alot has changed in the dining arena and unfortunately (and sadly), the Supper Club is an endangered species.  The wood paneling, the placemats and the bar are definitely throwbacks.  The food, I wish, I could throw back.  I went with the Friday special-fish fry and it didn't deliver.  The fries were not fresh and the fish overcooked and dry.  So long, Feilers, it was a admirable run."}
{"text":"I've been in Madison for 30 years now, plus or minus, and I've always been curious about this restaurant tucked away near Home Depot.  Today I went with friends, and it was great.  My steak sandwich was super, and my wife had walleye -- broiled -- and the piece of fish was cooked perfectly and HUGE!  The cheesy hash browns (wife got) were better than the twice-baked (which I got).  But they didn't have any dessert (Sad)!  The ambiance is totally rural town supper club, and I mean that in a very very good way.  I will not wait 30 years to go back!  Cocktails are cheap and strong.   Just the way you want them."}
