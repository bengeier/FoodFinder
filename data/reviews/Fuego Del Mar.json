{"text":"I really wanted to like this cute place.. I will add, the service was nice.  I found this restaurant through Amazon local, it looked good and had pretty good review overall, but while there, I realized that it was extremely over priced for the food they served... I got the enchilada dish, and it was extremely spicy, to the point that my eyes watered (share dinner with kid) because the dish was $24, she was not able to eat it, and oly eat the corn bread hushpuppies, which taste good, my husbad order a $25 dish.  Mind you we had to order like this because it was the deal I bought,  rediculous... I know they have to make money but come on... first impression are huge...   We also ordered an appetizer (some fish tasteless dish) and a couple a drinks and the bill came to $75.00 plus add tip.  To say the least, I will never go back, I expect a lot of flavor for that price.  I went to Anaya's in my neighborhood and I ordered almost the same with the difference that I got extra margarita and the price was $33.00 plus tip, and it was to die for!    If you have money to waste and like a bit of a snobby attitude while you enjoy dinner, then this is it, I think they should move location, get a new cook, chill a bit...lower the prices a bit..and they may have a chance.  Good luck."}
{"text":"Went there during lunch.  Lunch prices were very reasonable, the service was good and the food was delicious.  Would definitely recommend and will be going there again."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of AMANDA (owner and waitress), or Fuego Del Mar A.K.A. Fuegos Tacos! 
If you are new in the area or just visiting, please watch out for this restaurant!! I assure you this place will give you suspicions.
What's the point of having a groupon deal if the business does not welcome newcomers! Please please be careful yelpers."}
{"text":"Place has great potential not entirely capitalized upon.  Everything was good and it certainly has cool ambiance but the service lacked something to be desired.

You know how some people are great servers/hosts, etc?  Well, others are just doing a job.  The first person a customer contacts should be a host/hostess.  The food and menu was very good though I would have been more impressed with a little more oomph from staff.

We had enchiladas and the ahi tuna.  Yet again I managed the better menu selection (this NEVER happens to me).  The enchiladas were VERY good.  Spicy but not too much and the cole slaw was an excellent compliment.  I have to say that from reading other's reviews, I expected more of the hush puppies and mac n cheese.  Both tasty and the pups were extremely light and crisp, I just prefer more savory flavor.  My husband was satisfied with his fish but not overwhelmed.

We used a Groupon for this place which I'm glad for though ended up being a somewhat complicated process.  Tried to milk our anniversary once more with only patronizing comments from our server - I don't care if you've been married twice as long as we have, it's still a special day for us!

Anyhow, still a good experience but I probably would rather have tried Solo or gone back to True Foods or Stingray's.

Sorry, Fuego del Mar...seems you're loosing your fizzle."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!  I have actually been here for lunch a couple times when it was called Fuego Tacos and it was really good then.  They still have the taco menu for happy hour and lunch I believe.    My gf and I went here last saturday night and it was probably one of the best restaurant experiences we have had in quite some time.  Our service was really great the waitress was very helpful and extremely nice (wish I remembered her name!)  We both ordered margaritas which were really good.  My only small small small problem was that there probably could have been a little more tequila in it (but I am a huge man that likes my drinks strong)  We had the pablano peppers appetizer which was amazing and just the right amount for an appetizer.  I ordered the green chile stuffed relleno (which I have also had at their sister restaurant, Fuego Bistro)  and it was incredible it was even better than the one I had there.  It was cooked perfectly and the crispiness of the batter was in a perfect relationship with the softness and flavors of the pepper and seafood.  Also the seafood was cooked to perfection, which is very rare for Arizona.  I had the mac and cheese and hush puppies for my sides which were also delectable.  My gf had the enchiladas which she also thought were marvelous , I got to eat her second one, the next day and she was right.  I would absolutely recommend this place if you are in the area and I want you all to support the restaurant so that it sticks around and I can go there on the regular! haha We are definitely going to make it habit of eating here."}
{"text":"WTHeck! Is this place EVER open???? I've been there twice for lunch and they've been closed. Their website needs to be updated. When I've called I get a recording saying they're busy so of course that makes me think they're open."}
{"text":"We  were very disappointed.  When we arrived at 5 PM on a Friday evening and we were the only ones there.  We should have left.  The service was terrible as was the food.  The coconut shrimp were butterflied but not de-veined.  The fried empanada was cold in the center.  My husband ordered the seafood  enchiladas.  He did not eat them as they tasted of old seafood.  My son also did not eat his food.  Sitting at the table, the hostess cleaned a table next to us after taking a dirty rag out of a bucket which was sitting in a high chair in the dinning room.  After she wiped off the table, she threw the rag back into the bucket in the high chair.  Without washing her hands she came over to our table with the iced tea pitcher and just grabbed my son's glass and refilled it without asking if he wanted more.  When we asked for the check the waitress never asked us why we did not eat the food.  I hope we do not get sick from what we did taste."}
{"text":"To be up front we only came here for drinks but did a lot of observing. Ok, whoever manages this place needs to get a clue. This place has tons of potential but the lack of customer service is obvious. We came for drinks and ordered a margarita and mojito, the mojito was OK but the tequila used in the margarita was worse than Cuervo. Not psyched about a crappy margarita... We also ordered chips and salsa which never made its way to our table. The food looked good but awfully pricey for a poorly run establishment. There wasn't even a hostess to greet people as they walked in....3 people came in that had a reservation and it took more than a minute for the bartender standing right in front of them to acknowledge their presence. Finally they were greeted but led upstairs by the bartender who said nothing of where she was going so one of the guy's asked if they should follow him. 
However, every experience is subjective.


Save your money and go across the street to an actual restaurant"}
{"text":"Wow i havent dished our a one star in a while but this place definitely earned it.  Stopped in to try it out for a working lunch today.  First problem you have to park underground and get a ticket to park.  Next, negative vibe by the guy host at front door who also brings the negative vibe when he pours you water (no smile or talking).  I always say if you dont have a great personality that is okay, just dont have a job where you interface with the public.  

Next chips and salsa.  Chips tasted stale or they might just use bad oil.  Salsa was okay but certainly not amazeballs.  

Finally, steak and pork tacos.  YUCK both were really not very tasty.  Although we asked for a togo container after taking a few bites (just to be nice as i wouldnt serve it to a pet if i had one) we dumped it in the trash first chance we got.  Pinto beans were totally runny loke cafeteria food.

They do validate your parking ticket. so after yout dissapointing meal you can navigate underground road ragers.  Lol

On a positive note, decor was really nice, good internal vibe etc.  place is not for me.

Have fun, steer away from the Fuego. And find your sizzle amigos!"}
{"text":"I found Fuego Del Mar through a local deal. I believe mine was through Amazon but I saw similar offers on Living Social or Groupon. The location can be hard to find by the address. It is just to the left of the escalators leading up to the theaters directly across the street from Seasons 52. I ate lunch there and returned two days later for dinner. The Ahi Tuna Steak at dinner was fabulous. There were some innovative items on the lunch and dinner menus. The entre at lunch as top notch but the beans and rice on the side reminded me, well, let's just say, skip the beans and rice. They weren't a natural addition to the plate in any case. 

As for service, this appears to be a family operation including the teen who seated us and the man behind the bar on both occasions. Service is spotty. If you require something, you may have to ask. If they weren't netting $5 plus tips on an Ahi Tuna Steak while they try to move into the dinner market they could afford outside staff. But that is the consumer's trade-off - $10 or $12 (restaurant probably gets half) for a $30 voucher and $6 toward validated parking (which translated to free underground parking on both my visits)."}
{"text":"I should have known from the beginning it wasn't going to be a good experience.  

I eat out enough to know the customary greeting a server offers is typically a short greeting followed by a drink order.  What I was offered was a question if I had any groupons or other types of discounts.  I did happen to purchase a $10 for $5 here from Yelp she tells me \"I thought we discontinued that, hmmm\".  Not a great way to start.  When my friend asked if it was possible to order happy hour she said in a very snooty way there was no way to mix the coupon and happy hour prices.  Not even if we split the check.  I don't have a problem with that, it was the way she felt she needed to inform us.  She started to walk away while we figured out what we wanted, again still not asking if we wanted anything to drink.  I had to ask if she could get our drink orders.

At this point I knew I didn't want to have a meal here but I didn't want to waste my $5 I had spent on Yelp for this place so I ordered an appetizer to split with my friend.  It was very good but not worth ever visiting again.

Had that been the worst of it this review would be much different.  The remainder of our visit we were ignored for large portions of time and received more attitude each time she did decide to stop by.

It was understaffed and I'm sure this is why she wasn't in the best of moods but that doesn't excuse taking it out on the customers."}
{"text":"First time here. I bought a Groupon and thought it sounded good. It was fantastic. We had the Chili Relleno stuffed with shrimp, scallops and tilapia. We were saying wow all the way through it. It came with two generous side dishes. We chose the green chili and bacon hush puppies. I could have eaten a whole plate of just these things. They were sooooo good. Our second side was the Mac and cheese. Yum!  We also indulged on the Spicy Margaritas with the jalapeño infused tequila. I've had a lot of margaritas and I have to say this was by far the best. I had a half spicy/half regular. I was worried I couldn't handle the whole spice. I loved  the tingly feeling it created in my mouth. Great experience. I actually bought two Groupons for this place and I'm glad I did. Now we have an excuse to go back. Not that we needed that excuse. We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I took two other couples out for dinner.  The drinks were pretty good and the atmosphere was relaxed. The food was very flavorful with a great hint of spice/heat."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. Smooth music, low lights, modern setting. 

The sever had a good attitude. And was sure to check up on us often enough. But not too much as to where it would be annoying. 

But let's be honest. The food is simply mediocre. The Mac and cheese is atrocious. A 49 cent kraft box could have given this Mac and grease a beat down. The vegetables were undercooked and over seasoned. The hush puppies were burned and the coleslaw was drowned in vinegar.  

With that said the pulled pork was tender and well prepared. (According to my DH). I myself ordered the chile relleno and although it was decent I wasn't Impressed. 

So here is my reasoning behind the two stars: the pomegranate mijito itself was delicious!! (That's one star) and the server was very polite and upbeat (there is two)! 
Let's just say I'm gifting that second groupon. Not worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This place was a great lunchtime spot back when it was Fuego Tacos. Now they are trying to reinvent themselves as an upscale dinner spot, somewhat unsuccessfully. The last few times I have been in there, it has been dead. And the service has really fallen off in the last nine months or so, ever since their former manager moved to the Cityscape location. I used to eat here at least twice a month for lunch, and continued to do so because I like the seafood tacos. But things have gotten thoroughly mediocre, to the point where last time was the last time. I've decided not to eat here anymore, and I won't be recommending it anymore, either.

I miss the former manager of Fuego Tacos. His absence has uncovered a variety of problems. The kitchen has been spotty, cooking me the wrong meal on more than one occasion. And the service is spotty too. Sometimes our server catches the kitchen's errors and sometimes s/he doesn't. And service has become slow and indifferent. I have waited fifteen minutes to give my drink order after being seated, even if the place isn't full, on more than one occasion, and once my meal hits my table, I rarely get checked on again.

I do miss the old days at this place. It was nice to eat lunch in a place where service immediately recognized me, brought my favorite drink without my having to ask for it, served me promptly, watched me for refills, and brought my check and parking validation stub without my needing to ask. I was a happy regular at that place, but unfortunately, it no longer exists. The food is still good at Fuego del Mar, but there's not much point to having good food if you don't have the good service to go with it. I'm not sure why management felt the need to mess with a good thing, but I can ponder this as I drive past this restaurant in search of something else. Bye, Fuego Tacos. It was nice knowing you."}
{"text":"Worst service ever they need to change their staff ( Ladies ) if they want to be in this business ,DO NOT BUY ANY KIND OF COUPON FOR THIS RESTAURENT THEY ARE CROOKS ,they will screw you over , The food and menu was very good though I would have been more impressed with a little more oomph from staff. What a shame. I really couldn't imagine returning to Fuego tacos, which is unfortunate, I will never return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Nice cozy atmosphere and fantastic food.  I took my parents here on a Saturday for Mexican seafood.  Del Mar didn't disappoint or I would have heard about it... From my parents lol.  Our server was friendly we were early for our reservation but they didn't make us wait.  We ordered flavored margaritas and mojitos.  It took a coupe tries to get the favor matching what we ordered but no biggie.  We ordered ceviche and a stuffed pepper appetizer.  Both-yummy.  Then the entrees cod, and seafood enchiladas.  My mom said the cod was the best she ever had, perfect.  The enchiladas were great also.  The Mac and cheese side rocks.  Fuego Del Mar, you have my moms seal of approval.  Enough said!"}
{"text":"I work for the airline and the concierge at the Ritz Carlton recommended this place as a happy hour favorite for authentic, hearty, Mexican food and a great atmosphere and I couldn't agree more! To top it off I dine out in almost every city I fly to and service is first thing I notice, the hostess with the mostess, none other than,  Missy was very attentive to me all the while greeting, taking orders, and serving the entire front house, thank you for memorable evening Missy your recommendation to order the Del Mar Chowder was filling and absolutely delicious, I will be back so until next time adiós!!!"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I am writing this review is in response to how horribly the Fuego Del Mar owner (Jeff) responded to the review posted by Bad L.

I have personally been to this place three times --- every visit was a \"meh\". The food is unremarkable, the drinks are weak, the service is spotty, and the pricing is questionable for the quality. I never bothered to write a review, as I was just plain uninspired by my experiences there. 

Today I read the owner's ass-ripping of Bad L.'s review. I was horrified and motivated to respond:

Firstly, I agree with Bad L. in that why on earth would you place a deaf person in the position of being a host?  The host is typically the the front man, and the first point of contact and the first impression of your business that customers are going to have!  

It took Bad L. twenty minutes to become aware of the real reason why he was treated \"so rudely\" by the host that did not greet him or respond to questions. This is unfortunate, but it is understandable and NOT Bad L.'s problem.  The owner is the one that put the host in this position.

The owner said that Bad L. was a \"super bad human\" and \"less than an asshole\" and that Bad L. disrespected this situation, but then the owner doesn't even take the time to spell the host's name correctly (I doubt his name is (Chritopher), along with many other words in his response, which automatically casts a doubt on Jeff's intelligence, temperament and credibility.  

If the owner values Christopher so much, why doesn't he give him a job that is totally suitable for him, where he can succeed unconditionally, in both the eyes of customers as well as in his own experience? Maybe Christopher might feel uncomfortable being a position where customers expect him to greet them and respond to questions when he physically cannot. 

Jeff also suggested that Bad L. was \"inappropriate\" by wondering out loud if this establishment, that is located in a basically abandoned structure that is mostly vacant, with very few merchants, will be in business very long?  That is a totally reasonable question/doubt!.

What was also strange is that Jeff felt the need to point out that Amanda (who gets both positive and negative reviews from customers on Yelp) is his wife of 20 years.  Dude, who cares? Business is business.  Keep it that way.

Jeff also stated that \"most people know\" he owns multiple locations, so should forgive the fact that this particular location is sometimes busy and sometimes slow, so the staff doesn't know how to predict what kind of traffic each day will bring.  ?????  Do you think you're Chili's or something? How is the average customer supposed to know you have multiple locations -- and by they way, that is a totally irrelevant excuse when addressing a customer concern and completely unworthy of typing. 

Lastly, Jeff failed to even address Bad L.'s photo about the 0% off offer that could either be redeemed now or saved for later. What's the excuse for that?

Next time, when faced with a less-than-sterling review, maybe Jeff will take a deep breath and respond without the knee-jerk, insulting, unsubstantiated reaction."}
{"text":"Food was horrible.  Ahi tuna wasn't fresh, had been frozen tasted like fish flavored cardboard.  My wife's mahi veracruz was a few small pieces and over cooked.  Restaurant is in the Esplanade, but it looks on the inside like a cheap cafe in Mexico.
Another displeased customer was venting when I believe the owner yelled from the second floor balcony \"get the f....out of my restaurant\".  

I'd find somewhere else to eat"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Fuego Del Mar on a Monday evening. We had a groupon for Fuego Tacos worth $10 off, and the manager honored the groupon and gave us $30 off our meal to make up for the difference in cost on the menu. 

The atmosphere was calm. Low lighting, a small space, and not busy the night we went. The food was very fresh. I got the Enchiladas Del Mar, which were excellent. The sauce did not overwhelm the flavors of the seafood. I also got the pineapple cole slaw which was a little bland but also had some spice to it, and the hush puppies which were brilliant. My boyfriend got the Ahi Tune Steak, which we both loved. Again, the sauce was minimal so it allowed the flavor of the fish to shine. He also got the hush puppies and chipotle mac & cheese, which is basic but has some spice and bacon in it to liven it up.

It was a bit expensive, especially since we thought we were going to eat a cheap taco dinner, but it turned out good. The staff was kind and accommodating. Overall, I would recommend this for 2-3 people (too small for large groups)."}
{"text":"\"No fried food!\" I said to myself to balance a lack of exercise. This resolve quickly crumbled once I began to sample the Del Mar Empanadas at Fuego Del Mar. 

I've eaten my fair share of empanadas in my lifetime. These are a staple in any South American kitchen. (My Mom makes *amazing* empanadas.) They can be baked or fried. Fried ones are generally, in my opinion, the better variety.

At Del Mar the empanadas are stuffed with crab meat, chorizo, goat cheese (yes!)  and white corn. If that wasn't enough goodness, they are topped with a tomatillo verde sauce. I had agreed to \"just try\" the empanada as I wasn't prepared to sabotage myself.

Pfft! The empanadas are heavenly. I don't know quite how they time the cooking, but the chef managed to present a delightful culinary treat without a hint of grease. They were fried ... but there wasn't any goop. (For lack of a better word.) Seriously good stuff.

My dining companion and I had arrived at Fuego Del Mar after using Yelp. There was a $5 for $10 deal. What we missed in reading carefully, is that the menu displayed on the mobile app is for lunch pricing.  (Whoops!) Additionally, I was a bit bummed as I wasn't ravenous and the Happy Hour menu (which is available \"all day\") may not be combined with any other offers. At that point we almost decided to sit separately at the bar after speaking with the server. (There seemed to be some confusion that the Yelp offer is still online.)

I'd checkout downstairs seating. Upstairs offers a beautiful view of the bar. However, service turn around can be limited. That being said, upstairs dining, when seated by the railing offers a stunning view of the bar. (We did not realize that however, as we were seated against the wall.) 

This is a really cute place that has a hip bar ambiance. The food was unbelievable."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great. We started with the empanadas and coconut shrimp which were both very tasty. For the entrees we had the seafood relleno and the peascado espanola we both had the Mac and cheese and hush puppies for our sides. The relleno and hush puppies were awesome. My only negative is that my pescado lwas a little bland and the Mac and cheese definitely needed salt but after I added some salt it was great. However, I would like to see them have some sides that are a little more Latin like plantains or black beans etc.

The service was also very good. The hostess sat us right away and was friendly and our server was attentive."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Had appetizers, they weren't that great.

Kind of small place."}
