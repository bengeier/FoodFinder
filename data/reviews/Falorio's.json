{"text":"Awesome pizza place near West Mifflin. Was at Kennywood for the weekend and was looking for a local place to get a pie. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Pizza and breadsticks were hot and delicious. Great price too. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Visiting family and we flew up from
Austin, Tx,  I must say that the extra large pepperoni, mushroom and onion was one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  And the fried Zucchini was THE BOMB!  So fresh and tasty and the price is right on the money.  The entire family loved it."}
{"text":"With kind & courteous customer service, hand carved & ground meats, and an amazing ranch dressing Falorio's is a much needed change of place from some of the other local shops. I highly suggest a steak salad or the Sicilian pizza. This shop pays homage to many of the Pittsburgh staples."}
