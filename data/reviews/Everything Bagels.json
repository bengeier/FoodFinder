{"text":"Found you today!  Outstanding, it's about time we had a good bagel in central phoenix."}
{"text":"Loved the garlic bagels! Service was great! What can I say...I will be going back"}
{"text":"i'm from new york originally, even though i was in california longer. but when you originate from NY, you can't shake it. like a lot of new yorkers, i like to think i know what a good bagel is all about. in los angeles, Sam's Bagel in Larchmont was pretty decent...Canter's, meh. but in PHOENIX, jack?! good effing luck finding a heavenly dough ro.  over the years i think i've been to most of the \"Best Bagel in Phoenix\" places...mainly that small-*ss place around the Hayden/Indian Bend area, and Chompie's. none have been good and ARE YOU SERIOUS!, Einsteins...i won't even speak about that chain because that's like saying you can get a good burger at McDonald's. Einsteins. EINSTEINS!!! blech.  so anyway we hit Everything Bagels today and i gotta say: pretty amazingly GOOD. this review is for the bagels only. the only thing i'd buy at a bagel store is bagel and/or cream cheese. (they make their own cream cheese here. points) smaller than a typical NY bagel, but so what? portion size is healthier; cool. bagels are perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, with a perfect ratio of toppings. at chompie's for example, the bagel exteriors are WAY too tough. at Everything, the consistency is perfect.  parking looks intimidating from the street (2 spaces in front), but they've plenty of spaces in the back, jack; so don't be fooled.  other reviews roast the side dishes here: white fish, sandwich, etc etc. don't order a salad at a pizza place; don't order a damn sandwich at a bagel place! it ain't Burger King & you can't have it your way. and in MOST big cities, popular places run out of stock before 11, Noon or 1, depending on the cuisine. in L.A., if you don't get to Amandine on the westside by 11 a.m., you don't get no cheese bread because they only make like 12 a day. yes the selection was slim (after the morning rush), but they still had a few left of most flavors and that's good enough for me. (they mentioned they do catering too, so i'd imagine if we had a big party, that would be the only way to go; not going to the counter on a Sat or Sun and expecting 3 dozen bagels to be avail.)  for the bagels and cream cheese: 5 stars. when we went, a helpful manager was staffing the counter, so our customer service experience was great. hopefully the managers here train the part-timers to be educated about the product and how to handle customer flow so the good experience is consistent.  we will be back...hopefully the experience is equally satisfying."}
{"text":"Awful customer service.  Employee I ordered from could not have been more disinterested and rude.  Bagels were supposed to be toasted and were soggy.  When order was ready my bag was just slammed on the counter and the employee walked away.  Was hoping for a new place in my neighborhood to frequent but will never be back after the way I was treated here."}
{"text":"The bagels are great but the service is not. Everyone is very nice, but they often get my order wrong. If you can get past that, the bagels are delicious."}
{"text":"I've been going to Everything Bagels for about a year since I moved into the area. If you look back around that time you'll see all kinds of 4 and 5 star reviews. Totally appropriate for just a short year ago. However, Everything Bagels has been going down hill quickly. The service has just been awful. The employees are rude and act like making a bagel is somehow distracting them from something else. They are also lazy and cannot wait the full 20 seconds it would take to toast a bagel. My toasted bagel today was cold. It wasn't even toasted for long enough to heat up the bagel. I've been going nearly once a week for the past year, but I am done."}
{"text":"Only giving it one star because wasn't  happy with the way they made my breakfast burrito wasn't worth the money they were charging. I got a egg and cheese burrito which I get all the time depending on what place I go. They cooked my eggs in the microwave which I did not like at all but I didn't say anything  because it didn't look like they would do it any other way. Also wasn't  rolled up to its best to keep the eggs from falling out. But I would go back there to try there bagels. looks like that's what they're known for I just wouldn't ever get the breakfast burrito there ever again."}
{"text":"I can't take your word , they never have beagles its 1050 am on a Sunday ... Poor business management  strike 3 your out"}
{"text":"It's nice that drove all the way here at 7:30 in the morning and no one is home. CLOSED!  Hours say open at 6:00"}
{"text":"We live across the 51 from 16st & Bethany Home road which has undergone a revitalization in the last several years that has added a lot to the neighborhood. When we saw this place open a couple of weeks ago, we were excited to see a bagel shop other than the usual caned corporate choices.    the bagels were unbelievably good and the place was clean, but open for a couple of weeks doesn't allow much time to dirty a place up plus the square footage is no bigger than a Dutch Brothers. the pricing was a surprise as well. I was expecting to pay a boutique price on the bagels but they were in line with the chains.   The only thing that bothered me was the friendliness of the staff.  The guy behind the counter seemed a little too disinterested. I don't expect the guy to break into song but the place just opened and a little hospitality might go a long way in getting people to come back."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed the Pesto Florentine Breakfast bagel this morning and it was amazing! So fresh and flavorful. A great sandwich at a great price and the staff is very accommodating and kind. I will definitely be back with my boyfriend sometime."}
{"text":"The bagels are Rock Star good.    Get the everything bagel with bacon/egg/cheese. and dont blame me for getting hooked!!  Ha Ha..   Josh and staff do their best I never had a problem!      BillyRay"}
{"text":"Clean place and friendly staff and the bagels are fantastic! The bacon they have is amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to pick up a tasty bagel sandwich.  I've gotten the Baja multiple times-- they give a good helping of avocado on it. Slightly on the pricey side (about $5 I think for the sandwich, a tad pricey at first glance), but it's really filling so I usually save the other half for lunch.  Also impressed with the coffee-- they carry Peet's Coffee and Godiva. You don't see that often.  What would make it 5? Expand your service hours so I can enjoy you after 11 am, please!"}
{"text":"Sad bagel.   You have all the potential to be my best friend. We are not best friends though because your never there when I need you, you are inconsistent in your advice and you take more then you give. I just, as a friend, do not feel like you really care.   The first few times I visited this place was great! Lots of accoutrements. The New Yorker was delicious! Cream cheese, tomato, onion, lox, capers all piled high on a fresh egg bagel! Yes please! Where do I sign!!!   Now, I'm not going to state credentials on being a master of bagels or an aficionado.   I will say that this place feels overpriced for what you are getting. I am speaking of quality of ingredients and care of composition not portion sizes.   Sometimes the bagels are stale, sometimes they are cut wrong and sometimes they are toasted wrong. Sometimes the capers are fresh, some times the lox is fresh. All this being said the opposite of all of those things are also \"sometimes\" true.   Sometimes I get that little thin slice, which is supposed to be the top half but it's not... I dislike that thing. The employees should pay more attention. If it comes out like that how about cutting another?   They stopped making egg bagels. Really that was the best part, the reason for going.   In closing, everything bagel doesn't have everything nor do they everything well all of the time. However, they do tell you everything you want to hear and then break your heart.   We had a good run. See you around kid.  P.s. Selling day old bagels is a great idea, but incase you didn't know day old bagels don't have mold on them. Good luck!   The Sarcastic Truth Villain."}
{"text":"Gross bagel shop! Will never go back. Stopped in to Everything Bagels for the first time because a friend said it was good. Waited 5 minutes to be served and was served by someone that works in the sandwich shop next door. Shop employee was outside emptying garbage. Came back in and never washed her hands. GROSS! Got a ton of cream cheese on my bagel and saw that it had alot of the crusted, greenish/clear color that forms on the top overnight. Shop employee on cell phone the entire time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend (who is from Long Island) was in desperate need of a bagel. Being from NY, he disapproves of most, if not all, bagels made outside of the northeast. So off we set, searching for the best alternative to a true New York bagel. Everything Bagels is certainly a better option than anything else we've found. My boyfriend's critique was that the shell was \"adequately chewy\", the inside was \"decently soft\" and the shmear was good but a \"little chalky\". Travis rating = 4 for Phoenix. I, on the other hand, think bagels are bagels. So I give it a 5 for giving me a bagel."}
{"text":"This is a bagel shop and I go a few times a month to buy my bagels as they are the best I've found in Phoenix in my 4 years living here. I wasnt looking for a restaurant as some seem to be disappointed that this doesn't one. So why would you expect it to perform like one. It is a take out bagel shop. You want specialty coffees go to Starbucks or Einsteins. I bring all my friends and family here for bagels. We all love it. I'm glad I have a place to go that isn't another second rate Mexican place for a change. I would recommend these bagels!"}
{"text":"We Live really close to this bagel shop and it is the only one in the area so we go here once or twice a month but it is consistently bad. I'm not sure why we continue to go except that it's walkable from our house. The bagels are pretty good actually but the sandwiches are pretty lackluster and they run out of a lot of things it seems. The restaurant itself is also dirty (tables/ floor & bathroom).  This place is solid if you're looking for a bagel and cream cheese or something really simple but the sandwiches arent good"}
{"text":"9:00 am, only a few bagel choices available.  My bagel and my wife's look and taste like leftovers from yesterday.  My daughter's seems to be more fresh.  The tables outside look like they may have never been cleaned...ever.  As I sit here writing this I wonder if anyone would ever even touch the salt and pepper, much less use them."}
{"text":"Updating review:   It's 640 and the store open at six. I just went in, the lights are off, the door was locked, and no bagel for me. The manager had nothing but excuses. Not apologies. Excuses. I left my house early and planned to surprise my colleagues with bagels and coffee for the first day of school. What a letdown. :(    Old review:  For the most part, the bagels are good, but this place is so inconsistent, it's hard to give it more than three stars. Morning seems to be prime time at most stores that sell baked goods. That doesn't seem to be the case here. I have gone on several Saturday mornings (sometimes I am the first customer), and they do not have most items available. That being said, we have had enough decent experiences - and, frankly, there aren't many bagel places in the area, so we keep going back. I hope they are successful and stick around because I like having a bagel option close to home."}
{"text":"Very good bagels and the cream cheese is creamy and tasty.  I frequently buys bagels for the office and they are always a hit."}
{"text":"After the Scottsdale location decided that smoothies sold better than bagels I feared that this place would switch over as well. Luckily bagels must do well in North Central Phoenix, so it has remained open. The bagels here are made in the traditional manner of being boiled and this allows them to have the correct taste of having a light crust with chewy interior. They are far better than anything you can find at Einstein's or the grocery store. For my money, Everything Bagels and Chompie's make the only decent bagel in Phoenix, but the nearest Chompie's is all the way at PV Mall.  Also, Everything Bagels has my favorite salt bagels plus a large selection of other types.   If you're in the mood for a bagel, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Second time here. Had a terrible experience the first time but I gave it another chance and I was wrong. The kid behind the counter got my order wrong and had to redo the lox bagel. I asked for a latte but he said they were out of milk. So I ordered a medium coffee and he used a soup ladle to get it out of the coffee maker behind the counter. Then I couldn't find any cream and the older gentleman from the back said they were out and asked if I wanted milk instead, which I was told they were out of.  Food was horrible. The bagel tasted stale, the salmon did not look good. The coffee was not fresh. It was so bad I took one bite of my stale bagel and tossed it in the trash with the coffee. Wasted my money and will never go back there. I do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Nice little bagel shop, everything you would expect. Great end-of-the-day specials on grab and bagel bags. Service was good."}
{"text":"I pop in for a bagel probably 2-3 times a month and the staff is very friendly and fast.  They remember you and smile.  The bagels are way better than Einstein's."}
{"text":"I have visited Everything Bagels from the first week they opened.  I've been there about 4 times, and I'm ready to give up.  They always fall a little short.  They are not particularly friendly, they charge a lot more for some of the bagels (cinnamon, for example) with little notice, and they run out of items early (no worries, if you wait 15 minutes they will produce them for you).  I think it's adequate, if you have no other choices, but not the superior experience I was hoping for from a small operation."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars! The employee was finishing up with the one other customer when we walked in. She proceeded to take a cell phone call and walk into the back. Just before giving up ( and boy do I wish we had!) an employee taking out trash spotted us and took our order. I ordered iced tea only to discover all 3 types were empty. There were no napkins, and the cup of cream cheese on the bagel tasted rancid. Threw bagels in trash and went to Luci's across the street. Recommend you do the same!"}
{"text":"Looking for breakfast sandwich or burrito, saw this and thought I'd try it! Well, sometimes trying something new doesn't work out. So, thought I'd write a review to save you the trouble of going there.  My egg/cheese/turkey sausage sandwich was barely warm, really no flavor. Biggest dissappointment was that the bagel wasn't even good. It wasn't even chewy or fresh. I've had better bagels from the grocery store.   The clincher *** I ordered a coffee. Filled my cup with regular coffee and it was warmish, sort of. Dumped it out and filled cup with decaf. It was bordering on cold. I let the worker know the coffee was cold to which he replied 'do you want me to microwave it for you?' LOL Really? I said, \"No thanks that's not good; are you going to make some more?\" He said, \"No, we closed at 1p.\" Well, I didn't even realize at the time, but it was only 1230p! When he said that, I thought it must be after 1p and they were going to lock the door behind me. But no!! It was barely 1230p! This is a pet peeve of mine. Places have hours. They are either going to be open during those hours or not! That's like saying- 'I already put the cream cheese in the fridge and cleaned the containers, so, no cream cheese.'   So, I sat outside with my luke warm tasteless sandwich on my stale bagel with a cup of water. While out there I noticed that one of the 3 light fixtures was completely broken/missing and another was in disrepair. What a shame. From the street, this building looks cool/googie-ish! But taking a closer look was dissappointing to say the least.   Well, they can't all be winners. This one is definitely a don't bother! Honestly, I've had many a breakfast bagel sandwich at various Einsteins and the bagels are always fresh and the sandwich is always hot and flavorful. Guess it's back to Einsteins."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. It's not the worst I've had, but it's no Chompies or Hot Bagels, which I think are super yummy & very comparable to NY style bagels. I've visited here twice, so I've given it a fair chance. Twice, the cinnamon raisin bagels I don't think had one raisin in them & the cream cheese is really creamy, it's hard to describe, but I haven't ever seen such creamy cream cheese, it's not to my liking, it's also quite flavorless as well. The 1st time I thought maybe it was just an off day for them, but it was the same the next time. I might return if I'm dying for a bagel & not able to hit my 2 favorites shops mentioned above, but it won't be my 1st go to."}
{"text":"Ok so as a true NYer, I have to give my honest opinion here.  I have been here a few times and keep giving them more chances, but I've decided its not really worth it.   The store opens at 6am.  I arrive at 638 am today and the only bagels that are made are plain and sesame.  They have about 20 different bagel options listed on the baskets and on the menu on the wall - but there are only 2 options at 638 in the morning.  I specifically ask for a SOFT bagel as my bagel last week was hard.  He squeezes one, throws it back in the basket and takes another.  So obviously too hard for me - but good enough for someone else?  Bagels are bland, cream cheese is bland, staff is bland, bad lighting in the store, nothing super interesting here.  Why would I even give them 2 stars?  Because its still better than Einsteins or Bruggers!"}
{"text":"I've been here a half dozen times but I've never had a problem with the service.  Overall your typical bagel shop.  It's attached to Capriotti's with an opening between the two stores.  The bagels are a bit smaller in diameter but they are thick for their size.  You don't have to worry about getting a scrawny end of batch bagel that is an inch thick on one side and paper thin on another (looking at you, Paradise Cafe).  You also get more of the chewiness of the bagel.  The place could probably stand to add a few more cheeses to the mix, preferably a chive option.  I've really only tried their regular bagels and the sausage/egg/cheese breakfast bagel (see enclosed pic).  The pork could have used more flavor; I'm not sure the sandwich really stands up on it's own.  Since it's rare I order things like this my review is mostly for the regular bagels.  I go there at odd times so no problems waiting in line, ordering, or parking.    Quick Tip:  The bagel part of the shop closes at 11 AM and you can buy \"end of day bagels\" from a rack in Capriotti's.  Stop by at 11:30 AM and you can get a half-dozen bagels for $2.50 and they aren't nearly as old as other end of day bagel shops."}
{"text":"Super friendly, chatty (if you want them to be) people.  The bagels were made-that-day-fresh and the spicy cream cheese was great."}
{"text":"Overall I'm just not impressed. I wasn't greeted when I walked in and both employees just stared at me with a blank expression until I started talking.  I had an everything bagel that was just okay, a little salty for my taste and the veggie cream cheese was a bit overwhelming. But I guess that's because they charge 2.05$ to add cream cheese to a 1.20$ bagel?! Seems a little steep in my opinion.  Their bagels are definitely better then einstiens but I wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Good decor, love the location. Being jewish, I love a good bagel and shmear ;) I was bummed they were out of everything bagels when I arrived at 11 am on a Saturday, only to have fresh ones made right after I got my order! Darn! Decent prices, and will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice and both times they've closed early so I can't order a bagel for lunch. When your establishment says you are open until 11 ... STAY OPEN UNTIL 11. Looks like your employees have a problem with timing because other customers have complained in the comments below."}
{"text":"No matter how fresh the bagels or helpful the service when one looks back to the prep-area and sees a filthy white backdoor that hasn't been cleaned in forever, it grosses you out. Restaurant cleanliness is an issue at this busy morning bagel shop.  Send in a cleaning crew and I might come back..."}
{"text":"Sadly, I didn't get to experience the food. I ordered via Postmates from their advertised menu some breakfast sandwiches and wraps.  The postmates driver called us and said they didn't have anything we ordered. We ordered bagel sandwiches!  The place is called Everything Bagels!  So we cancelled and asked Postmates to remove them from their listings."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bagel to go on my way home from the new Uptown Phoenix farmer's market. I ordered the New Yorker (bagel with cream cheese, lox, tomato, onion and capers) on a pumpernickel bagel, a cappuccino and 1/4 lb of the whitefish salad. I did enjoy the bagel - it's not as good as NY Bagel and Bialy - but better than most of what passes for bagels here. The whitefish was about as boring as it could possibly be. There wasn't anything specifically bad or wrong about it - but it was, well, boring. As for the cappuccino, I was so unimpressed I'll just check out the regular coffee from now on. I will be back - these are the best bagels close to home, and it's very rare I am in the mood to drive 30 minutes each way to get the better version - so, yes. I will be a repeat customer. But I'm thinking I'll just stick with the bagels."}
{"text":"I'm convinced that Everything Bagels officially has the best bagels and coffee (Peets) in the city! Welcome to the neighborhood! We will be back! Alot!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time this morning, found this place by asking the yelp gods for some new breakfast spots. Conveniently this is right down the street from me. I had an egg, cheese and bacon sandwich on a garlic bagel that was toasted, it was delicious. I was worried that it would be skimpy but I was proved wrong. I will definitely be back to try some more of their bagels, there are many flavors to try! Plus you can't go wrong with China Mist tea!"}
{"text":"Solid bagel place. Friendly staff. Fast and affordable. I was between delieveries. I enjoyed a beautifully toasted begal with lox and cream cheese. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Like many people here in Arizona and from NY, I've been on the search for a great bagel. I thought I had found something here, but I seem to get inconsistent bagels.  My first time I had a sesame bagel with egg and that was great. But this weekend, I had an everything with cream cheese and a plain with egg salad. The everything was not too bad but the plain, oh the plain, I can't even say it was a bagel!!! The plain bagel needs to be your best bagel!    I was pleased with the customer service, though there was only one guy working with basically no bagels in the bins. I rate this place a 3, but 2 stars for the bagel."}
{"text":"So I should begin this post by saying that I LOVE Bagels! I saw this place & the connected sandwich shop next door to it open recently. I recognized the name of the sandwich shop, Capriotti's, because there is one up in north Scottsdale. I've never eaten there, but have driven by it numerous times. This was my first clue that the new bagel shop was probably locally owned & operated. I always prefer to spend my money at those types of places when possible. When you pull up you notice there is very little parking in the front.There is however ample parking behind the building. If you are familiar with his area, you know parking is a bit limited everywhere. I walked in the front door and was hit by a soft sweet aroma. There were large coffee carafes filled with \"Peet's Coffee & Tea\" neatly lined up along the wall. The place was well lit, organized, and seemed very clean. I walked up to the counter and was greeted by a friendly man. As expected, there was a large selection of bagels to choose from at the counter. I couldn't pick just one so I decided to go with half a dozen. They had some unique bagels on their menu such as tropical & sourdough. The man kindly offered me an extra container of cream cheese & I decided to try the light veggie one. I brought the bagels home and cut into an asiago one. I notice right away that the bagels were big & thick! They looked homemade & not like the usual generic, mass produced ones you get from Buerger's or Einstein Bros. The inside was so moist. It was almost doughy, but not underdone by any means. Impressive! I lightly toasted it and put the light plain cream cheese on it. The cream cheese was delicious. It doesn't taste like it's the light version either. If the light version is this good I wonder how good the regular cream cheese is?!? Out of curiosity I try a taste of the veggie cream cheese on its own. It's also delicious! Again, you can tell this was homemade and not made in bulk somewhere & sent out. A good balance of flavors! This is my new favorite bagel shop. I cannot wait to try the rest of the bagels I bought. Next time I want to try some of their coffee & or bagel breakfast sandwichs. There will definitely be a next time. This is such a great addition to the CenPho neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I went in for a fresh bagel with cream cheese before work (6:30 a.m.ish) and was very surprised to see the majority of the bagel bins empty, including the typical favorites (plain, cinnamon raisin, etc.) I thought because it was early, maybe they just hadn't had a chance to bring the bagels out - so I asked the gentleman at the counter, \"Are these all the bagels you have?\" With little more than a glance in my direction, he said, \"yeah,\" and kept walking. Previous visits here have been decent - but no bagels and no customer service - not the best way to start the day."}
{"text":"First of just want to say AMAZING BAGELS!!   Had an egg cheese and bacon with jalapeño cream cheese! Gotta say LOVE the fried eggs!! Customer service is great!! Walked in and the young man and gal had a great smile on, don't see that very often! It's great walking in and having that welcomed feeling!  Keep up the GREAT work guys!"}
{"text":"It's no surprise that the businesses around this place have lines & full parking lots, and this place has the buzz of zero interest.  I woke up with a craving for a fresh bagel this morning, and decided to walk over to Everything Bagels.   I walked in at 7:20 to a place with no sign of life. The display case was nearly empty, and there were very few bagels in baskets. I thought maybe they were closed. I was about to leave when an older man stepped out of the back. I asked if they were open, to which he gruffly responded, \"yes, the door was open, wasn't it\"? I was taken off guard by his rudeness, and apologized, and simply told him that it didn't seem like they were open yet. He said, \"you're fine\", as if I was the rude dumb-ass. He proceeded to lecture me on the fact that he was the only one there, and that he had many things he had to do all by himself. Here's some free advice dude --- it takes 2 seconds to make a card that says, \"In back. I'll be with you in a moment\".   At this point, all I want to do is order something, and get the hell out of there. THEN, he asks me if I want a drink. I ask him how the iced coffee is served, to which he patronizingly says, \"well, I give you a cup of ice, and you can poor the medium or dark roast over it\". When I decline, he says, \"do you mind telling me why you dont' like coffee over ice\"?.  More free advice - - It's stinking hot here, and you have to be totally clueless not to offer your customers a descent iced coffee during a Phoenix summer.  Since he asked me why I don't like they way they serve it, I tell him that I don't like pouring hot coffee over ice because it just melts the ice cubes, and makes the drink watery. ---- DUH!  I then muster all the politeness I have to ask him if he has every had toddy coffee. I mention that it's smooth, delicious & easy to make.  He goes on this diatribe about all the water that is required to make a toddy coffee taste good. I make toddy coffee at home all the time, and he clearly didn't know what the heck he was talking about. It takes time, but not a huge amount of water. HUGE SURPRISE --- When I asked him if he had ever had toddy coffee, he said he had not. The take-away from this is that hot coffee over ice is bad. However you get your hands on cold brew is up to you, but a cold brew over ice is a key component to iced coffee.   Summary: Customer service is key. If you don't have it, then you don't have my business."}
{"text":"Waited ten fucking minutes and no one acknowledged us.  And they were out of everything bagels, which is weird, considering their goddamned name.  How the fuck can a place called Everything Bagels be out of everything bagels?"}
{"text":"I was in need of a delicious meal to help me recover from Oktoberfest @tempe town lake.  A bagel sandwich seemed ideal so I searched yelp for everything bagels (cause I love everything bagels) and found this place.  Enthused and hazy from many beers the prior evening around noon I got the courage to leave my bed and make the journey to everything bagels.  I got their lox bagel sandwich on pumpernickel bread (The New Yorker) and iced americano and fresh squeezed orange juice.  Everything was great the lox was perfect the bagel was like a bagel should be not like that Einstein's BS, New York style FANTASTIC. The coffee was also good in fact I was going to give 4 stars but that rude woman who gave them 1 star because they don't have a cold brewed coffee is crazy, yes cold brewed coffee is delicious but coffee over ice is not terrible it was fine.  So to help boost their star rating they deserve I give 5 stars.  I will def be back again to try the other egg breakfast sandwiches, one more thing I got a Hawaiian bagel to go cause it sounded intriguing and it didn't let down it was like a kings Hawaiian roll in delicious bagel form!!!"}
{"text":"Great non-chain place to grab a bagel. Great ice tea choices also. Bagels were better than the national chain stuff."}
{"text":"I asked for lightly toasted, it was burned. Coffee is more tea (of how weak it is) than coffee. Will give them a second chance, but have no high hopes for it."}
{"text":"Great little hole-in-the wall bagel shop. Nice, chewy New York style bagels. A few tasty sandwich options. I had the Baja bagel which featured egg, cheddar cheese, avocado and jalapeño cream cheese. Just a little heat. Very nice!  Seating is a few outdoor tables, which was nice in December Arizona weather. I imagine they would be less desirable in the summer heat."}
{"text":"Disgusting bland flavorless instant eggs.  Staff not capable of following a simple dietary request of no  cheese either. Explains why there no other customers at 830 in the morning."}
{"text":"Best bagels we have had in a long time. Ours were fresh baked straight out of the oven right when we walked in."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming, slim selection of bagels, also were out of a lot type of bagels. Had about 1lb of cream cheese on my bagel too.  It was a ghost town there at 8am on a Sunday, and I quickly realized why."}
{"text":"This place is always out of something. Ordered a bacon, egg and cheese bagel. They were out of bacon and would take 30 mins to make, cheese would take another 15 to cut. The Ice Tea was all out and would also be 20 mins to brew. If you have 2 hours for breakfast this is the place for you."}
{"text":"It should go without saying, but their everything bagels are the best thing here! In my opinion. My wife loves the lox and cream cheese, and some chocolate coffee thing as well. I am plan black coffee, butter or plain cream cheese on my bagel type. But seriously, it's the everything bagels that keep us coming back, not sure what it is about them that are so different from other bagel shops."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped off this morning, absolutely great experience, the bagels are the best  I have had since leaving New York, and staff here are very nice. The bagels here are bigger and better tasting than some of the popular AZ delis I will not name. These are real bagels, cooked the right way. I also had the Whitefish salad which was so good, as was the cream cheese and coffee, we bought more bagels, cream cheese and Whitefish salad to take home. We plan on going back soon."}
{"text":"Great service, bagels are awesome. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Five star bagel experience. Kettle-boiled and baked leave them crisp on the outside and soft inside. Been here several times and never had anything less. Cream cheese are amazing as well.  LOVE the everything bagel with Lox, Capers and Red Onion. Also had a great bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on a jalapeño cheese bagel. Both outstanding and hubby and I mused at the price: $8 breakfast for two, unheard of in Phx. Seriously the best bagel this NYer has had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Would be fine if they stayed oped during their advertised hours.  I stopped by to get a bagel,  saw they were already closed,  went to dunkin and STILL made it back to my house before 11.  This isn't the first time they have closed early."}
{"text":"They still cannot make hot coffee.  You can't brew a container of coffee and then sell it 4 hours later and expect it to be hot.    I guess I will just order bagels.  Bagels are good, and fresh!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because it's within close proximity to my daughter's preschool. Not impressed. First, their system for taking orders makes no sense. I had to tell the person in charge of cutting the bagels what I wanted, then repeat my entire order to a man not five feet away so he could punch it into the POS system.  Second, the gentleman behind the counter was incredibly rude. I ordered a cold-brewed coffee, but noticed that the one carafe marked \"iced coffee\" was empty. When I informed the employee behind the counter, he responded that he had prepared two carafes of cold brew, then directed me to a carafe filled with boiling hot coffee.  Third, the baskets in which they serve the bagels don't fit their trays, so when my wife grabbed her tray, one of our bagels slid right off onto the floor. They remade the bagel for free, but the gentleman behind the counter was a jerk about it.  I'm not sure what compels people to come here. Their \"New Yorker\" uses the same toppings as Einstein Bros., to the one, with no discernible increase in quality. I can easily buy red onions, capers, and lox and prepare the dish at home.  We had actually planned on taking some bagels to go, but the service was so poor that I didn't want to reward them with any more of my money.  I basically had the exact same experience as Todd C. and wished that I had read his review before coming --mediocre food and abysmal customer service. As another reviewer noted, I, too, was not greeted when I walked through the door. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place and wow, SO GOOD.   The hours are a bit unconventional but I was able to catch them while they were open.   I got the pesto florentine on a spinach and cheese bagel. Delicious. Comes with egg, spinach, mushrooms and pesto. Everything was super fresh.  I'm going to try a new bagel every time I come back to this place. I'm sure I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Disappointing!  I stopped in to grab some bagels and whitefish to bring home to the family. They were out of nearly every kind of bagel so my choices were limited to 3 non-premium flavors.   When I got home and opened the bag I discovered the kicker: I ordered and paid for a  1/2 pound of whitefish but only received ¼ pound.   I tried calling the number listed here in yelp twice without an answer.   I should have read the reviews and I would have avoided this establishment. Read the reviews. I wish I had.   Their location is conveniently located on 16th Street just north of Bethany Home Rd. Staff wasn't overly friendly but they weren't rude either."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, I have been searching Phoenix for almost 60 years looking for authenticity.  I found it in Everything Bagels.  They are so far better than anything pathetic Phoenix can offer including Chompie's \"white bread fake bagels\".    I buy the Everyday Bagels two dozen at a time and freeze them.  New York is only as far away as my freezer.    Five stars!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for some bagels to go. No problems with the service and the bagels were great - NY style (boiled then baked). They weren't quite as good as Chompies IMHO but way better than Einstein Bros. I'd like it if they would add some vegan toppings like a dairy-free margarine though."}
{"text":"Good bagels and friendly staff. They're bagels are close to new york bagels. I'm glad I found this place. Reasonably priced and just really good."}
{"text":"Really good home made bagels!! Tasted just like the one's from New York. Great service and very friendly staff! The scallion cream cheese is delicious!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Long line, slow service. Coffee was cold - not fresh. Like many other reviewers... I am  from NY, the bagel was just okay. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Not quite sure how this place has four stars, but I know it isn't for their customer service or selection of bagels.  Been there 3 times and never greeted with a \"hello\" but rather, \"what do you want\"?  Also, I have never seen more than 4 or 5 varieties of bagels.  Here is a novel idea as well....try not to get onions in your blueberry bagels....it kinda ruins it.  Good coffee though....so you get two stars."}
{"text":"Wife likes it.  Bagels OK.  Service terrible.  Took 15 minutes to get 3 bagels.  Wife can go there but I won't be back.  Way too much competition for my $$ in this part of town for such lousy service."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few weeks now. What a pleasure to have a good bagel in AZ. Crispy outside and soft inside which is how they should be.  Only way to do that is boil then bake. I drive 15+ miles just for these bagels.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"I think I arrived opening day.  They were still getting their bearings.  But all I had to do was bite into the bagel breakfast sandwich to forgive all indiscretions.  I had the one with spinach, mushrooms, cheese and pesto.  Very original and extremely tasty!  Staff was friendly and love that its a unique local place.  Very small space other than the seating outside.  Give it a try and bring your friends!  These types of great places need our support to keep our neighborhood special.  Another great thing about this place is that they took a sad old building, refurbished it and made it look great.  Gentrifying the neighborhood instead of building new (like a certain Z'Tejas is doing) is much more helpful at retaining the charm of the area."}
{"text":"I live near Everything Bagels but just stopped for the first time this morning. The best bagel I've ever had! I ordered an Everything, toasted, to go. Perfect lseasonings and crunch to the outside but light and heavenly inside. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The Location:  The Skinny: Would I got back here again? Probably Not. Inexperienced staff but may be due to lack of management training which does not equal great customer service.  The Restaurant: The store itself was clean and picked up. Counter service at the front and drink station to the left after you walk in What was nice: The bagels seemed fresh  What I did not like: The lack of knowledge on the staffs part. They have a variety of coffees on their menu but asking for a cafe latte for my wife, I was given a cup and that was it. There was no \"making\" the latte. I know that lattes in itself contain milk and asking of them for it as it was not there, they showed me all they had was a gallon. Afterwards they disappeared in the back and then chose to ignore me as I stood there for a few minutes.  I understand this is not a coffee shop but if the complete left side of your menu points out the coffee, I would assume they would know how to make half the items they have posted and choose not to ignore you as you are staring right at them.  Was very dissappointed in the service and the lack of customer service from the staff.  Should you go: I would say no. There are other breakfast places around with better service. Plus they do price gouge on certain items. For approximately 1.5 cups of Orange Juice, they charge $3.75!  My Kids Review: It was a bagel and tasted okay"}
{"text":"Great bagel shop and affordable prices. I had breakfast here this morning and got the Pesto Egg Sandwich on Asiago Cheese Bagel paired with a cup of Godiva Coffee with Hazelnut. They have flavored creamers and Stevia here which is a big plus for me. Customer service was prompt and service was fast."}
{"text":"Buyer beware:  The prices here are not always as they appear.  The published price list differs from the actual price they charge you.  For instance a 1/2 pound of cream cheese is listed at 2.95, but the actually charge you 3.25.  If you say something to them about this their response is nothing they can do about it as they have increased their prices but not their price list.  So check your pricing, but in all reality nothing is going to be done anyway.  I guess I should have stuck to my gut and boycotted this place and listened to my previous review.  Go to Einstein's instead. Closest one is on Camelback.    Previous Review:  I have never had good luck with this bagel store.  Either VERY slow service, out of product, or today they decided to open an hour late at 8:00 instead of 7:00.  Of course on the day I am in a rush they are closed.    On top of all this they are overpriced    I guess this was the nail in the coffin and I will no longer go here anymore."}
{"text":"This place could use some work in such a nice area with great restaurants around it. Better staff too. The kid behind the counter today looked and acted like he not wanting at all to be there. Asked for bagel with veggie cream cheese and sliced tomatoes. Got no tomatoes. Seems like a simple enough order. Shame."}
{"text":"The owner and staff here act like they've never sold a bagel before, I felt like I was in the twilight zone. Our group of 5 walked in and they ignored us. When we finally got their attention, they took just half of our orders and then continued avoiding eye contact. The owner was passive aggressively telling his workers to help us out, while doing absolutely nothing himself. And when it came time to pay they they had crumpled up the bag with my bagel in it. They also got several of our orders wrong. Clearly these people have no idea how to run a store or any type of business for that matter."}
{"text":"Thought my family and I would try our neighborhood bagel shop.  Walked in young lady at counter.  She took or order but never a smile or welcome.  We ordered 5 breakfast bagels she sliced them put them in the toaster and disappeared.  We stood there waiting to pay or for her to come back. Another customer came in and we all just stood there waiting... Finally he asked if we had seen anyone yet and told him we ordered and she disappeared as our bagels stood there now cold in the toaster (no one was in the kitchen either). Finally after waiting a long time my family decided to leave and so did the other customer.  We will not be going back.  Adlai to mention the tables inside and outside were all very dirty."}
{"text":"This is the place that got me interested in the everything bagel. Actually, bagels in general. They boil their bagels, then bake them, which apparently makes a difference. The texture is so different than an Einstein's and makes the bagels in the grocery store seem like a horrible charade. It kills me to think that lenders bagels were my understanding of what a bagel tastes like. To top it off, the seasoning is all over the bagel, not just the top.   I really like the lox, but we also had the bacon egg and cheese. Both were great and filling. Also, the price point is affordable.   The only reason for 4 stars is the limited selection. Also, getting a dozen to go is a little disorganized. Einstein's does that much better, but if rather take more time and get the better bagel at Everything Bagel.   Finally, the people behind the counter are very nice and friendly.   Good addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Add a no star option! Poor customer service, poor food prep, and what looked like a pubic hair in one of our bagels! Shut this place down!"}
{"text":"Visiting here this past Sunday, was the first time I ever experienced bagels fresh out of the oven. YUM! I agree with some other reviewers, when we walked in they didn't have too many varieties available. I was offered fresh-out-of-oven sesame bagels if I was willing to wait 5 minutes. My husband and I both chose to bring home a half dozen fresh baked bagels along with a delicious tub of veggie cream cheese. The next day, we warmed the bagels in our toaster oven and they were still amazingly fresh and delicious. Great Sunday morning breakfast stop!"}
{"text":"Customer Service 101: Greet your customers. Preferably when they walk in the door. Don't toss receipts and cards on the counter, especially when their hands are extended to receive said items. Don't shove the bagel across the counter towards them, especially if their hands are reaching out. Thank your customers for visiting. Don't dismissively walk away without a word.  Change this and you'll get a return customer. Not someone who tells friends and neighbors that \"the bagels are okay, but they've horrible customer service.\""}
{"text":"Bagel gods have answered my prayers!   I love this place and their bagels and their veggie spread! First off their bagels have tops on both ends. Which is a huge plus in my bagel book! I totally hate when I have to eat the bottom half of my everything bagel and it lacks the \"everything\" part. Until this place suddenly appears in my life no more bottom half problems!   Their veggie cream cheese is delightful. You can tell its freshly homemade. I bought a dozen bagels here one morning to bring back to my family which was visiting me from back home in Cali. They devoured these in seconds! They were all surprised at how delicious they were!   I believe the also make breakfast sandwiches here I need to try one soon. From what I hear they are good!  I wouldn't order a coffee here though. I think I ordered one once and wasn't that impressed.   Customer service is great! They are always very friendly and helpful  A must try if your love bagels like I do!"}
{"text":"I went there this morning for the first time. When I walked in, there was another gal waiting for service.  She said \"I don't think anyone is here, I've been waiting for like 4-5 min\". So i popped my head in next door to Cappriottis to see if anyone was over there. Nope, no one there either. She shouted HELLO a few times, no response.  We both left.  This was 9:am on a Tuesday morning.  You would think they would anticipate customers.  I'll bet once Dunkin Donuts goes in across the street,  this place will be a gonner."}
{"text":"Not very impressed, stopped in on a weekday on my way into work and expected a top notch bagel selection since it is what they do.  Selection was basic, smear was way over the top, in the excessive kind of way, and the prices were a little steep.  Wouldn't go out of my way to return here."}
{"text":"I had a terrible one star first experience and went back to give them another try. I was not disappointed, the service was fast and efficient and the food came out so good!!! What I like most is a bagel sandwich is less than 5 bucks and full of good stuff!"}
{"text":"Overall a really nice little place. Great decor, and fresh squeezed OJ. I got a breakfast sandwich with pesto, mushroom and swiss cheese. The only reason it gets 3 stars instead of 4 is the eggs. I like an egg cracked and cooked on a grill, not poured from a carton. I will be back though, it was yummy!"}
{"text":"Our first sign this place was going to disappoint was it was empty, not a single customer there at 7:30 on a Sunday morning. When we walked in no one greeted us.  They just stared.  Ordered bagel and lox. The order taker smothered the bagel with so much cream cheese we gave up eating the bagel a few bites in.  Need to do some training on customer service, proper way to make bagel classics, and creating a more fun environment for customers."}
{"text":"Hands down best bagels in Phoenix. I am a true bagel snob (from NJ) and this is as close as it gets to authentic NYC bagels. They don't have pork roll though!   Bialys and bagels are continuously cooked throughout the morning and always so good.  Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside like it should be.   I called ahead today to make sure they had what I wanted- I have gone in previously in hopes of picking up a few bialys and they were sold out or didn't make them that day. The staff said if I called in 30 min before that I could order anything I wanted with any topping and it would be done. True to their word today!!   The staff is extremely nice and on the ball always!  Einsteins and Brueggers can't compare!"}
{"text":"My bacon, cheddar and egg bagel sandwich was good. But I was there on Sat morning at 9:30 and they had very few bagels. Many bins were empty or had only 1 or 2 bagels in them. I chose a sundried tomato bagel for my sandwich. There was also no juice. Just a few bottles of flavored Vitamin Water. The girl said the truck had not come yet.  There was only 1 couple in there. Seems like a weekend morning would be busy but if there's no bagels that might be why. I've never been there before so I don't know if that was a normal experience. I might go elsewhere for an assortment of bagels to take home but the sandwich was ok."}
{"text":"This place isn't what you think it is.... or at least it wasn't what I thought it was. I went to Everything Bagels thinking it would be a cute mom and pop place... it really isn't. It's kinda like an Einstein's bagel. It's attached to a sandwich shop. The bagels, though, weren't terrible. I didn't like that they use a weird egg beater substance to make their eggs. I also didn't like that all of their flavored cream cheeses are low fat... even the chive. Anyway, I stuck with plain cream cheese and an everything bagel and it was decent. I wouldn't rush back then."}
{"text":"most authentic bagels in phoenix. so good, the asiago bagels are made fresh every day and aren't too pricey."}
{"text":"First bagel place I have checked out in PHX. This east coast Jewess is happy :)  Showed up 20 min before close - everything was still up and running. (Staff wasn't half way out the door or anything already) got half a dozen of my choice. They were out of lox cream cheese (wahhhh) but the kind lady offered to whip some together for me (yayyyy!)  $13 out the door half a dozen boiled goodness and some shmear!"}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday morning for a bagel sandwich and some coffee. Overall there were a wide variety of bagel flavors and I tried an everything bagel as well as a sundried tomato one. The bagels were average, the crust was not very thick and the interior was very dense, not chewy or soft, and more importantly the dough's taste was bland. In essence, just an average bagel no different than one at Einstein's or another chain. Still pretty good for a quick bite on the go, but a bit disappointing if you're expecting a departure from the typical.   The regular drip coffee was great though, PEETS!"}
{"text":"Dirtiest restaurant I have ever been in.  So disappointed. Yesterday was my first time back since their first year open and it will be my last. It was so dirty that I was thinking of calling the health dept for restaurants.  It looked like the floors, walls, soda machine and coffee thermoses had not been washed since that visit over 3 years ago. I don't know why I didn't turn around and leave but I stayed and I did order.  The kid was nice, food was ok, ordered a coffee that I was told was made that morning and it was lukewarm.  The manager offered to heat it up. No thanku,  I'll pass. I don't want you to heat up your coffee from yesterday for me.  Yuck. Yuck. Yuck."}
{"text":"I stopped in here today after trying Capriottis next door. More out of curiosity since I am a NY and always on the search for a great bagel. So far the best I have found is in the west valley and still nothing here comes close. My fellow Yelpers help me out. Where can I get a good NY bagel? Well, I thought the sign saying Kettle Boiled would pull me in. To be honest, I was happy because I saw that they have Salted bagels. I love Salted bagels and rarely can find them. I got one and it was just alright. I don't know what else to say. It was good, not great. It was not bad at all so three stars from me.   I had no problems with the service at all as others stated. The girl was young and new to the job. She did not go out of her way to wow us but she was sweet and not rude as others mentioned.  Again, three stars. One thing I did think was kind of strange.  I asked her what a Hawaiian bagel was and she said she did not know. They did away with it a while ago. Why it is on the menu still? She said some other worker knows what it is but she doesn't know that ladies name nor what the bagel is. Hmmm, kind of weird. I still want to know what a Hawaiian bagel is and who is this mysterious lady with the power of the Islands knowledge? -lol- does the bagel have Mango in it? First world Foodie problems/questions. I can't sleep until I know-Ha! Just kidding.   I would go back to try some of their other items. However, I would not really go out of my way unless i was in the neighborhood. To be honest, that neighborhood has a lot of competition for good eats."}
{"text":"Great service! Friendly staff! The breakfast sandwich was so tasty and filling! They boil their bagels so that's one thing we love! So very yummy, clean environment and great coffee too!"}
