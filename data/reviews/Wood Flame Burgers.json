{"text":"Seriously. It is not difficult to make a good, flavorful burger. Although, the amount of times I saw the chef hyper-actively sniff and rub his nose may have insinuated that perhaps it may have been difficult for him to concentrate on the evening I stopped by.  1. Salt/pepper (this is honestly all you need) the beef just before you cook it. My burger had a rubbery texture, which means that they had seasoned it awhile before cooking it. 2. Don't cook it well-done when I ask for medium-rare. Dry, tasteless cardboard meat is not enjoyable. 3. Do not serve two-day old buns. I realize that dry buns complement dry meat, but make it more subtle by serving just 1-day old buns. Trust me, we're in Goodyear, so we're probably hungry and won't feel as ripped off if you even make a half-assed effort.  Rude service, as well. But I tend to enjoy rude service as long as the food is good. My advice is to keep driving a few miles back into town and get a burger at the AM/PM."}
{"text":"This place is great! Outstanding burgers that I crave relentlessly, if you are in the area definitely stop by. Not only is it a great deal but it is incredibly affordable. Go check it out today!"}
{"text":"This place recently opened. This was my first time there. When I arrived just before noon all of the 10-12 available tables were occupied. Pretty smoky inside from the grill, but not too bad. There were 4 or 5 employees working at the time, but I didn't see the chef pictured in the profile.  You buy your burger according to \"woody\", \"large woody\" or \"extra large woody\". Unfortunately the weight is not specified so you'll have to ask if it they don't list it after reading this. They put the cheese and/or tomato on in the back (cheese is approx. $.50 extra, but there are several choices, including: American, Pepper Jack, blue cheese, etc.). There is a topping bar outside the counter to add the rest of your toppings and/or sauces.  I got the large woody burger and some of their sweet potato fries. The burger had a good smoky taste, hand formed fresh patties and in store baked buns. Overall a very good burger and at this time the best for the money in the Goodyear/Avondale/Litchfield Park area. The sweet potato fries were OK, but I think I'll try the regular ones next time. They had a bit too much of the thick tough sweet potato skin on them and were a bit on the soft side. I've had better sweet potato fries before, but they just barely opened too.  I can solidly recommend the burgers and they are a solid 4 stars. This is a burger place, and they are definitely doing good things in the burger department."}
{"text":"We got a coupon so we thought we would try this place.  The burger was just ok.  4 oz burger seemed pricey at 3.99.  The burger and bun was very small after cooked.  The size of a McDonalds burger.  The fries were terrible because they were cold. They bag them up as soon as the order comes in and then they cook the burger.  The one good thing is all the burgers are cooked when they are ordered.  The sweet potato fries were ok, a little burned.    One of the employees was sitting at the table next to us she got up and went back into the kitchen area and spit out the food into a napkin.  It was very disgusting!!  I believe she was one of the managers, because prior to that she was bossing the other employees around telling them it was their job to clean off the tables. This is one place we will not eat at again!!"}
{"text":"Boooooooo. We were SO not pleased with this experience.  First, the buns were so hard and dry I could hardly choke mine down. I ordered the chicken sandwich with bleu cheese. The chicken breast was TINY...smaller than the palm of my hand. The bleu cheese was good, but how can you screw that up? They wanted to charge extra for grilled onions but raw onions were free. I'm not exactly sure how that makes sense but, whatever. The sweet potato fries were good w/ the fry sauce but that was, literally, the best part of the experience. I don't know if this was an off day, but, frankly, I'm not sure if I want to find out."}
{"text":"We took advantage of a coupon for a 2 for 1 deal. It was our first time in as well. While reviewing the menu the prices were reasonable even without the coupon deal. The burgers were delish! Bun were fresh as well. The girl running the cashier was super sweet and helpful. My hubby had the sweet potato fries which he really liked. They have a fry dipping sauce that was super tasty. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Good idea, poor execution.  Being a 5 minute drive from the house and getting a coupon in the mail was enough for us to give this place a shot.  I like the idea of a very basic concept with few options to start and then you can make it your own after that.  It just didn't deliver.  Here's the breakdown:  Pros: ++ The buns - they are made there, are really light, very tasty and a good size.  I don't like burgers with too much bun! ++ Three sizes of burger to choose from - something for everyone. ++ Ingredients seem to be pretty fresh ++ The regular fries were pretty good ++ You get to add your own fixins  So-So: = The sweet potato fries were a little charred - enough to give them a bitter taste.  They also are thicker cut with skins on (which was okay by me) but could have used a little more salt/seasoning. = The place seemed clean overall, but there were quite a few flies around =They seem to have a decent selection of sweets, but we didn't try any  Cons: -- The fixins bar is weak.  Not a lot of fresh produce and they offer shredded lettuce (which I think is messy).  It could use fresh avocado, pineapple, sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions, etc. Something more than raw onion and two kinds of pickles to dazzle up your burger with. --We both ordered our burgers medium and they were both definitely well done. --Watermelon lemonade was a special drink made that day.  I was excited, but it ended up just tasting like watered down watermelon - should have been more like lemonade with some watermelon than watermelon with some water and a little lemon in it. --It's crazy quiet in there. With no music and not many patrons, it was like a library. --There were about 6 people working this small lil' place which probably could have been run by 2-3.  Team that with the quiet and you felt kind of on display for them all to watch and wait for more people to show up. --Weird hours - only open until 7 and I *think* they're only open M-F possibly M-Sat - definitely not sure on that part though.  Mediocre at best.  If they worked out the kinks and revamped some of their stuff, I *might* give 'em another shot - only if I had a coupon again though."}
{"text":"Awesome Burgers, Great Price! It is actually one of the best burgers I have had in years. I can't wait to eat another one!  The meat that they use just melts in your mouth, and it's mouthwateringly juicy. If you haven't tried a burger yet, you're missing out! I love the WFB special sauce! (When you get a burger, make sure you put some on!) Tell Chef Allan and Roscoe and Britney I say hi!"}
{"text":"I understand the \"farm fresh concept but 4oz. burger is $3.99, little pricey.  Buns were dry and beef patty wasn't juicy.  WFB special sause was very good."}
{"text":"After receiving a coupon, we stopped in to check it out.  The weights for each of the burgers are now listed. Someone said that $3.99 was pricey for a 1/4 lb burger, and if you compare it to McDonalds it might be. But this place grinds their own meat from a specific group of ranches, and after tasting it I will tell you that it's well worth the price! Cooking the burgers over a wood fire also gives them a great flavor. They now put lettuce and tomato on burgers free of charge, so the shredded lettuce is no longer there.  The fries are also unique and outstanding. From their menu, they use Yukon Golds and fry them in rice oil with duck fat. The flavor is incredible, and when you use their fry sauce...well, I couldn't stop eating them.  My wife tried a couple of the sweet potato fries and liked them too.  They now have a TV in the small dining area that is usually tuned to sports.  We will definitely be back, and highly recommend this place to anyone that loves burgers!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't the great, burger was dry, fries were extremely greasy. Toppings are confusing; the kitchen gives you the lettuce and tomato - the mayo, onions and pickles are at a condiment bar and the ketchup/mustard is on your table. Didn't make much sense.  Overall wasn't worth the money, Smash Burger is a better choice.  I do have to say though the restaurant smelt really good: that camping aroma of burning wood and charred beef. I loved that."}
