{"text":"Slow food makes really healthy and tasty meals promoting fresh ingredients from local farmers. Price is unbeatable of $5 for a 3 course meals on Monday nights, and sit around a big table with other friendly folks in the madison community. The portion varies on different nights, in general I'm very happy with what I have been served and always have more reason to come back."}
{"text":"Perplexed as to how no one has reviewed UW Slow Food, seeing as it is certainly the best deal for lunch (Wednesday) or dinner (Monday) in the campus area. Sure, the ambience is lacking, but where else can you get a creative, delicious, filling meal for all of $5? (That's a three course dinner on Mondays!) Picky eaters need not apply, as there are rarely any choices beyond making your meal veg, vegan, or gluten free. But everything I've had there has hit the spot, and it's awesome to see students engaged in something like this that expands the meaning of education beyond the classroom. Plus you can check out the menu (and suppliers) beforehand online. One tip: if you want anything beside water, kombucha, or coffee, bring a thermos/flask."}
{"text":"One of the benefits to working on campus is the proximity to Slow Food.  If you need more information, they do have a Facebook page that is updated while they are running.

I have been going to their cafe on Wednesday afternoons for years now.  I have never once had a bad meal.  With an ever-changing menu and the dedicated student volunteers, you will always be able to have a unique experience.

I can't say enough about their farm-to-table philosophy, utilizing the most local ingredients available.  The continually strive to educate people on the benefits of local food and communicate where all of their food comes from.  This integrity of this concept also draws in many guest chefs, giving them a platform to share a unique menu with the community.

Not only is the food amazing and the premise solid, but the meals are very inexpensive.  This allows more people to take part.  And for those that cannot afford it, they started a pay-it-forward option.  If you are able and inclined, you can pay for an extra meal to help cover the meals for those less fortunate.

How do you beat good food, a commitment to the local community, and the dedication to be available for everybody?  To be honest, I'm not sure you can."}
