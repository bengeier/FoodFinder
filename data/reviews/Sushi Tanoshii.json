{"text":"This hidden little gem along Baldwin was near empty when we showed up on a blazing hot Saturday afternoon (everyone was lining up at ice cream places). But I was interested in coming here after seeing the few, but highly rated comments on yelp.   We were not disappointed.   Our server was super friendly and attentive during the entire meal. She serves with a bright smile on her face.   The fish was so fresh, the portions are great and the prices are reasonable considering how much you get.   We ordered a shrimp tempura roll, avocado yam roll, takoyaki and the deluxe bento (Salmon teriyaki + sushi + tempura).   The rolls were amazing. The fish was fresh, the ratio of filling to rice is perfect (lots of filling and not a copious amount of rice on the outside).   The takoyaki was absolutely delicious. It came to us piping hot, and when we bit into its                           core we just loved the texture of the centre. It's not too mushy like some places, and not too gooey like other places, greatly balanced and well textured, and the sauce was fantastic.  The deluxe bento was one of the last items we ordered and when it came in, my partner and I looked at each other like we were in trouble. We weren't expecting this much food! For $25 the bento came with two heaping portions of tender salmon on a bed of veggies, a portion of rice, two potato croquettes, two crisp gyoza, and it was hard to count how many pieces of tempura we got with this (it was a lot!). It was crisp on the outside, piping hot and tender on the inside. In addition to that, the bento we ordered came with 5 pieces of sushi (you get to choose if you want it to come with sashimi, sushi or a maki). The pieces of fish were a good size, the fish was super fresh and it just melted in our mouths.   All in all it was just a fantastic dining experience. Between all the food items we were absolutely stuffed, spent about $40 before tax and tip which was split between the two of us."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and to the point: if you like expertly made, super fresh, delicious sushi, you owe it to yourself to come here.   I'm visiting for a couple of weeks and I've been to all the highly rated sushi restaurants within a mile radius and this place is the best by a marginI would happily have paid twice as much for my meal."}
{"text":"This could absolutely be my new favourite sushi place. This new restaurant is such a good find. Fresh decor, good hip-hop music, amazing Baldwin Village location, and of course, super fresh fish! We ordered the Sushi Regular, and customized it to be California and salmon sushi. If you don't specify what kind of fish you want, the chefs give you an entire rainbow selection of beautiful fish. (It's a fun surprise, people! Live a little!)  Highly recommended: the Salmon Lover plate! Beautifully presented, great portions, and well-priced, too.  We'll definitely be back!   Tip: Pay cash and get 10% off your order!"}
{"text":"Sushi Tanoshii has taken over the space where Etsu used to be. I am unsure if its the same owners, but the sushi is definitely a lot better!  We went at lunch time and the place was mostly empty - a few tables joined later. They have a bento box lunch special - lots of different options for the sushi you want. I settled on getting spicy salmon and a dragon roll.  The bento box is a lot of food! Besides the sushi you get a miso soup, salad, glass noodles, and two gyozas. Everything was very tasty and the spicy salmon was actually spicy.   My only minor complaint would be that some of the rolls fell apart but the quality of fish seemed to be really good.  Great and attentive service, and if you pay cash you get 10% off your bill.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey but very good quality by Toronto standards."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for lunch and was very impressed with their menu. I tried the bento box and my friend got a la carte+donburi. The price was very reasonable, also the quality of the food was very good.  Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food caused terrible stomachache. Went to this restaurant last evening around 7:20pm. Ordered the beef steak. The waitress didn't ask my preference for the doneness so I felt unusual. But from the food I guess it was medium rare. This early morning I waked up by extreme stomachache and vomited. It was definitely caused by the steak since I didn't eat anything else last night. The beef definitely didn't meet the hygiene requirements. Make sure you specify the doneness. I wouldn't recommend beef steak in this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered their sushi today off Uber Eats and was highly disappointed. The fish is not fresh and the sauce / mayo used was quite off putting and ruins the taste of the sushi. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"This little gem is hidden at the west end side of Baldwin street. At first I was a little hesitant on trying this restaurant since not many people were inside nor were there many reviews up on yelp.. (this establishment has only been open for a couple of weeks) but the other sushi restaurants on the Baldwin strip did not seem as appetizing in price and variety as this one.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is cozy. I believe the restaurant is a family run business. Upon entering we were greeted by a super friendly server.  We were quite hungry and decided to order the following items:  Chicken karage (chicken pieces were big and juicy also came with a special sauce and was very nicely presented)  Spider roll ( price of the spider roll is fair (12$) but   I have to say I've had better at other sushi restaurants)  Tempura udon set (this was such a steal. For $13 we had a huge bowl of udon filled with a good mix of vegetables and noodle, 6 piece California roll, many pieces of veggie Tempura and 2 piece of shrimp Tempura, and a salad on the side. The noodles did not taste like those prepackaged noodle. Flavour of soup was very delicious and not salty at all. Tempura were fried to perfection and the cali roll had the right ratio of rice(10%) to meats  (90%).  Salmon lover set ( 4 piece of fine salmon sashimi, golden dragon roll (similar to a red dragon roll with salmon ontop and dynamite roll togeher) and 6 piece spicy salmon roll) this set was fair in price ($20) but also comes with soup and salad. The quality of the fish was very fresh and presentation was impeccable. Definitely can compete against competitors such as japango.  The service was quick and the staff are super friendly. They take all forms of payment and I noticed lots of ubereats and foodora come in for pick up as well.  I will definitely be returning to try their other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"How did this place close down?? No longer there. I live on the street and ate there at least once a week it was some of the best I've had in the city. So sad to see it go. Hope they re-open closeby!!"}
{"text":"This place looks sketchy from the outside, but actually is a pretty nice place. The sushi here is actually quite good, probably tied for best in this area with the sushi on the corner of baldwin and mccaul(I forgot the name). Overall the service is good and fast and the food is good, but at a moderate price. Sometimes however the waiters are slow and today we didnt get our utensils until our food already arrived so that takes off from a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"The spicy tuna was not crunchy at all. The tuna was DARK meaning it was old. The Chicken Karage was good but tasted like Popeyes. The Spring Rolls are DEFINITELY grocery store brand bought from the frozen section. Sushi was watery for some reason. Don't go."}
