{"text":"Avoid at all costs if you are coming here for food. Coming from a mexican household, my dad was disgraced by what they call authentic Mexican cuisine. I got the steak tacos that were dry and bland, while my sister got a burrito that was cold dry and tasteless, you could tell that the meat they use is frozen. My dad got enchiladas that were a soggy depressing mess. Will not return unless they fix the food quality."}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend for my birthday.  The decor is very nice!  My first test of a good Mexican restaurant is the complimentary salsa.  I expect fresh chips and fresh homemade salsa, hopefully with some fresh cilantro!  I was disappointed with chips from a bag and more cruelly still, tomato sauce-like salsa from a supermarket jar.  Note to the chef: let me know when you start serving fresh homemade salsa, I will come again.  Until you have fresh salsa I will not patronize your establishment!  The soup was absolutely delicious.  I ordered the Mexican \"Cesar Salad\" which was disappointingly standard salad with grilled chicken with some light \"Mexican-ish\" coating.  Come on guys, where's the cilantro?  Where are the colors?  My friend ordered a burrito with gray rice/meat stuffing that was drowned in pale sauce/cheese.  Get on with the colors!  What is up with that... I didn't taste this dish but it looked like prison food.  Put some decorations!  It's a restaurant.  People eat with their eyes."}
{"text":"The food was great, service could have been better!  We had a reservation for 7:30pm and were sat down about 15min after the reservation which isn't so bad.   We ordered almost immediately since we were all starving but only received our drinks and food about 45min later. We had to ask another waiter to bring us water as ours hadn't brought us any at all.   The food was amazing!!!! We shared the guacamole and calamari which was delicious! The meal was also really good although I wouldn't be able to describe what it was other than chicken and salad but I couldn't tell what the rest was, but nonetheless really good.   The drinks were also great! I had the hibiscus margarita!  The service got better once another waiter came to see us for the bills and asked us if we liked our experience. It was great to know that they appreciate the feedback and strive to make it better for next time!"}
{"text":"My favourite place!!! I got the chorizo quesadilla and my boyfriend got the steak one. The rice and salad that it comes with is delicious. The drinks are awesome and the ambiance is super fun!! I have no clue why this RESTO ever got a bad review"}
{"text":"When I think of Mexican cuisine I think of boisterous plates, exciting spices and a mouthful of flavour. This restaurant provided none of that.   The margarita was not bad, nicely frozen, but served with a ring of what seemed to be a mixture of sugar and paprika. Not the most enjoyable combo. We ordered a pitcher of red sangria, which despite its bold red colour, tasted watered down and bland. At least the tap beer had an appropriate amount of foam.   As we sat on the narrow terrace in what felt more like a smoke lounge than a restaurant we received our nachos. The chips tasted over cooked while much of the cheese was not fully melted. They were topped with a stingy amount of refried beans that seemed more like a drizzle of brown sauce than anything and were served with no form of salsa or anything to alleviate the dryness of the dish.  We eagerly awaited the mains hoping for a better experience. My lamb shank was served in a large clay pot with rice and \"potatoes\". Upon serving it the waiter made me sniff the top of the clay pot, which smelled of, you guessed it, clay. He drizzled the sauce over the dish which at the time seemed like a nice touch. The lamb was cooked well but was very fatty and extremely bland. The sauce was similarly bland with the exception of the excessive boozy taste. The rest of the dish was far from exceptional, including what were supposed to be potatoes but appeared to be more like under cooked apples. My fiancée order the steak quesadilla. It came with four less than inspiring look pieces with too much cheese and no flavour. Needless to say the couple we were with were also unimpressed and found the meal extremely lacking of taste, excitement and any type of grandeur.   We decided to skip dessert."}
{"text":"Went with my wife for my birthday,  ambiance was great nice decor server was very kind and efficient and the food and price was spot on.  We really enjoyed our evening there and I highly recommend it.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Many reviews were negative. But because I like Mexican food, I decided to give it a chance. And I was not disappointed at all. The service is very friendly. The food delicious and the portions generous. I will definitively come back."}
{"text":"Asked for no mushrooms and was told that everything was pre made and re heated, and that you can't change anything. Overpriced!! This was my second bad experience.  The first one was when I ordered a vegetarian meal and they gave me meat with the beans."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I was really looking forward to eating here, but now I wish I had just gone somewhere else. Arrived at 1 o'clock on a Friday and one of the table d'hote items was not available. I forgot to mention that the restaurant was about half full. The server was busy and we were patient but when she finally came, I had the feeling that she also wished that we had gone somewhere else.  Ordered the chorizo quesadilla which was quite good but really? Why include salad on a table d'hote item, when the table d'hote menu includes soup or salad. The only soup was bean soup so I went with the Caesar salad, which was also good with the exception of the badly planned tortilla strips instead of croutons. If you CAN'T pick it up with a fork, it doesn't belong on my salad. My wife had shrimp tacos which she said could have been better.  All in all, quite disappointing. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Premièrement , n'allez pas là! Do not go there!!! Je crois que Taco Bell serait mieux!!!! Mauvais service, fake restaurant mexicain , pas de sourire, amateur. Passez tout droit! À quand la fermeture ? Je ne peux pas mettre -2 étoiles , donc j'ai mis 1 étoile !"}
{"text":"I'm really not sure why this place is getting such bad reviews. I don't know what it was l8je when it first opened.  We have been here several times. The decor is OK and has that Mexican feel but I don't go to restaurants for the decor but their food. That being said. The staff is friendly and attentive. They are there when you need something but don't hover over you. We always order the guacamole which is really quite good. We had their take on their lentil soup which tasted great on a cold night. We followed up with braised lamb tacos. I little messy but was really tasty.We had no room for desert this time. I do believe if your looking for a reasonabley priced Mexican restaurant this should be given a chance."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food! Nice place in the west island. Good prices, great food. Love the churros!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, but first time for lunch. Normally come here for dinner and a cocktail. If you go for a cocktail I recommend getting the Latina caliente! And go between 4 to 7 for a better price.  The lunch deal was reasonably priced. I got the fish option that came with rice, veggies and an avocado sauce plus a salad to start and tea after for 16$. The person joining me got the enchilada and I have to say I was a bit jealous. It was giant and looked so delicious, but I was still happy with the trout.   This is a place that you want to go when you aren't in a rush. Not possible to go in and out in a hurry, the service is on the slower side but that might be because their moto is \"eat, drink and be happy\"."}
{"text":"Great food great drinks and a beautiful patio for a sunny day! If you want authentic Mexican, it may be too \"touristy\" for you but if you're looking for good popular Mexican dishes then this is your spot. Staff and service were also great. I would definitely come back! Great for groups and ambiance!"}
{"text":"Ignore the negative reviews! This place may have started off on the wrong foot (I wouldn't know, but based on the reviews...), but it is EXCELLENT. I've been here 5 times now and it's always delicious... Not to mention has a totally cute decor and fun music.   They bring you some chips & salsa when you sit down. And if you're going at dinner time, sit in the bar area of the restaurant (on the left) to get happy hour-priced drinks!   Here are my top recommendations:  APPETIZERS Panela flameado al tequila  Queso fundido  MAINS Chilaquiles con pollo **OOC! (Out Of Control!) Enchiladas with salsa verde Barbacoa burrito (but really, just stick to the chilaquiles or enchiladas!)   DRINKS Mojito  Caipirinha  Tulum  Elderflower sangria    The chilaquiles are seriously crazy good. Beer marinated chicken breast over a bed of these super cheesy, softened Tostitos, with a side salad and pickled onions - the whole thing is a crazy combination of flavours that you just don't expect. It's amazing.   The enchiladas - please get them with salsa verde. Good god. So delicious. My favourite part is where the salsa meets the cheese that's melted on top of the enchiladas... Holy moly!   Pretty sure the happy hour is from 4-7pm so you've got plenty of time to get your drink on at a good price. Plenty of options, too. My husband is particularly fond of the Okanagan Springs beer that they have on tap - $5 during happy hour, or $7 for 20oz at regular price.   We seriously love this place & the current rating makes absolutely NO SENSE. Give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"Hello fellow yelpers!   I was very, very disappointed with this place. To start off, we only received water 20mins into sitting down. Faux pas as it was a terribly humid evening and we were all parched from the minute we sat down.   When the waitress finally came, she kept pushing us to order our meals and drinks. We decided to go with a pitcher of sangria to share amongst the table. Awful idea. The sangria came completely watered down, tasting like 7up and apples. There was no sign of red wine to be found. The plus side was, they took it back once we complained. The new round of drinks didn't come until halfway through our main meal, and even at that, they were pretty tasteless.   We decided to order nachos for the table, that too, was a mistake. They came half burnt with the \"chihuahua\" cheese that I'm sure was just mozzarella. Tasteless seemed to be the theme for the evening.   Finally, getting to the main course, I ordered the enchiladas and my girlfriend ordered the fajitas. The enchiladas were pretty gross and her fajitas weren't much better. The other couple we were with also had a terrible experience and didn't come close to finishing their meals.   In conclusion, if I could rate this place less than 1, I would have. If you want to taste some delicious  Mexican food, visit El Meson on the Lachine canal!   Ciao yelpers, until next time..."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different so we stopped by last night. The place is decent looking nothing too fancy or grotesque. We got a seated right away and  our waiter brought a plate of chips and salsa while we looked at the menu. He was nice and polite. Wasn't too sure what to get so the waiter recommended the chicken Burrito/Enchilada. When the food got to our table I noticed right away the insane amount of sauce on the plate. The cheese was melted into the sauce and all around my plate. I cut into it and noticed that the burrito was really soft, as if everything was microwaved. I asked the waiter how it was prepared and he told me they put it in the oven. Usually when a burrito is put in an oven the cheese gets a little crust and so does the burrito, not so here. The burrito was just soft and wet from sauce, it also lacked any taste or seasoning. It wasn't just me my friend who ordered something else didn't finish her meal."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch experience! Excellent service, delicious food, lovely terrace. We will be back"}
{"text":"Place is very well decorated, lots of colors, there are 2 sections : bar section with flat screen tvs + dining room. Service was great; went for a pick up and ended up having a margarita - which was delicious btw... But the food... : I had the cod tacos (expensive for one small piece of fish in each taco) and was expecting a good home made tortilla de harina, but it was thicker a bit and softer. It also sucked to have this cheap melted orange cheese In the taco...:/ For sure its not a traditional Mexican joint but still good to grab a beer/drinks since they have an Happy Hour special, or lunch."}
{"text":"Tried out this New Mexican restaurant in the west island.  Was ok.  Drinks took forever to arrive like 20 mins by which time happy hour was over so when I ordered a second he said he was doing me a favour by letting me order at 7:03.  Lame. The food was meh, pretty average.  Had guacamole to start which all four of us thought was \"off\"....waiter had chef and owner try it and came back saying it was fine.  So much for the customer is always right...and they charged us for it. My fajitas were average, the salsa had no flavour.  Friends had a burrito which was ok."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Mexican spot. Good and authentic food. We love the sashimi tacos, delicious. We also typically do the beef and the pork taco on corn tortillas, just like they do it back in Mexico. DELICOUS! The menu is very well priced, I believe they offer a fantastic quality/price ratio. During the summer they have a nice little terrace to enjoy a cocktail while soaking in some sun, feels like your down south. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I mean, the taste is alright but I wouldn't call the food \"Mexican\". If anything, it'd be the interpretation of a misinformed dude (the owner, maybe?) with a bunch of Mexican names lumped in a menu with native American motifs designed on it. The food is extremely white-washed too. I should have known better when the place was full of white people. The servers are white AF too.  Calling yourself a Mexican restaurant and misspelling the names? As a Mexican it is hard not to take offence. And the prices! Even the best authentic taco place in Montreal is way less expensive.  I don't recommend this place, unless you wanna eat fake Mexican and have some extra bucks you wanna throw to the garbage."}
{"text":"My husband and I passed by this place on our way to 5 guys, and I suggested we try this place out. Unfortunately, should've played it safe and stuck to our original plan of getting some greasy burgers and fries. The outside looked nice as did the interior, however very empty for a Saturday. We both ordered burritos- mine was chipotle chicken and his the shrimp. They were both very bland and we both added a good serving of salsa and sour cream to have some taste. We also ordered calamari which were cold and ridiculously oily. When I told the server, he said \"oh ok\", as if expected. Overall, it's a step up from Taco Bell (although not that high) but very unlikely to return."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try a new Mexican restaurant. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  Let me start with the good... the resto is clean, the service friendly.  However, when I go to a restaurant it's for the food.  The portions were small.  We started with Tortilla soup and were served small half filled bowls.  It was very spicy, but that was not indicated on the menu.  We also had a starter of guacamole and chips.  The guacamole was straight out of the fridge. Two of our party of 6 had steak tacos as their main meal.  All they got was 3 small soft corn tortillas, about 3\" in diameter with a few pieces of meat and vegetables.  They were served open flat, on a \"sushi style\" plate (rectangle flat), with no sides or sauces.  Another of us had fajitas, there were about 6 slice like pieces of steak with only green peppers and again the really small soft corn tortillas (3 of them).  The sides served with it were in too small containers and weren't enough for even the 3 small tortillas.  2 of our party had burritos - they looked like wraps with salad on the side and a small bowl of beans that looked like baked beans and not black beans.   The last person in our party had fish in a banana leaf, although the fish was \"ok\", the banana leaf was very smelly and made the experience less than enjoyable.  Considering this is a new restaurant you would expect the staff to mention that the main meals DONT come with sides and would you like to have anything else on your plate?    6 of us, water only - no alcohol or sodas ... $217.  What a disappointment.  I will NOT be going again or recommending it."}
{"text":"Good deals during the week 4 to 7.  Certain drinks are 30% off and tacos are 3 for 10$ I believe. The food is always yummy but this time the service was not very good. Changing my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars because of it."}
{"text":"Service was great. Chips and salsa was delicious. Menu had some different choices than the usual Mexican flare. Drink were tasty a bit on the expensive side though. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Filling but not satisfying. The location is nice but the food is just meh. It's not that it's bad, it's just not good."}
{"text":"Festive place, good times and great food."}
{"text":"So many bad reviews this place gets and I have no idea why , what a pleasant surprise . Went with a girlfriend for an early supper and took advantage of the happy hour drink pricing by sitting in the bar section The restaurant is very pretty , we loved the Mexican decor and all the special touches to make you feel as if you were away on vacation , spectacular drinks , my friend had the Tulum which was a spin on a gin and tonic , and I had a lime marguerita , and a mango , shaken not frozen , these were perfect , not sweet at all , perfectly refreshing and real fruit juices , lots of lime and salt rims , I was nicely buzzed off 2 drinks , so they do not skimp . We started off with the queso fundido ( probably wrong spelling) and guacamole , omg both were spectacular , then we ordered our mains , I had the baja fish tacos with a side of mango salsa ( do ask for this , there is an upcharge but so worth it ) and my friend had the burrito enchilada . We were so full that we decided next time no mains , just drinks and a few more apps  The service was great , the meal well timed , the servers were not over the top friendly , but the service was not bad at all . We will return for sure"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant! Very spacious. We went around 4:30-5 o'clock. It was a 4 to 7 happy hour.  Great drinks, amazing steak taco and shrimp taco! Miam! Lots of flavor, very tasty and the portion is decent. I recommand it to anyone who wants eat with and enjoy great food with friends or family!"}
{"text":"My gf and I were in the mood for something different. I came across Valerie's review suggesting the chilaquilas and the enchiladas. We loved it. I'm not Mexican, so I can't say what is authentic or not, but we found both dishes delicious.  Definitely go back given the chance.  Service was excellent and the décor really is cool. We sat outside and it is very well shielded by plants so you can't see the parking lot. Very nice."}
{"text":"Ok so I went back a third time - I'm still giving it 3 stars but my Chicken enchiladas in molé sauce was pretty salty and the chicken was dry. My mom order fajitas and the chicken was dry - too bad. $4 for a very small portion of guacamole. My husband enjoyed his enchilada burrito and my daughter had chicken quesadilla which she loved. My second margarita was very strong - delicious but it packed quite a punch!"}
{"text":"Pour une premiere visite et après avoir lu Plusieurs commentaires négatifs, je ne m'attendais pas à rien. Premièrement le décor est superbe avec plein de couleurs et la musique mexicaine met de l'ambiance. La table d'hôte du midi comportait 4 plats principaux. Soupe ou salade verte ou........salade César! Je trouve que la César n'a pas sa place dans un restaurant mexicain. Selon mes invités, la soupe aux légumes était délicieuse. Nous avons tous choisi les enchiladas au poulet. Servi très chauds sur une plaque chauffante. Trois enchiladas etait beaucoup pour le lunch mais puisqu'ils étaient bons.... J'ai pris en apéro un Mojito classique et c'était bien fait.  Le service fut très bien par une des deux serveuses présentes ce midi.  Le stationnement est très facile."}
{"text":"The decor in this restaurant is outstanding! They have a nice bar with a good variety of drinks and a wide range of beers. We went for a friends birthday and it was a Friday night and the service was really bad...we asked for chili sauce and literally got it after 20 minutes after asking at least 3 times. The food did not have much flavour. I got the quesadilla and they were nothing special, it came with a salad which barely had any dressing and mexican rice which was really dry, seemed like it was kept and reheated in the microwave a few times...not a big fan of this place. Although, I would give it a second try and get something different next time!"}
{"text":"The restaurant decor is so pretty! Perfect spot for hanging out or a date night.  Our waiter gave great recommendations and always made sure everything was okay for us. The food service was also very quick! I ordered the burrito enchilada, which was very cheesy and juicy, especially with their guacamole. My bf ended up getting the steak taco which was not dry and very flavourful! The guacamole was better than most restaurants but nothing amazing. The portions were perfect, and the food was overall very good!"}
{"text":"We loved our lamb shank tacos and ceviche salad with sangria. I love any Mexican place that can actually give you corn tortillas!  The place is kid friendly and my LO loved the decor."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, I adore the art on the walls inside! my main meal was insanely good. Steak in a burito? whaaaaaatttt  ?! it was so good xp and very filling. they even toasted (or grilled?) the outside of my burito. it was soo yummy  I can't get over how much meat there was in it lol it was amazing  bland rice though inside lol beans came on the side, and they were bland too lol  my brother ordered some kind of tacos, that came on a wooden board. Just 3 little ones that came open pn soft bread. Never seen tacos like that. The waiter only told us at bill time that the tacos were half priced, we would have ordered more if we had known before but he was distracted by my mom who wouldn't stop talking to him. That poor guy lol my mom was being very stuck up, and he took it ALL with a cheerful smile LOL a real champ! Very polite and attentive to all of us. Thank god he spoke arabic, because my mother is a real ass, and it really helped that he gabbed to her in arabic, but you know arabs... they're shit tippers. I feel horrible, and I must go back and make up for my mom lol  the complementary salsa and chips in the beginning was nice. the chips were m'eh like store bought, but the salsa itself was amazing! it tasted homemade and special  can really appreciate the seasonings they put in it, it was a soft flavor yet savory, almost reminded me of a sauce. Dunno what was in there, but it was really special   we had also ordered a chip and dip apetizer, where the dip had a bean paste bottom, layered with melted cheese and guacomole. I think it was a mistake for us to have mixed the dip and ruint he layers. There was so much bean paste, that it was the only thing we tasted, and made it not very good. Kind of a waste of 12$.  We had also ordered the blue sangria. The waiter warned us that it was very sweet, but we love blue coraco or wtv and got it anyways. We didn't find it very sweet at all. It was just ok, not alot of fruits, or even variation of fruits and cut extreamly small. The oranges inside still had the rinds on them, and since i like eating the fruits, i noticed everything. It was basically just apples with a few orange pieces, which is very weird to me for a sangria. for 30$, that was nothing, but we at least got 6 glasses out of it, when the waiter told us it would give us only 4.  split a white chocolate cheese cake at the end. It looked very different and pretty, but not very yummy. the fried pastry crust overwhelmed the cheesecale filling. the caramel drizzle was very  yummy and the whipped cream was m'eh. At least the berries weren't too old tasting, but deffinetely not very fresh either.  We sat outside, away from the crowd, and eventhough we were surrounded by bushes, we were not bothered by any insects... and they didn't even have a bug zapper or anything I noticed, so I was a little impressed. The seats we took gave us a nice view of the pretty restaurant inside from the large terasse windows. Looked like there were alot of drink specials, eventhough there was no bar. I wouldn't mind going here with friends to have a nibble and drink instead of going to a bar actually."}
{"text":"After reading many negative reviews, I was extremely skeptical to try this restaurant. However, I had a great experience!  I went for lunch, and for 12$ I had a chili burrito, soup, salad and coffee. Not a bad deal. The burrito and soup were both delicious. It wasn't too busy since it was lunch time, and we had good service.  Also love the decor and music."}
{"text":"Nice casual place to hang out with friends. It was my first time here. Some of the tables are placed a little too tight for my comfort. Had to squeeze myself to get by . Waitress was friendly and nice.  Food is either hit or miss.   I had the steak tacos which were very tender and good. Wish they were bigger though and had some sides to accompany them.  My wife had the 'Enchilada Grande' from the table d'hote menu. The filling in the enchilida was ok but didn't go well with the tortilla wrapping. I found the tortilla wrapping a little too salty and cheese did not blend well together with the seafood from my perspective.  My son had the 'Quesadilla' from the kid's menu. Looked a little too plain. It was just cheese in between two tortillas and fries as a side.  I would give this place another try but their menu needs work if they want customers to keep coming back."}
{"text":"I went there twice now. Once for supper, once for lunch. I was very happy with the food and service each time. The lunch table dhote has good selections and comes w soup/salad and coffee. The mushroom soup was very good. I took the quesedillas. Couldn't finish my plate so the staff gave me doggy bag. For supper, I tried different drinks & they were all very tasty. This restaurant is much better than 3amigos and carlos&pepes. A great option in the west island!"}
{"text":"I honestly have mixed reviews about this place. The restaurant in itself has amazing decor, and the food is really yummy! Staff is very nice! But their drinks are SO disappointing!!!!!!! They have a menu for the drinks alone, and look WAY better than they taste. If i'm being honest, the last two drinks I had (pineapple mojito, and a month or two later the Paloma) both tasted... dirty? I could barely even drink the Paloma. It was so bad.. Which is really unfortunate considering how fun the menu seems, and how pricey their drinks are. They definitely need to review how they make them, or change it up. I would be giving a 3 star if it weren't for the fact that their food really is awesome!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent with a clear twist towards originality. The service is outstanding with a decor to match. And don't be afraid to ask them to spice it up. Apparently Montrealers prefer less spicy foods.  Margaritas are perfect!!!  If your in the area (it was well worth an hour drive for me) this stop is a must."}
