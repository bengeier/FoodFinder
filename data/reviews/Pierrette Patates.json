{"text":"After our second order I noticed that the food wasn't great at all. Meat was weird, pita wasn't tastey the fries and everything were made with no love. Didn't even end up eating my wrap it tasted so awful.

Not a fan anymore 

Update !

I didn't even want to eat from here again but my friend ordered. Wasn't good, we were both sick and were over charged. No Bueno."}
{"text":"From the fries, subs and clubs, Pierrette simply cannot be beat. I've had so many guests come over and have their minds blown by Pierrette's subs. What would be a dry mess with terrible house sauce in some to the establishment is instead a glorious crisp and soft bread with tons of toppings and the most amazing house sub sauce I've ever had.

The club sandwich,  made with actual brrast meat (not some deli cut BS) is amongst the best I've had and it's a deal that can be beat, served with a mountain side of Pierrette's  scrumptious fries.

The pizza is the best Ive found in Verdun so far and the dogs and burgers are mighty good too. I've yet to try a few other key items on their menu: souvlaki and gyros. But I've also heard great thing about their pizza dough garlic sticks. I look forward to trying those. 

This place has been around for over 25 years, I feel I've missed out only finding it in the last 6 months. 

Pierrette's will be a constant goto for all the time I'll spend in verdun and will be well worth the detour when o go elsewhere.


1 small knock against it though. It's cash only. Please pierrette people get the gear you need for us fans old and new to enjoy you even more often!"}
{"text":"Howdy!

Some restaurants are destination restaurants, others are worthwhile eating at if you're in the neighborhood. After having a Michigo with onions (a pogo covered with Michigan sauce and onions) I am seriously contemplating moving to Verdun so that I do not have to hike across God's half acre in order to eat there. 

It is is better than a destination restaurant, I wish it was my kitchen."}
{"text":"Après un déménagement je cherchais un bon spot de \" roteux \" et Pierrette patates était dans ma mire depuis déjà un moment. Contente de découvrir ce petit spot dans Verdun!

Le service, bien sympathique, le \" roteux \" (hot dog) était très satisfaisant et la poutine était bonne. Mention spéciale aux grosses frites fraîches et croustillantes à souhait. Prochain coup, je prend la frite sans sauce/fromage. Le fromage ne faisant pas \" squick \", m'intéresse un peu moins.

Pas très bon pour la ligne, mais parfait pour le moral!"}
{"text":"Great bang for the buck. Poutine was nice and crispy and lots of cheese, definitely recommend."}
