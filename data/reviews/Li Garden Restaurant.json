{"text":"We ordered during -20 weather because they deliver. The guy came and was very nice. I got the pork lomain and it was ok. The crab rangoons were great! I would order again but knowing it's not going to be mind blowing."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.. Very good food.. Just get young boy or girl to help you.. More of a take out place, but you can eat in.."}
{"text":"Let me first say I, we love Chinese food!

We were really hungry tonight so I decided to use Yelp to discover the best Chinese restaurants. Several came up and unfortunately I chose the WRONG one. $23.10 later plus a$3.00 tip I arrive home open my food and boy was I surprised! The Egg Foo Young was just one degree from burnt!!! The picture came out lighter than the actual patties. It was cooked in very old oil. Wish you could smell it... No on 2nd thought; I wouldn't do that to you. The patties are swimming in this old oil. Our order of Vegetable Chop Suey. It too was not good and had that same old old oil smell. So tonight it will be peanut butter for me and my daughter. 

They may have been good at one time but that time has passed. I will never go back. Besides that they have boxes upon boxes all over the place. Think twice before you order from here.

Pretty disgusted."}
{"text":"Just had literally the worst chinese food, which makes me miss li garden so much. Some of the best delivery food around. General Tso's chicken is WHAT TO ORDER here. If sweet and spicy is your thing, that is..."}
{"text":"My husband picks up the food that I want, and he always comes home shaking his head over how rude the people are who wait on him..Help--I like the food but he may not want to pick it up for me much longer if the rudeness doesn't go away."}
{"text":"Got veggie lo mein from here one night after work. Kind of a weird experience. I went in and it wasn't quite ready yet, cool, no big deal at least it'll be fresh and hot!! The owners had a table set up (it's take out only), and we're eating and drinking wine. Now I don't know if she was drunk or what lol but when she walked past me to go in the kitchen, she belched...and I mean LOUD..a little odd but the food was pretty good. Not enough veggies for vegetable lo mein but decent Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"Love this place! I lived in China for a year and a half, so I know my dumplings. I was so completely satisfied with their pork fried dumplings, I get them every time we go! Hopping place on a Friday or Saturday night. It's certainly not quite authentic Chinese, but it hits the spot every time! Plus- super affordable, with huge portions. Nice family owns the place."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of westernized Chinese food. One real advantage of this place... the deliver and perhaps most significant they deliver fast."}
{"text":"My favorite chinese food in the area. I have only done take out but there is seating inside. Good prices. Good portions and incredible food. Their spring rolls are fantastic!  I always go here when I want chinese!"}
{"text":"Just what I wanted! Best Chinese I've had so far in the Eastlake/Willoughby area. Wonton soup was delicious. Combo platter with General Tsos was a decent sized portion. Good food for a good price. I will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Took me a second to figure out where this place was. It's actually in the plaza near harbor freight and not right on Vine St FYI. Do not let the decor of the dining room fool you when you walk in. I assume that most of their business based on the looks of the inside, is solely on carry out and delivery- but well worth it!

We had 
-crab Rangoon
-Beef and broccoli 
-sesame chicken 
-shrimp egg rolls
-shrimp chips

We ordered at 3pm on a Friday and it was delish! Extremely fresh and we ordered using the online app beyond menu which was super easy! Will return!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great size portions the staff is very friendly. I tried the shrimp with garlic sauce and the amount of vegetables was amazing. My favorite local Chinese spot"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the area!  We order from Li weekly from an online app, and they always call if there's an issue!! Delivery is a little longer than some other places, but we think it's well worth the wait. I've tried half their menu and have yet to find something I don't like!!"}
{"text":"A mom and pop place with affordable Chinese take away. Able to make special requests are not a problem. Great noodle dishes. I have been a customer for several months."}
{"text":"This place needs some picking up in front because it's cluttered with boxes and not very nice for dine in. Thus, I recommend take out or delivery. On to the food review.

I came in for pick up. We ordered Shrimp lo mein and General tso chicken- two dinner specials which included rice and an egg roll. My shrimp lo mein had a good amount of quality small shrimp and a pleasant (although mild and short of mind blowing) flavor. Lo mein was al dente and not too wet :)

Bests' General tso chicken was very crisp, even after a seven minute ride home... And he said he liked it, which makes me glad. I liked it too, in terms of crispiness... BUT...if we are talking sauces, China Sea by CSU (another cluttered hole in the wall) still holds the crown over this dish, in terms of sauce AND crunch. 

Now, I'm debating on whether I will come here or Peking Chinese next time for the GTC because although not as crunchy, I like Peking chinese's sauce a tad more. What the Garden does hold the crown for at the moment, is their winning fried rice: Well balanced flavor and fluffy AF. Can I say that? I'm sure I'm not allowed to spell it out. Haha. 

So here's my personal combo breakdown:

Peking chinese's sauce and (smaller but) trimmer thigh meat. 
VS.
Garden's crunchiness and better side Egg roll filling and shell (even though I don't like how they wrap it). 

That said, one could assume that the winner is Garden on paper but IRL I'm still torn. I can go without an order of egg rolls, Best cannot. I guess it'll have to depend on if he's home or if I really want good fried rice. This fried rice is. good. Four star fried rice.

Aaand.. if you want to be a baddie like we, come here for your Chinese food fix and then pick up a fun box at the Mama's in the next plaza. Level up your combo game.

China Mountain. I'm coming for you."}
{"text":"Did I not review Li Garden yet??? I love Li Garden! I just get your run-of-the-mill American Chinese food here, but I love it! We love everything we get there when we're in the mood for that take-out Chinese stuff. They are always nice. Sometimes it takes a while, so i show up later rather than sooner."}
