{"text":"As a sushi lover, I am always on the hunt for good sushi. For the amount that my husband and I eat, we have found ourselves going to all you can eat places when we need a sushi fix, and saving the a la carte places for meeting up with friends or date nights.! I have tried many places in York region, and this is my current favourite for all you can eat.   For the selection, the price is about right, but I am not sure I would pay more. They have a great mix of raw and cooked options. Their fire grilled sushi is a must order!   Service was quite quick and the waiters were pretty helpful.   My main problem with this place is that they did not serve unagi (eel) in sushi form, and that it is only available in maki or hand rolls. That was a huge disappointment, but I did find other things to eat!   *edit* they do offer squid and unagi sashimi and sushi in their a la carte menu, but they go for ~$3 per serving... no thanks!"}
{"text":"Food was quite good. Choose the AYCT option and had a wide variety of selection including vegetarian. Service was ok but had to ask for replenishment of condiments, they should be checking and topping up. Liked the iPad option for ordering. Would definitely recommend and return."}
{"text":"A family outting brought us here   The food is good and price reasonable  great for sharing"}
{"text":"Best place for sushi in Vaughn & Maple. Everything is super fresh and delicious. I've been back 3 times since my first visit. Honestly hope this place keeps up the good food and quality, I'll be coming back steady."}
{"text":"Just tried this new \"all you can taste\" or ala carte Japanese, Thai Restaurant for lunch on the recommendation of my son.  Decor was modern and pretty.  Food was very good and fresh.   Service fast, thanks to menu on iPad.  My husband is not a sushi fan but there were lots of choices for him to eat.  Thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and will defintely go back.  Good value for the money, especially for seniors."}
{"text":"The place is going down hill. Food quality is not good. Hot things come out cold. Charge is ridiculous. New thing is for 5+ people they put on a 15% service charge for less than mediocre service. We had 4 adults and a toddler and we were charged the 15% service charge on a weekend. And the 15% was based on the total AFTER tax which is wrong. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place opened beside our house :) great food, great service. We will come back with more people"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best service for an AYCA place. You put your order in with an iPad and food will show up within a minute. The selection is quite good as well. From ramen to grilled okra we do most items pretty well. The decor is really top notch as well."}
{"text":"Great new sushi place in the Weston and Major Mackenzie area. The restaurant offers both ayce and a la carte options. The place is very airy and spacious and has clean washrooms. Good service and tasty food. In addition to the usual sashimi and rolls you would expect, there are some great specialty rolls and non-meat items like grilled mushrooms, okra, and eggplant. Nice place to take a date. It's my new favorite sushi place in the Maple area"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been waiting to try this place ever since we saw it being built.   We decided to go for the all you can eat instead of the a la carte menu.   As it was a Monday,  it was only $26.99 per person plus 10% discount for its soft opening special.   Friday/weekend goes for$28.99.  We ordered out dishes on the iPad that they provided for us.   Dishes come in tapa style portions.   We tried a variety of dishes that range from fresh mango salad to grilled and fried seafood.   Standouts were the mussels (great size!), fried calamari (so tender)  grilled squid (perfectly cooked and seasoned)  and short ribs (finger licking good)!  In total,  we ordered about 28 dishes between the two of us.   We didn't order any rolls/sushi so I can't comment on how these are.   Other tables around us did,  and from what we can see,  they looked fresh.  Although we ate a lot,  we did not feel heavy or bloated after because the food was fresh and prepared to order which allowed for hot steaming dishes to come out at your own pace.   The servers were very friendly,  welcoming,  and attentive.   We will definitely be back... Even better that it is right in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Disappointing Saturday lunch. I had the ala carte selections of pork ramen and gyoza. Gyoza was crispy and filled with cabbage and chicken; it was light and served with a tangy soya sauce. But it was not hot!!? Seriously? The restaurant was not packed and so this feels like just poor service. The the ramen came; have a look at my photos - it looks nothing like the picture on their iPad menu and tasted mediocre. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Decent pricing. All you can eat is worth the price. Food was great. Really likes how the staff was attentive and we had zero issue with getting what we ordered because of the iPad menus. Thought that was neat."}
{"text":"This was a first time walk-in visit....casual atmosphere, you use an iPad to select your dishes, and how many of those dishes you want.  Food came very quickly....BE WARNED.....for a party of four, all of you have to have a la cart/menu, two cannot have a la carte, and two menu.....Owner explained why we could not do this, and he was courteous about it and not rude, Customer Service was very good, attentive.  Food was really good and tasty, this is now one of our go to spots."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant! The food was great and served relatively quickly. The dishes I tried was the Beef Teriyaki, Sweet and Sour Chicken Set and Shrimp Pad Thai. Each dish was surprisingly filling. The Sweet and Sour Chicken Set came with a side of California Rolls, which were really good! The chicken tasted great and the presentation of the set was aesthetically pleasing. The Pad Thai tasted great, though it was nothing mind blowing. The Beef Teriyaki was great as well (it was cooked to Medium Rare for those who are curious). The staff was very friendly and responded to every request respectfully. The environment is pleasing in the restaurant, it is a nice place to unwind with your friends and/or family for the night. The prices are a bit higher than usual but nonetheless the food had left me satisfied. All in all the restaurant gets a 4/5 from me!"}
{"text":"Average AYCE sushi fare. Not as much selection  as Spoon&Fork.  Pros Tuna sashimi (probably why price is so high) IPad ordering Nice clean elegant decor Friendly service  Cons Over priced compared to similar vacinity AYCE fare. Beef satay pieces were too large and not tender."}
{"text":"My first time going to this restaurant and it was a great experience the portions that they give our generous and the thick slices of sashimi are what really knocked it out of the park for me. The staff was very attentive and the food comes out relatively quickly. It's quite a large interior the looks very small from the outside. I find that it's a little bit more on the pricier side for an all you can eat sushi though the vast options make up for the more expensive price. They are two dollars on the weekend though that seems pretty common these days. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night way back when bc I wanted to check out the new sushi place that opened nearby.  I was immediately drawn to the higher price of their dinner menu compared to other sushi places. As long as the food was fantastic?, this wouldn't have been a problem. Speaking of their sushi, appetizers, etc., I mean it was alright, but there was nothing special about it. Especially not to justify their higher prices.  In regards to their service, it was absolutely horrid considering it was a weekday night and it was pretty dead when I went.  In short, Ichiki is obnoxiously overpriced and definitely not justified by their quality of food or service."}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced compared to local competition.  Meat tastes rubbery, MSG packed, and there is very little of it in all your dishes. I went for all you can eat and I had to order 30+ dishes to even feel somewhat full.  Vaughan has many, many other better all you can eat sushi places for less $$$."}
{"text":"The hunt for good ayce sushi is tough. I wouldn't say this was the better ayce I've ever had, I would visit again if I was in the area.  Like many sushi joints, Ichiki has integrated the iPad system to order. There's a great selection and variety of items. One notable example, is the pressed/torched sushi. Everyone is trying to do nowadays, but for ayce torched it's pretty good! They also had butterfish tataki which is different from the regular salmon and beef tataki.  The orders come out fast and quick. Unfortunately, our group over ordered and we were charged $15 for excess food. Although, for 15 dollars we got a deal on how much sushi to take home as we ended up with 3 full takeout containers."}
{"text":"The most horrible restaurant I've ever been to. I've been to so many sushi buffet. They took all our sauce bowls and expecting us to leave. So when we asked for the bill, they said they're going to charge $1 for every 2 pcs on the plate. We didn't even have  chopsticks because they took all of them. THE WORST PLACE EVER IN MY WHOLE LIFE + food is not even good. It's just average sushi buffet quality"}
{"text":"Came with my parents and sister for my late late bday dinner yesterday. My parents are still on that all you can eat (ayce) sushi tip (I'm over it), but to satisfy their cravings we came to this location since they have red tuna sashimi. They also have a la carte available, but we kill the sashimi so that wouldn't make sense if ayce is available.   No reservations on a Tuesday night, they had a pretty packed house, but we got the last big table.   Food:   Sashimi!! Let's see.... we got red tuna, butterfish, snapper, salmon, surf clam and mackerel. Check out the amazing photo of all that sashimi! My parents laughed and said the restaurant owners took an L with that order. They cuts were all uniform and what I felt was the right size. Temperature was just right as well. For an ayce place, they are probably the best at this temperature control and size.   Tataki's were all really good, comparable to straight up a la carte places.   I only liked the torched beef pressed sushi. Did I word that right? Haha. The other ones were meh. I also thought it was strange that the salmon ones had more rice than the beef one. The beef one was the right ratio. The rice could have been seasoned better for this kind of dish.   Squid was available in sushi form only, not sashimi. Booo, it's a shame they don't offer it in the latter.   Maki rolls, too big! Example of them trying to fill you up with rice. I guess these are more catered to the a la carte guess so it's more bang for their buck. I'll pass on these next time.   Ugh, cheese wontons were so good. I shouldn't be eating these, but they were absolutely delicious after having all that raw food. Get these. Get lots of these.  Pad Thai, pass. My sister said it tasted like ketchup.   Grilled squid, get this. Buttered lightly and had just the right bite to them. Now, get more of this.   What else... beef mushroom rolls were aight. My mom liked the coconut shrimp and mussels.   Hot sake (10 oz). It stayed nice and hot throughout the service, no need to reheat. It was a good amount to be shared for three ppl.   Dessert, the only thing that stood out was the deep fried milk. Would get this again over all the other items in the dessert photo. For those of you who like chocolate ice cream, they have it here. Maybe I'll be basic and try this next time. They also have coconut ice cream.... mixing these may save their dessert options.   Service: They seated us quickly and asked if we wanted to do a la carte or ayce. We asked for ayce and they set up our iPad menu. Menu was easy to navigate and to order from. They also asked what we wanted to drink right away and brought it promptly. They did refill us on tea once, but we had to ask for more the second time around. She placed the tea thermos on our table this time, which I am always, genuinely happy to get and serve myself. The food came out as quick as possible and  they took plates away quickly. The bill came when we asked for it (you would be surprised how many places don't do this well, but they did good!). All the servers were pleasant to be around.   Atmosphere: I like the layout and decor of this restaurant. The ambience was nice and the music was not too loud so it was pretty family/conversation friendly.   Washrooms were clean, other than the fact that someone either threw up (kind of, maybe) or threw out some food in there. Since I couldn't tell which it was, it didn't bother me. These restaurants have no control over some of their ratchet customers. I also did not notify them to clean it, so I don't blame them for this.   Final thoughts: I hate to leave it on that note. So my overall impression of this sushi restaurant is GOOD. With capital letters. Worthy of the five stars because there were some quality items on the ayce menu (red tuna sashimi for an ayce place A+). Obviously not as good as going to a fancy a la carte, but it will do to curb your cravings. Service and ambience was GOOD. GOOD place to take your sashimi loving parents. I'll be back eventually (I'm still full).... but just with them. Not my friends. I'll save the boogee a la carte places for them."}
{"text":"The food is presented in a way that no other AYCE sushi place does. The service staff is in top of cleaning the table and getting refills. The ordering is iPad which is great and the food comes fast. More pricey than typical AYCE but worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times whenever I get sushi cravings, and I'm always left with the same feeling - not bad, a little above average but not AMAZING. I'm focusing on 3 aspects of their food and service overall.  Their sushi tastes fresh and it's great, but their a bit larger than to my liking, I prefer smaller portions so that I can try a bunch and order more :D Other than that, they have a great variety, many special ones I've never seen in other places! I'd rate it 3.5/5  Their fried items like shrimp tempura, gyoza, calamari, scallops, etc. are nice too but they do feel very heavy. So if you do want to focus on sushi, I'd recommend ordering all sushi rolls first, then the fried items so you're stomach isn't already full from all the fatty fried goodness! I'd rate it 3/5  Their stir-fry and skewer items are just average too, personally I think they're bland in flavor; especially the Korean short spare ribs. They're my favorite item to get at any Asian restaurant, and although they were incredibly tender, the flavor wasn't there for me :/ I'd rate 4/5  The service is always great here, they fill your water very regularly and quickly. They're very nice whenever you need additional items like napkins, extra spicy mayo, extra utensils/plates. They greet you the moment you walk inside and seat you immediately if there is not waiting time. Only thing is, servers here are generally more quiet, as most sushi places are, but I do like conversing here and there. I'd rate 4.5/5  Overall, I'd say this place is good for a sushi fixing that is better than most locations in Vaughan, however, its a bit more pricey. Service is great and variety of foods is better than a lot of locations in Vaughan."}
{"text":"I've been to this place maybe three times already? First, let me start off by saying that this place is more pricey than any usual AYCE sushi restaurants. The primary reason to why I come here is because it's literally a five minute walk from my home.  For the price I'm paying for ($18.99 for lunch), I honestly don't think it's worth it. Their menu consists of a good selection of sides and appetizers. As for their sushi selection, it was alright, but defintely not as great as I thought it would be. Overall, I would say that I enjoyed the appetizers more over the sushi.  The service at this place was good for most part. My cousin and I got seated right away when we got there and our server took our drink orders. The wait time for the food from ordering via iPad system was quick. There was one time where we received a plate of sushi that we did not order, therefore, we had to tell our server to take it back.  I defintely don't think I will be coming back here for sushi, as there are other restaurants out there that are cheaper for lunch."}
{"text":"Originally I was going to give a 4 stars cause the food was great.  But my son got food poisoning after so I have to take off 2 stars. (I would have taken off all stars if I am 100% sure it is caused by the restaurant.)  This is the first time I try out this restaurant.  The food was great.  The atmosphere is great.  Service was prompt.  I just hope that it didn't cause food poisoning for my son.  But the only food that he ate that I didn't eat that day was from Ichiki.  It was a chocolate ice-cream.  At the restaurant, I did noticed there are some white spots on the ice-cream, it just thought it was freezer burn, and I didn't look closer.  Now I think back, it maybe mold.   =("}
{"text":"It's meh to begin with but one time I ordered the chicken pad thai and it was def. not chicken so we never went back."}
{"text":"Food was okay, customer service was horrible. Waitress was unreasonably rude the entire stay, I asked for an extra bowl and she snapped at me :/ Probably had a long night but she shouldn't have to take it out on nice customers. Went a while back to try the place out and I wouldn't think of coming back again."}
{"text":"Wow. I can't believe I ate the whole thing. Ever been famished so much so that you just eat what's in front of you ? That was the case here. That said no one took the time to ask how everything' is after they delivered our what they call Pad Thai.  We call Pad slop.    If Burger King served Pad Thai they'd Probably do a better job. Worse yet after we politely indicated that what we ate was the worst Pad Thai we have ever eaten the waitress who was more concerned about dinging our debit card could care less.    We said we'd never come back. Even upon our pre order we specifically said \" easy on the oil and extra spicy \" what they delivered was a Hospital delight of bland oils and ketchup drenched noodles.    Not a single bean sprout to be found let alone garnish of lime. At $17.95 a pop which is not exactly cheap for this dish as average price is around $14-16. This looked like something you see served in a prison movie.    Than again it was Halloween. The food and service is very scary here. Your better off to go through the local fast food drive through. This restaurant can't make up its mind Thai food or Japanese. There are no Japanese people working here. Otherwise you'd be greeted walking through the door.    We can only imagine the Sushi is probably best enjoyed by your cat here seeing as they DECIMATED the Pad Thai. If your missing your teeth or have seniors that want to eat out this might be a good choice. Or if it's your cats birthday you definitely should add this to your list of fine feline eating.    Mind you that's not truly a fair comment as we didn't have the Sushi. We're disappointed we didn't bring our retriever he would have slopped down the PT and licked the plate clean. Guaranteed. Maybe next time when it's Killers Birthday we will bring em here. That is if there are no cats he enjoys cat Sushi more than Pad Slop"}
{"text":"Amazing place, atmosphere, service and Food!!! Very fresh and tasty. Defiantly, will be back soon."}
{"text":"They do a good job with their hot dishes. Skewers, Japanese fried rice, baked mussels, short ribs were yummy here. Ramen had a foul bamboo spout taste (eek). Found the portions too large.   Sushi dishes were a miss for me.. they were poorly assembled and packed with tasteless rice. Eel was dried up. Tataki did not taste fresh. Sashimi was not bad tho.  Slow night but the kitchen was super fast. Servers just pile on the dishes.. as typical ayce sushi does.  Orders are made on the iPad which is always a plus. Beautiful modern renovations, comfy booths."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in Vaughan, although on the pricey side- the food and service does not disappoint! The titaki is the best I ever tasted. They use iPad style To order. Lots of variety for sushi and cooked dishes. Their baked mussels are one of favourites there. Quality is good! Must go here !"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. I don't like AYCE but if I'm going to do it, it best be good! The rolls here are tasty as are the cooked items. The hand rolls especially were done right, bursting with ingredients other than rice.  And for some reason the sweet and sour chicken was out of this world. I probably would prefer doing lunch rather than dinner even though no sashimi, just because it's way more reasonable."}
{"text":"The food is great for an AYCE joint, but the service was just too slow which is why I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4. We were there for over 2 hours because we were waiting for our orders to come. The server explained that they were short staffed that day, so I'm guessing that it isn't usually this slow.   For the lunch buffet, they had a decent variety. They have some great apps including baked mussels, takoyaki, and calamari (which you don't usually find on the lunch menus at other AYCE places). The rolls were pretty standard but the quality was better than other AYCE places. They also have pad Thai and curries available to order for AYCE.   I would say overall it's better than most AYCE restaurants and it's reasonably priced (about $17 per person). So if you're having a tough time trying to pick amongst the plethora of AYCE restaurants in the area, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely extremely disappointed with today's service and quality. Utterly disgusted and will never return!   As a regular customer with dietary /ALLERGY needs, which must be met each time, and have been discussed with the management on every visit,  AND REASSURED ON EVERY VISIT we are weekly visitors and we come as a large family of 6 each time, it's never a cheap visit. For the  final time I was served none gluten free food, although as usual I have written my order down on a piece of paper, ALSO LABELLING GLUTEN FREE- clearly stating my gluten free allergy  also verbally (I'm always ordering fresh food or off the grill) and asked to speak with manager before my order, and as it was placed.  They mentioned multiple times she's coming and she never did. (Which normally she greats me and confirms all my orders) the waiters told me they are ok to take my orders.... Once my order came inn and I began to sample it, I realized it was all smother in sauces which normally it cannot be; those sauces are not safe for me to consume-not even close!!  the management knows this and above all else the kitchen staff -cooks MUST know... they even bring me soya sauce that is gluten free, so they know sauce is a big factor, long story short, most of my food was not edible and we again requested for the manager!     at the end of my family's dinner she arrived, we brought the issues to her attention and she simply apologized and confirmed yes all the food was not gluten friendly and began to take it away, Mind you, i didn't have the chance to eat ... after going back and forth and looking to resolve this serious health risk issue, we asked if my portion of the bill can be cancelled since I didn't have a chance to eat- the manager had to call the owner and later retuned with a NO!  We were shocked!   We all felt we had terrible service, unorganized - uneducated and unprofessional!  I didn't get to eat and came in contact with food that was dangerous to my health although I was reassured on every visit that it will be fine... and yet we had to pay for my sitting Near my family and watching them eat!  Shame on you! This company has lost very good paying and loyal customers! Due to their ignorance-We made it clear that we will not return. Nor will recommend this place to any one else from here on!   Good luck on your business.  We are completely disgusted with the risk they put me under! And the way they handled this situation! Shame!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Everything we ordered on the iPad came within five minutes. Food very delicious and worth it for the all you can eat price. Atmosphere was nice. Will be definitely returning."}
{"text":"My favourite go-to sushi place! I come here all the time to satisfy my sushi craving.  Service is good, nice seating area, and pretty good sushi compared to other places I've been to. It's slightly more expensive for all you can eat especially on weekends but, that being said, it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Good consistent food. Been going here since it opened a summer or two ago. Good value for their lunch bento box take out or their AYCE. Has torched sushi and raw fish or sushi unlike any other AYCE in the area. Good quality food compared to the other AYCE In the area."}
{"text":"This place is good but I would say it's not worth for the price it's 30$ for all you can eat dinner and 20$ for the lunch but the lunch they cut half of the menu so it's not even worth it trust me please there's better places"}
{"text":"I love going to this place! So yummy! Great location and service. The food gets served promptly and tastes great. The atmosphere and interior design is beautiful as well. The cost is the usual for all you can eat places. I bring my family and friends here all the time and everyone falls in love."}
{"text":"Food was good. Pressed sushi wasn't the best I've had, but they have tuna sashimi which was fresh and tasty. Price was a little high. My husband doesn't like sushi much, and they had a great variety of beef and other tempanyaki offerings which were really fresh and well seasoned which he loved. iPad ordering system in a bonus."}
{"text":"Update: We've gone back here now a few times for take-out, mainly the thai dishes, and the quality is outstanding. They are really nailing it these days with the take out.   The food is super fresh and flavorful, and it could be the best thai food I've had in vaughan. The basil beef especially is amazing as was the beef fried rice. The chicken pad thai was really tasty but a little too tangy for me, my wife loved it though.  Looks like they're really picking things up here and I couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"Very nice large sushi restaurant. Same AYCE concept but seems more open. The dish selection is incredible and creative.   Prices are pretty much on board with the rest of the restaurants but quality here seems better.   Staff is friendly but their plate handling can be a little softer. I lost count of how many times they threw our dishes on the table. They weren't that busy so there was no necessity for it.   But i'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ever since it opened, this became my go-to sushi place in Vaughan. The lunch bento boxes are pretty good too. Nice to know there is finally an AYCE restaurant with good food & service in the area, but it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"The food is good for AYCE and the service is great, the order is come very quick. And the environment is comfortable."}
{"text":"Was our first time and they sat us near the door and we asked to change and they swiftly accomdated, even though the place was very very busy. One of the best all you can eat sushi and with the added thai to the mix. Food was fresh and innovative. Fried calamari was amazing... Service was Uber Fast. I liked the i pad ordering system so you just add as you go and food magically appears. Surely coming back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pretty nice with friendly staff. The food was not that impressive and most were under-seasoned and did not leave much to be excited about. That said, it is still the soft opening so there is definitely room for improvement. Will come back  to check it out again later on."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews for restaurants, either positive or negative, but I have to share my experience at Ichiki. My wife, young daughter (under 2), and my self went to Ichiki for dinner. We've been to this restaurant many times before and would consider it to be a \"go to\" restaurant for us.   This particular occasion my daughter got sick at the table just as soon as the food started to come out (only 4-5 small dishes were brought to the table). I apologized to the wait staff and told them to cancel the rest of my order because we would be able to stay for the meal.   After the waitress poorly cleaned the floor I asked what I owe for the minimal food that was brought to the table. The waitress said that they \"had\" to charge me for one full adult dinner totaling over $30. She said it was to cover the cost of food--there was two seaweed salads, 8 pieces sashimi, one miso soup, and one ramen soup--$30 seems a little excessive for so little.   I understand I had to and was willing to pay something for the food that came to the table and the 7 minutes spent sitting at the table, but not that much. I will not be dining at Ichiki ever again because compassion and customer service is beneath this establishment."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time yesterday (Sunday) for an early dinner. Atmosphere and decorations are nice, service was not very good (and a bit awkward at times) and food was okay. We had high expectations but the food just didn't satisfy us. We decided to go a-la-carte and ordered the beef pad thai, vege pad thai and grilled squid. Maybe we should've did the AYCE and had a different food experience but we just weren't in the mood for AYCE. But anyway, food and service didn't match the high prices you're paying at this restaurant. Most likely will not be going back here."}
{"text":"1st visit was really great  AYCE but......... Second visit went just for ramen and something was not right soup base was no flavour and to make things worst I got food poisoning off of ramen I was amazed RAMEN of all things to get food poisoning from that's just messed up will not go back"}
{"text":"This place has such beutiful decor when you enter. They also have the iPad ordering which is great. There are lots of options and the food is fresh and tasty.  The service is also very good l. The Manger Peter is great."}
{"text":"I like the sushi, pretty good quality but the price point is quite high for me to say it's worth it. However, if you are a lover of all things tataki this is the place to go if you want an ayce sushi menu with tataki. It actually is better than any other ayce place that does have tataki which is usually not the case. It's my second favourite place for tataki, the other is in Waterloo so I can't really go there all the time . The service was realllllllyyyyy good. We had a younger gentleman and he was actually friggin amazing. Earned his tip that night with his \"my pleasure\"s and coming to check up on us with water. His demeanour was just refreshing compared to other sushi places that are like okay, eat, ice cream, bye."}
{"text":"Every single thing on the menu is so good.  All the standard AYCE sushi dishes are top quality, even the skewers (which is where a lot of places fall down).  There's also a bit more variety than usual, for example the superb beef tataki, not to mention all the Thai dishes.  The creme brulé is amazing!  It's light and milky instead of the traditional thick custard, but by this point I'll have already eaten way too much and it's just right.  I've been 3 times in the past year. Everything is consistent, including very fast service."}
{"text":"Not sure why it took me so long to write a review for this place but here it is....  The entrance of this place is a little tight if you have to wait to be seated, but once you sit down it's a lively and well decorated place.  After several visits the servers still start with \"how are you doing today?\" Not just \"all you can eat?\" Which is nice.  The food is delicious, served hot(for hot dishes), the sushi is fresh and they make a mojito ($5 mojito Monday) that will take your mind straight to a Dominican beach.    I love red tuna which they serve at dinner only unless you ask to pay the dinner price during lunch which is what I do.  My consumption of their Garlic Beef, Short Ribs, Red Tuna Sushi and Fried Cheese Wontons would be worth it at double the price.   This is definitely the best AYCE sushi in Woodbridge."}
{"text":"Much better experience today at AYCE lunch. Although pricey ($24 top n tax) flavour was good! Portions were big and rice wasn't too overbearing. Service was fast and this time they didn't need a supervisor to cash me out.   I will go back!"}
{"text":"We went here in on a Saturday evening at 6:30. They place was fairly busy, but we got seated within 5 minutes. Service was great, food came out quickly and plates were cleared just as fast, which was surprising since the restaurant was full. They get all three stars solely on service, which is lacking at most restaurants these days. The food...... sushi was not fresh. Other then the salmon, all the other fish tasted slimy or \"fishy\". The fried food items were very greasy, over cooked and, it was like they used oil that hasn't been changed in awhile. There are a lot of ayce sushi places in this area, I would try a few of those before returning to this place. However, the quality of service might draw me back to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Nothing special. A little overpriced for average sushi. The service wasn't amazing.   I don't think I would ever come back, there are better sushi in the area."}
{"text":"This place is a phenom, both my girls always agree with each other when I suggest this place for dinner. At  7 and 5, that is a very rare occasion.   Their menu consists of items that the whole family can enjoy, as my wife and youngest aren't fans of fish, let alone sushi. So, they hit the many rice, noodle, chicken and beef options, while my elder daughter will try to eat her weight in crab, and is willing to try the plethora of sushi options I order. Thankfully it's all you can eat and children are much cheaper to feed, although drinks are quite pricey here, but not really of the mark from other establishments of this variety.   Even better is that my daughters enjoy running up and down the interlock pathway that is right beside the restaurant. Great for burning some of those calories we just jammed into our faces."}
{"text":"So after a friend of mine convinced me to come here for an amazing experience, I was convinced that this would be a nice change being that its a Sushi and Thai place.   I have to say that the whole place is fairly mediocre. Theres no real setting this place  aside from other places. The Thai dishes are kind of mediocre. The grilled Squid was chewy.  Even the sushi left alot to be imagined.    The place isnt downright awful or anything and its certainly acceptable to get your sushi  fix but the sushi wasnt exceptional or anything."}
{"text":"Good decent AYCE Japanese! Love how FAST the food order gets delivered, even the hot food came out pipping hot! As soon as you order on the iPad, and hit submit, it was probably less than 60 seconds before someone appears beside you to deliver plates and plates of dishes we ordered!  We were very impressed, most AYCE places would just skim or skip some of your order or \"lost\" your order somewhere or bring it so much later you get full and not want to eat anymore! Not this place! Love their fast order and bam it's at your table in seconds!   The quality of sashimi could be a bit better, the salmon wasn't the best I've had. But they did have tasty sweet shrimp sashimi!  The grilled \"mandarin fish\" (I believe it was just cod) was absolutely delicious! So was the grilled king oyster mushrooms! First time we had cooked food as much as we had for sushi and sashimi!  We didn't have any thai stir fry, only had the tom yum soup which was also light and brothy for a cold winter night! Awesome fried milk pudding which is my fave!! I hope they add fried banana as well in the future!!  Will def come back if in the area, just wish it wasn't so far!"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 3/5 This place is located on Major Mackenzie Dr W and Weston Rd. There weren't that many fun things to do in that area, but there were ample spots in the parking lot.   [SERVICE] - 3/5 Average service, orders were placed with an iPad for both À La Carte and All You Can Eat options.   [DÉCOR] - 4/5  Comfy and cozy Japanese bar vibes. Chairs and booths were quite comfortable.   [QUALITY] - 1/5 We ordered items from the à la carte menu, and the quality of items were below average for the price.   [ORDER] - 1/5 - Chicken Pad Thai - $12.95: noodles were too soggy, and there was an overwhelming ketchup smell/taste. Unfortunately, this dish did not taste authentic.   - Maki Combo - $16.95: sushi rolls were average, nothing spectacular, and definitely not worth the price.  [OVERALL] - 1/5 Food was below average, and not worth the prices on the à la carte menu. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place if you want Japanese food for a decent value."}
{"text":"Great spot for an all-you-can-eat sushi. Easy ordering with iPads. Quick service. Nice looking decor and great food. The sushi is delicious which I find rare for an all-you-can-eat. You get a nice slice of fish rather than the typica sliver. Been there multiple times and enjoyed it. Service is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Went here at the time they recently just opened with 2 friends. I ordered their maki set and I like how you could order from an iPad. I found this to be a bit pricy but it was one of the cheapest things they had. The fish itself was average, I expected more quality since that costed around $15. It's also an AYCE spot as a lot of people ordered it. Maybe next time ill swing by here to eat AYCE."}
{"text":"I tried Ichiki for the first time today, and my experience was a very pleasant one Their food is pretty good, and especially the sushi is among the best ones i've had... First of all the restaurant looks very nice from the inside, nice modern design with a rusty feeling to it. All tables were nicely stocked and clean. We were greeted and taken to our table right away, as it was not busy at all ok a Sunday afternoon. Since t was my first visit,The waiteess was very helpful explaining their ordering process.  Basically you can order off the menu, or you choose the 'All you can eat\" option, for $19.99 lunch rate, you can order as much as you want. Both options/order types are placed easily via a tablet that the waitress give you to keep on the table, that you can easily navigate through, select item, quantity and send to kitchen! Done!  The food was delicious, portions are perfect, which is different than other competition on that category where you get a small sampler size. These portions are filling and the quality is superb. Sushi selections are very big, and it covers a wide variety of maki, sushi, sashimi rolls.. They also have a wider variety of Thai and Chinese pad thais, woks, curry plates, etc... My favourite apps are the coconut shrimp, tempura shrimp and Teriyaki beef & chicken satays.. As for all sushi items that we had ordered, they're all superb! The only one thing I would like to see improved here is the service, staff can be a little more friendly/smiley. Other than that, i'm going back soon!"}
{"text":"Very clean and modern restaurant allows for a comfortable dining experience.  The take out experience is exceptional as they're kind and efficient in taking your order over the phone and having it ready with a set time expectancy. It is overpriced for AYCE but the food quality is above average compared to other places around the area. Overall, awesome place!  Update: Brought my review down to 4 stars because they do charge for extras not finished left on the plate after you finish eating at AYCE.  This was not disclosed anywhere on the menu/iPad.  A definitely negative ending towards a otherwise positive experience."}
{"text":"Driving past this place today and noticed it has now opened. Piquing my curiosity, two of us ventured in for lunch.  What strikes you first is that from the outside, the restaurant seems tiny, but inside it it fairly large. Decorated with warm woods and minimal clutter, it is a great addition to the concrete plaza it sits in. We were greeted at the door and seated promptly. The menu is on an iPad, so you can peruse the items at your leisure. It seems as though the main thrust of their business will be the all you can eat menu, however, seeing as how we were there for lunch, we ordered a-la-carte.  I ordered the Terryaki Bento meal, my dining companion opted for the General Tao Bento. First to arrive was a small salad and a miso soup. The salad was excellent (with a peanut dressing)...but I'm not a fan of Miso (too salty for me) so it just sat there. I did taste it...but seeing as how I don't like it, this didn't change my mind. Next came out our California Rolls..6 rolls per bento meal. They were excellent. While scarfing down the rolls, our bento boxes arrived. They contained the meat selection, 2 spring rolls, vegetables and white rice. It was a ton of food and I couldn't finish it all, despite the fact it was deliscious.  Food was of an excellent quality and not overly expensive. Staff were attentive but not in an in your face kind of way.  I'll definitely be going back to do the all you can eat option. Great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place has a pretty good Asian fusion vibe and a menu to match. Loved there rice dishes and the general Tao chicken was delicious. Well priced for an all you can eat place. Definately a place to revisit in the future. Eat well friends!"}
{"text":"This place is my favourite! The sushi is always incredibly fresh, as is everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Came in for mid-day A La Carte sushi a few Fridays ago. I ordered their Maki Combo (18 pieces), their sushi tasted very good and the presentation was nice as well. My sister also enjoyed their Veggie Maki Combo (18 pieces). They have good portions and reasonable pricing. This is my go-to for sushi every time I visit Vaughan from now on. Hopefully i'll get to experience their AYCE in the upcoming future!"}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located close to home for me so it is a go-to from that respect. Pretty typical for your average AYCE. However, you need to watch out for their holiday pricing which is MORE than they're weekend pricing. We went on January 2, which was. Monday. They charge $30/person! I was shocked... Food is fresh but I think they have some trouble actually making what you order. We had a few items not show up but we were full by the time we noticed anyway. Service staff are nice but not super attentive. Could use a little more training."}
