{"text":"This place is a fast-food Mecca. Despite my best intentions, I have just enough self-control to maintain an unsightly fast-food indebted belly, so I come here often. Much too often. I'm not sure if Misty (who is a lovely and sweet lady) finds it odd that I've recited my order to her enough times that I know her better than most of my immediate family, but if she does find it odd (and I know I do) she's excellent at pretending otherwise. If I ever come in and she asks me if I want \"the regular\" I'll know it's a sign I should cut back. But instead I'll probably just order something different. Maybe I'll add jalapenos to my burger, I don't know. I hope it doesn't get to that point.   The menu at Whataburger is pretty great - it has every option you'd expect from a burger joint and an \"all-time favorites\" menu that has some specialty burgers which are all fantastic, and though their burgers are always higher-priced than some of the other places you can go, they're big burgers. Everything I've tried on the menu has been fantastic, but it doesn't really matter, because I always order one of two things. To start, I always order a patty melt. Two patties, melted cheese, grilled onions and a sauce that I'd go into detail about if I wasn't concerned about alienating readers from displaying an alarming amount of affection for it. The patty melt is big and filling, but me being the careless fat man that I am I usually order a meal of chicken strips on top of it and make it a large. The meal comes with 3 strips, fries, a drink, a slice of texas toast cut diagonally (and we all know bread tastes better when cut that way), and your choice of dipping sauce. I always get gravy because it's perfect for dipping the bread into. Thank god they have diet Dr Pepper in the fountain so that I can keep this meal healthy and low-calorie. I always get spicy ketchup with my order instead of regular. I'm not sure I think it's better - in fact I'm pretty sure it's not, but sometimes the novelty wins out.  Sometimes, when I'm feeling adventurous, I make the patty melt the meal and get 2 honey butter chicken biscuit breakfast sandwiches instead of the chicken strips meal. That's where I find the only limitation with this place - they only serve breakfast between 11 PM and 11 AM. Fortunately I'm a goon and often don't wake up until the sun has gone down, which makes that time period take up a good portion of my day. On the other hand, what should be \"morning\" for me is often long past 11 AM. Oh and there was one other time when the guy working the drive-thru made me pull around front because it was going to take them a little longer to cook up all the food for the massive one-man feast I ordered, and he assured me he would throw in 2 apple pies for making me wait but instead he only gave me 1. I'll hold a grudge over that unforgivable crime until the day I die.  But this whataburger is open 24 hours. Even the inside is open all the time, and that's good because there aren't many other places where I can pig out at 4 AM except Filiberto's which always carries a much stronger \"you might get murdered here\" vibe at that hour, and I like to feel warm and safe while I destroy my body. I've spent enough money here to put one of my future children through college, and sometimes my individual orders are big enough that they cost more than anything you could get at a 5-star restaurant. And it might just be because I'm almost entirely classless, but I'm pretty sure I'd rather eat here."}
{"text":"Eating a whataburger. It's fantastic. Haven't had one in years. It's a perfect compliment to a football game that may be a blowout. My burger had no less that 8 pickles on it. I'm sick of this one pickle bullshit. The bacon could have been thicker, but this burger was easily 1.8x larger than a McDonald's burger. French fries could have been crispier but the had a good flavor. And they offer spicy ketchup. What a burger"}
{"text":"I don't eat fast good, but now I do!  When someone told me whataburger made biscuits n gravy fresh I didn't believe them? And almost was scared to try...  Get the biscuits n gravy and get the jalape√±o and cheddar biscuit... Thank me later! ;p Also their chicken strips are good, unlike it with honey mustard and gravy.  Fast and fresh service!"}
{"text":"The burgers here were meh.  The patties were the size of a McDonalds burger.  I ordered a burger with no pickles and no mustard and it came up \"Dry\" with pickles.  Proof is in my picture.  I would rather go to Sonic Burger over this place."}
{"text":"It is what I have come to expect from Whataburger.  I realize that I may take FOREVER in the drive-thru line, but that is what they normally do. If you are in a hurry you shouldn't go to Whataburger. They start making your food when you order it, therefore it takes a little longer than other fast food burger joints. The taquitos that I had were really hot and tasted great."}
{"text":"Great burgers available all the time. Do not go if you are in a rush but definitely worth the wait. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to eat here in Sunday since she had been craving it for awhile. We ordered our food thru the drive thru and as we pulled away we realized that the burger we ordered was wrong. So we made a u turn, I parked, and went inside to tell them that we ordered this burger with only tomatoes and pickles which had only lettuce and onions. They gladly said they would fix it. The manager took the burger to the cook, fixed it and gave it back to me. As we got in the car we realized that all they did the was scrape the lettuce and onions off and added the pickles and tomato. I thought they were going to make a new one but they didn't and we know that they didn't because there was still two pieces of onions on the hamburger and the meat just smelled like onions. It is a good thing that my mother wasn't allergic because  if she was that could have been bad. Not to mention that the fries we were served were very old that we couldn't eat them... I would not recommended this place to anyone especially if you are allergic. If you want whataburger I would go to the one on Dobson and Broadway in Mesa.. BTW... We ended up throwing our whole order away and went somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Two stars for food, four stars for service. It was after midnight, we were hungry. Don't order the bacon avocado burger unless you like mushy burgers on soggy bread. The chili burger was edible.  Chicken strips were very small portion. Decent fries and rings. Great shakes. Fast friendly walk in service. First time at a whataburger. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I am from Texas so maybe I have high standards for Whataburger.  I have been to this location a few times at all different times of the day and never seem to get fresh food. I Also have had friendlier service,  wish I had recieved that here. Still gets three stars because I love Whataburger."}
{"text":"The restaurant was loud and dirty. And the food was incredibly greasy. I will probably not go back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for ever. But ever since minimum wage went to $10.00 and hour all you see is high school kids not giving a darn about your order. I order a cheese burger with extra mustard and extra ketchup you think I got that? Nope the bun was harder than a rock . I also asked for fresh fries and no onions since I'm allergic to them. I got cold  fries. And extra onions extremely unsatisfied. Especially when the Lorena works that girl is the rudest person I've ever met in fast food she definitely does not belong in customer service."}
{"text":"Randomly came here during our roadtrip.  I thought it would be cool to eat here because of its name :P  These burgers taste as bad as a white castle burger. I can't determine which is worse! I'm giving an extra star because of it's unique name!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Whataburger, I get chicken strips. It is the only place I can think of that gives you a piece of toast with your meal."}
{"text":"I love whataburger the food is always so good and it  actually fills me up unlike most fast food places! The employees are so friendly at every location I have been too they always make you feel welcomed and are so helpful with the menu items"}
{"text":"Delicious! Bought a Double burger yesterday and it was fantastic. I don't like their chicken sandwiches so much, they're usually hit-or-miss, but their burgers are fantastic. The little mustard that they add goes a long way! Workers are very, very nice!  Bonus: Open 24 hours a day!"}
{"text":"The employs are nice. But they are slow and ignore you when you are at the counter. All they care about are their drive thru customers. They tell you to wait yet they aren't doing anything, help the customer you lazy people!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.   The only tea they have is sweet tea.  Very sad.  One order taker two points of sale.  If you want ranch with your onion rings there is an additional charge.   Nickel and dime."}
{"text":"Slowest Fast food restaurant on the planet. I think I have been in line  For 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Open late! This place is always relatively clean when hubby and I visit, and we like that they deliver the food to your table (kind of nice for a fast food joint). We partake of the chicken strips with white gravy and toast from time to time. The burgers aren't bad either ~ pretty large and not frozen-tasting. I also like the fact that they use mustard on their burgers, since I'm a mustard fan. They're also good at honoring my husband's standard order of \"only lettuce and tomato.\" Last but not least, the fries are very boring, but the onion rings are good. Go for the o-rings if you're ordering a burger.  Overall, a good place to catch some late night fast food!"}
{"text":"Great service but it's just McDonald's with better options.  Much better than In andOut but short of 5 Guys, the gold standard."}
{"text":"I really liked Whatabuger when I was in NM... I have tried this Whatabuger several times and it just gets a little worse each time. Today, I wrote this place off; officially! I took my kids in and stood at the register for 5 minutes and all the workers were in the back. They walked by and never made eye contact or even said \"hello\". So, I took my kids and left; never to return!"}
{"text":"Tastes like home made! I love this place, ever since I moved to Arizona about a year ago, I have gone multiple times. My favorite is the Jalapeno burger. That's if you can take spicy :) The meat is great quality and the fries are awesome!!! My mouth waters when I think of this burgers! The customer service is nice too :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the patty melt and some onion rings. The patty melt was amazing. Fast service and great food. The staff was friendly. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome just awesome food good service especially the African American male manager with the long hair he was very helpful."}
{"text":"Forget the fact that virtually all fast food tastes like heaven after a long night of partying. I've been to this location in varying states of intoxication and they have always provided top notch customer service, even though its 3:30am, I'm probably still drunk and probably talking too loud or not making much sense. The people there always have a big smile and treat all their customers very very well. I would recommend this place to any college student in a late night quest for greasy, tasty, delicious food.  The one thing I would recommend is that you specify that your chicken is fresh, and by that I mean that it hasnt been sitting in the warmer for any longer than 5minutes. However that is something you should do at every fast food place."}
{"text":"This Whataburger is usually decent as in 4 stars but I just bought 2 breakfast taquitos with cheese and the eggs were obviously sitting under the warmer for who knows how long bc I thought I broke a tooth when I started to chew my first bite. I spit that out and opened it up and the eggs and the sausage were hard as hell! Everything is supposed to be fresh except breakfast I guess....I wouldn't recommend eating breakfast here AT ALL!"}
{"text":"After having a very good experience there the other day I decided to give them a try for a quick breakfast. They serve breakfast from 11pm-11am! WIN right there!  It was barely 6am and again, friendly service! I don't even remember the last time I ate fast food for breakfast. I had a Jalapeno Cheddar Sausage Biscuit and a Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit. A bit of a wait which was fine because it was made to order for me. Came out hot and was pretty damn good! Hash Browns were a bit boring and simple, but still cooked well.  I can sum this up pretty easy now. THIS is what fast food was like everywhere 40-50yrs ago before Corporate America took over trying to pinch pennies and sacrificing quality. Probably not going to be going back for awhile because I generally don't eat like this, but great to know there is a pretty good 24HR option if I am hungry!  Give this place a try next time you're considering one of those BIG fast food joints for nasty breakfast! You won't be let down!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good old fashion hamburger joint today that still has customer service, but this Whataburger is tops on that list. Every time I have either used the drive thru or gone inside to eat, the staff there has always treated me very well. There is one girl that usually works the drive thru that is the nicest person you would ever have serve you and you can tell she truly wants to make sure you have received your order correctly and even if you change your mind at the last minute, she makes sure you feel okay about it.  Oh did I mention the food there is Great too!  Love their Wataburger with lettuce, tomato, ketchup and mayo only, with an order of onion rings! Mmm Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"My ears are ringing from the loud club music and my stomach is a growlin' I'm kinda drunk still, so what do I do? I go to Whataburger at 2:30am, that's what I do. Tonight's craving was Onion Rings. Jack in the Box was blocked off due to the New Year's Eve block party in Tempe, so we stopped here instead. Good move.  The onion rings were delivered piping hot. The dude warned us, and he was right. I'm convinced there was a grease fire going in the bag there for a bit. You could heat a house with what was coming out of the cardboard box of fried onion goodness.  And these onion rings are pretty damn decent. Horrible for me, I'm sure, but I don't really care at this point. And the KETCHUP (all caps on the container,) it comes in a dip-able container. No bags of ketchup here... only \"Fancy KETCHUP.\"  There's two onion rings left... but they are ALL MINE!  UPDATE: The onion rings are all gone! I ate them all!"}
{"text":"Food was not so good. Staff did not look healthy; Whataburger needs to pay their PHX employees more money."}
{"text":"food is MADE TO ORDER, hold your horses you impatient twaaaaaaa....... love this place,  THIS location is zi best in PHX, WHATABURGER FOR LIFE"}
{"text":"Got the Monterrey melt last night, I've been sick with food poisoning since. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Was the worse burger and fries that I've  had in a long time.burgers and buns were cold and tasteless and fries were also cold.Was so disappointed as I had eaten at the ones in Texas and they were good. My daughter and I felt it was 12.00 that was completely wasted"}
{"text":"I can't believe I am actually going to review a fast good joint, but having just moved out to the west valley from downtown Phoenix, we have been struggling to find good places to eat. I normally do not eat fast food, but this whataburger has been one of the more good and consistent restaurants we have been to on the west side.   The staff here is incredibly friendly.    The whatachickn sandwich is truly crispy and reminds me of the chicken Sammies of my youth.   The fries are consistently good.   My biggest complaint would be the tables. They appear dirty, but it think it actually just the texture and design of the table tops."}
{"text":"Whatadisappointment.  Hyped-up by Fark threads and usually compared to In-N-Out, the burger is as plain as all get out.  The basic Whataburger I got had two dry thin patties sandwiched by two bland Wonderbread-like bun.  Even when I asked for no pickles on the burger, I didn't know that they slathered the patties with a harsh relish paste.  If you like Fatburger but hate the taste, Whataburger is just for you.  Big Mac tastes a lot better and cheaper too."}
{"text":"This location gets 5 stars because of the manager Chris! My boyfriend and I took the survey after a visit and were dissatisfied.  Chris personally sent us an email to get back our loyalty of stopping by at his store, inviting us and guests for dinner. Not only was our whole bill covered, but he was sincere and genuine. He made it right and is an excellent example of customer service!  We now for sure will be back for being treated so good and feel valued as customers."}
{"text":"Drive thru isn't the fastest because they actually make food to order unlike most fast food Burger places.  Always friendly people working"}
{"text":"For a long time, this location had a gentleman named Kenneth (a.k.a. \"KP\") who ran the drive-thru in the mornings, and Kenneth brought this Whataburger's normally good service to a legendary status. He ran as tight ship as I've seen at the drive-thru, and you drove off feeling like he remembered you from your previous visit (even if you had never been here) and that you were receiving personalized service from him. I understood from a previous visit that Kenneth no longer works here, but it's my pleasure to advise that another gentleman named TJ has picked up the ball where Kenneth left off and is likewise doing a fantastic job running their drive-thru. He's fast, friendly, and always has a smile when he hands you your order. Thanks for the great service, TJ - you continue to make this Whataburger location my favorite!"}
{"text":"Love the A1 burger good onion rings also good service"}
{"text":"Worst whataburger I've ever been too. Been too several and none are as bad as this one. Only ordered a large fry and sauce and the fries weren't hot or fresh and they forgot the only sauce I ordered. Lastly the manager was working the window for some reason and almost forgot to give me back my credit card until I said something."}
{"text":"I stop by this place quite a bit to grab a bite when I'm at work. Each time I go I have nothing but great customer service and great food. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"They need to hire some help or something. You shouldn't have wait 30+ minutes to get a couple sandwiches even if it is 2am. It's called fast food for a reason."}
{"text":"I'm finding it hard to believe this WB has two bad reviews.  First off it's a brand new location and is always very clean and this can be a hard thing to find in the fast food world. The first reviewer commented that her burger was smashed.  I'm having a hard time believing this.  WB cooks your burger fresh WHEN YOU ORDER IT then assembles it with fresh fixings and DELIVERS it to your table. Were in the 20 foot walk to your table could the burger have been smashed ?  I can't even comment on the second review.  She's comparing a White Castle to a Whataburger?  This doesn't even make sense to me.  How can a burger MADE FRESH when you ORDER it be a bad thing?  In the fast food world WB makes some of the best burgers there are simply because they are made fresh to order.  I've been visit this WB since they opened a few years ago and have always been extremely happy with everything from the service to the fresh made burgers to the cleanliness of the store.  In the fast food world what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Visited five times per week, chicken sandwich is better than whataburger, although have no idea why chicken sandwich is expensive than beef burger..."}
{"text":"This was my first visit ever and I was blown away. It must be because the cater to the senior citizen population, but this was the absolut best customer service and most polite fast food place I think I have ever been to. The food was good and the prices a little high. I'd go back."}
{"text":"It is a fast foods place. Actually I don't like American foods and burger at all. But their lemon pie is my favorite one. I always go there for lemon pie. Hope they will give more different kinds of pie later."}
{"text":"One word. Awful. Not only did they screw up my order, I didn't get my food until at least 15 minutes later. It wasn't even busy. My friends and I were the only customers. Not only was the service horrific, the food was worse. I ordered the Chicken Fajita Tacos and I'm 99% sure it gave me autism. I'm sorry to say that I can only describe my so-called \"food\" as moist, frequently used condoms, and that was only the fajitas. The chicken, however, tastes like soggy cardboard shared by every single member of homeless community. But wait... there's more! Now let's describe the ground beef. When I ate this, it reminded me of the God-forsaken soil of Arizona: dry and as stale as Harambe memes. Phew. Glad I got that off of my chest. Too bad I can't get this trash out of my stomach though..."}
{"text":"Great food that is made to order, I go inside everytime for that reason...fteah and as fast as fresh can possibly be.   P.S. the party melt with extra butter and onions is the bomb."}
{"text":"DO NOT USE THE DRIVE THRU HERE, you'll wait long enough to make you wish you would have abandoned your order 10 minutes ago."}
{"text":"Burnt hamburger. Took it back, second one same as the first. Disgusted. I just walked out. Left it on the table. Asked for another salt, she never came back."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich mediocre, hash brown sticks and coffee lukewarm.the gal at the window had a nice smile."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place any stars is because the people working here are nice.. but the food is just awful. I work close and have given it multiple chances but the burgers are bland the chicken was dry and the buns do not taste fresh. I would rather have McDonald's and thats saying something."}
{"text":"What? A burger? Is that what I just ate? Whataburger, welcome to your tape. This is Douglas, dying and in my bathroom. That sound in the backround, is me throwing up. The black plague was a cake walk campared to this. The plague killed millions in Europe and now I fear my brain cells will suffer the same fate. The food was so bad it'll literally be the death of me. Goodbye world."}
{"text":"Being from Texas, I've had my share of Whataburger. This one is consistently horrible! Why would anyone want to eat a cold burger or chicken sandwich with less than fresh ingredients and a slice of cold cheese on top? And how about fresh lettuce instead of the old white chunks of iceberg? WAY too many other options out there to eat this crap."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes to order something on drive thru.. Charged me incorrectly.. offered an refund..  Than asked me if I wanted something for free instead.. didn't give me an refund for the difference.. than its not free is it?  After all that didn't even give me the extra pie I asked for..  Never coming back"}
{"text":"Such nice kids working here. They're always so pleasant. The food is pretty good, I like Whataburger just fine, but I'll go out of my way to come here just because the workers are so much faster and friendlier than normal fast food employees."}
{"text":"Whataburger burgers are delicious, that's just a fact. Get yourself a double with cheese and enjoy. 5 stars for this location based on their wonderful staff though! I've been here twice now while in the area on business. Both times staff have been friendly and helpful, but today I was especially impressed. As myself and co-worker were eating, one of the nice women working came over to a trash bin near (but not super close to) the booth we occupied. Before she began emptying the full bag she asked us if it would bother us if she emptied it. \"of course not\" we relied, but I'm super impressed that they put that level of focus on the customer experience to check with us first.  Great work here Whataburger!"}
{"text":"Being a native east coaster, I was so excited to try this food. I had been out the entire day and hadn't had a chance to eat yet,  so my friend and I stopped in late night on New Years Eve to grab a bite. The gentleman working the counter was very personal and attentive, and the food tasted pretty good... but the entire next day I was puking and running to the bathroom. I figured, maybe I am just getting to old to eat the way I used to... but after drinking a bunch of pepto, and a few amodiums, I was still having issues. I decided after a day and a half of vomiting, and intense digestion upsets to go to our local walk in clinic. $150 dollars later, they deducted I have bacterial induced colitis... they ran some blood work on me and results are pending. Considering this was all I had eaten in the 24 hour period, it's highly unlikely it came from another source. Please review proper food handling procedures with your staff, and hand washing etiquette with your crew members, before you people kill some one. I sincerely hope that no one else gets as sick as I am right now. Antibiotics, missing two days off work, feeling miserable, and having to be stuck with needless, and $150 of doctors bills, was not worth eating at your establishment. I will not return, and will ensure I do not recommend your stores or food to anyone in the future."}
{"text":"This place is dead to me starting today. I used to go in there almost everyday day due to the close proximity to my house but after havering my orders messed up over And over again I no longer have the patience to deal with this water burger. Is it seriously that hard to listen to a customer when they are ordering?"}
{"text":"They need more workers poor service had too wait on ordering and then had to wait on food way to long"}
{"text":"We didn't even get straws for our drinks. Burgers were probably pre-made and sitting all day at room temp."}
{"text":"I just had their milkshake........meh, it tasted like frozen ice milk, maybe I am spoiled by Freddies frozen custard,but this was meh....."}
{"text":"I agree with my fellow yelpper, This Whataburger is the best run in town. I eat all over Phoenix Metro area, I get bad service and attitude everywhere! It's refreshing when you get the kind of attention you should get as a customer. The employees here are always polite. The food is good, and one time when it wasn't good, the manager came out and personally apologized and replaced my meal and gave me coupons. I have eaten there many times since, I will go out of my way to go to this Whataburger."}
{"text":"Love the burgers, love the fries, love the spicy ketchup. Wait times are pretty short and staff is always very friendly. I don't come here too often, but occasionally they seem to remember me, which is always nice at any business. The best part about them is that they're open 24 hours, so after a long road trip to northern or southern AZ, I can stop by here on the way home - when I'm absolutely starving but too tired to cook anything and it's too late to order anything else."}
{"text":"Ordered a grilled chicken salad. Paid for a grilled chicken salad. Waited forever at the drive thru window for a grilled chicken salad. Got back to work...no chicken. Thought I'd give them a try. Won't do that again."}
{"text":"Drive Thru staff is very rude and be careful when you order a drink here the girl gave it to me with soda running along side of it and the cup was very sticky. Ask for the cup to be cleaned she gave a lot of attitude. Good place to eat but service very disappointing."}
{"text":"I love Whataburger and I have been to this location a million times, I was just here today and unfortunately I received the worst service tonight. I ordered my food at 9:18 and I was willing to be patient because they had been busy, and I went to tell them my food was not to me yet, and the workers excuse was that they were busy and nothing could be done. It was not until 10 that they came to ask if I ever got my food. However the rest of the people I was with already had their food, they were very kind with refunding my order though."}
{"text":"Pretty good food here, I have had a cold burger on occasion but man does this place take forever, both drive through and inside. I'm currently inside now and I've waited 30 min for my burger and judging by the amount of people still waiting in front of me looks like another 10 min. Hire more staff!"}
{"text":"Worst food I've ever had in my life. Also they won't serve certain items if they are too lazy to make them."}
{"text":"My trek to Whataburger was an artistic quest. I'd never heard of Whataburger before so I thought David Foster Wallace was making it up when he refers to the \"Whataburger Southwest Junior Invitational\" in Infinite Jest (the tennis tournament is made up). When I found out it was a real place, I had to come here.   It wasn't bad and kudos to the woman taking my order. She upsold me to a meal - \"are you sure you don't want a meal, honey?\" Her voice indicated that she was genuinely concerned about my general hunger situation which, admittedly, was extremely high at that very moment. Then there was the wait outside the take-out window, probably 10 - 15 minutes in total. I  figured they must be assembling one king-hell burger in there. But more likely, it took that much time to fill the giant Whataburger cup with Fanta Orange soda. I let out an audible gasp when I saw it - holy crap it was big. Like I could have gone hiking in the desert for miles with nothing but that giant cup of soda to sustain me.   The burger was pretty big. Bigger than anything you'll find at any other fast food joint and don't forget the wait, I think the wait is key. Because that wait is what sets this place apart from say, a Mickey D's or an In-n-Out (which, incidentally, Whataburger is way better. Like the first time I ate an In-n-Out burger that's exactly what it did). So sitting outside waiting behind the big white SUV with the smokey exhaust you're inhaling for the ten minutes it takes for them to make their burger, plus the ten or so minutes it takes for them to cook your own and  assemble your meal, fill the giant styrofoam Whataburger cup with Fanta Orange soda, and deep fry your peach pie (very tasty) lets you reflect on the state of your life in relationship to your expectation of wanting a fast food restaurant to act as an instant gratification machine, when, in fact, by going to those other places, you are perhaps missing out on all this personal attention to your burger, meal, soda, dessert assembly (and don't forget that caring moms-like voice so concerned for your hunger situation), in the space of which time you are allowed to reach out to loved ones via your cellphone or text-messaging system (I was able to call my husband twice and read a magazine article about hiking in Tempe), and think about what you want to do next w/r/t your art and just what the fuck are you doing with your life anyway that you think waiting outside the Whataburger for ten minutes is keeping you from actualizing some potential self that may be far better served by simply having to wait a moment for your food?"}
{"text":"I'm sorry that dude had such a bad time. I I had a great time! I haven't been to a whataburger since i was a kid. I got the patty melt meal and it was heaven! Pure bliss. And it fast. Not cold or moldy and the service wad wonderful! I can't wait to try the breakfast. Everyone should come here. How could you not after seeing the cute commercial? Whataburger can go in my kisser anytime!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for and for what I paid, I guess I shouldn't have expected much more. The food was good, but nothing out of the ordinary for a burger joint. I liked the fries and the small drinks were HUGE.... but isn't that everywhere now a days. A+ for fast and friendly service. Prolly won't visit again--I'd rather go up the street to Micky D's for a Big Mac."}
{"text":"The best customer service! The food was very good. Glad the place is by the new house! Will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"I occasionally come here for late night food, Their is always a long wait but it's expected considering it's late night and half the workers have already gone home. The prices are a little steep, not too bad though. Can't really say anything for the inside as I haven't been in there in many years."}
{"text":"Our food was Cold and the fries taste like we're eating salt packs. 1st and last time eating here."}
{"text":"I've been to a few different Whataburger restaurants before but this location definitely has the best quality food so far. Service is generally good and the wait time relatively short, but this time I was pleasantly surprised by the service I received from Jazmine R; she had a huge smile on her face and gave me excellent eye contact which made me feel very welcome. At first I was confused because I saw she wasn't a manager but a regular employee; as she showed professional attributes while quickly and accurately taking my order. Jazmine is the type of person I would be extremely happy seeing become a manager and taking on more responsibility as she seems more than capable and deserving of a raise/promotion. I will be back to this specific Whataburger not only because of the food, but the great service I just received."}
{"text":"Ultra-attentive service at fast food restaurants is hard to find, but be that as it may, I actually experienced it at the Scottsdale Whataburger during a recent visit.  Not only was the cashier extremely friendly when I ordered, she actually came out to ask me how my burgers were while I was eating.  When is the last time you experienced that level of service at a burger joint?  In any event, the great service at the Scottsdale Whataburger was just one facet of what I loved about the place.  My burgers were cooked to perfection, parking was easy, the prices were reasonable, and there was no line even though I walked in a couple of minutes after noon on a Saturday.  As far as I'm concerned, Whataburger is the best fast food chain in the U.S. (and probably the world).  Even though California is my home state, I have no qualms about making the following bold statement: they should pack up all of the In-N-Out Burgers, ship them up to Oregon where mediocrity is celebrated, and Whataburgers should be installed in their place."}
{"text":"Clean outside and inside.  The bathroom was okay.  The food was hot, completed as asked and well made.  The food was good.  The service was excellent.  The staff was friendly and showed that they cared that you were there.  As far as fast food, this one is on the top list when I go to this side of town.  Thanks."}
{"text":"I love Whataburger soo much.  I don't mess with the original Whataburger, except to add cheese and delicious bacon.  Their cheese is melty and compliments the beef...and it says nice things to the bacon as well.  I also like the breakfast taquitos or chicken strips with country gravy.  Good thing i ate there today or I'd be heading there now.  Oh, they're open 24 hours a day and will make a burger anytime you want."}
{"text":"Much much better than In N Out burger. Had the burger and the kids had the chicken bite meal. Burger was fresh as was the bun. The chicken. It's were just as delicious. Pretty good value as well."}
{"text":"Meal was great as always. However service is always slow here I literally sat at the drive thru for about 10 minutes waiting on one order. Not only that they always seem to forget something when I get home. Whataburger is great but highly recommend another location for accuracy and quicker service. I know i won't be coming to this location anymore."}
{"text":"Garbage food: Lettuce pieces-3 the size of a dime each,      white part of lettuce only. Onion pieces-old,sour taste. Bacon-artificial smoke flavor, no real       bacon flavor, limp, soggy, old. Fries-soggy, wet, partially hard, old. Burger-thinner than McDonald's. Chicken in fajita taco-artificial charcoal       flavor, but no chicken flavor. Pop-normal Buns-soggy, but normal flavor. Conclusion:  the pop is okay, but the food went into the garbage.  Garbage quality.  Extreme ripoff. Unfriendly, unsmiling.  DISGUSTING!"}
{"text":"What happened to Whataburger  it use to be so good! Now it's just lame! I came about two months ago to this same location my burger was dry and my fries were cold. And they were out of ketchup.so I thought it was just bad timing. This evening me and my family came for dinner I had even forgot about my last experience here till I took my first bite it all came back to me dry burger cold fries and not so friendly service the only thing good was they had ketchup!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a fast food restaurant that was closer to my place. They never get your order right, and you usually end up spending at least 10 to 15 minutes in the drive thru. I sat there (not late at night) and watched 8 people stand around by the drive thru window, while I waited for 10 minutes just to have my payment taken from them. After almost 20 minutes in this drive thru at 3:30 in the afternoon, I got home to discover that my order was completely wrong. Thanks whataburger, I really appreciate all that."}
{"text":"I'm giving one star because I have to in order to start this comment. Absolute horrible customer service every time I've been to the store. I went to the drive-through last time young man was very rude and after his rudeness I did not feel comfortable eating food that passed through his hands. As I walked in to speak to the manager I saw him run back to the managers office before I can get to them so I walked back outside to my car and just called. The manager gave me the same line of shit you would hear any place that he will have a talk with the young man which I doubt.  I will never go to this location again and I would advise you not to even bother!"}
{"text":"I have always loved Wataburger. Except one night when my bf and I went to grab a burger, they were having some kind of research group(taste testing their food). In the 20 mins we were there we watched them throw away at least 15-20 uneaten burgers. This made me so upset to see them waste so much, there are so many hungry people in this world. Other then this research group, i love that place"}
{"text":"It really sucks to have to pay for Jalape√±o Ranch and then they don't put it in the bag even when you ask for a second time at the window.  Plus food today was very cold. Very dissatisfied with today's food all around and usually place is pretty good. Step your game up Wataburger Goodyear!"}
{"text":"The fact that I customized my order by removing onions and pickle, addimg cheese, and receiving it in 3 minutes, should of been a sign.  It was a slow day for my brain.  The burger was cold, not very flavorful.  This was my first visit to a Whataburger on my life and I'm 48.  I won't eat at any Whataburger for the rest of my life.  Gross."}
{"text":"Food was real good ,combo size was more than I thought,condiments were fresh and tasty.i will stop on my return trip home.It has been a while since I been out here in Arizona,this and cracker barrel are my usual stops for food."}
{"text":"First time here. There was only two cars in the drive-through. I thought it would go pretty quick but  it ended up taking about 10 minutes to get my food. Then I ordered honey mustard,the guy said it would be 38 cents. He had my card so I said, \"okay\". when I drove off I realized I didn't get any honey mustard. The burgers were terrible! Yellow lettuce, yellow/green tomato, and way too much onion.And is it normal for you guys to put cheese on the bottom bun? No, flavor! I got a \"Diet Coke \" which was really a cup filled with ice and about three sips of Diet Coke."}
{"text":"Took longer to order and get our food than I typically expect from a fast-food drive-thru. However, the food more than made up for the wait. The burgers were awesome. My favorite option at Whataburger is the double green chili burger."}
{"text":"Entered the drive-thru at 2:45 this morning.  Didn't leave until 3:14.  So much for fast food!"}
{"text":"I was craving a Green chili cheeseburger and remembered this joint. Delicious, especially if you are looking for a old fashion hamburger joint. The green chili was HOT, I loved it. Fries were fresh and came with a big ass drink. I did drive thur, service was fast friendly."}
{"text":"I've been gone a long time away from home and I never - ever would have said this before now but, IMISSED MY WHATABURGER!!!   I've eaten at so many other fast food burger places all of this country and in other countries that I can say with authority and confidence that this Whataburger will be one of the best fast food burgers you'll ever eat!  Sure there are better burgers, but not fast food!  In-N-Out is a very close tie however you get more burger for your money and the taste is just as good!"}
{"text":"Went in this evening for a late night meal and I can honestly say it was THE most pleasant and enjoyable experience I have ever had at a fast food establishment! Marie was extremely friendly and very accommodating to our food requests  she was fast and efficient and our food was pipping hot and delivered to out table with a smile! I will be back because of her. She made my evening I wish there were more like her!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best fast food joints in town. The place is new, clean and nice looking. The staff greets customers as they enter. The Whatachicken sandwich is my favorite."}
{"text":"Just wanted to take a moment to commend the staff for their exceptional service.  Truly amazing for a fast food establishment!   The chicken salad was also delicious!  My first visit to Whataburger...and what a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Best fast food burgers in this town for sure, and open 24/7 too. It's my go to for good food fast!"}
{"text":"Bomb burgers place in nice and clean. Stoped by on our way back home to Cali booooooomb burgers"}
{"text":"When I was visiting for a concert this was the only place open when I was drunk at 1am on a Monday morning! Thank you Whataburger!"}
{"text":"I love whataburgers chicken tenders but the last time i went it seemed like they where pretty old chicken., Very hard to chew. Hopefully next time it would be better"}
{"text":"Let's start off with the food. Cold and tasted funny. Had to ask two times for condiments and then had to actually go get them myself because they have them behind the counter. Witnessed gossip in both English and Spanish while cursing in front of the customers. Then a group of employees decided to sit in Dinning area to continue gossiping while on the clock. It was like a high school cafeteria. Then there was a girl the team members were socializing with while giving her free food and beverages in front of paying customers. Seriously the unprofessionalism was ridiculous. You guys really need to get a hold of all the employees at this store, who worked on April  28, 2017 at 2:30pm. There is a picture I posted of the few sitting while giving free food.  Upper management needs to speak with the shift leader about having team meetings in front of customers and speaking badly about another employee who had just left."}
{"text":"This is the slowest location. They are all slow, but this one takes the cake. Been here for 15 min at 12:30am and have red even ordered yet. Full line in the drive through. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Just not good but I've had worse.  The bun was mashed down and you could see finger prints.  will not go back"}
{"text":"We love wataburger, that being said..i went though the drive through last night. .. My chicken was RAW , burger and fries were cold and soggy, when i took the food back at 9pm, there were only 2 guests in restaurant but the manager was to busy to come out and acknowledge me. The girl at the counter told me she needed my receipt and she would remake the food I wasn't offered a gift card there was no apology it was made to seem like it was my fault that they messed up my food. The manager did take the time to come out of the office walk over to the grill and glare at me as she tried to remake my burger. Hearing one of the girls at the drive thru window laugh at the fact that I had eaten half a chicken strip before I realized it was raw was the bottom line for me... in what world does a manager find this behavior acceptable???  I walked out with no food ,still hungry, angry, upset and out $19. I will never ever return to this Whataburger!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing hands down. Just had that the sweet and spicy bacon Whataburger and it tasted great. The only reason why this is getting a 4 start is the help needs to pay attention. I requested 2 regular ketchups. And they gave me one spicy ketchup. It's not that hard."}
{"text":"Great customer service.  Food was delicious and the root beer shake was perfect. Wish we had a  whataburger in southern California."}
{"text":"Momo took our order in the drive thru and she was so patient and kind. She should get an award for her customer service skills. I asked her for a rootbeer milkshake and she was willing to make one for me even though it wasn't on the menu. The food was delicious and hot. We will definitely come back to this location when we are in Arizona."}
{"text":"10/31 @1:19am visit   Walked into front door to an empty yet very clean lobby, upon entering parking lot I could see a packed drive thru..so expected a little wait, but this was beyond little.   I stood at counter for 3mins. During which, Cook cleaned grill, spatula, pulled frys, checked his screens, and cooked. Asst to Cook made burgers, made frys, talked with cook about me (they looked at me), took boxes out of back, broke down box. Boris (MOD)   Now at 5 min (pulled out chair and am sitting, still nothing has been said to me. Boris has helped 4 cars since I entered making over 20 trips between fry station and drive thru window, comes to front runs credit card on front counter comp. Looks at me says \"be right with you\" as mono toned as he could. (6:00) Goes back completes 5th car after returning to grab food from fry station. At about 7:00 mins in he returns to front and says \"what can I get you?\"  (after 7mins he was no more excited to see me then a dog going to the vet)  I explained my order and did one at a time since it was same item different preps, yet was still wrong. Asked for extra sauce for 2 large frys and 3 taquitos, got 3 sauces, which he had to go get from drive thru, where he again serviced another car, while I waited for extra sauce, my 3 sauce packets.  No Teamwork No simple hold on Bad CS by far."}
{"text":"Have been in this location many times.  Great service and food is at Whataburger levels. Staff is always nice and attentive to your needs to fill your order correctly.  With this location right next to ASU, it does get busy when the bars get out. In true Good CS form this staff handles the extra push of guests very well and treats both walk in and drive thru guests with care.    Open 24 hours by foot or car.   Bike Rack.  Changing stations not sure.     Good or Bad CS    This was Good!"}
{"text":"This place really has gone down hill!!! 2 yrs ago they had it right, however my last 3 visits have been a complete fail!!!   Orders completely wrong and the fries were the worst I had in many years"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is great, but the lemon pies are incredible. Service us always great and the food is hot. I would highly recommend this establishment to people who want an upgrade in their \"fast food\" options. Even the grilled cheese us spectacular"}
{"text":"Very nice staff. Used to have a prob w them messing up orders but not any more. Manager Gina is very sweet."}
{"text":"Dont usually review fast food but this place is awesome! You have some great people here working on the night shift!"}
{"text":"Ordered 4 honey butter chicken biscuits and took them home. The chicken strips must have been hours old they were old and disgusting. I worked at kfc when I was young and these should have never been served. Disappointing."}
{"text":"First, I am impressed with the cleanliness of this restaurant. Between rushes, a staff person is out in the dining room cleaning tables, doors, restrooms,etc. Second, I have eaten here for years and the food is very consistent and tasty. Third , the staff is friendly and easy going. All together a very positive dining experience!"}
{"text":"Rude and unhelpful.   I have visited this location twice and both times felt unwelcome and even unwanted. I consider myself friendly and helpful so I can't image how they treat their difficult customers.   I used to enjoy going to this chain but the service has left a bad taste in my mouth.   **Bring back the chop house burger**"}
{"text":"Have went to this location twice now, service is fine, food is good...would be so much better if it was actually hot though. Not a big fan of the burgers but their chicken strips with buffalo sauce & onion rings hit the spot, perfect late night munchie meal  the drive thru wait is kind of ridiculous for it being a fast food establishment"}
{"text":"I am not even kidding when I say that this is the best breakfast place around.  The prices are so low and the quality of the food and service is out of this world.  The biscuit  and gravy is amazing.  I have not had this great of gravy in a long time.  My all time favorite is the jalapeno cheese biscuit with sausage and egg. I dipped my hash browns in the gravy and it was insanely good.  We went through the drive through and it was a bit slow or I would have given them 5 stars for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Good food topped with great service! They treat you like they would in a regular restaurant. First time ever at one of these and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"my husband and i  had never been to a whataburger  and  decided to try it out  well when we walked in  the place was clean  and smelled great  the cashier   came up smiling  and when asked even recommended  a few different  things to try   as we waited for our food  i sat and watched  the staff   and what i saw was  pretty awesome   staff washing their hands between   different tasks , and making sure there was not much waste  when filling  containers , smiling and working together as a team without being rowdy and disrespectful    the manager was unavailable to talk but i did see him walking and talking to his crew as well as helping  with tasks  the only thing i wish was different is that  i could have told the manager  personally  how impressed i was    great job  :) oh and  a side note  the burgers were great"}
{"text":"This review is for those not familiar with this chain: I have heard of this chain for years. Some people say it's better than IN n OUT. I went to Phoenix to visit family and I saw a Whatabuger. I HAD to find out what this place was all about: it's ok. I like it. It is NOT better than IN n OUT. I'd rank it with Carl's Jr. It's a decent place."}
{"text":"Dude, why have I never heard of this place before! Oh, because they don't have any in California . . . damn.   Like others have said, this is an In & Out Equivalent, but in my humble opinion, I think Whataburger is better. You get more food for the same price and better service.  And the burger tastes more \"real\" than In and Out (Sorry to those who think that is blasphemous).    My boyfriend and I went here twice on our visit to Tempe.  Gotta load up on the goods while we can!"}
{"text":"I come when I have quick, close, and edible on the mind!  The food is pretty good for fast food ( I am a picky fast food eater.)   Eating in the dinning room is something I suggest. The general manager makes rounds asking how you are doing and even offering to refill your drink! I was without a drink once and a crew member even gave me a medium cup to sip on something. Hospitality is great, food is good, Comes out piping hot ( my burned tongue fell victim though ) what else could ya want from a fast food joint!  The dinning room is open 24 hours which is awesome when coming home from a concert or late movie."}
{"text":"Due to my job I tend to be out and about at crazy hours.  So this is a place I tend to hit up between 11pm and 1am.  It takes a while to get your food, but in this case I am saying that is a bonus and not a negative.  Their food is always fresh and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! I was on lunch 30 mins mind you and went in for a 2go order . Im the only person in line. I waited 10mins for a cold crusty burger and half cooked fries... not going back to this location! !"}
{"text":"Whataburger is so much better than McDonald's.  There is a new McDonald's at Granite Reef and McDonald Dr. SOOO bad.  Three tries and I'm done with this location.    Went to this Whataburger and had a very tasty burger.  My new favorite fast food burger.  Friendly staff.  Wait inside was a bit long but the burgers were fresh and hot."}
{"text":"This is the worst whataburger experience I have ever had, four of us had lunch here and we all agreed that the bread was stale and the meat was cooked hours before we arrived (dry and tasteless beef), the only reason you're getting two stars instead of one is because the lettuce, pickle, onion and tomato were fresh. French fries were good."}
{"text":"Great food, courteous, friendly staff. Highly recommended! Eat here today! Clean restaurant, quick delivery of my order. They have good manners ."}
{"text":"I actually had a really good experience at this place. We went out from California for the Packers vs Cardinals game and were nervous to eat anywhere in Arizona with our packers gear. Lol. But seriously the employees here were excellent. Service was great, friendly, and they were very attentive. The food was also good. I heard good things about Whataburger and coming from CA had to try. The ladies at the counter were very dedicated to their job and the place was very clean."}
{"text":"Outstanding lunch. Whataburger & fries with spicy ketchup. This restaurant is always clean and employees are helpful."}
{"text":"Finally a place with good food and great service. Very clean, people are actually nice too you. Order your food and get your drink. Sit down and they bring your order and condiments to you. Very pleasant people, always cleaning and helpful.   Fries are freshly made. Burger is delicious. Glad I found this place. Not like the other burger places where they are rude. I'm impressed."}
{"text":"This place always gets my damn order wrong!!!!! Always pay for extra bacon and they never put it on and I ask for no onion and they put it on there. Every time I go it's not busy either so like how hard is it to do your job?... DO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken sandwich meal w fries and a drink and a double cheeseburger meal w fries and a drink and order 4 sauces. They forgot my 2/4 of my sauces and the chicken sandwich was SSSSOOO bad. It was soggy and tasted like food poisoning."}
{"text":"What-a-waste!!!  Been here twice, both times.... Service and food was way below par....  Burgers - ok Fries - cold and terrible Root beer - tasted like fizzy water, un-drinkable   After getting home, Missing item from kids meal and was given the incorrect drinks for kids meal.   $28 bucs wasted.... The frozen section in Fry's has better food!!!"}
{"text":"Andrew S. - VERY nice young man. His upbeat, positive attitude will make him very successful in any endeavor. This place is very lucky to have him. I don't eat fast food late at night often, but I will definitely be coming back here if I do, and perhaps maybe just to be greeted by him again. He doesn't know it but he made me day. Excellent customer service and great food. This place really has it together, I can appreciate that. Kudos to management!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Just a cheap, home-grill type burger. Inexpensive. Great for late night snacks.   Fries this time around weren't very fresh, which aggravated me."}
{"text":"Wow, Thank you for your amazing costumer service and friendly staff! I was at your location on 1/20/17 and was shocked at how polite and friendly your staff was. Thank you Betty and Pam!"}
{"text":"Great service GReat burgers and the best apple pies FRIED like McDonalds use to! HELL YES!"}
{"text":"10 minutes in line Yay for me, oh by the way if you put caution contents may be HOT on your coffee cup. Make sure you put the lid on properly."}
{"text":"Don't do this to yourself. Don't be mean. Don't go to Whataburger at 1 in the morning. Especially at this location. Your punishment will be indigestive agony and general malaise for a long time afterwards.  And if you do go and suffer the consequences, all I can say is, \"I told you so.\"  But why suffer?"}
{"text":"If Terri's isn't here, go elsewhere.   We had to wait to order.  Even then, they served a customer behind us, first.   Typically I'd give a full 5, but not today.  Were this my first visit, I'd be giving 1 star.  The kid who way available was clueless, the manager wouldn't come over; the grill girl had to come off the grill to take our order, then proceeded to take the person behind us' order first....."}
{"text":"Good fast food for the money; the ingredients tasted fresh and were made to order. \"What a burger!\" indeed."}
{"text":"I went to Whataburger a couple weeks ago for biscuits and gravy to bring to my mother's place while visiting her.  I usually make breakfast at home, but I was feeling lazy that morning, and wanted to do something nice for the woman who gave me life.  Anyway, I drove up to the window, and probably THE friendliest person at a drive-thru in the history of fast food greeted me.  I believe he may have been the manager that morning.  He said good morning, asked how my day is, made sure everything was in the bag, asked if I wanted cream in my coffee.  I said I'd like cream please, and he asked me which flavor of cream I'd like from their selection and named off which flavors they have.  I was thinking, \"Wow!\"  I was very impressed!  ...If people in fast food only realized that it's the little pleasant things you do for the customers that can really make someone's day."}
{"text":"terrible less than mediocre burgers, after waiting nearly 30 minutes through drive thru, which wasn't the issue,  i just can't grasp how you can get my order wrong after having 30 minutes to prepare it. I ordered 2 simple bacon cheeseburgers medium combos, the result; tasteless and dry, not worth my patience,  fries were fine."}
{"text":"The first time I had Whataburger was in Houston. For locals, I imagine it's like no big deal, but for this Cali girl living in Atlanta, it was all over when we spotted Whataburger in Chandler.   We decided to go in and grab some food. The cashier was super friendly, the restaurant was clean. I ordered a #1, the Whataburger with fries and a drink.  Food came out fast. Our cashier became the sauce fairy carrying a tray with a ton of sauce options to choose from. Want spicy ketchup? Bam, they have it! Want salsa verde? They have that too! Slinging sauce like it was her job, well, I guess it kind of was.  Anyhoo, if you are looking for a solid bite to eat in a clean restaurant I would recommend this stop off."}
{"text":"Let me get this out of the way. I'm not giving Whataburger 5 stars because it is a super classy gourmet place but because for what it is, it's the best.   Whataburger is my go for anytime I want comfort food.   Today I went in for a delicious burger, the line was a little long but for whataburger, I'll wait. The manager opened the second register and called us over, he was the perfect combination of fast and friendly, an excellent quality of a manager. As we walked away he mentioned that he's a Giants fan too. Extra points.     We didn't wait long before enjoying lunch. The burger was perfect, the fries were hot and the place was clean, wiped down and ready to sit.     I love this location because it's always open, the food always tastes the same and if you do the online survey you get a free Whataburger. Yes please!"}
{"text":"They are slow as hell and very rude. I hope it goes out of business and they put an in n out or Chick-fil-A here. Correction- Paola is very sweet. Great customer service. Everyone else sucks."}
{"text":"What you are reading is right about the fly's. Its HORRIBLE. I mean like hundreds in the dining area and it is clear that everyone else who went there is having the same issue. I Love Avi L.'s review because it was so direct, to the point and honest, but I want to add to this if I may...  Don't know about the drive thru because I went inside. The front desk cashier lady is rude. She talks way too fast and when you ask to have her repeat what she said because it is impossible to understand her, she responds back with an attitude. He was right. She is rude as hell.   It looks like the crew is all into themselves and they clearly don't care one bit about the place or the guests.   What saddens me is I am usually a big Whataburger fan. Really am. I have been to several in Texas and the experience is always great. Staff who likes the people coming in. No flys. Fast service and clean. THIS place is like it is managed by a person who has a grudge on his shoulders about WhataBurger and is hell bent on ruining the franchise.   We actually left mid-eating because we got way too tired pushing away the flys from our food and the B.S. excuse is it's hot outside and that's why there is so many flys is insulting everyone who knows that this is not the case anywhere else in Phoenix.   SO IF YOU WANT A REAL HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND RUIN YOUR DESIRE FOREVER TO GO TO A WHATABURGER... just drop by here!"}
{"text":"I like the food BUT the reason for the rating is the lady at the drive through this morning 5/4/17.    She was rude and practically threw my bag to me.. not interested in going back until she is gone or attitude has completely changed - the guy who I usually get has kept me coming back - sure wish he was there - cuz it does bring down your day to deal with that.,"}
{"text":"I went through the drive through and I knew it would be very busy since it was Saturday. I finally got to the window and had to pay extra for BBQ Sauce since I don't care for ketchup, got out of the parking lot and the Fry's are cold. Not going back to get this fixed since it's late and they are way busy"}
{"text":"Whataburger has a decent burger, but is definitely not one of my favorite places even for fast food. This location hasn't been too busy on the few occasions that I have dined here though, so it has been quick and convenient for me."}
{"text":"Great service! Fresh food. The gentleman in the drive through (Zack) was very nice even at 5am. Being from Texas a couldn't have expected any better service."}
{"text":"This place has awesome service they really pay attention to what you want. Casher Chardonnay is very friendly and great with her Costomer service skills and always smiling. So when going in there ask for her and you can see what I mean."}
{"text":"Great service and great food here, Whataburger has the most delicious french fries here."}
{"text":"I love the food here at Whataburger, it is super addicting and delicious and I don't mind because it is very tasty."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about other Whataburgers in the Phoenix area but I live near this particular Whataburger and it's drive through service is beyond slow.  Luckily the drive through lane is not curbed so if it takes too long you can leave.  I have had the pleasure of doing this once when I had ordered two Whataburgers and was still in line waiting 10 minutes later.  When I have endured the torture, I arrive at the window and the workers are chit-chatting with each other and are much more concerned about their conversation rather than moving cars through the line.  Although I do enjoy the food they put out, it is not worth 10-15 minutes of my car idling in line."}
{"text":"Can't get a burger with green chile in Naperville! So when driving thru Phoenix, we always stop for one at Whataburger. Plus this place has nostalgia for us from when we lived in NM. I think Blake's Lotaburger is much better, but this is adequate. Big burger. Hard to eat while driving, so don't try."}
{"text":"Another tradition as I leave Sky Harbor and head north in AZ. I can't get green chile burgers in my town, and these are big and beautiful with lots of chile. This last time I was here, though, the gal behind the counter assured me I wanted the green chile burger meal and I didn't check that out thoroughly enough. So what I ended up with was a double burger with cheese and chile (plus fries and a drink). No, no, no. I wanted a hamburger with one patty, no cheese, and lots of chile. So be forewarned if you are not familiar with the menu! When you get what you want, though, the burger is amazing. No reason to get those fries, they don't add anything to the experience."}
{"text":"Tasty! Staff was friendly and helpful... Love to stop by when in the area. We ordered a #1 & #5 combo"}
{"text":"Whataburger's are hands down the absolute best hamburger I have ever eaten... Whatabuger's are fairly priced which deliver the best taste you will ever experience!!"}
{"text":"I lowered my rating for this place after a bad experience today. I would have to say now that they are hit or miss, depending on who's working on the shift when you arrive. One thing that has really gotten on my nerves is the neurotic way they serve condiments (ketchup, spicy ketchup, mustard, salsa, etc..) in little packets that you usually see in diners for butter and jelly. And they put them in a display box similar to Stash or Bigelow tea and politely (almost proudly) ask you how many of each you want (although I suppose there is no limit). All this fuss around condiments strikes me as weird. I've come to believe that any restaurant that doesn't simply give you bottled condiments when you're eating in is messed up and will probably disappoint you in other ways as well. I had the same issue with U.S. Egg. Still...Good tasting burgers and a clean place."}
{"text":"After I ordered, we had to wait about 15 minutes just to get to the window. Once we got our food and went home, I noticed the large fry and medium fry on top of my burger. Honestly, they aren't that heavy, but my burger was squished flat, to the point where I tried to squish it some more just to see how squished it was and it barely inched. Seriously, no one wants a completely squished burger. Could have went to McDonald's and get a NOT squished burger. Maybe it is just this location, but I want to give some advice to the workers. Please, don't squish the shit out of any customers burger."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in to grab a bite after some golf.  Katie was waiting for us with a warm smile, exuberant personality and some great patience!  We both knew what WE wanted however I was going to surprise my daughter with one and she likes almost nothing on it and I need to make sure I get it right...;)  Even though they were busy I never felt rushed or on the spot to get moving she let me fumble around as I built my daughter's burger, thanks for your patience Katie!!!  All the Whataburgers I have ever been in are immaculate and this was no exception, the staff always do a great job and always look forward to my next Monterey melt, burger not chicken (gross)."}
{"text":"I LOVE Whataburger, my favorite burger in the valley! Whenever I am asked would I like to grab a burger and where Whataburger is the first answer off my lips... I almost ALWAYS get the Monterey Jack or just a whataburger, but today I felt I would broaden my horizons.  I ordered a double bacon burger with avocado...HUGE mistake!!!  The bacon was GROSS and the avocado tasted funny as well....was not a good lunch, very disappointed...the bacon tasted as though it were days old and reheated, the avocado was mushy most definitely not what I would expect from Whataburger.  I don't know if it is just this location but this was my first visit here and most likely my last...I gave it the three stars only because of my previous visits to the other locations...."}
{"text":"Ok, let me assure you that you should stay far, far, FAR away from this location. Granted, I have been to no Whataburger! since this location (which I tried twice since it is right across the road from were I live), but both experiences were SO bad that I will probably never try again.   Let me start off by saying that both visits were identical, in every way. And both visits were terrible, in every way. Why did I give it another shot? Everyone has bad days. Now, I'm not really a big fan of fast food, but as I said earlier, it's right across the road from where I live, and we're all creatures of convenience from time to time, so why not? I pulled into the drive-thru, up the screen and was friendly greeted. I assessed the menu, as I always do, for probably one second too long, before I decided on one of the meals, which was I believe a cheeseburger meal of some sort. There was a huge sign offering a new lemon pie. I wanted to try a lemon pie. It sounded good, I like lemon stuff, why not? \"Sorry, we're out of lemon pies.\" Not quickly forgetting the large sign advertising the lemon pies, I reluctantly parted ways with the pipe dream that was: lemon pie. I drove directly up to the window with no wait (curiously uncommon in retrospect) and my money was taken quickly, change returned quickly. So far so good (aside from the bitter conclusion of the great lemon pie saga). But wait my friends, this is where the fun begins. As I part with my money, the window begins to close. Soon to be the barrier between myself and my impending dinner for an excess of 10 minutes. I wait, and I wait, and I wait some more. I see the woman who took my money pass by several times, no eye contact. And even though it cannot be expressed in writing how long it actually felt like waiting for this meal, it was a really long time. Think about the longest time you've ever waited at a fast food window for your food. Multiply that by at least 2, but most likely 3 or 4. That's how long I waited. Maybe one more second for extra emphasis. Finally, I was handed my meal, and I peeled off, extremely frustrated over this scenario. Oh, and of course the meal was absolutely terrible. And I do mean terrible. Old, cold and full of mold. Well probably, I mean it might as well have been.  Anyway, a month or so later, I was hungry, nothing sounded good or convenient, when in the distance, loomed the W I had begrudgingly renamed WheresMyBurger? Ok, Ok I thought to myself. I'll give them one more chance. Pulled up to the window, picked out another meal, a chicken sandwich this time, I think, and yes you guessed it, a lemon pie. Guess what? They were fully stocked with lemon pies. Just kidding, out again. I wanted to drive away right there, but was hungry and decided to wait. Maybe it'll be quicker. Nope, as long as last time. And the food was even worse.  So in conclusion, and proceeding most likely the longest fast food review you have ever read, I urge you, fellow food eaters, to stay far, far away."}
{"text":"My friend and I were just on our way back home and starving so we decided to stop here. Not only did it take us 20 minutes to get our food, it was super super salty, tasted bad, and also they almost forgot my friends French fries. The only thing I liked was their shake"}
{"text":"They get your food right and it is good. How can you go wrong with whataburger? Each time i go to Phoenix I will visit. Wish they had these in CA."}
{"text":"Im NOT Sure what happened here. The service & quality of food has definitely taken a turn for the worse. What the heck has happened to people taking pride in what they do? Some people may think working in fast food is a low job, I however have much respect for anyone that braves a cruel public to make & serve fast food.  Whoever is currently responsible for training here is truly doing the worse job ever. My Order was wrong, Even the attempt To fix the error was wrong. Other patrons had looks of total disbelief because to watch the staff struggle to do their job was almost painful. So what I ended up with was a cold cheeseburger. Disgusting. Inedible. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is amazing as always. Love the prices. All employees have great customer service!"}
{"text":"I visit this location frequently and have always had good experiences, except for the last time, which was on 9/25. My boyfriend and I ordered food at about 11:05pm and waited 15 minutes for it. The workers did not seem to be in any hurry.  Unfortunately, we did not think to check the food before we left, and when we opened it we saw that his sandwich did not have the sauce it was supposed to come with, and one of my apple slices was brown and mushy. Also, both of our buns were very stale, to the point where parts of mine were literally hard and crunchy.  I'm not sure if this location is under new management or if something weird was just happening that night, but it made me very disappointed and hesitant to go back."}
{"text":"I ordered the sweet & spicy bacon burger. I asked what comes on it since it was my first time ordering it. Mustard was not mentioned, but there was a huge glob of mustard on my burger. It was either made incorrectly, or I was misinformed. Regardless, I did my best to scrape it off. The fries were cold, so I asked for fresh ones. I did appreciate that no hassle was given, and my fries were replaced.  Lobby appeared clean, and the other burger we ordered was made correctly."}
{"text":"I would give it 3 1/2 stars. I am putting 3 because I just can't give it 4 but I feel bad giving it 3. It is good but not the greatest. For fast food it is a little step above bigger chains. It is kind of clean and kind of local.  The Green Chili Double is really good. Sometimes they are hotter then others it depends on the chili but that is a good thing because at lest you know they are using real chilies and not some lab created trickery. Even a regular Whataburger Double with cheese is good. The fries are good too. They just aren't blow your mind good. Plus they have a rep for being a little on the dirty side. Just a little nothing to get them shut down just not white glove clean as some other places. Also they are just a few dollars more expensive then the regular fast food place. I would go again and I have once in a long while. Just not the first choice with so many other great places to choose from but still a choice."}
{"text":"Never had a Whataburger until it was late last night and I spotted that it was open at 11PM.  Ordered a double cheeseburger with grilled onions, cheese (40 cents extra), extra pickles, ketchup and onions.  I also ordered a breakfast biscuit with bacon egg and cheese for the morning.   The burger was totally packed and literally fell apart (in a good way).  Their bun is not one of those huge fat buns so holding the stuff together is difficult.  But I like their flatter bun without the huge dome.  Remember, the larger the bun the more calories you consume.   The biscuit was not as good as the competitor's (M).  The biscuit needs to be more crumbly, and the combination of flavors just doesn't make it.  Even the bacon tastes better at the other place.   I would go back for the burger especially since they are open late!!!"}
{"text":"Waved at the dude in grey. Laughed at me and didn't wave back. Rude af! Also the strawberry shakes taste like medicine.....   Gravy is good as fuck. Sell it by the gallon please"}
{"text":"I entered this establishment today and I was immediately greeted by what I assumed was the manager.  Being in the same industry,  I look for little things most don't see.  The staff was friendly and had smiles on there faces when interaction with guests.   That impressed me, but, what most impressed was the one I assumed was a manager asking how my food was as he cleaned his restaurant.   To me, that shows pride in you're job.  To ask a guest how there food is at a fast food joint is above and beyond!  Kudos to Eliot!"}
{"text":"pretty good place. The burger was made well, the star of the meal was the root beer shake. Also the chicken tenders with gravy is really good. Though this last time the tenders were way over cooked and quite a bit dry but they normally do them well."}
{"text":"Worse Whataburger yet! I have been a customer and an employee here and this place I can tell you does not care about your food!! They let the parties sit out for 20 mins and serve them up along with the fries being in the heater as well!!"}
{"text":"They make it the way you like it. This location has been solid for a few years. I don't come her often, but when I do, It hits the spot!"}
{"text":"This is the smallest, most inaccessible Whataburger I've ever been to-- and I've been to a lot of Whataburgers, in a lot of states.  No parking, next to no seating and a near-suicidal entry/exit.... Wow.  If the food wasn't good, I'd say skip it and make your life a little easier.  The food's pretty good, though.  The service was efficient and friendly, and they got my order correct,so I'm happy with my experience.  Its open 24/7, and close to home.  I'm sure I'll be revisiting.  Its a good Whataburger, with some shortcomings.  Nobody's perfect."}
{"text":"Great service! Monique was our cashier, super nice lady. Had such of good time with my friends there."}
{"text":"Great service, speedy, and the food is very delicious. Will return. Only thing I dislike is they charger you for barbecue, etc...my triple cheeseburger was fire  nuff said!!!"}
{"text":"Best Dr Pepper ive ever had but by far the worst fries I have ever had. Literally taste like they were made last week and they didn't even bother to put them in the microwave! Very very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Place is empty. My girl and I are the only ones here. I tell them no pickels on my burger. My girl no onions. Really they got both wrong. Now we know why it is empty. Fail!!!!"}
{"text":"We usually eat in at this location. We went through the drive thru tonight. Hard to hear on the intercom. Got our food home. My sons bun was MOLDY in 4 different spots so he had to eat his hamburger without the top part of his bun. My onion rings were frozen cold and my husband could only eat HALF of his double cheeseburger because it was RAW RED. Super disappointed we just spent 30 bucks on dinner and we didn't even enjoy it. Guess from now on we will continue to just go in so we know our stuff will be cooked and fresh and not moldy."}
{"text":"I just moved here and the Whataburger is right down the street.  I have been there a few times and I really dig the burgers.  They are much bigger than most fast food chains with a slightly toasty bun.  They seem to be a little tricky to order, but I am getting there since I only get them \"Plain and Dry with Cheese\".  I really enjoy the fries they are slightly squishy which is just the way I like them.  They even have ketchup in the little dunking containers.  The only down side is they seem to take quite awhile when you are in the drive through. Haven't quite figured that out yet.  Maybe I'll go in and order and see if it takes long."}
{"text":"So the food is good, a bit pricey if you ask me.  There are no pleasantries here, just take your order and push it out to you.  And really what is the deal with charging $0.38 for a thing of BBQ, I would think if you got onion rings or fries and you did not get ketchup you could pass over one free tub of BBQ, I mean is that really going to cut that much into your profits?"}
{"text":"Rolled through drive-thru about 4:30am on Sept 1st. Believe guy working window was Mike G. Heavier set middle aged man. Also working the grill was a younger guy believe his name was Josh or Justin on the name tag but cannot recall 100%. I'm sure they are good hard working guys but noticed the younger guy working the grill was wearing gloves and prepping my taquito. Next I watched him reach to his left and pull raw hamburger patties out of a freezer/fridge...BUT he never changed gloves then still handled my food. Pretty sure this is not aligned with best practices according to Health Dept rules and food handling. The older guy seemed incredulous that I ordered coffee. I guess he was mad because he had to brew some? No idea but he just seemed a bit grumpy. I'm sure it sucks working 430am but it's part of the job?? At least try to be clean and handle food properly. You could make someone sick! Also take care of customers and be courteous. I guess it's a lot to ask these days but this is the kind of stuff that gives fast food places a bad reputation."}
{"text":"First time eating at this place.  I ordered #1 meal which is the Whataburger meal.  I was just going to order the burger itself but couldn't find it anywhere on the menu.  Reason that I'm not coming back is because their menu is a bit confusing to order from."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. I've gone there quite often for lunch and they have never got my order wrong. The food is delicious and the burgers are savory. It's a very good price and their shakes are phenomenal. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and will chat with you if given the time. There is a man at the window in the mornings and he is always so friendly and has the biggest smile on his face I would recommend going in the mornings to see him and get breakfast (their biscuits and gravy are to-die-for)"}
{"text":"Here was my drive-thru experience 10 minutes ago:  Can I get a 9 piece whatachikn bites with the gravy- WITH WHAT SAUCE The grav- RANCH?? The gravy please and that's- AND FOR THE DRINK  Like STOP INTERRUPTING ME. I'm TRYING to give you all the required information.    Then I had to go inside because I ended up with ranch instead of gravy.  3 stars because this place is usually way better than this."}
{"text":"While I really like Whataburger, I can't stand this location. Every time I order a vanilla malt I can't tell if there is any malt in the thing. It takes like a plain vanilla shake.  I guess I'll go to Sonic down the street for my malts."}
{"text":"Compared to other Whataburger stores, this one is not as clean.  The food is good though but we just saw a whole bunch of dirty tables.  Coming here always brings back good memories from my hometown.  Love the taquitos!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times. The burgers are ok as far as fast food goes, but I always seem to get the one with a dried-out bun. The fries leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Came here on election night, ordered 1 Kids' Justaburger meal, but for some reason, the cashier charged me for 3 total meals.  Order one 3-piecek chicken strips, this charge was correct.  Ordered one #2 meal, this charge was correct too.  Due the the incorrect over charges, the manager reverse all charges back to my card.  Good for them to admitting their mistake.  Food was good as they made me fresh while you wait, but since all locations are 24/7, it might be a while before you get your food if someone in front of you orders a lot like we did."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food breakfast. Biscuits and gravy are better than any chain restaurant by far."}
{"text":"One of the WORST Whataburgers out there. Save yourself some time and patience and do not go to this location. Took FOREVER for the food. Order was incorrect. Sauces are extra charge. Very unfriendly employees. Never again."}
{"text":"I came back! WHATACHANGE food was fresh, hot and delicious. Front counter girl were friendly, polite, respectful, made sure everything was prepared the way I ordered it... Thank you such a wonderful change... I will be back"}
{"text":"While I've not actually been to every whataburger in the phoenix area, I believe this location is the best in phoenix. I eat here about once a week, and in the last 2 years they have only given me the wrong order once, which they promptly and courteously replaced when I pointed out the error. The quality of employees at whataburger is always better than most other fast food restaurants, but this location seems to have the best of the best."}
{"text":"Lobby is always lonely. There's a sharp curve at the exit of the drive thru that everyone runs over, so be careful. Transients are in and out. Whataburger needs to shrink their drink sizes and increase their fries sizes -- its disproportionate."}
{"text":"Good and bad I have had at this Whataburger. The good is the burgers. They are great tasting and filling. The bad... I thought I tried the Buffalo Ranch Chicken Strips Sandwich. I asked for it without the ranch dressing and it came the way I ordered it. I just wish that it came with extra new, \"oh-so-special Buffalo sauce.\" The sandwich was very dried. When they served me the sandwich I thought I might be offer some more sauce but I guess since it is \"oh-so-special Buffalo sauce\" must be used very special since they used very little of it. So when you go there just order a burger since it is what it is name after..."}
{"text":"This location takes an unreasonable amount of time to push the mediocre food out there's a quality McDonald's just down the street"}
{"text":"This is probably the best run Whataburger in town. I have had the opportunity to be served by every shift here. I'm sorry but I am having a real love affair with the old classic green chili double burger now available.  Tonya, or Sonya? is a little tiny pistol that takes your order in the mornings. Who needs exercise when you can watch this gal work. If I were looking for an apprentice this gal would be at the top of my list. Now getting back to that burger... It tastes as close as it gets to authentic Chimayo green chile from New Mexico. Not too hot but the roasted flavor and texture of Whataburger's green chili is simply the best in town. Add a fried egg and maybe even some bacon and you will have a meal sized sandwich, I order the Jr. Size. The food is always hot and fresh here..."}
{"text":"Always a decent burger.  I think it's much better than mcdonalds for a late night or 24 hour resturant meal.  It takes a little while to get your food sometimes, but it's all good once you take a bite!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to finally try whataburger. More like what a disappointment. I tried both the whataburger and the whatachicken. The chicken sandwich was actually really good. Maybe it was just too hyped. Either way, there was a sonics across the street I should have gone to instead."}
{"text":"Major points scored by what-a-burger for treating evey customer that walks in the door like a welcomed guest!  The staff are friendly and attentive!  I am a fan of the Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger because it's just the right size for me."}
{"text":"Waited 3 years to get a Whataburger. I was so excited, but when my order arrived at the table... the fries were undercooked and lukewarm, the hamburger patty was not brown and crisp, but a greyish-brown; the cheese was not melted completely; and the bun was cold-ish. This is not the food I craved for years. Downhill Whataburger. Sad."}
{"text":"This location is HORRIBLE. This should not be considered fast food. We did the drive through and post ordering (2 burgers and 2 fries) it took 15 minutes to get our food. There was only 1 person in front of us. When we finally got our food I asked the lady if it normally takes this long and her response was \"Nope, it's my fault. That's why I brought your food.\" No apology, not a thing.   Not even the food was redeeming - and expensive for 2 burgers and 2 fries! I'll be sticking to in n out from now on. Very disappointed and I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Stepping into Whataburger is like stepping into a time warp....and I LOVE it!   Fast food is fast food, but if I had to pick a \"better\" establishment, this would be it. The staff was more than accommodating, friendly, and genuinely hospitable. The girl who took our order hadn't been working there long so she needed to ask for some help, and the manager that came over to help her was patient and didn't talk down to her. She apologized to us a lot for not being very fast as she figured out the register but it didn't bother me at all. We laughed and I told her that I was super patient so it was no big deal. Later she stopped by the table to make sure everything came out correctly and we had a laugh (it had).  I saw a commercial the week before for the patty melt and it had been on my mind since. It was really good (for a fast food burger). The fries were fresh, the sweet tea was good, the kids ate ALL of their food....and weren't even upset that there wasn't a toy in the kids meal.  I'm so glad that we re-found this place...I now have no desire to go to any of the other fast food burger places."}
{"text":"I just went through the drive-through at this what a burger. It is awesome! I friend at work told me about this location on my way to work. It was my first time stopping there. The girl at the window it's nice and friendly and that something I needed this morning. I actually forgot to order a Diet Coke and she got it for me. It said on the ticket Lisa Renee . She is awesome !!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Texas where Whataburger originated, so I certainly appreciate the great burgers they serve! Obviously some locations are better than others!  This one in Scottsdale is consistently good.  I live close by, Hit the drive through fairly often.  Never a timely wait, food is consistent.  Mgt at this location is solid.  My go to burger is a Double Meat-Double Cheese Whataburger!  Pretty Hard to beat, seriously...A-1 thick&hearty, and other speciality burgers are pretty tasty..."}
{"text":"Interesting visit thus evening as my wife and I visited this chain of fast food joint for the 2nd time. Great food. We feel the need to let the guy who takes orders at about 2 am know when a customer asks about what time the milk shake machine goes down you cant just say whenever i get to it cause i might just return another night at the same time and get your same dumb response again.  If there is a better time we would like to freaking know. Also you have the personality of a foul dirty dish towel. Maybe we shoulda asked when is your shift over so we can avoid you mr ice cream shake cleaner at 2am. This yelp help is for you. Lose the pedo stache. Get laid."}
{"text":"They didn't get the right order. I live 200 miles away, I ordered a sandwich for my family member and when I got home it was wrong, plus the jalape√±o ranch (which is delicious) I know they charge for it and I'm okay with that but at least fill the containers up more then a quarter way, they didn't put any in there at all, I usually have enough to last me for my larger fry and some to take home , this time it was gone before I even finished my fries!!! Also when I went to order two more they had ran out , & instead of saying they only had enough for one they put so little in each one & charged me for both!!! I was not happy, especially cause I live so far. I've never had a problem before so I didn't think twice of checking on it. I called they said oh to bring the receipt but they didn't ask me for my name or anything , then as I explained to them like 200 miles I don't plan going there just to replace my burger they didn't care once so ever. Will never spend my money here again!!!!!! I don't have a wataburger where I'm from so I'm deeply disappointed. Hope this helps. Thank you."}
{"text":"Person at drivethru said order back to me wrong...twice...I've been sitting in drivethru line with two cars in front of me for 11 minutes and counting.....if there wasn't someone behind me, I'd back out and leave."}
{"text":"The young lady running the register with brown hair and glasses gave amazing customer service, she deserves a raise x10!! I was very happy with my order and so were my kids!! I'll be back soon, hope she's working :-)"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here. Can't get enough lf this place!  Great service and great food, whats not to like? So good that this is the last restaurant I chose to eat at before heading out of town for awhile."}
{"text":"I don't like the food here, except for the onion rings (they are huge). The burgers are boring and the fries are similarly lame. I'd much rather go up the road to In N Out. BUT... my husband and brother LOVE this place & I have to agree that the service is outstanding, especially for fast food (thus the three stars). Would I recommend it, no. But it is a place I find myself at every once and again."}
{"text":"This location is much cleaner and has a newer appearance than others I have visited. Overall I'm not a huge fan of their food. Burgers are so so and their combos are more expensive than I feel they are worth. This location is freezing cold, but clean. Seemed like they had too many employees working, many just stood around and chatted. Onion rings were super greasy, not a whole lot of breading or flavor. Milkshake was also mediocre. There are a lot of burger options out there, don't make this your number one."}
{"text":"i ate there today, not good food in my book....first, the restroom and no paper towels to dry ur hands...the booth i sat in had a loose bottom to it...i thought , wow, nice to see things in order...i ordered the #2 , 2 patties with cheese....when i got it, i thought, this is big, and it was...after my first bite, i thought, tastless...then i looked at the patty, i thought , this does not look like hamburger meat to me....anyhow, its in n out burger , steak and shake, or 5 guys....... i have ate at a lot of fast food places lately, and american fast food is not good anymore...corporate america has destroyed alllmost all of them..i could write a book and how fast food in the 70,s compared to today is not even the same at each resturant...allmost every fast food place has completely changed from what they started out as"}
{"text":"The triple meat Whataburger burger was amazing and the chicken bites were crispy. They have an interesting dipping sauce called gravy which had an interesting thick and kind of like a soup taste to it. Would recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"Although this restaurant is about 30 minutes from where I live, we love to go there every couple of weeks.  The place is always very clean and the food fresh and excellent.  Unlike most chains, Whataburger hasn't reduced portion sizes or lowered quality.  Parking is usually very good, although I usually conceal carry when I am in that part of town - I wish they would open a restaurant over near McQueen and Ocotillo - that would be awesome!"}
{"text":"Always great service and good food.. just alot of bums in this area which made the experience not that great and the manager wasn't very friendly to them ."}
{"text":"First visit January 2014, 3pm. The store was clean, lots of staff moving around in the kitchen. I ordered the single patty burger with everything and a small drink. Total was $4.95.  The burger was room temperature, the patty was dry and thin. What I think happens is the burger was cooked but all the condiments are cold, but the patty is so thin that it drops in temperature rapidly when they wrap it in paper. When it arrives at the table the burger is slightly warmer than room temperature. While I was eating someone in a uniform walked up to me to ask if my sandwich was okay. I had a mouthful of food at the time, which is an odd time to go interrupt someone. I wanted to ask if they could nuke my burger but by then I just wanted to leave.  The sign inside says they are open 24 hours a day. I doubt I'll return, I was totally unimpressed."}
{"text":"Great burgers and grilled cheese sandwiches. It's a fast food chain with good quality and good quantity."}
{"text":"Great food that is hard to find elsewhere. The burgers may be four star but the chicken and grilled cheese is done perfect."}
{"text":"I don't get to eat here often but when I do it's always good. I haven't had a bad experience yet!"}
{"text":"Manager Ricky is very unprofessional , rude & should be terminated ASAP !! GM about who you allow to put in that manager position !!"}
{"text":"French fries were cold and looked horrible.  They really needed to change the grease in the fryer as it was long overdue.  I ordered a double meat and cheese and when I got home and opened it up to eat it I noticed there was bacon on it.  I did not order it with bacon.  I overheard the man in line ahead of me ordered a double meat with cheese and bacon.  I do not eat bacon.  So obviously I was given the wrong order.  I really dont understand the decline in service these days.  Not just here but everywhere you go it seems nowadays.  I understand mistakes happen but I was not going to hop in my car and drive back to this location.  The dogs got a nice treat."}
{"text":"Swung by this location this morning to pick up my call in order. i ordered a grilled chicken melt and a large coffee.  marie took my order in a very professional way. she greeted me and sound very happy and pleased to assist me.  i had some special instructions on how i wanted my sandwich and she had no problem adjusting to those instructions, to where as most places take that deep breath like they dont wana help u or they want u to order it the way it comes. well not here at this whataburger.  my order was made to perfection. grilled chicken was hot and fresh. the grilled veggies were toasty and cooked very well done as i requested. it was prepared on a big bun another one of my requests.  my coffee was nice and hot/freshly brewed. donell assisted me and offered me creamer and made small talk which was awesome bcuz most workers this early on dont have that \"happy face\".  overall, my experience here was amazing. the restaurant was clean and free of trash. the exterior of the place was clean as well. i love coming to restaurants that make have such a positive feel and wonderful impact on ones day.  i will be returning here more often. and i highly recommend this whataburger to any of u that wana experience perfection as well as tasty fresh, made to order food. good job marie, donell and to the cook on duty this morning. thank you guys for all ur hard work and for making my morning a good one. we need more workers like this. high 5"}
{"text":"We come here pretty regularly but today's visit was disappointing. We always ask for our fries to be extra crispy. Today, we think, they barely made it to the end of the timer. Cashier, Elexis, was barely paying attention to what I was saying to her. Asked her to put only a certain amount on one card, trying to use it down, and she just ran it without putting that amount down. Tried to do the survey, but our receipt has no code. We know they can do better."}
{"text":"Great food but it's way too expensive - 2 double burger meals with shakes shouldn't be almost $30."}
{"text":"Worst service   ever!!!!!!!  Was in the drive thru  waiting for over a half an hour the cashier doesn't even apoligize for the inconvenience . . Then she gives me back almost four dollars  in change  and doesn't  apoligize for that either . . This also is not the first time it has happened to me here but it is the last time"}
{"text":"I've lived in the Phoenix area for about 13 years, and never been to one of these places. Seen and heard the ads, passed them 100's of times, but for some inexplicable reason, I've never dined at the Whataburger.   I think I've been missing out. The burger I had there this afternoon was totally excellent... Dude. I had the double Whataburger with cheese, and it was outstanding. Fabulous. Marvelous. Very meaty and tasty. There was a healthy dose of garden on it as well: Lettuce, onions, tomato, and some mustard as well. I noticed that their menu was also very reasonably priced.   No 5 stars because the fries were simply Mehhhhh. OK, but not great.  I think I like this place much, much better than some of thew newer joints that I've tried: 5 Guys, Smash Burger, etc. I'll be back."}
{"text":"A lot of hype but none of it lived up to what I had heard of it. Girlfriend wanted to try it and kept insisting on it. Got it and she wasn't that pleased with it either"}
{"text":"Was gonna give it 3 stars but I'm from Texas where whataburger is not only King but life so it gets 4. I've eaten at tons of whataburgers in my life all in Texas except this one. The difference between those and this one? Those are in Texas where they have pride in their locations where this one really doesn't care cause hey they're not in Texas and no one really cares about whataburger here. Every time I go they always get something wrong with my order I actually don't think I ever gotten the correct order here. It's usually minor things like forgetting bacon or something I wanted added so it's not a big deal but would still be nice to get what I ordered. I will still keep going here no matter how bad the service is and how many times they mess up my order. Why? Because it's a taste of home and it keeps me from going crazy and jumping in my truck and going home. Overall the worse location I've ever been to but I will keep going cause hey it reminds me of home....wouldn't you keep going?"}
{"text":"I can't believe we don't have whataburger in Buffalo. This place beats McDonald's or BK hands down. And that's just talking about food quality, let alone price. I tried to eat a burger and chicken sandwich in one evening and it was way too much. The next day I got a double cheeseburger and I absolutely loved it. I just wish we had this chain up north."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes in the drive through just now for a burger and a sausage and egg biscuit with no cheese. Got a biscuit with cheese. Awesome job guys."}
{"text":"This is my all around favorite place to stop on late nights and early mornings. If you have not been this is not another fast food joint. I made the pleasant mistake my first time of ordering two cheeseburgers. These are real cheeseburgers with 1 being enough to fill you. I have been here multiple times using both the drive through and inside. They have gotten my order correct 100%  and I have always left full and satisfied. I enjoy the spicy ketchup, the great tasting burgers, and pleasant service. I have two small complaints-the seating area is so small only a few families at a time and it is not designed for larger framed people-not just fat bodies but tall as well. The other is even though they have two lanes in the drive through the wait time borders on obnoxious especially when coming back from a show and wanting to get home-was over 20 minutes last time for a basic order."}
{"text":"Great burgers! And they have some other interesting combinations as well. I usually get the Honey BBQ Chicken Strip Sandwich. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because it's not in the best part of town and there can be some shady characters that show up."}
{"text":"The back door was open and the place was full of flys, I let the manager know and it seemed as if he did not care much. Also no coffee at 8 am !"}
{"text":"Must have one every time I come to Arizona!!! Consistently delicious, especially the jalape√±o burger. Nice service touches, a little perk for seniors, clean and efficient service."}
{"text":"De-lish-every freaking single time.  Burger with all the trimmings and spicy ketchup.  Makes me want to move to AZ!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch today with my daughter to Whataburger. I forgot how good their burgers are, and how big they actually are! We ate inside so the fries and burgers were piping hot, and the gravy to dip fries into is well, gravy on top! It's been a while since I ate in at this location, so it looks like they did a little fixing up inside, looks good. We will be back for sure! Five stars, keep up the good work! Next time back I will take some pictures!"}
{"text":"They had good service although it seemed their cash register was down so took a minute which I can understand, I was in no rush at 2:13 a.m and couldn't get the breakfast item I wanted but got the patty melt and it is spectacular, I can't tell if it's because I'm so dabbed out or I'm just truly hungry and the onion rings are always alright with some ketchup, good Dr. Pepper unlike some food places."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service at this location. An employee told me that I had to pay extra for a combo that I ordered and paid for! I was super disappointed in this location and the employees blaming their actions on \"training\". Will never return to this Whataburger."}
{"text":"The burgers are a lot tastier and juicer than your normal fast food joint.  The frys are salted just enough.  The employees are all friendly and the service Is pretty fast. The only thing  is there is not a lot of seating so you might have a bit of trouble  finding a table during peak lunch or dinner hours.  Go triple meat or go home."}
{"text":"If there was a no star option. They'd get that. Now i will say that the majority of the staff members are relatively friendly. However if you encounter manager trainee Jacob or store manager Michelle;  God help you! Absolutely no customer service whatsoever between the two of them. It started with my wife's meal. They sent it to us wrong. Which i get it. Things happen. So we took it back. They \"fixed\" it and sent it back to us. Then my wife enjoys about half the burger and finds a hair on the lettuce. So we take it back.......again and Michelle couldn't be bothered with it anymore so she sent Jacob to handle the situation. He then VERBATIM repeated the original order to my wife to make sure they get it right then sarcastically asks \"is there anything else special you want?\" Then walks away. About 30 seconds later they bring out their third attempt of making this burger. (So much for making it fresh as they advertise) then, even after Jacob repeating the order........tada! They still managed to mess it up.......again. So I go to the counter to just get a refund at this point. Being that the situation was what it was, the worlds greatest manager Michelle was notified that I wanted a refund. And rather then come out and face me and talk with me, she stayed behind the scenes and sent se√±or Jacob back out. He then asks for the receipt which was thrown away. I told him exactly what was ordered AND HE LITERALLY OPENS THE TRASH CAN AND DIGS THRU THE DAMN TRASH TO FIND A RECEIPT!!!!!! As if we're were lying about the situation in the first place. I've never in my life been treated with such disrespect from two people in a management position. Do yourself a favor. And visit the Avondale location if you need a Whataburger fix. Because this one will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. Or will leave you with a hair in your mouth and will act as if you placed it there yourself."}
{"text":"My first and last Whatacrappyburger. Nasty grey patty and one of the heaviest burgers ever. Needed to cook some more once back home, but i could only eat half of this junk before I threw in the towel. Free fries and drink helped soften the blow, but this chain is a disaster. In and Out is way better. I can't believe how bad the burger was, too bad cause they spend alot of money on billboards, but not even on quality food obviously."}
{"text":"Good burger & would have been better if it would have been warmer... didn't like having to eat inside ( no outdoor tables available).  Liked the non grilled bun & the fries were very good!"}
{"text":"Ate here twice, ordered burger and fries and chicken sandwich too. The fries are my new favorite. Best fries. They are crunchy, and fresh. The burgers are good. The chicken sandwich was something I would order again. The service was fast the first time I went but a bit slow the second time. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Horrible restaurant. They actually charge for barbaque sauce. I was told by Randy if I wanted just 1 barbaque sauce for my hashbrown sticks I would have to pay 39 cents. I asked to speak to the manager and Randy said he was the manager. He told me the barbaque sauce is only free when you order chicken tenders. I'm a vegetarian so i asked him is there anything I could order that is not meat related that can get me it for free and he said no. I hate this greedy restaurant. You're already overcharging me for 4 little hashbrown sticks and you expect me to pay extra for just 1 barbaque sauce? Insane. Randy you and this restaurant have lost me as a customer until you stop being so greedy."}
{"text":"Niece and nephew had summer reading program coupons from Whataburger.  They're totally new to this place.  Victor and Yani went out of their way to help us redeem multiple coupons this evening.  Kids were delighted.  Thanks for the awesome service!"}
{"text":"I love to eat here. Breakfast lunch dinner or late night. My favorite is the dbl Whataburger with cheese, grilled onions, the works with the Onion Rings and a root-beer.    I like the breakfast also and the chicken strips.  Fries are good here also.  Order is always right!  It cost a litle more to eat here but I think it is so worth it.  Generally spend $9 to $11 per adult."}
{"text":"I am not one for fast food drive thru....but I was remembering how good a Whataburger USED to be, so I decided to give them a try. I ordered a whataburger with jalapenos and a small order of fries. The meat patty was dry....jalapenos were unbearable to eat and fries were literally  cold and a bit soggy, not even a brown hue to them. I was so disappointed and angry at the same time. I will not be returning........and my advice to you.........avoid going there!"}
{"text":"Great food, and really appreciated being able to eat burgers for breakfast. It was quite a collection of customers in here at 7a and being open 24hr probably attributes to some of it.   Either way, my food was good, and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Horribly ran establishment. I went through the drive through, ordered, asked for a Powerade (it was on their order board) for them to tell me that they don't carry Powerade. Why put it on there if you don't have it then talk to me like I'm stupid for ordering it? I waited quite a while for my food, got home and hey gave me the wrong food! I had to drive all the way back and they made the food again and didn't apologize or anything just offered me an apple pie. 30 mins for \"fast food\", double the drive time, but don't worry they offered me an apple pie. Not to mention the manager was present for the whole situation and never spoke to me, just ordered everyone to remake my order."}
{"text":"First time they have made a mistake on order.  But the correct Hamburgs were yummy  Can't beats whataburger!!! Place was clean and staff very helpful."}
{"text":"This location had better quality of food and cleaner dining room and kitchen before their update. Now it's awkward to dine in, the food quality is poor and the restaurant was full of flies. Large amounts of flies especially in the kitchen. Also one cashier at lunch rush is not acceptable."}
{"text":"The place lacks maturity in service since all the people who work there are bugger-nosed kids.  But besides them snotty childish people, the burger was delicious."}
{"text":"I came here a few times but it's just not the same when they first built it.  But if they know they did a bad job, they will correct it quickly. What i mean is if they shorted u on stuff they will correct it"}
{"text":"Hundreds of flys constantly fly around this establishment. GROSS! I walked out. They said it is because of the heat, yet there are no flys in other stores. The manger said they don't land on the food. That is when I walked out."}
{"text":"I've been here a several times. One of these visits was not the best. The chicken strips were not fully cooked when I got home. I called the next day (it was after hours and late) and the MOD was apologetic and offered to rectify the situation. Restaurant always clean and staff always friendly."}
{"text":"Worst Whataburger I've ever been. Cold tasteless food is what this place has.   This location should be ashamed of themselves. Luckily I didn't pay but my coworker did.   I live in Texas and Whataburgers are always good. This AZ location needs to close. Sorry no second chances for this place."}
{"text":"My coworkers brought me a mustard grilled chicken sandwich and even though it smelled amazing, I saw the ingredient details online and BARF! Grilled chicken or not the numbers were pretty bad."}
{"text":"We were looking for the competitor and ran into an old friend bu accident. Yay for wahtaburger!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend's cravings brought me here. I got food poisoning from Whataburger once and never went back. Second time around and my attitude has changed. Not bad! The meat tasted great and so did the fries and malt. Every now and again I may return."}
{"text":"Yuck. This was my first trip to Whataburger and it's definitely also my last. Just terrible food all the way around. I realize it's just fast food, but you can do so much better at many other places. On the plus side, the service was friendly."}
{"text":"This is the worst place to eat food. The bread is cardboard, the chicken is overcooked and very dry. There is not a lot of flavor. There are sauces you can get to soak your sandwich in to make it edible. Sauces save this establishment. Fries are basic."}
{"text":"I'm so glad Arizona has Whataburger!  I don't have to travel back to Texas for this amzing fast-food burger joint.  Their famous Whataburger combo is awesome.  You get to switch out regular fries for some greasy yet crispy onion rings.  The burgers tasted the same as in Texas.  The only difference is that maybe Arizona isn't too hype about it like Texas?"}
{"text":"Oh Whataburger, how  I recall thy tasty breakfast taquitos from my days as an undergrad at the University of Texas at Austin (and that one time that bloody crackhead came in...).  Well, I recalled seeing the giant orange \"W\" and was craving something late night and who was there to supply the goods, but Whataburger."}
{"text":"Great chocolate shakes! Although the service can be very slow. Food is what you'd except from a fast food restaurant. Chicken strips are good, not the best."}
{"text":"It may be silly for a vegetarian to review a hamburger place, but we need our fast food fixes too! My boyfriend, a meat eater, and his friends, also all meat eaters, really like Whattaburger a lot. I, on the other hand, would take In-n-Out any day.   To put it simply, Whattaburger's grilled cheese is puny. It's about 1/4 of the height of an In-n-Out grilled cheese, the lettuce and tomato are on the sad wilty side, the bun was cold (if I hadn't been rushed through ordering I could have gotten it toasted apparently), and there was only 1 slice of cheese. Truly a sad little grilled cheese. Whattaburger has a decent green salad and the french fries are delicious. On another (late night) trip here I got the breakfast and liked it a lot more. Naturally there are a lot more veggie options for morning food, and I can happily recommend any egg/cheese combo on a biscuit.  Anyways if you are coming here because everyone else wants to and you are vegetarian, Taco Bell and 7 layer burritos are right next door :)."}
{"text":"Ordered a 3 piece chicken strip and literally got 2 chicken nugget sized, strips. Also they were 70% dry breaking and 30% old dry chicken."}
{"text":"I used to love whataburger as a kid, it's a slowly slipping downward slope! I was so xited when I moved back into a neighborhood that had a whataburger so close, first time I went there waited literally 25 minutes behind 2 cars then had to pull away to go to mcdonalds 2 miles down the road. Decided to go back a couple months later(tonight) they didn't give me my drink, my bad for not recognizing this but I was busy on the phone. Food was ice cold when we got into it and we live less than a mile away. When I called to ask about a credit on the drink I got \" oh next time u come thru ask for a free drink\" really? Pretty sure that's not gonna work. They might be ok during the day but definitely don't go late night"}
{"text":"Slllllllllllllllllllllllllloooooooooooooowwwwwww.  Service is generally friendly, but is it worth the wasted gas idling in the drive thru and the potential that they will mess your order up 25 percent of the time?"}
{"text":"Don't even know what to say here. Staff smoking right by the entrance, older employees yelling at each other & other employees, a lot of confusion in drive thru, staff apparently is unaware of their volume as everyone in the dining room can hear everything they say. They were loudly complaining of a smell coming from the bathroom- their was a Plummer onsite and they kept saying it smells like gas . Better go outside and light a cigarette I guess??  Food was okay so 2 stars, customer service is clearly lacking at this location."}
{"text":"5-Stars in the fast food category.  This place clearly serves the best fast-food burger (in my opinion).  You can taste the freshness in the meat.  The bun is nicely toasted - the burger actually tastes like a grilled cheese and burger combined.  I wish they had these back in central-Florida!"}
{"text":"I'm certainly no burger aficionado, but having eaten at Burger King, McDonald's, In and Out Burger etc., I understand what to expect from greasy, mediocre, fast food. This was not mediocre in any way, but virtually inedible. The only thing I could compare it to is what you used to get out of a vending machine and then proceed to microwave. Absolutely the worst burger I've ever eaten in my life."}
{"text":"Was in the area on business and when we drove by this Whataburger I knew I had to try this legendary burger purveyor.   My expectations were met. I got a Green Chile cheeseburger and it was delicious. The accompanying onion rings were very good.   I would skip the fried apple pie. It was meh and not worth the calories.   The menu is full of interesting choices. My colleague got a Monterey burger that looked amazing. Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this because every time I go through the Drive-Thru my experience is awesome, absolutely no complaints. But the one time I decide to go inside, a woman named Asheley decides to bombard me with attitude and dirty looks and completely gets my order wrong, and proceeds to give me even more attitude and bad looks when I correct her.  And I promise I use my manner and was not rude to this woman. Do yourself a favor, go through the Drive-Thru"}
{"text":"Just got the first food I've had today due to a long work day and the gal.at the drive thru was so nice and cheerful it made my day. Best way to end the night with a good burger and a pleasant and quick experience."}
{"text":"I have had good burgers from this location but the most recent burger i got was pitiful. The patty was super thin and falling out of the bun. The tomatoes were white and not ripe and it was just thrown together very poorly. After a long day at work all i wanted was a good burger :( fairly disappointed."}
{"text":"My salad is terrific, nice grilled chicken, my fruit is fresh, the meal is delicious. My favorite part has to be the size, it's filling for sure. :) I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped here today for lunch. I for some reason thought it was an odd choice, but he seems to go often and enjoys it. In fact the woman taking the order said to him, no drive through today? It would looks as though he is known in the whataburger world.   The people working here are very friendly if not a little disconnected. I ordered a whataburger with cheese and onion rings and a small drink. I opted for the Hi-C. I do not like sloppy food and this burger would not have been if the bun had held up. But as it is onions lettuce and tomatoes are falling all over the place. The meat was dry and lacking an particular flavour. The onion rings were very generic and sort of soggy. I loved the Hi-C.   You know you just never know if you will like something until you try it. I tired it and that is enough. Nice friendly folks though. I do like friendly."}
{"text":"WHAT A TERRIBLE FIRST EXPERIENCE IVE HAD HERE. First time ever to this place and I was treated like absolute dog shit. Got home and just tossed the food I was so mad. Not even worth calling the manager who I saw throwing my food around because when I got to the window I had an extra burger added on to the meal, mind you I could hear her yelling about how she had to make the food fresh all over when I never asked that. Even the cashier was rude over the speaker. Will never go to another unless I'm starving and about to die because I rather almost die then deal with their shitty attitude again."}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars. My Texas friends had been telling me about Whataburger for quite a few years. Imagine my surprise when we were driving back to Vegas from Tucson and ran into a Whataburger! Even though it was barely 10am we had to try a burger here.  We got a double burger and found out it doesn't come with cheese! If you add cheese, they add $0.50 per patty, so for a double, it was and extra $1. But the total came out to $6.10 (with tax) so it was a $5.75 burger for a double with cheese. Closest I could compare it with is Farmer Boys if you're familiar. It was much more juicy and hotter than FB.  Cannot compare it with In N Out since the price point is totally different.  In reality, it was a Del Taco Double Del Burger on STEROIDS.  The spicy ketchup gave it a bit of edge.   Didn't get a chance to try their fries though, however, we asked for two cups of ice water (for our dogs for our long road trip) and they gave us two large size cups with ice cold agua."}
{"text":"What can I say?  Its Whataburger!  Been eating here since I lived in Texas back in the early 90's.  I tried their new A1 burger with cheese and bacon.  It was made perfectly and giant as usual.  Waitresses still come around with the napkin/ketchup/sauce trays.  It was a great lunch.  Try it if you never have..."}
{"text":"The patty is decent, but tomato was the orange color of a candy Hallowe'en pumpkin and the iced tea is not brewed but reconstituted - blech! The fries are innocuous enough.   Meh."}
{"text":"I ordered #5 with grilled onions and onion rings.!the burgers are very generous in size. Very filling. The onion rings I ordered tasted of old oil not to mention they burnt it!"}
{"text":"Came here for a burger after striking out at the DQ down the street.  The green chile burger pic looked great.  Staff was very friendly.  Fries were pretty good.  Burger was pretty big. The circumference was larger than the length of my iPhone. Probably not the best burger ever but I was hungry and heading to the airport.  The hamburger meat itself tastes like a McDonalds hamburger but with the pasteurized, processed cheese and the green chilies it was a little better. I would assume an ordinary burger with lettuce and tomato would be better.  Like I said service was good. Place was clean and they were busy.  Whataburger does not even come close to In & Out quality so don't be disappointed and because the comparison is not fair."}
{"text":"We come to this location after every football game, I love seeing our fans here!! It's like getting together with our family for a meal. The staff is very thorough and my food is as ordered all the time. It's a great place to sit and eat!!!"}
{"text":"Wish we had one of these is San Diego. This would give In-n-out a run for their money. Great burgers, with SEVERAL different choices to top your burger. I opted for the whataburger with green chilies . WOW it was good and spicy. I loved that they had both regular ketchup and spicy ketchup. Of course I opted for the spicy ketchup, it was flavorful and had a nice kick. I will definitely come back here anytime Im in the area."}
{"text":"Ok, the others are being way too hard on this place.  I had never had a Whataburger before, and I thought it was a great value.  The burger was very edible, and topped with fresh, ecoli free toppings.  The place was not in the finest neighborhood, but was clean and well kept.  The staff was friendly as well.  I am fatter for the experience."}
{"text":"I really love Whataburger as a whole, but this location sucks.  At the risk of being labeled a cranky old dude, they always play their music way too loud. I have politely asked to have it turned down twice. One time they just ignored me, the other time the dude gave me attitude about. Nobody comes here to listen to music while they eat. Music should be background noise. Not the loudest thing you hear in the lobby. It's super obnoxious.   They don't enforce rules regarding animals or \"service\" dogs. Last time I ate here, some loser couple had their dog sitting on the bench with them, feeding it. The manager on duty was the one who brought their food out to them and didn't say anything about it. Gross!  There's also this \"pigpen\" little troll kid that works here. He hangs out here before/after his shift with his giant dirty military Rambo backpack. So he's easy to spot. His Whataburger work shirt is disgusting! It's stained, grungy, and just so badly in need of a wash, a proper management would send him home over it. Or, at least make him wear a clean loaner shirt. He's wearing this gross shirt every time I see him. I don't want some nasty, smelly troll making my food!  The place is usually clean. Most of the employees are pleasant to interact with, so it's a ok place to go. I'm probably just a cranky old dude. So take my review with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"It's the only thing open near my house; this is the last evening of our \"eat-whatever-we-want\" marathon; I had my heart set on a #13 because of the \"Texas Toast.\" Well, my Texan friends and family may argue this isn't a piece of Texas toast... this is a perfect representation of \"Arizona Toast.\""}
{"text":"poor guys, I went last Saturday night around 1.00 am, there were only 3 guys doing everything! drive thru, charging and cooking! we were about 15 people inside and about 10 cars outside, they were fighting with each other not to let more people in, they really try to serve us but with NO luck, we went to the Ihop ...."}
{"text":"Big, juicy, meatly, cheesy burgers with an endless combination of toppings.  The fried zuccini is also a nice change to the old burger and fry combo."}
{"text":"Pretty good, actually.  Green chile burger and chicken strips with gravy both tasted good.  Very friendly service.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Showed up right at 11pm for some Honey Butter Chicken Biscuits and man were they fresh and tasty! We had to wait about 5 minutes because they had just started making them, which was totally worth it. Being from Texas I was skeptical that this would be a good experience and the Yelp reviews definitely didn't make it any better. However I couldn't have been happier and I even felt like I was at home. It seems like they could be understaffed at points because they were pretty busy even for 11pm, but that's normal and they held their own. I would highly recommend to anyone eating past 11pm or before 11am to try a honey butter chicken biscuit or any of their other delicious breakfast items. My personal favorites here are the Chicken Tenders which comes with fries and Texas toast, and the Patty melts because I love burgers on Texas Toast. Whataburger and In n Out are the only burgers for me!"}
{"text":"This location is the nearest to work for a few colleague of mine; that being said, we tend to order out from here a couple time a month. Every single time we would visit, we would bring coupon which is clearly sent by their company and we are always frowned upon when using them. Especially the ladies in the white dress shirt, if you aren't please with the way your company advertise your franchise, then by all mean please voice your opinion to your employer and spare us customer your attitude each time we visit.   To summarize this to the local customers, please avoid using coupons that are sent to you. Clearly each time you would use the coupons, it'll be deducted from the employees wage."}
{"text":"In no way was this location comparable to the multiple locations I've ate at in Oklahoma and Texas.  Food was barely warm and the bun tasted like it was either reheated or had been sitting under the lamp for quite some time.  Seemed like the food took longer than other fast casual restaurants.  All in all, this location didn't seem to meet the quality products I've come to expect.  Being hundreds of miles from the nearest store, it was disappointing that this location failed to live up to Whataburger's normal standards."}
{"text":"Good food reasonable prices. Lots of burger choice toppings clean facility and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I get double meat, double cheese, plain and dry medium meal. Everyone there is pretty friendly. Food is my favorite for fast food!! My burger is SOOOOOOO good. The fries are hit and miss. Sometimes they are hot and fresh and amazing. Sometimes they are cold and soggy."}
{"text":"Another great visit... ( This is my favorite burger place out of all the fast food chains. Service during the day is always off the chart. We had the Green chili burger combo and tried the new mushroom & Swiss combo lots of flavor, food was hot. Can't say enough good things.)"}
{"text":"I have visited this location many times since I work nearby and it is just across the street. Overall, they are pretty consistent with the quality in their food. I took a star because of the occasional times that the food wasn't completely fresh or a little cold. I normally only get the Chile Double or the Chorizo burger, which are both really good. With my fries, I always get a ranch sauce which is 33¬¢ extra and comes out of the fridge cold. I haven't had anything to complain about."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about whataburger. I was excited to try it until o got to this location. The woman was rude at this location who was handling the drive through. She hands me a drink and before I can put it in the cup holder she yelled \"ma'am\" like one I'm 21 I'm not a ma'am. So didn't give us straws and a receipt until I asked for one, which took an extra couple of minutes because she had to go back and do it. As I'm getting ready to change my life with this burger i take a bite and notice the ENTIRE thing was COVERED in mustard. I'm not picky and I wouldn't have cared if it was a little but it was like eating a mustard sandwich. I had my dad try it to make sure my taste buds weren't deceiving me and he even said it was way too much mustard. Do better y'all!"}
{"text":"The drive-thru is SO slow it's painful However, their burgers, fries and shakes keep reeling me back in........"}
{"text":"My meal was great! Patty melt was smoking hot fresh, Awesome! Tabasco ketchup, tall malted thick shake. Biscuits on the weekend!!! Worth every penny for my family when go to Avondale Whataburger."}
{"text":"Thirty minutes in the drive thru with only 2 cars ahead of me! They apologized about the wait, saying \"good news, the food will be fresh!\" It was not fresh, it was cold. Long wait, mediocre food. I will not be back!"}
{"text":"I made myslef a promise not to review chains if I could help it but in this case, I can't...help it.  Whataburger is a good place to get a greasy burger..you can get jalapenos added which I love and they have a pretty decent breakfast sandwich if you're snarky in the morning and need something to remove the snark. If that doesn't work, trying ordering a Diet Dr. Pepper (or a regular one for that matter) in the morning and please use the drive-through.   The lady on the other end of the talkin' box will put on a smile on your face simply by the way she says Dr. Pepper during the order confirmation process.  She rolls the R in Pepper so beautifully, I'm fired up right now just thinking about it.  I don't know her name and I don't want to. She's just the Dr. Pepperrrrrr lady and she will remain so forever.  Do yourself a favor, go here in the morning and listen to the sweet music of the rolling R."}
{"text":"I like them for breakfast best, they know how to scramble an egg without browning it!"}
{"text":"First time at Whataburger. Arrived at noon on a Tuesday and it was hopping. The line moved quickly tho.   I ordered the Sweet and Spicy Burger as a meal. It came to $8.41 and arrived in seven mins.   The fries were good but lacked any salt. I didn't see any available until I was ready to leave and then saw that the person who delivered my meal to my table had it but it was never offered; just ketchup.   The burger was actually very good. A good mix of sweet and spicy, just as advertised. It was a rather large sandwich, as designed by the original owner/founder. He agonized over getting the right sized bun, way back when. Really good bun BTW. I'm picky about my hamburger buns and this was a really good one. Don't overlook that aspect.   I will definitely try Whataburger again."}
{"text":"All honesty. i pull up 11pm, munchies in FULL effect. Everyone's super friendly. Cleanliness is a 10. My burger and shake came hella fast. I enjoyed. To hell with anyone who leave a bad review the world needs less pissed off white people."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through. Man working had great customer service. Waited a good bit of time for the food. Fries were hot and delicious. Burger, on the other hand, was cold and had clearly been sitting under a warming lamp. Cheese barely melted to the patty, bun was tough, and bacon was soggy. At least the fries were on point..."}
{"text":"I ordered a Powerade which was pictured clearly on their drive-thru menu, was told that they don't have any. Then I asked for a water bottle instead, and again, I was told they don't have that either. Never once did she mention that they were out at the moment, but that they don't sell that???? Then why would it be on the menu?? Then as I drive up to the window it is in an awkward turn which leaves me more distant than usual at a drive-thru window. The same girl handed me my drink but then quickly withdrew and refused to give it to me until I paid. Very unprofessional! She shouldn't have tried to hand me my $2 drink if she thought I wasn't going to pay. I always hand over my card or my cash first thing, and who goes to a fast food place to rob them of a drink??? She must think it comes out of her welfare check or something because it was pretty uncalled for and unnecessary. Good job whataburger for hiring incompetent HS drop outs with no common sense!"}
{"text":"This isn't a burger. Plain & simple. This sucked. Someone told me this burger was better than In & out. I should have never even wasted my $. Uggghh"}
{"text":"Amazingly good pancakes. Our son from Houston Told us how good they are.  He was right, as good or better than most other places including Denny's. Plus you get free senior beverage. We have been enjoying their pancakes for several years now. Try the jalapeno cheddar biscuit too."}
{"text":"When it comes to good pancakes you can't go wrong at Whataburger. My wife and I come. Here for their pancakes and find them to be in the top 3 for great pancakes. With \"senior\"coffee we both eat breakfast for under $6."}
{"text":"Thank you for not changing the chicken strips, too bad the butter milk dressing is gone and too bad I had to pay 38 cents for an extra ranch which I didn't need!"}
{"text":"Definitely not a fan!  I would not go there again.  I ordered the cheeseburger which was not very hot.  The burgers are quite large which for some people would be a good thing, but I thought it was rather dry and tasteless.  I also ordered the patty melt which tasted better, but the three burgers were expensive and very disappointing.  The bun was dry and tasteless, the burger over cooked, dry and also tasteless. I would not recommend nor go there again. There are a lot better burger choices out there!"}
{"text":"Delicious burger and fries!!!   I love that they have spicy ketchup along with regular ketchup! It's delicious. The workers are very helpful - not too 'friendly' but I personally don't need staff to be overwhelmingly \"fake\" friendly.  I was very satisfied with my meal. The burger was HUGE with delicious accessories - lettuce, tomato, onion, PICKLES, mustard ... The fries were very good, too! A great meal for when you want to splurge on fast food."}
{"text":"I am from Texas, so I absolutely adore Whataburger. But this is by far the WORST one I have ever been to. I go to it because it's the only one remotely close to me, but their service is always slow. It took me 20 min in the drive thru to get one sandwich combo. Absolutely absurd!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best service ever!! The cashier Lorena, didn't rush me to order, helped me choose the perfect desert for my sweet tooth and she has a friendly smile. I liked that I was able to use the restroom right away and Very Clean restroom also."}
{"text":"WORST customer service for subpar, overpriced food!!! My son loves Whataburger... but, after my HORRIBLE experience today, I will NOT be returning to this location again!! The girl who works the drive thru at the Chandler Blvd and I-10 location was beyond rude with the WORST attitude problem!! Whataburger should really re-evaluate who they allow to represent their business.  If I could give 0 stars to this location, I would!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with my Whatachicken sandwich, but my friend who got the melt was thrilled. Quick, friendly service otherwise."}
{"text":"The best food beats any american fast food, definitely better than mcdonalds. Affordable and friendly customer service, most important food is delicious and I hate fast food personally"}
{"text":"Umm...yuck! First, the decor is so outdated it feels dirty and old. Second, my order was delivered wrong. By the time it came out correctly everyone else was done eating. The burger was greasy and flavorless. I didn't finish it and won't be back."}
{"text":"It's actually not as bad as I expected. But it's not anywhere near my favorite greasy spoon. There are so many places I'd rather get my greasy fix at. Not gonna lie... I was a bit disappointed. I mean if you follow HS sports. I've heard players who didn't want to leave the state of Texas because they'd miss whataburger. Wow it's not bad, but it's not Shake Shack and it ain't better than In & Out!! Not today, tomorrow or ever. You can take that to the bank. You're welcome! Btw one thing in the favor for this place if you're in Arizona is they're open later than most restaurants."}
{"text":"I can't believe I paid for this garbage. The only redeeming thing in the whole meal was the iced tea. Never, ever, again."}
{"text":"As feeble and futile as it is to rate another franchise, I have to admit I was a little giddy in trying whatever made this Southern-seaboard establishment so popular amongst the Houston Rappers and other Southern entertainers alike. Coming from California with such cult burger followings as The Habit and Father's Office, I would say my sense for a decent burger is somewhat honed. Whataburger was next on my list.  The location seemed new and dining area was spotless. I ordered their general Whataburger with fries and a drink that came out to roughly $5. Their niche? They bring out a tray full of condiments and napkins with your food so you grab what you want. Neat.  As my friend was watching me take my initial bite, he knew what the verdict would be. He thought I hated it. Wrong. I thought it was flat and precisely cafeterian. The only form of moisture was mustard and the meat itself was mundanely unseasoned. The fries likewise had no salt but were well-sized and well-fried. As for the drink... keeping up with the Texas tradition they had sweet tea. Plus one.   I could see why this franchise is open 24/7 and why young adults enjoy it's existence especially between the hours of dusk to dawn. When your tastebuds have gone numb and where flavor isn't a huge issue, Whataburger will be there to suit whatever your waste wishes."}
{"text":"Has a very fresh feel. Ask for the spicy ketchup it's awesome. Food came out fast, used the ladies room and the food was at the table. Drink sizes are nice and big."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly and attentive, I was pleasantly surprised to get this at a fast food place, for a sec I had walked back in time to the era of soda shops and diners and expected to see roller skating car hops next.   Though I had a to go order, I was met by two young lovely girls, one who brought me my meal in the bag and the other my drink.   Along with that came the gal with a  tray, at first I thought it would be candy or cigars though on closer inspection it was varieties of ketchups and napkins and such.  I would come visit whataburger again just to see that.  Alas, even with great marketing and happy go lucky people, I arrived at what I came for, the root beer shake and avocado bacon burger.  If I could rate just on the staff, it would be 5 stars all the way, though the food this trip rather failed me. Minus a star for charging for the full meal deal when I only wanted a sandwich. Not so happy about that and didn't notice till I got home (about 2 blocks from here).  The fries, surprisingly, were cold and seemed like your generic McDonalds frozen extra proceesed variety.   The burger and bun were smushed and cooked a boring medium all over -- granted I was never asked how I wanted it cooked, and this isn't smashburger -- it almost seemed microwaved from frozen. Aren't these supposed to be fresh?  My 'guac spread' had chunks of avo, though it wasn't quite what imagination was dreaming for 'avocado' in mind.  The bacon was plentiful, though a bit undercooked for my taste.   On the plus side, the sauce, oh whatever mystery sauce, it was quite good and just about made up for the otherwise bland burger.  The root beer shake was, well, interesting. Consistent thickness throughout if not a bit runny, like root beer flavored milk with some ground up potato or thickening something to give more texture, okay it was meant for a straw!  Hey it tasted fine, so I ended up putting it in the freezer for later. After several minutes it became root beer soft serve and now spoonable. Yay. If whataburger sold it like that, you could call it dessert.  Tldr; Excellent service, meh food. Give these guys another try, see what the next visit brings..."}
{"text":"Never. Again. (at this location)  Friday night was rough.  On the way back from the bar I blew out a tire and changed it on the side of the road at 2 AM.  By the time I got that taken care of and got everyone home it was nearly 3.  I was spent and needed a little sustenance.  Taco Bell is almost closed, so where else to go??  I channeled the old college student within and went to Whataburger.  Whatamistake.  Come to think of it I've had a couple sketchy experiences at this location (i.e., undercooked meat etc), but alcohol and/or exhaustion must have clouded my judgement.  Being the ONLY customer in the drive thru, getting a single burger should not have taken this long.  I would say it may have taken longer since they were adding a slice of cheese they so graciously charged and additional .45 cents for, but wait, they neglected to put it on at all.  After taking one bite it all became clear.  It took so long because they must have been shaking a salt shaker above it for at least 5 minutes.  Gross.     Never. Again."}
{"text":"Came here and was really happy but they are under staff and running around trying to get things don't really wanted spicy ketchup and well they are out and didn't tell me till I got my food. It is all good I understand you run out of things but you should let your customers know."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. I've given this location several chances despite the constantly long wait times and receiving food that was either reheated or cold. I went through the drive thru at 130 AM yesterday and observed that while my food was being prepared a trio of employees were standing together hovering over my food, pouring condiments on their fingers and licking it off. They were not wearing gloves. I was so perturbed and uncomfortable that I drove off, vowing never to return. If I'm craving whataburger in the future I will just drive to the location by ASU."}
{"text":"This morning after Church found us for breakfast at Whataburger.  Having a strange family we had both breakfast and lunch items this morning.  The Burgers are hard to beat always tasty and the way you want them like add green-chilies \"YUM\".  The french fries and the hash brown sticks were no good this morning. \"1\" old and cold, started to take them back but the youngest had already eaten 2 of the sticks and put french fries on his burger (on his burger), yes, he's my kid.  The best thing we had was the biscuits and sausage gravy, always the same and only about $2.29... I think... Sausage and Egg sandwiches are OK \"3\", but stick to the Burger \"your way\""}
{"text":"After one bit of my grilled chicken sandwich, I instantly regretted going here. The lettuce was slimy, the mayo tasted rancid and the chicken was not hot. I threw out he sandwich. It was disgusting."}
{"text":"sadly~~went thru the drive-thru and ended up with only half my order;thankfully we were planning to stay in the car and eat!! so i go back in, tell them the \"issue\" and oh yes~~i was given yet another  whataburger w/cheese, so we stupidlysat and ate two cold whataburgers w/cheese and cold fries!!! i spent $20 as i also got 4 cinnamon rolls, which those were good but that will be our last time here!!! poor poor service~~and when you go in, everyone is just standing around chatting!!!"}
{"text":"I live very close(come here avg once every 2 weeks)and they are always good but could have a 10-15 minute wait during peak hours.Tonight a new employee who Said it'd be the beast party melt and he wasn't lying. Think you for the consistency over the past 2 years."}
{"text":"This Whataburger is my favorite!  The employees are friendly and I feel like a person, not a number when I drive through.     The burgers are tasty with the perfect amount of mustard, the large soda comes in a styrofoam cup and stays cold for hours and the fries are not too salty.  You cant ask much more from all American fast food!    Oh yeah and they have biscuits and Gravy for Breakfast."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was fast. Only a 3 star for the petty reason of 39 cents for a ranch packet. Not a total game breaker, but it's the small things that annoy me."}
{"text":"Boooyaahhh! I ate it, so I will rate it! I am such a regular here that the staff refers to me by first name or with a big excited smile knowing I am back! Actually no not really, but everyone is super polite and it is clean! Talking about polite, Marie and Theresa are the two individuals who I prefer to deal with, out of anybody, working here, but if they are not there, anyone will do, but those two ladies are super awesome!  So before, there once use to be several Whataburgers locations closer to where I lived. That is no longer the case and I am a sad panda.  I always order a #2 (Double meat Whataburger), add cheese, extra pickles, extra onions and extra mustard on the bun! I feel those three things help perfectly clash with each other so I can fully savor the meat and the overall meal. The staff never even judges me or gripes about me wanting all the extra stuff.   The fries, always crisp and golden and not too salty, but enough salt to have with the \"Fancy Ketchup\" ! I always grab extra \"fancy ketchup\" here to take home with me.  Onion rings taste sooooooooooooooo good. Add some ranch for 30 some cents, and yep..    Inside, like I said, clean.. but they play 50s-60s music, and it is music I grew up listening to, so I like the ambiance!   What I like is that I can go in at the 3am and sit down and my food is cooked just as fresh as if I ordered it at 2pm! This place is open 24 hours so this place is legendary in my book. Yes, I said it, LEGENDARY!  Here are the downsides.  You have to eat the food right there and then, right away. Not one closer to me. If you Whatasize the Fries, it's the same size as the large fries! Don't do it!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place out. Rand had told me about it but you can't really know until you try for yourself. The help was friendly and so on.... when it comes to fast food two things decide 4 me Food vs. Price. The Burger I got was Juicy and wonderful I ordered a combo and it was like $8 and change. Not much else to report folks. =)"}
{"text":"I never have anything bad to say about this Whataburger location. There service is great and ftiendly. I love there food. Yes it's located in the  \"ghetto\", but it's delicious. Give it a go!"}
{"text":"Burgers were decent. They were Big and I thought they were well put together. This is probably one of the Biggest Burgers I have eaten that didn't fall to pieces on me. Usually when you got a big burger with tons of stuff in it, The bun crumbles and stuff squishes out the sides. This Burger or whoever put it together did an Awesome Job! The Shake on the other hand was Booooo!. The lid was on halfway and I almost spilled it when I grabbed the cup from the guy at the window, it had fudge along the side that I got on my hand and then on my shirt. But all in all, it was a Good experience. I enjoyed the Burger and the Shake was Tasty. Would I come back agaig? If I was in the area. Its a Good burger spot, but not good enough that I would drive across town for it. But if I am in the area, I would definetly stop in."}
{"text":"They say In and Out has better Burgers but I've eaten at In and out and they don't hold a candle to Whataburger. We love Whataburger my wife likes their Spicy Chicken sandwich but me I get the Double Whataburger with double Cheese."}
{"text":"I came in one morning and I love the biscuits and grey. Amazing. Can't wait to go back. Customer service was great every friendly staff."}
{"text":"Very impressed, one of the cleanest locations and friendly staff, got the sweet and spicy Whataburger and it came out delicious, perfect melted cheese warm bun. The sweet tea was very good and the fries were nice and fresh! I'd highly recommend this location, super super clean restaurant and good quality in the food preparation! Very impressed!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here food was ok not cooked enough sent back and when got food back again looked like someone had sat on it . Was all smashed down and looked terrible I just looked at the server and she smiled . I took few bites and threw it out . Burger made me sick later that afternoon do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else this was second time I tried it here and it was worse than first ."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  Then again as a vegetarian who likes to eat healthy for the most part there is really nothing on the menu for me.  Took the kids to get the chocolate brownie pie.  None of my three children really liked it.  Took about 15 minutes for them to make it also."}
{"text":"We went late night on Saturday in the drive thru. The burgers were fresh and service speed was decent. The bacon on my burger however was not good and they left off my husband's bacon, but he didn't miss anything because I ended up taking mine off. The burger was hot fresh and a big portion. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Clean dinning room, easy parking. I got the JrWhataburger and medium onion rings $4.02. Had I noticed the limited seasonal menu that included a pineapple milkshake I sure would have ordered that too! I originally wanted to kids meal but the Jr Burger includes some veggies so I don't feel so bad about skimping the diet plan - they also will make an Barq's Rootbeer float if you ask with the vanilla icecream and the fountain rootbeer. They make it however you want it it's pretty great to have one near by again wish they'd make it further out west but I guess In'n'Out would be a huge competition. What you don't pay in dollars you will in calories LOL but sometimes you just need a treat."}
{"text":"For several years, I have enjoyed eating at this particular Whataburger. I can always depend on a clean, peaceful, and quiet environment to eat. I can also depend on fresh iced tea being available. Rather than hiring high school students, they tend to hire more mature employees who care a lot about their work. I always feel welcome at this particular Whataburger (unlike other Whataburgers). I also appreciate that the background music is played sofly."}
{"text":"Not too bad for fast food. Burger comes with mustard & pickles which I always ask them to leave off. More reasonably priced than some other drive thoughts. My daughter likes their chicken strips."}
{"text":"Love the burgers.  Love the breakfast even more.  And Diet Dr Pepper fountain drink - heaven."}
{"text":"Do not go through the drive thru. With no exageration it was 27 monutes for a grilled cheese.    Either buy a larger grill or hire competant people"}
{"text":"Not bad for my first visit. I had the patty melt and it was pretty tasty. Greasy, but tasty. Fries were decent, too. Brb, gonna give their honey bbq chicken sw a try."}
{"text":"The little asian woman with glasses working the drive thru window, late night, (or as in her case - morning) is wonderful. She is fast while everyone else is turtle speed.  She is consistently enthusiastic and takes pride in her work, it seems. I hope she is the manager.        The other emloyees could probably learn a thing or two from the display of her work ethic. Food is sometimes wrong and they are not really fast paced. You can see them do everything through that window. Check your food before you drive home (as you should at any fast food joint). I LOVE whataburger and will drive pass 2 Jack in the box/McD's to find one. Every time  If you dine inside, dont get an awkward feeling when they offer to refill your drink! They do these things here. They seem to care about their customers. Very hospitable."}
{"text":"Stopped on vacation. Heard the burgers were good and didn't want the typical fast food. Gotta say the burger was very good and my wife's chicken fajita taco was awesome. The fries are hot and the service was warm and friendly. Wish they had one back home. We will be back again"}
{"text":"Came here last year with my bro and some friends and it was great, I actually didn't want to eat here but my bro Eddy, decided to go and I liked it.m, surprising enough Our home girl loved it too, which says something, she is a picky ass eater and I mean picky.   But I liked how everything was so fresh and clean and it had an awesome taste to it.  What i ate really made me happy and I cant wait to come back to AZ and eat their again. I really appreciate the freshness and the way it tasted.   The drive through experience was okay, I mean it could have been faster. They did forget to give us some condiments but one of us went inside to get them.   Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"The bacon burger, very juicy and everything was very well prepared. The fries were everything that I hoped for! For being fast food they hot every point. Except for pricing. A tad high for end product.   Overall, definitely a must stop place to eat in a rush."}
{"text":"Not to many of The Whataburger locations left... one great thing, when I walk into one there always busy! Which is good to see! Love there food but my mouth waters for there onion rings--which I totally forgot to take a pic!"}
{"text":"My first time here I ordered a chicken strip sandwich and I got it cold. But all I had to do was ask nicely for them to make me one hot and they brought it out to me hot and it was super yummy! They were very nice and professional about it too. Great service !!"}
{"text":"2nd time thru the drive thru.  Very nice gentleman took my order. Even let me order off the breakfast menu before 11pm.  Allowed me to take my time, to look at menu. Didn't rush me. I appreciate that. I know people expect\"fast\" all the time. I appreciate him taking the time.   He did forget to give me my daughters milk. I am in line getting it now. Very nice man. Accidents happen."}
{"text":"Came to Whataburger expecting the place to be closed  but luckily was open. Asked for a recommendation on what to get and the whole staff chimed in giving their recommendations, had a elaborate order from everybody's favorites turned out to be fantastic! Went back and asked for everyone that helped out with my order... Edgar, jabari, Eddie, neo, and kim. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This whataburger is my favorite burger place! They are always consistently good and food is fresh. And their prices are pretty reasonable. Employees are friendly and always nice! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"The food at this location is decent, though we experienced terrible service from Ashleu Rutherford.  The dining room was an icebox, and when we complained, Ashley seemed annoyed but claimed she would turn the air down.  She never did and lied to our faces when we questioned her shortly thereafter... Will probably go to other locations in the future, where service is not such an issue."}
{"text":"How many business can identify their product with a clever name.  I just want to repeat the name of this special franchise over and over because not only is it clean, fast, friendly, efficient and simply just plain good.  Everyone has heard of the west coast best burger, well let me tell you this is not them.  The WC burger place is great too but were not here for that CA staple.  Here you get this juicy  flavorful burger.  It is as good as a fast through joint burger can get. I have only been to two or three different locations and I know I have so much more to write but if your in the vicinity of on of these you must visit the W and get your fill.  Do it you wont regret it."}
{"text":"When I want a fresh and juicy burger WHATABURGER is the place I go to !  I love the Bacon & Cheese Whataburger.    Combo meal is only $6.88 after taxes and that includes your fries and drink.  This restaurant is always clean.  Employees friendly and nice and the best part ?    Both the drive thru and dining room is open 24 hours !  Whataburger is old school I remember ordering their food at America West Arena ( Now U.S. Airways Center ) when I went to Suns games back in the early 90's."}
{"text":"I've been a lifelong lover of Whataburger's food. They offer great late night options for those of us who love breakfast all day. My favorite is the egg, potato, and cheese taquitos. Try them, you won't be disappointed! This particular location also has great customer service."}
{"text":"Check your order before you leave the drive-thru window! For the THIRD time in a month or so, something was missing. When I'm ordering a bite for myself, it's not a big deal - but when I'm doing a food run for the folks at work & I return without something someone ordered...no bueno. To Whataburger's credit, the manager is always exceptionally pleasant and courteous when I call to share what happened, & they do offer to make it right next time... but it's sure be nice if it were all a non-issue."}
{"text":"Waited almost 20 minutes for a BBQ chicken strip sandwich and they couldn't even make it correctly. Ended up with a plain chicken strip sandwich, not a drop of BBQ sauce on it. How hard is it to make this simple sandwich?!?"}
{"text":"This place is seen OUTSIDE of California. On my way to Texas one year I saw tons of these places but failed to get to eat at any of them. Here was my chance during my trip to Arizona. It's a cool looking place with the white and orange colors that light the place up. I ordered the simple items such as the burger and fries. I was hoping they had the spicy ketchup but that's no longer the issue.   The burger here is okay. It's no In-N-Out. A decent burger that gives you what you need. It feeds the hungry. The fries were nice, crispy , and rightly salted. They have their own ketchup here, but nothing beats Heinz ketchup. If you're a fast food lover and have never tried it then come on through. Just don't expect anything mind-blowing."}
{"text":"So... Green Chili burger means only 0.25 oz of green chilies on half of the burger? This is the first time I get such a sad looking burger from this location.  Fries were cold and the bread was at room temperature. I looked for my receipt to see the price of the burger but I never got a receipt. I will give this location one more try sometime in the next week or so but if the quality of the food is still this poor, most likely I would stop going there.  Customer service was great."}
{"text":"We came to Whataburger on Friday/Saturday at 12:30 and the whole experience was bad. We ordered 2 number 3's 1 with cheese only 1 everything no kethchup both with extra cheese,  issues both had everthing on them. 3  Bob's 2 with bacon 1 with sausage all with ectra cheese all 3 had sausage and no extra cheese 1 patty melt that was made right. 1 biscuits and gravy that was ok 3 lg frys only got 2.  Other issues inside the female bathroom there were 2 people shooting up drug's we told the staff and they saud \"oh okat\" then heard them talking in the back \"the tweekers are back at it again and laughing.\" we tried call the store but got no answer. I sent them an E-mail and a PM thew Facebook with no reply."}
{"text":"Great for a late night snack. The fries are always very fresh and this location in particular has great service. The food is always fresh. I will continue coming here. Oh yeah, the strawberry milkshake YES!!"}
{"text":"With mass chain restaurants, I can't necessarily review the food, as it's standard throughout each franchisee. However, this specific Whataburger is unbearably slow--you can expect to wait about 15 minutes for a relatively simple order. This isn't exactly because of lazy employees, but I believe the restaurant is understaffed frequently. Once, after an ASU football game, there were four employees manning the restaurant for about forty to fifty customers, and I waited about 45 minutes after ordering to receive my food."}
{"text":"Restaurant was freezing. Food was wrong. Twice. Instead of remaking my burger they just put another patty on it. This place is awful"}
{"text":"Horrible. Walked in at 7pm on a Sunday. Not one customer. Woman stood three feet from me made new eye contact or greeted me. After a few minutes some guy yelled \"be with you in a meeting minute\" over his shoulder. What's the hold up???? Nobody there. After 5 minutes I left. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I just spent $40 on lunch for my guys and I can't get free condiments. They charge for them. What?? It's not like we ordered off a \"dollar menu\". Oh well, came to pick up several bbq chicken sandwich meals and left . Hopefully the food is as average as normal or I may just give up for the day."}
{"text":"For a fast food joint I find whataburger to be more appealing than the rest. What really sucks though is no matter how much you spend on a meal, when they come by with your meal and the condiments don't ask for ranch or bbq sauce because it's extra. This petty nickel and diming is a real big turnoff and that definitely deters me from eating here.   This location is easy to access and has a drive-through, which I think most of them do but I figure not everyone reading these reviews have been to whataburger so here you go.....  Burgers are good and whataburger likes to emphasize on the fact that there are thousand and one possibilities for making a custom burger. Whatever your bag is, they can make it. The fries are pretty decent, sometimes they're a bit more saltier than I like but they are good. The pies are yummy! And of course last but not least, my favorite is the honey barbecue chicken strip sandwich on Texas toast. Delish!!!! I don't stop at this establishment a lot, primarily because they don't have a lot of locations but when I do that chicken strip sandwich is my jam!   Just a side note, is it just me or has anyone noticed that whataburger seems to hire people on the low end of the spectrum to work here. I get the whole minimum-wage thing but sometimes I really question the mental stability of the person taking my order. Not trying to be mean or unheartful (I made that word up) but sometimes I feel like someone's a sandwich short of a picnic if you know what I mean. Hats off to them though, because even though I feel their employees are somewhat questionable, mainly appearance- they have never messed up an order. I guess being the food connoisseur (aka food snob) that I am I probably have my standard set a bit too high when I walk into a fast food chain. Hopefully you enjoy and find my review useful as I work on my foot to mouth issue"}
{"text":"I always find this beacon of light in a dreary & dismal ghetto. It brightens my day & clogs my arteries at the same time-pure perfection. haha! Today was a more exciting day than usual for the employees and patrons of this particular location. Somebody needed some discipline next door at the lingerie shop so 15 cops later, their little circus act with a large bear riding a motorcycle and a bunch of reporters filled our afternoon with curiosity. Tho I'm sure this wasn't entirely the reasoning for the good spirits, I have to say the gentleman taking orders could have filled in with a small comedy show in between all the commotion.  Back to me....My poison of choice....Honey BBQ chicken strip sammich on Texas toast.  It's pretty delectable. I pretty much get it every time. I trick myself into thinking since it has chicken, its healthier. Today tho I tempted fate, I got a side of jalape√±os to add a little fire to my taste buds. Not bad at all! Next time I'll order them on the sandwich so I can see if heating them up a bit adds a little heat.... I really like their fries when they are warm so of course I took down a couple of those but this time... You got it! I ordered the jalape√±o ranch to top them off. Not impressed with that tho, the ranch lacked flavor. Oh well 1 out of 2 jalape√±o attempts came out well. Since I'm a half full kind of guy, I'll call today a success."}
{"text":"This place is nice and clean  Very friendly and they come to your table to see if we need anything. Perfect!  I only have to say please cook you burger longer your meets r not cooked long enough. My meat was not cooked  all way way through!  It taste like high school burgers! I like to go into a hamburger joint and well done charbroiled hamburger. Please cook your longer meat please."}
{"text":"I gave 3 stars because the food was fresh and the restaurant was clean. However when the girl came and asked us if we wanted condiments I told her salt and ketchup she gave salt and pepper and started to walk away I told her can I have some ketchup please and she whipped around and practically threw them at me. Than the young kids one of them a manager was talking about him being a \"1 min man\" at the counter. Real professional. Keep your adult talk for the back of the restaurant and if you don't want to deal with people asking you for ketchup get a job that doesnt require you to do so!"}
{"text":"This place was just as the name says... what a burger lol .. I had the guacamole bacon burger . It was basically just mushed up avocado. My boyfriend had a chili burger which was terrible as well. The service was super causal , moving slow and joking with an off duty employee . Guy was sleeping in the drive through and the armed security guard was just chilling . Ummm but why is he armed at a fast food joint? Ok Arizona lol"}
{"text":"Went here for an emergency food stop to put a much needed chocolate shake intermission on a night of drinking.   The only problem, I didn't order a big enough sized shake!   The shake and burger were delicioso and probably part of the reason I feel slightly less terrible this morning. What a burger!"}
{"text":"Went to this location today and I have to say it was a really bad service! I asked for cheese on our burgers, there was none. They didn't have the soda I wanted, and when we got home to eat our food, the fries were dry and cold like they were sitting out all night and when I took a bite out of my burger there was a blonde hair in it! When I called to say something, there was no answer! Go to a different location!!! NOT THIS ONE!!!!"}
{"text":"Whataburger is by far one of my favorite fast food burger places. Yeah other big fast food giants get you with those \"dollar menus\", but Whataburger has the tasty burgers doesn't matter what the price...like I always say YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET. My personal favorite is the double with cheese, jalapenos, and bacon on a Texas Toast bun! However, they have healthy options, chicken strips, and even breakfast. If you're a burger freak like I am and cant decide what to eat, stop torturing yourself and just head over to Whataburger."}
{"text":"We stopped here to try the burgers. They weren't bad. They were huge, in fact. However, the service was lackluster, as the guy working the register just would not acknowledge the extra mayo I wanted on my sandwich despite me saying it 4 separate times. Surprise, surprise, no extra mayo. Even more surprising, the cheese I asked for was missing from my sandwich as well. It seemed to take a really long time to get our food. I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"These guys ROCK!!!! Buy far the best burger joint in North Phoenix. They always get it right. And there are the fry's... these best Mc from here to eternity."}
{"text":"I'm a big whataburger fan, I'm from NM and their green chili is on point, but someone needs to tell the owner to have the windows cleaned, especially the entrance doors. I almost drove away when I saw how dirty they were. The food was good, but I've had better at other locations, and there was an eyelash in my gravy. The cashier was friendly, but the lady who brought the food out was rude. I'm a very nice person, and I thanked her and she ignored me and said here it is and walked off. It's super late, so I didn't have a lot of options, but I'll definitely pass on this location in the future. I highly recommend whataburger for anyone who hasn't had It before, it's really good for fast food, just not this one in particular."}
{"text":"Meh. I actually like whataburgers food. But this place is very old and run down. Definitely needs to be remodeled on the inside. No restrooms. Not a comfortable dine-in experience."}
{"text":"Four ingedients?   I stopped at Whataburger on my to work for a breakfast sandwich. I ordered a sausage, egg & cheese biscuit sandwich. That's a total of four ingredients: Biscuit, sausage, egg, cheese. Well, they forgot the cheese.   The sandwich was good even without cheese.  I bet if I had ordered extra cheese I would been charged something like 50¬¢. Now I feel like I've been cheated.  Oh well... It's fast food, I guess mistakes will happen."}
{"text":"A good burger from a chain restaurant! Juicy, tasty, and cooked to perfection. Good job"}
{"text":"How do you F**k up a replacement order after I told you you F**ked up the first one? Ordered: Triple, no veggies, double cheese, extra mustard, add mayo. What-a-sized. What I got? A double, with veggies, no condiments. Size small.  Why did I pay for more and get less? So I called, and the manager on duty told me to write \"Chasity\" on the receipt and to come back anytime within a week to replace my order free of charge. I came back a day later, the girl at the window gave me nothing but attitude like I was lying and said \"have you been here before?\". Have I been here before? What does the fking receipt say? What kind of question is that? Do you honestly think I'm trying to pull a fast one on you? She replaces the fries, what a sized thankfully, but then gives me a SINGLE this time, with mustard only. Did you misread the order AGAIN? And then she asks if I want the drink replaced too. To be polite I said no that's fine, as long as the order is correct. I get home and the sandwich is f**cked up again.  How about you minus your attitude as if you own the franchise, and replace the order without question and apologize. The nerve of this idiot, who f**cked it up after I told her the first was f**cked up. I'm mad at myself for being polite to this moron."}
{"text":"I needed a quick lunch today after doing some errands during lunch today. I ordered the #5 which is the bacon cheeseburger, fries and a drink for $6.58. The burger tasted good but is not quite on par to a Smashburger or Culvers. The fries were average, nothing special. I did like that the size of the drink was rather large, I'm too lazy to constantly get up and refill those puny small drink cups that you normally get with the combo. I will definitely return to Whataburger when in the area and in need of a reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Whataburger locations.  We have a tradition of going here after every home Cardinals football game.  All of the employees are polite and genuinely happy to see you when you come in the door.  The food is always hot and just like you ordered it.  Best Green Chile Double I've ever found (seems to be made a little differently depending on the location).  Love getting a side of their gravy for our fries, in addition to regular or spicy ketchup.  Highly recommend this location.  My favorite Whataburger outside of Texas."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a Whataburger ever. First of all I ordered a #13 which is a 3 piece chicken strip meal for 6.44 . I noticed that the 6 piece was 6.14. My boyfriend got a #7. Our total came out to 11 and some change. I decided when we got to the window that I might as well get the 6 piece if it's a few cents less. I tell the guy to change it to the #14 which was the 6 pieces. He says okay your total is 15.91. Uhmmm, no. Almost 4 dollars more for 3 more pieces, are you kidding me??!! I tell him that in the sign it says 6.14 and he tells me that it's because they're chicken bites. He made absolutely no sense. I didn't order chicken bites, they were strips. He hands us the receipt and we look over it. This guy charged us the regular price of the #13 AND added the 3 piece chicken bites at a charge of 3.89. I DIDN'T ASK FOR CHICKEN BITES. We specifically told him we wanted to just make the 3 piece a 6 piece. My boyfriend said it was fine and he's probably new. We ended up just leaving it alone and not making a big deal out of it. BUT THEN, we get home & I start eating my food. First strip was good. Second and third were TERRIBLE! The best way to describe the flavor was stale! Tasted really old. Payed 4 more dollars for shitty food. definitely NOT RETURNING"}
{"text":"First and last time visiting this place. Sean was as rude as anyone could be and was not forthright with us when we tried to use our coupons.  We were shamed, lied to and told only one coupon per order.  The coupons clearly state \" one per customer\",so we did not appreciate being harassed and shamed by Sean and Gina the manager.  They made a spectacle of us and made us come inside. The whole thing was ridiculous.  Whatabunchofassholes!  To top things off, the food was mediocre, service atrocious, and everyone working here has no heart.  Do not eat here ever!"}
{"text":"After waiting all day at the dealership to finally drive away with a new car, we decided to get a quick lunch/dinner (it was around 2 pm so we're going to be snacking later but my mom and I were STARVING) and we pulled in to get something. Of course, being very hungry, the systems on every single console decided to update at the exact same time just as it was our turn because timing is just like that and sometimes fate hates you. These poor employees were just crestfallen. They tried everything they could but it was too late. So we, and everyone behind us, had to wait for everything to finish updating so we could order and they could take our money. Every employee tried to make it better. Every employee kept a smile on their face and wrote everything down so they could keep track later. People behind us were upset, some even walked out because of the wait. HOW IS THAT THE EMPLOYEES' FAULT?! How ungrateful do you have to be? If a system update is happening, then it's happening. Especially when it's a chain that's controlled by a head office somewhere outside the state. Suck it up, wait your turn, and soon enough you'll have your food. That's exactly what we did and before we knew it, we had paid and had our burgers (whatamelt for me and the regular number one for mom). Delicious, cooked perfectly, and hot just like always. Every employee in the place did their very best. They kept things moving the best they could, despite long lines inside and in the drive thru. I hope the head office understands this, because they really deserve recognition for how well they handled the situation, despite the complaints from some of the people behind us. Some people just can't seem to wait five extra minutes; there's no excuse. My mother and I hadn't eaten since 8 am this morning and had no problem waiting a little longer (seriously, it was only about five extra minutes). Keep doing what you're doing guys! You're doing great!"}
{"text":"First time to ever try Whataburger. To my surprise the whataburger was delicious. The drive-thru was a bit slow, but it had to have been due to a huge order from the car ahead of us. Once that car was gone, we were served very quickly with hot food too. The server at the window was pleasant too. Thanks for a great experience. Being from California, we don't have whattaburgers. My husband loved it so much, he wants to stop here on our way back home."}
{"text":"Great burger joint.food lives up to the 50s traditional feel. Clean environment and great service. I especially like their onion rings."}
{"text":"Great Burgers always fresh and delicious also the Onion Rings are good too"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Whataburger, this location is near my work. I usually bring left overs from home. But sometimes I get lucky and get to eat out!! As I say this time and time again. A fast food franchise is just that! So my expectation is not that high! I love their chicken BBQ sandwich! I get this every time I eat at Whataburger. You can compare this to the Carl's Jr BBQ chicken sandwich. Fries are a little salty at times, so I usually ask for no salt. Service was just fine, prices are a little higher? But you are not getting a Big Mac!! This will always be an option for me."}
{"text":"Ever since I tried Whataburger for the first time is Texas, they have been one of my favorites. Since there wasn't any in SoCal, I was very happy when I relocated to the Valley that there were plenty of Whataburgers to pass around!! Been here a few times, never had any problems! But then again, I don't expect to much from a fast food joint! Plenty of parking, and seating inside. Service has been good, sometimes the drive through can be slow. Their food is better then most other fast food joints, but you do pay for it."}
{"text":"This place is clean and very friendly. The food is very good and fresh too. I am writing this review because you can tell this restaurant is operated by a family and I really wish the owner reads this review. I want to give the owner kudos for being real. I love this place because they play Christian music on the radio and are not afraid as they shouldn't be to be proud of this. Don't get me wrong I'm not a church going person but do believe in God and in this day and age where prayer is banned in our schools and other places I am relieved that there are still people out there that keep it real. Good job!  God bless and keep it up. Love your concept.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"Came to Arizona to watch Wrestlemania with my buddies. I never heard of this place before, but saw enough Whataburgers around town that I was interested in trying it.  Being a West Coast kid, no other fast food burger will ever hold a candle to In-N-Out Burger... and that's not an opinion. It's a fact.  But that isn't taking anything away from the other fast food joints. The Whataburger may be better described as the Jumbo Jack and Whopper's love child. The size and meatiness of the Whopper combined with the taste and quality of a Jumbo Jack. Both are decent, so I wasn't disappointed. It's a fast food place that isn't In-N-Out Burger... I knew what I was in for.  But there's one thing that Whataburger does better than any other fast food joint I've ever been to... they serve the ketchup in dippable sauce containers!"}
{"text":"I never thought I would give this place such a low rating but after tonights visit they truly deserve it. Jeffrey is working the drive-thru and has zero personality. He tried to charge me for sauces even though there is no sign posted.  Worst part of all he didn't give me my daughter's food and my burger order was wrong.  I know, I know I should have checked but hey I believed in him. I called and Jeff answers. I explained who i was he said he recalled me, He has me explain the situation and never tells me that he knew he didn't put the sandwich in there until I asked him point blank. Anyways, don't waste your time at this location.  You will be better off going to the Van Buren/Dysart location."}
{"text":"Well it was my first time in the \"drive thru\" ... when i got home with our order #555146 the DBL WB special looked like a hamburger bun sandwich with fajaita mix & an old piece of meat inside !!!  The other cold burger was BACH WB , ask for X-lettuce ( not happening & it was yellowish the few pieces my bacon cheeseburger had ) I could go on ... but anyways NOTE: i had always gone inside & ate with No problems for my \"special\" request on WB.   Already called location, going back with my receipt and an upset stomach !!!"}
{"text":"Best place to go for a late night snack. Their fries are better than any other drive thru and their desserts are always amazing. Could eat here daily with the variety of amazing burgers. Staff is always friendly as well."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like what a burger !!  Always stop but when in town.   I really enjoyed their burgers and the onion rings are always so good.   I also enjoyed really liked that I ordered one to go with everything on the side to take home to my dad and they packaged it so well and literally everything was on the side.  Only reason for 4 stars is that when I was eating mine you could tell they just slapped everything together and was kinda messy and I had to set it up to eat it."}
{"text":"This was the first time we ate here; this chain is not in the Pacific NW. This is \" fast\" food, but a niche above MickyD's. We went in to place our togo order. We were struck at the friendliness of the staff. The interior was clean.  Our order, two cheeseburgers, took longer than expected to make.. We thought we would get piping hot food due to the wait.. Wrong. It was lukewarm.. A good burger drips down your hands and arms. These burgers didn't really require napkins. We think the chain should stay down South; they couldn't compete with the local chain Burgerville. We rate fast food by the temp of the food and if the order was correct; its fast food, it's handy,  taste rarely has anything to do with our rating. It was handy and our order was correct....can you really expect anymore?"}
{"text":"We have a trade concept here in America whereby the patron pays for an item, and the vendor hands over the item paid for. It's that simple. And, it works at most places in America, except McDonald's.  At McDonald's, you pay for something at one window and hope to receive it at the next. But McDonald's doesn't believe in this concept.  McDonald's believes in taking your money at one window and at the next, instead of handing over your food, they hand you nothing but a friendly smile and request you pull ahead, saying \"We'll bring your order right out when it's ready.\"  Fundamentally, this concept is wrong on many levels, but for the sake of verbosity, I'll spare you all but two.  First, as I said, I paid for something at the window. I want to leave the window with something other than some Mexican kid smiling at me with his gold-rimmed tooth, asking me in broken english to please pull up.  Second, I beat my ass in traffic to cut-off the car turning left into the drive-thru, and now, that fucker has his food onboard, and is likely picking at his french fries. While I on the other hand am parked in the penalty zone for ordering something I knew they'd have to make fresh....something I knew they wouldn't have sitting under those little heat lamps for the last two hours.   So I stopped going to McDonalds.  Their sixteen year-old 'managers' AND their 'please pull ahead' concept can suck a big one.   This is why I go to Whataburger.  At Whataburger, I can get their signature burger, 'The Whataburger', (wow...go figure) a coke and large fries for somewhere around eight bucks. My burger also has lots of mustard, pickles and jalapenos, (on request). All stuff I enjoy.  And, they never ask me to pull ahead. Something I appreciate in a fast-food place.  Whataburger. Where the only time you'll hear the person at the window ask you to pull ahead is when you take too long rifling through your bags, trying to find some salt for your fries, but are too stoned to locate practically anything.   Note: I love Whataburger so much, I bought one of their baseball caps online. (see photo),"}
{"text":"Stopped by this Whataburger to have breakfast, bacon taquito, hashbrowns and a drink. I ate my fresh hot hashbrowns and started on my taquito...three bites in, went to put picante on the next bite, and WTF a hair in the eggs, not just any hair, it looked like a nose hair, eyelash or a pet hair, JUST BLEEPIN' NASTY! I nearly puked right then and there. There was no argument and got fully refunded. I will NEVER be back!"}
{"text":"I love whataburger, just not this location. Employees hanging out smoking at the door or on the patio and frequent panhandlers in the poorly lit parking lot. I wish there was another location close by so I wouldn't have to go to this location"}
{"text":"I hate giving a Whatburger a 1 being from Texas where I know they are just great. I've been going to this one for sometime now since I moved from Gilbert. The one in Mesa was pretty good. This one has however turned into a dump. It seems the more I go the worse the flies get. Was there the other day and counted at one given time a total of 19 flies sitting around. This is only what I could see. The kids working behind the counter where the fries and stuff are was swatting flies with their hands then handling food. I called the customer service line but never heard anything back. Spent more time swating   flies then eating. I think the best thing for this Whataburger is bulldoze it down so it doesn't give other Whataburgers a bad rep. Probably should call the health department."}
{"text":"Horrible long ass wait! No one in line either  I would drive off but unfortunately just paid!! If I could give no stars to this location I would. They should run a timer like in and out does"}
{"text":"Awesome Sunday (11/12/17) afternoon/evening staff!! A huge thank you to their team for being friendly, attentive & accommodating. #chorizoburger"}
{"text":"This location does not support military veterans like other Whataburger restaurants do."}
{"text":"My first visit ever to Whataburger was good as far as staff friendliness, Chicken BBQ was good,  but other chicken items were ok after I added hot sauce. Prices are about average in comparison to other fast food eayeries. Overall I am pleased for a fast food establishment."}
{"text":"No where near as good as In'N'Out Burger, but pretty darn close.  They have more to offer on their menu, so it's nice to have change from the double double with cheese.  Drive-Thru or dine in, either way, the food is superb!!"}
{"text":"Usually this place is spot on. However, I came in at around 3:30 in the morning and noticed two workers I hadn't seen before being the cook and the guy taking the order. Firstly, I ordered a Monterey melt which was dressed in ghost pepper sauce and not in jalape√±o ranch. Secondly, the extra side of jalape√±o ranch I ordered wasn't delivered and instead I was given buttermilk ranch. Small things, but enough lack of attention to detail to lose two stars."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Just as bad as Stephs attitude. Can't get an order right and gets mad when you ask her for a refund. Everyone tonight was complaining about the horrible service. I wasn't the only one. No ice in the drinks. No cheese in the burgers. No sprite. Dirty establishment super slow service and Steph was rude and disrespectful."}
{"text":"This place never let me down when I need a nice big burger at a right price. I have shed a tear at this place like two times because it delicious. Better then Mc Donald's, Burger King, and etc."}
{"text":"Worst burger experience I've had in recent memory. It tasted like old Burgerking but not even as good. The people were nice enough but totally unorganized. They messed up our orders twice and were pretty flustered in how they handled it. All that would be fine I guess if the food was awesome. But It wasn't. No matter how much I wanted it to be."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, but what really knocks your socks off about this place is the customer service.  The staff truly seem to enjoy their jobs.  I think I might continue to eat here even if the food wasn't great, because I'm always so pleasantly surprised by the great service.  Seriously not your typical fast food restaurant lack of customer service."}
{"text":"This review is for the sick temptation that is unfortunately around the corner from my house.  Whataburger aka \"worldwide conspiracy to grow my ass\".  I never was a burger person before... but you've managed to suck me in.  Bravo, sir.  Bravo.  Thank you for the extra hours I will now have to spend on the treadmill."}
{"text":"Good food (if \"good\" can be associated with fast food) - but the drive-thru here is one of the slowest I have used.  You come to fast food and a drive-thru for a QUICK and easy meal. The easy part they did.. the quick part turned into a 15 min wait from order to eating. Way to long in my opinion."}
{"text":"Whataburger has been in the business of serving food for a very long time. You cant make it in the fast food industry for as long as Whatburger has by serving bad food.

The food was fresh and hot.  The burger patties at Whatburger  aren't thick  but the lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, mustard and bun really do make for a tasty burger.   I also enjoy Whatburger's breakfast items.  The Breakfast on a Bun with sausage and grilled onions is pretty good, as are the pancakes. Whatburger has  everything you want for breakfast.  This is not the Whataburger we usually go to however it wasn't bad it's just not as clean as most of the other restaurants I have visited."}

A believer is born. She had a morning taquito and to her annoyance they aren't taquito sin the general sense. They are more like flour rolled burritos lol.  But if you are looking for the fat kids shangri-la look no further than the honey butter chicken biscuit. Heck, get 2!!!!! And their oh jay is the real deal! OJ!!!!"}

{"text":"Tried to eat here last night with my husband, while on a bike ride. Well the Manager tells me our bikes can't be in the store, that they were a hazard, the store had 1 customer. Our bikes we're safely beside our table, the store wasn't busy, they were mopping the entire store at the time. I'm not sure what happened to good customer service. Or what he issue was, we spent $20 and had to sit outside and eat, on the curb, with our bikes looking inside a empty store at 845pm in PHX. Very irritating."}
{"text":"I honestly wish I could give this zero stars because this whataburger is a piece of shit. I personally work in the food industry so I can honestly say it's TERRIBLE.   My dad has experienced bad service from here, but then this time around I also did with him as well. My dad drove 15 minutes to get our food because it's the closest one.... When he comes back home, we literally received half our food. Pissed, he calls and I call because this is ridiculous!   The manager answers my call with not much help... And says \"there's not much she can do\" so she tells me to call tomorrow because the real general manager will be there.   So my dad gets back after the *second* trip and guess what? The food is ICE cold, and when he called back the manager answered again, and she was a complete and total bitch.    Honestly, McDonalds has better service than this piece of shit, so don't go there. This place doesn't deserve customers."}
{"text":"WhataBADburger.  Couldabeenbetterburger.  We came here on a quick stop before heading to our friends house and I remember the Texas Whataburger being so much better than this was!  Soggy fries with no salt, and a smashed burger is what we ended up with.   Sadness. Whataburger disappointment!"}
{"text":"The drive through was very quick and service was friendly.  However, I could not finish the burger. I took a couple bites and had to quit. There was so much grease. I regret not going to In-N-Out Burger. :-(   The fries for whatever reason were not over powered in grease and actually were pretty good."}
{"text":"I go to this one all the time. Just spent 9.00 on cold fries and a special order that was wrong. Very dissapointed."}
{"text":"I have always LOVED Whataburger of course, who doesn't? I  have even visited the original restaurant in Corpus Christie TX! This particular location has the friendliest most professional night crew.  VERY VERY good customer service!  I would hire these guys for my business, nice guys. I love breakfasts here as well, the best biscuits and gravy!"}
{"text":"I know it's shocking, but I had never been to any Whataburger until a few months ago.  I've now been to this location twice.  The first time was after 9 pm, and we ate inside.  The burgers and fries were both pretty darn good.  The gal who brought us our food and offered condiments was very pleasant, too.  I really have not one complaint.  The second time was a complete fiasco.  22 minutes in drive-thru.  I tried not to get irritated as the end result would be a really good burger, made-to-order.  Well if this burger was made-to-order, I wasn't the one who ordered it.  I will say it was assembled-to-order, however.  Not only was it cold, but the cheese had never been melted and the lettuce & tomato were still refrigerator cold.  So assembled-to-order with an already cold patty.  The fries were only slightly better.  So my relationship with Whataburger was incredibly brief and is over...unless I'm hard up late night.  Then anything's possible."}
{"text":"Great burgers! We are from California where they dont have Whataburger so we had to stop here and try.  Prices are fair. Customer service was good. They bring your food out to you with a tray of sauces to choose from. The spicy ketchup was great. Still taste like ketchup with a little extra kick. Diced onions went well on the burger. Fries were hot and fresh. If you want mayo you have to request it. I would come back and recommend eating a burger here if you are in the mood for one."}
{"text":"The Best!!! I'm a Texas Gal...so Whataburger is an all time favorite of mine!!! Love the breakfast menu--just wish it was served all day : ) It's absolutely awesome! I could eat here everyday w/out ever being disappointed. Everyone at this location is super friendly; patient & always helpful. There's lots of places to choose from for fast food but nothing compares to WB! All those other places don't ever come close not in the least in comparison to good ole WB! The service & expectations U know U are gonna get excel way beyond anywhere else because you've become accustomed to what U WILL get at WB! No Comparison to the quality of the food & service (fresh) whatsoever! U'll be a completely satisfied customer & extremely happy with the end result! It's a total rockstar fast food place to go 24/7!! How AWESOME is that?!?  I've been here many times so they now they me & basically know my order before I even say a word which is a huge bonus to have because I've always got lots of stuff on my mind so it's very awesome to have a good staff who remembers U for starters in addition to what U typically order. And that's such a Big Help!!! To sum it up--don't listen to all the crappy reviews people post...IT isn't true!!!  (((Whataburger ROCKS)))  Seriously it is always great food & service! Don't miss out on some of the absolute & best tasting fresh fast food around! Although it's kinda pricey it's totally worth every penny! Take my word I'm always gonna be straight up honest & tell ya the complete truth... the good the bad & the ugly!¬°!¬° Trust Me!"}
{"text":"Ok im from California and always saw this place on youtube and different tv shows so i was super excited. I was finally in Arizona and was able to try a burger from this place ive heard so much about. Sooo the burger comes with onion and mustard thats it the meat was ok at best, kind of taste like a wendys double stack without the toppings. I was very disappointed. After having In n Out, Habit, The Hat, Fat burger, Five guys etc. this place is at the bottom, maybe i should have added cheese and it would have been better, even the fries were cold Ive had better at the hole in the wall spot. Now the Size was decent and the price wasn't too high so thats a plus. But all in all i was disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh the memories! From a child my Dad introduced me to Whataburger. It was his favorite fast food place; even over McDonalds. Being my Fathers son, i walk in his burger shoes and too adopted his tradition.  Even through high school and beyond, my mischief days, we would frequent Whataburger often. Sometimes we would drive through the Drive Thru backwards. Or, I would walk in and grab the old microphones they used to have and start calling out my order. Oopsie (almost got kicked out for that), .  However, now that those days are in the past, I enjoy coming to this location to indulge in the standard Whataburger without onions; it's my favorite. the management at this location does a great job and they really cater to their customers. What I mean by that is, they personally come to your table with not only your food but your offerings of ketchup, salt and napkins. Wow! I don't think even In-and-Out offers that. The selections are good and I like both the patty and bread that it is conceived upon. Every once and in a while I get the itch and I need to grab my fix. I'm not sure if all locations cater to their customers like this one. Give it a a shot!  #IrishcatV2 #vinosquared #Vino2 #Vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"This specific What a burger was horrible the 2xs we went there. First time was a to go order for 3 people. Once we git home, all burger were ice cold. Fries cold.  Husband drove back and they replaced meal. I kid u not, all fries were still frozen. And he had to wait 20 min for the replacement. Second time, we went in to eat there. We Waited a.long tome for food. Had to ask for our drink cups. Table was dirty. People working there were goofing off and talking with friends that came in.  Food was cooked that time. Just took forever to get the food.  We love what a burger. We just don't love this one. Needs new management."}
{"text":"The burgers were good. It's pretty noticeable that they use fresh ingredients, but honestly the only reason why I made my friends stop and eat here was because of all the hype of it supposedly being better than In n Out. I'm sorry to break it to you guys, but it isn't even close to tasting better. I would say the burgers are comparable to Wendys."}
{"text":"The burger was awesome and a lot bigger than I was expecting, about the size of a whopper. The fries are comparable to McDonalds, service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Doesn't matter to what time of day you come to this place (I've come from various times 6 am 11 am 3 pm 11 pm etc) the drive through is ALWAYS slow. Plan on sitting in your car for 10 minutes plus. It's very irritating when I can watch all the cars quickly cycle through the McDonalds drive through in less than a minute right across the street. The food is good though just slower than heck."}
{"text":"The food isn't awesome. Saying it was ok is a stretch. Everything from the burger to the fries was just tasteless. On the positive side, the staff were very nice and pleasant to deal with."}
{"text":"If I could, I would not even give the food 1 star. My wife and I both got sick from the  food! We both had the runs after eating a green chili double burger and a fish sandwich. I would not recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I have been sitting in line for six minutes behind at the car at the window in the drive-through. If this is supposed to be fast food this is got to be the biggest joke in the world. If you're in any kind of hurry to go anywhere or even if you want to just get home on time don't stop at this water burger they are super slow."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the slowest \"fast food \"restaurants you will ever run across.  The food is fairly OK for this kind of restaurant, but if you're in a hurry, your best bet is to drive down the street one of the other fast food chains.  It doesn't matter if you order inside, or if you go to the drive-through. It is SLOW."}
{"text":"My father-in-law said that this place awesome so I figured I would give it a try. I was highly disappointed. Maybe we got them on a bad day, but for my it was just a McDonald's burger but bigger. The food was cold.   The burger had no real taste or flavor. I could only taste the onions and mustard on the burger. I have heard the shakes are good but we didn't try them.   Overall, I might give them another chance but I was pretty disappointed for the price point of the burger."}
{"text":"Julissa offered the best customer service even though there was a situation that happened. She owned the problem and and compensated us for the inconvenience. She is a great employee and should be rewarded, even if it is just a nomination for employee of the month. Cuddos to her!"}
{"text":"Definitely unexpected. Service was great and so was the food. I got a BBQ chicken sandwich with onion rings and it hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Whataburger is not in our State so we just had to stop to get a burger. Ordered #1 with cheese which was a single burger, cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, mustard and ketchup. The burger was huge and delicious! The crinkle cut fries were tasty. Soda with #1 was huge. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Drive through took 45 minutes.  Cashier's attitude was short.  Food was dry and didn't taste like what a burger should taste like.  I have to borrow my wife's thumb and give this place 3 thumbs down.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Best burger east of California!!! Love the spicy ketchup yum. Had my order quick and no wrong orders. Way to finish my trip in arizona seeing an old friend ;) and family. Love Love Love these burgers!!"}
{"text":"As someone who lives in Texas, I must say I was less than impressed with the service here. They messed up 2/4 orders, and the employees caught an attitude when we asked them to correct the mistake. One burger was made with regular bread when Texas toast was requested. We asked for just the toast and that process took like 15 minutes. Just not the kind of service I'd expect of a WB."}
{"text":"The food is okay considering it is fast-food, but the drive-thru service is terrible.  I've been to this location a few times because it's on my way home from work and every time I have to wait at least 15 minutes in the drive-thru.  No matter what I order, I am stuck waiting  - not very fast-food if you ask me..."}
{"text":"My first whataburger. Food was good. It came fairly quick. Decent price."}
{"text":"The girl in the morning on Saturday's is always super friendly.  The food is made fresh and tastes delicious for fast food friendly budgets."}
{"text":"I came in for breakfast, they were attentive and fast. They are always good here, the store is clean the employees are professional and courteous. Overall it's a great place to come to eat , definitely a step up from regular fast breakfast food."}
{"text":"Super great service , positive and polite staff. They bring you your food out. The pancakes are fluffy and made from scratch, takes longer, but worth it because they are real! Unlike McDonald's where everything is made from frozen precooked soggy fake-jacks. The coffee is good and they offer senior discounts for those who care about that."}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE! I kid you not I literally ordered 2 orders of 3 piece chicken tenders and they gave me 5, and split the 5th one in half to give me 6. I mean are you serious. On top of that they were like stale. Never coming back. They also lied to me that the sauces I repeatedly asked for were going to be in the bag. There were no sauces in the bag.... bet you when they tore my tenders in half their hands weren't even clean"}
{"text":"Wow I cannot explain how unbelievably rude the little twit was who was at the drive thru window about 10 minutes ago (10/22/17 @ 9:30 pm). After waiting 25 minutes STUCK in the drive-thru, she hands me my food, I look inside asked for the ranches I initially asked for and there was nothing so I ask for a few ranches and she says \"UGH\" under her breath like me politely asking for ranch is out of her job description. She comes back and SLAMS one single ranch in my hand. I'm like uhhh... can I have one more please? And she seriously just sat there and stared at me like I am just simply asking for too much of her time or I am interrupting her and her other coworkers not doing a damn thing back there. I wanted to pop that girl in her mouth for the lack of general respect she has for others."}
{"text":"I don't know why a lot of people like this place, food is not good and costumer service is not good, place  is dirty they don't have someone to clean tables every now an then y had to clean our table, they had @ 16 tables and all of the were dirty, we order @ $60 of food, I went and ask for some Ranch dressing and the manager wanted to charge me .40c, he wanted me to stand in line @ 3 people and do a transaction for that dressing, ok is not the money is the fact the I was not asking for a bucket of ranch dressing, after $60 of food j think I'm in title of some on the house, I dint said anything, I was not standing on line so I went back to my table to finish my crapy meal, 30 second later the customers the it was standing on line wen I ask got me a ranch dressing, wen he handed to me he made the comment (can believe this guy), said thank you for the Ranch out loud so the manager can ear me, this place sucks, never going back Shaun."}
{"text":"All I can say is double, double with cheese! Oh how I wish we had a Whataburger at home. I do miss this place.  In N Out Burger has nothing on them. All other burger places are just burgers. Whataburger is a little bit of heaven under a bun."}
{"text":"Ah! I Went today for old school lunch & had a healthy burger lunch with jalape√±os and green chilies! Call me crazy,  but it hit the spot(fast food grease)! I Dine inside and the food and customer service has always been great, Very polite."}
{"text":"In a gritty section of Phoenix sits this stately Whataburger.  Ironically, I have a passion for their chicken sandwich which his always just right and their large fries in the stand up boxes is cool.   For fast food, this is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Decided to try out Whataburger for the first time today and am so happy I did. Ordered the Green Chile Double Burger combo and was amazed. The burger was hot and a bit spicy. Fries were hot and crispy. Staff was very friendly and kept coming by the table to ask if I needed anything or if I needed a refill. Will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Green chile cheeseburger and a biscuit after midnight hit the spot. Higher quality than I was expecting and I'd come back."}
{"text":"Huge props to the folks here!   Right before midnight on Saturday night a big green bus rolls up with 17 drunks girls and guys... warning sign one.   They proceed to storm the building to find that it is locked, closed except drive through.....flash mob warning sign two.   The drunk girls somehow get them to open the doors, so they could use the restroom....we are in the closed building.... warning sign three.   We proceed to order a shit ton of food, barely able to order in any sort of language that would make sense... warning sign...you get it.   The food came out PERFECT, we were all super happy and happy to have a large hamburger bun in our bellies to help with \"digestion\" of previous liquid we had consumed.   What-A-Crew ROCKS."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan but when I need a burger with mustard and pickle only and do not want to have a F'd up order I use this drive through.   They always get it right and the burger hits the spot."}
{"text":"Could anyone really say anything bad about Whataburger?? Well I know I sure can't. If I am going to have a cheat meal this is the place. Love the Double w/ cheese and large fry!  They are a bit higher priced then other fast food places but the food is fresh and always better!"}
{"text":"As a Texan it was strange walking into a whataburger in Phoenix. However the food was more fresh than most locations found in Texas! This was a pleasant surprise and the employees were helpful. Not sure why the reviews are so low."}
{"text":"The cashiers we dealt with the past 2 times we've gone were especially rude, and my expectations are generally pretty low. If we have a question, it's met with an eye roll. Our orders are never right. The last time we ordered, we asked for a medium fry, which we didn't get. We saw on the receipt that they put through the order for the fries and then removed it like they cancelled it. Certainly not the end of the world but annoying anyway."}
{"text":"This Whataburger is like stepping onto the set of Cocoon. The average of the diners has to be over seventy."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Always clean.  My only complaint is that it seems to be Hobo-Town in this neighborhood. You almost have to run to your car."}
{"text":"Friendly staff always and good food too. Never had any problems when visiting this location. The rewards program they have isn't all that great but I guess only if you visit more than a handful of times a week it's worth it."}
{"text":"The burgers are great! I had never had tried their food before, until a few weeks ago. My girlfriend was in the mood for a burger and she recommended this place. I decided to try one myself, and I'm glad I did because it was delicious. I will be coming back for more soon, can't wait to try something new of their menu. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Came to this location and was told they were closed because someone had broke their window.. Kinda suck that someone would do that.. But not totally sure how that caused them to close.."}
{"text":"Donnel was great at the whataburger off Bethany. First time at whataburger from Cali and it hit the spot. Burger fries and a shake. It was great! Thanks!"}
{"text":"The food here is always great, and at a pretty good price. The fact that this place is open 24/7 is perfect for any night owls like myself. The staff here are almost always friendly. Plus, nothing beats their ketchup! If you're a Tea-nut like myself, they have really good sweet tea here."}
{"text":"Whataburger what's the point, I got the Whataburger with cheese, onion rings and drink. It was a long wait, then the server brought out 3 orders at a time and my food was warm not hot. My onion rings where warm and greasy, they do theirs skimpy beer batter style not crunchy at all.  This location is near my job so it could be convenient but I don't know if I would bother since it was so underwhelming."}
{"text":"Super unfriendly staff. The girl who took my order clearly hated her job. I had a coupon for a free burger with me and said it was \"too late\" to use it, after i clearly told her i wanted to use it when ordering. Then when asking for ranch she said it was 40 cents more. i Declined and she proceeded to charge me for it anyways. Never again will i come here and will be sure to  alert my friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great fast food for the Valle. Love the Chicken grilled sandwich, French Fries are crispy and my favorite spicy catsup"}
{"text":"First off everyone that works here is excessively rude. The girl never even looked at me when I was talking and kept making me repeat myself since she was so caught up in Listening to her coworkers joke around. When I specifically ask for NO CHEESE and you put FOUR SLICES of cheese on it and CHARGE ME for four slices of cheese we have a problem. I love what a burger however this one is so sub par and incompetent they should close it before it damages their franchise name."}
{"text":"Two stars because the food is actually good but, for a drive thru with only 3 cars and takes 10 minutes it's just ridiculous. I've been to in-n-out during there busy time and they don't even take that long and the food is cooked the same way. Good food but not worth waiting for."}
{"text":"So dbl meat and a chicken sandwich. Both were exactly how I ordered them. Just love fresh beef."}
{"text":"I pulled up and ordered a number two which is the double meat whataburger combo meal. Price was sub-$10. Service wait was about 5-7 minutes at the drive through in the early morning with about two cars behind me. Burger was pretty decent, prices were decent."}
{"text":"Good service thru the drive thru, haven't ate the food yet however Whataburger has a pretty good reputation so I bet it's gonna be great!!!"}
{"text":"Let first state that I am a fan of Whataburger, This location is 24 hours and relatively close to my home, so this is my favorite to go spot to eat at for those late night munchies or a long night out. Typically, the wait will be at least 15 minutes and the food is always pretty decent. Price is average for a fast food restaurant. My main issue I have with this location is the customer service. My most recent experience was on Saturday (9/03/2016)  at around 12:30am, the woman who was working the drive thru was extremely rude. When my husband was ordering she kept interrupting him to the point where the order got messed up because of the confusion she was creating. By the time we were being handed our order I simply asked her if the sauces were in the bag and she mocked my question by repeating it back to me and adding \"DUH.\" I know this isn't considered a five star place to eat at but from an avid Whataburger fan I still expect to be treated with respect. That was clearly not maintained this last visit and I intend to find a new late night joint."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times over the years, and they consistently have the most polite service...and my fries are never scattered all over the bag lol"}
{"text":"I was in town for a business trip.  It was late.  I was hungry.  I just got gas before getting to the hotel to save time on the car rental return the next day and asked the folks at the gas station how this place was compared to Jack or Carl's and was told it was awesome.  It was far from awesome, it wasn't even that good.  The drink and lid were terrible, they didn't fit right and caused it to leak a little.  I got a chicken sandwich the bread was a cool idea but it just didn't work for the meal.  Nothing was overly terrible but versus some of the other local fast food places nothing really sets this place a part or stand out.  Maybe breakfast is good but...wasn't willing to go back."}
{"text":"It's fast food but their price on the small malt makes me come back.  When you don't want or need something huge and too calorie laden, the small malt fills the bill at $2.39. The employees are always very nice, too.  I've had the Chicken tenders and the burger, both were okay but not wonderful, to-die-for, can't-wait to-come-back good.  Just okay.  But they weren't bad either.  But their malts are delicious without breaking the bank.  Now excuse me while I go deal with my brain freeze."}
{"text":"I had the best experience here!!! The gentlemen were so nice and my order was fast and yummy. The restaurant was really clean too. Will come back!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I stopped here for lunch This afternoon. But I do know that I will never eat at a whataburger EVER again!  This place has some of the most off the wall people working the cash register! This chick took my order; Then dosed off into a trance like stare at my \"yoohoo\" area... And NO I didn't have anything going on down there or nothing on my pants if that's what your thinking. Seriously though no joke I couldn't believe  what this chick was doing in front of the entire lunch hour rush that was storming in and out...  I looked at her then politely said \"umm hello? Miss, What are you looking at?\" she came out of her spell and smiled at me with a kinda creepy half smile... Then as I was filling up my drink I caught her doing it AGAIN!  NO I'm not gay and yes I do have standards. This chick was missing half her teeth and was about as old as bob barker.  Yeah I literally couldn't even eat cause this chick made me loose my appetite. And the fact that my burger and fries tasted like it was soaked in a bowl of grease then sat under a heat lamp for about 20 minutes.   They should shut this place down or turn it into a In N Out burger. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Great food and service... service was quick and food was fresh. My burger was huge and it was a task to finish it off. The dining done is clean and we'll stocked. The oldies playing is a nice touch... in short, Whata-great experience!"}
{"text":"So stopped by Whataburger today for the first time... All my Texas friends rave about this place, just like my friends from back east raved about 5 guys.  Being a Cali boy.. The place we start and stop for burgers is in-n-out.  So I will review WB based on comparison with in-n-out.    Burger:  since I get a double double at ino,  I went with the double Whataburger with cheese.  It is a much bigger burger than the double double, the meat is fresh and over all the burger is tasty.  Still not as good as the double double but better than five guys.  Frys:  toss up, since Whataburger has spicy ketchup I will give them the fry over in-n-out.  Tea:  Whataburger, hands down, they have sweet tea... Yum.  The menu is much larger than in-n-out but that is what makes in-n-out so special they do one thing and do it right.  Over all I enjoyed my meal so if you are near a Whataburger, stop by you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was the first time I ate here, and would never eat again.  Both the service and food was horrible.To start off, like some fast food restaurants they want to charge you for extra condiments. That would have been okay except for a value meal, they gave me two lousy napkins!  To top if off my burger practically fell apart in my hands.  Will never eat at another Whataburger again! Whataburger? Whatarip."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good and it's open 24 hours but I wouldn't recommend coming after 2am because it literally takes about 30 minutes to get your food in a drive through. It's not something you'd expect or that people are use to, it's it's a bit of a downer having to wait. But the food is still really good."}
{"text":"I been proven wrong, being from cali I always tell people how nice people are but this fat kid (yes kid) in this long sleeve Orange shrirt name Billy was the rudes dude I met. Thanks to him I have some bad to say about AZ. Its more rude when the other employees see it and smile as it ok. Please you been warned"}
{"text":"So I'm not one to usually write  bad reviews, BUUTT my experience here was so awful I cant keep quite. Just a little background, I came here with my mother, son, niece, and nephew. We just got back from an event and wanted a good ole fashion burger. Keep in mind, we had a choice of this place or In and Out and we chose this place, due to the high quality of food. So my mother orders the food, I got a number 1 with no tomatoes. It's what I always get.   When the food came out I noticed I didn't have a milkshake like my little niece and nephew did. I wanted a milkshake and my mother didn't order one, so not a good start to the meal. I got the burger and you'll never believe what is on it.... TOMATOES!!!!! Yes thats right even though I'm pretty sure my mom told them no tomatoes when she ordered, they had the nerve to still put tomatoes on my burger. Since I'm not a petty guy, i just took out the tomatoes threw them on the floor, and started to eat the burger. While eating the burger i noticed something was off... and when i get about half way though i noticed the bun of the burger seemed old. Like older than it should be. It didn't taste good, it felt like i was eating an old mans a**hole.  Trust me I know how that taste... So yea I was upset about that as well. When it was time to leave, i bought MYSELF a milkshake since my mom didn't. Got the milkshake and started to head out the door. When we got to my moms car, i was helping my son get into the seat and my milkshake fell to the floor, and since the cups which the milkshakes are in are cheap the cup exploded and  i was no longer Abel to drink my milkshake. They didn't give me another milkshake to replace it either. I didn't go in and ask, but they should of offered, I was just outside the store they should've of seen it drop and came out to help. So all and all, I will not be coming back to this store, and I want management to do something to refund me the money that my mom spent on me."}
{"text":"YUM! Night staff is the best! They are funny and always actually awake and attentive! I love this place and will always eat here."}
{"text":"Hint: If you're going to make customers wait in line 10-15 minutes for your overpriced Whateverburgers, maybe just come out & tell them why. We were third in line our entire wait."}
{"text":"This is the only location we ever go to anymore because they offer the best service! Always friendly and kind, have never messed up our breakfast order, and always seek to be in a great mood :) we've never had a bad experience here, the food is always freshly cooked, and we always leave full and happy!"}
{"text":"Love this place, when you walk into the joint the smell of burgers slaps you in the face! I got the number #5 and it was very delicious. First time eating here and I have to say I will be back, burgers are a very good size. If it's your first time eating here make sure to ask what you don't want in your burger because I hate mustard and in my first bite I had realized it had some, still enjoyed it but removed all the mustard I could. Another thing was that they charge for barbecue sauce etc. That's the only thing I dislike about my visit, so 4 stars is my rate."}
{"text":"Whataburgers are rapidly disappearing around here which I think is too bad as I like their food.  And they have used the fast casual approach in their dining room decades before the label.  They have always been good at preparing it with your choice of toppings and you can get a side of gravy for your fries.  This particular morning I was driving a bit of a different route and wanted a breakfast sandwich of some sort for a snack.  I spotted this store and got a breakfast biscuit with sausage, egg and cheese.  It came out quickly and it was indeed a good snack.  Of particular note was the biscuit itself was not old or crunchy.  This one I rounded up from 3.5 just because."}
{"text":"Reminds me of back home in Texas! The food is pretty close to how it actually tastes back home! It's definitely a go to if I'm ever feeling home sick! I highly recommend the Patty Melt, the honey butter chicken biscuit, and the honey barbecue chicken strip sandwich! The spicy ketchup is also a go to for sure! Love me some Whata!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times. The burgers are always good. I went there last night around 9 PM. I order a double meat hamburger. I must say it was one of the best I have eaten in a while. The service was above and beyond what one would expect from a fast food restaurant. The workers were very friendly and offered to refill our drinks."}
{"text":"Went there around 1 pm for lunch today.  I went through the drive-thru and it was super busy, so they asked that I park in \"Lane B\".  It was a little bit of a wait, but it was lunch-rush, so I expected it to be busy and expected there to be somewhat of a wait.  When it was my turn, a young man named Skyler comes out with my drinks and immediately apologized for the extensive wait, and thanked me for my patience.  He knew which order was mine, and didn't hesitate to ask, \"Um... did you have...???\" which is common at other fast-food restaurants with this system.  The food was fresh and hot, and delicious, and most of all, PRETTY DARN ACCURATE!  The only thing that was incorrect was I had ordered a small sweet tea, and received a coke.  Everything else was correct, even down to the combo with no mayo, no onion, add ketchup.  I was super happy, and would go back any time!  I also saw another girl running around delivering food to a vehicle, and she smiled and waived at me as I made eye contact, and watched her walk back into the restaurant.  These guys both maintained upbeat attitudes, despite the rush, which is important.  Any Whataburger location I go to I experience perky employees, which makes me feel a lot better.  I had just gotten there after a bad experience at store I had gone to shop to, and so the friendly attitudes and faces helped to turn my bad mood around. GREAT JOB EVERYONE!"}
{"text":"The white guy with the mustache at the drive through at night is the best costumer device I have ever experienced in shocked on to with his skills why he's even working here unless it's he's the owner! Wow! Good job we need more polite and enthusiastic people like you!"}
{"text":"Some dam good fast food... it was a 70s decor tgat reminded me of the movie falling down..."}
{"text":"Its been years since my husband and myself have visited Whataburger. But he saw a sign as we drove by for a pattymelt and wanted to try it. We went in and there were so many workers at the front. Yet no one greeted us. We patiently waited amd still nothing. After a few minutes an employee came up to the registers we walked towards the one he was at. And then he walked to the other register, (the one we originally were standing in front of) and then he just walked away. Other employees were high fiving eachbother and having a good time. But no one acknowledged us. We waited a minute or 2 longer and then we just walked out. We ended up going to the other location on indian school and litchfield. Where when we walked in everyone welcomed us. It was a night and day experience. Get your crew together and teach them the basics."}

{"text":"Green Chili Burger.....my fav fast food burger joint!"}
{"text":"I was not expecting an outstanding burger experience like 5-guys I was just looking for a quick \"fill-up\". Whataburger is over priced for the quality of the product that they offer.  Bland burgers made with flavorless meat & stale cold fries, sub par even for fast food. Service time was average.  Facility is dated and in need of a remodel.  This was a poor choice for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This location is the worst Whataburger I have ever experienced!! Sunday evening around 6pm and the place is a hot mess.  Drive-thru doesn't move for 20 min so we decided to go inside.  Whoa - what a colossal mistake.  The guy takes our order and 30 min later still hasn't even given my boyfriend his shake.  He asks the cashier about our order and the manager comes over but they have no clue. So at this point, they have the opportunity to make it right and they still get our order wrong. The lemon pie literally crumbled in my hands and had 0 filling (so basically I'm guessing that was supposed to be lemon). Terrible service and the food was mediocre.    Sadly, someone from the  drive-thru line came in while my boyfriend was waiting because the staff screwed up her order too.  To top it all off, rather than refunding the order, the manager put a note on the receipt and said \"your next meal is on us.\" Why the heck would we ever come back?!?!   To the guy who decided to send me a message about my review...seriously?! That's beyond weird to send me a message defending the service and food quality. They had two chances and still screwed it up.  Whataburger is a great spot normally and I've eaten at them all over the country.  However, this location is not. I hope they improve but I will never go back to this location to tempt fate."}
{"text":"The establishment is very clean and the customer service was also very good.  The Employees were polite and courteous."}
{"text":"Wow this place is packed at lunch. We ordered how to look for a spot to sit. Then it did take around 10 minutes before we got our food. The taste of the food was okay. The service of the employees were awesome."}
{"text":"The best thing I can say about their food is that it's a few steps below dog food although I think the dog might have already eaten it. I have no idea how this chain is still in business."}
{"text":"What an awesome service...everyone so polite and helpful. Most definitely coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I only stoped here because my friends from Arizona and Texas told me Whataburger was the best so I had to find out myself. So I had the pattymelt the first time I want and it was ok... Nothing to go crazy over. I tried the hamburger my wife got and that too was just ok I would rather go to in-n-out if I wanted a burget. The second time I went (the next day on the way out of town) I got the bbq chicken strip sandwich and they was amazing I have never had anything like before I would go back just for they sandwich.  The staff were super friendly was asked for alot of the spicy kechup to take back for our friends and they gave us a good hand full.  It was really clean I saw them always wiping down tables."}
{"text":"After 20 minutes in the drive thru, they cannot even put a burger together properly... so glad i paid good money for poor service and a burger like this... im not going back to this location again..."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly !   Food is always fresh and hot!   I am a fast food junkie waiting for my metabolism to catch up to me.  I have had everything from their chicken strips to the burgers and it is always cooked fresh !"}
{"text":"Personally, their food is good, but other places are better. It's kind of rare to get hot fries here, but the main reason me and my family keep going back is their sodas. They keep the machine clean and the sodas are pretty damn good. Better than Sonics even! Just sans the special add-ins. The day staff is really nice here, but at night the workers are a little.. unhappy. It's expected from a graveyard staff, but a little cheeriness doesn't hurt.  Update 6/3/2012: If you're taking your food home and you want an awesome dessert, get an apple pie (or any other flavor pie if you wanted) and if you have vanilla ice cream at home, you can eat a little of the pie and then eat a spoon of the ice cream. It's probably the greatest thing I've ever done with a fast good dessert that doesn't deal with a Wendy's frosty. Seriously try it, you won't regret it!  Update 7/26/2012: Just a side note for the employees and maybe the managers, can you make sure that the people working the drive-thru don't wear strong lotions or colognes? It's REALLY off-putting when you go to drink your soda and cologne slaps you in the face."}
{"text":"Omg this place takes forever! I've been sitting in the drive thru for 10 minutes, and I cannot get out! Ugh! This is not fast food! They are lucky the food is good, but I will not be back to this location"}
{"text":"Very clean and honest people working here. Not to mention the food is great! I had left my debit card there, called 8 hours later, and they had it there waiting for me to pick it up. Good integrity."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. The woman, Betty, interrupted my husband 4 times during the order to chat with a coworker. The burger was dry and the fries flavorless and pale."}
{"text":"seriously these people are idiots, so i spend almost $9 for a burger combo, they give me old fries so i wait for fresh ones (mind you, its 6pm dinner hour should not have OLD fries), i sat at the window and watched the cold old fries just sitting there....THEN i get my new fries, get home and wtf the spicy bacon burger i paid for guess what, no bacon and it isnt even spicy in the last!! so to recap, $9 for old fries and the wrong burger seriously 5 workers i could see from drivethru cant get a basic order right.  one star for the lady who brought my new fries to my car she was nice"}
{"text":"Terrible service took 5 drive thru orders while I stood waiting for my order inside. Avoid"}
{"text":"I remember a person telling me that if in AZ to go here. He used to have his friend bring him the burger when he would come to CA. I had to try out the place. Well what I can say that after experiencing In-N-Out, this place is so-so. I would like a hamburger place that actually serves a burger that looks like the picture. The burger here really did not have much flavor and the fries were not hot (I hate fries that have been sitting under the light, as if that really keeps them hot)."}
{"text":"People are right This burgers are awesome specially the A1-Thick. Service is fast and friendly Prices are ok The jalape√±o ranch and their fancy and spicy ketchup are something else. If you are from Cali. And come to Arizona this place is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to eat here after hearing it was bad food, but I wanted to be the judge of it myself.   I ordered the bacon and cheese Whataburger. The burger itself was thinner than most burgers, BUT was wider which pretty much made it a decent size burger and a lot easier to eat.   The burger was good and the bacon tender and not hard or flavorless like other burger places.   I'm a fan of sweet tea so I got a little excited when I saw they had some. The sweet tea was really good, but still not as good as Popeyes sweet tea. Sorry (:  The medium cup is pretty big which is a plus, and the place is 24/7. What?! I know crazy right  Customer service wise, the dude was nice and even took us a tray of condiments which I thought was cool."}
{"text":"Probably won't be coming here again any time soon. Drive through line took almost 40 minutes with only 4 cars including mine. They forgot our ranch for the chicken fingers. Our burger and fries were cold when we got them and chocolate malt was runny and only filled 3/4s of the cup. Make sure you check you bag before you drive away!"}
{"text":"Now normally I would not give a whataburger this low of a rating. But back in Dec on a vacation I came back from a bar late on a Sunday night went to this whataburger and they had no meat! We went to the drive up menu where greeted. Told them it would be a minute. We took ten minutes and finally when we decided what we wanted we where THEN told they where out of meat. Sigh."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers around!  Just remember there hamburgers are really big!  Don't let your eyes be bigger then your mouth.  Fry's are great too and they have Diet Dr. Pepper!  Yummy."}
{"text":"I have been to a few other Whataburgers'  in the Phoenix Metro area, and always the the staff was courteous and efficient, and the food very good. But, at this restaurant, I found the burger to be a disappointment.   Now, the fries were nice and hot :) , and the veggies crisp (lettuce and onion) and fresh (veggies and tomato). But the burger was both barely warm (no where near hot), AND slightly undercooked (there was some pink showing, and with patties this thin, I don't think that should have been the case). But, I was too hungry to send it back. Had the meat been hotter, it would have been a lot better.  However, I don't think I'll go back to this location again."}
{"text":"This is an average burger place. The wait time for the drive thru was crazy, but I thought their chicken fajita taco was pretty decent for a fast food place and actually better than a Taco Bell version. I was also starving from just spending all day on airplane, so that may have also influenced my opinion."}
{"text":"Just get the biscuits & gravy and be happy.  This is my local hideaway all summer as it's wonderful, cold and dark with the supertinted windows. Walking distance for the eotw. The burgers are also fantastic and the clerks are always friendly."}
{"text":"Well..... everything was going pretty good. The store was clean and the food was good. However, watching two so called managers (one female in a black shirt, and one male in a tan shirt) bring a young female employee out to the lobby. Loudly the female manager explains to the young girl \"This is a verbal warning...this time!! If this happens again both this event and the next one become part of your record that gets sent in\". Excuse me, but have some professionalism you managers. Don't do counseling / feedback in front of your customers. How embarrassing for the employee, yet how embarrassing for three two poor managers who have no respect to treat an employee with a sense of professionalism and give this \"verbal\" somewhere private. As a customer I'm so disgusted by these managers. These two managers earned this location a 1 star. The non manager employees here looked and acted more professional than they did. Here's my written warning to these managers, I'd fire you both over this!!! Lucky I'm not your boss. All people and employees deserve RESPECT!! You both dropped the ball here. Leave your ego's at the door. I talked to Melissa the store manager in the black shirt and she defended her actions. I said it was disrespectful and wrong. She said it's their policy to do it. After she was done listening to me, she walked back and said \"I'm so sick of customers!!\". If you're sick of people that come to the store you manage, you should find a new job where we the customers and your employees won't be treated poorly. I'd for sure terminate your employment Melissa."}
{"text":"I got the Honey BBQ chicken strips sandwich, though it was average at best. The place itself is pretty clean, but the food wasn't over the top or anything special in my opinion"}
{"text":"I ordered a burger with added mayo. The cashier couldn't seem to wrap her mind around the fact that I STILL wanted the mustard that comes standard PLUS mayo, despite my telling her NUMEROUS times I STILL WANTED MUSTARD BUT PLEASE ADD MAYO. When my burger arrived it only had mayo. No mustard. I went up and asked for a packet of mustard. She was in the back for an absorbent amount of time, finally appearing with nearly a half pint of mustard in a styrofoam cup. Not really sure why I needed that much mustard, a packet would have sufficed.  Anyway, by the time I got back to the table and fixed my burger the way I ordered it, it was cold and not edible. Now an hour and a half later, I'm starving and eating Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Four stars for good service. Truly never had bad service here, but the restaurant is too small and there are never enough seats. You wait to order because you don't want your food to get cold while waiting for Father Time to get up from his patty melt, then instead of people being courteous, they snatch the next available table out from under you (when they walked in after you) before Father Time has swallowed his last bite.  Please make this store bigger. The amount of business alone should make it worth your while."}
{"text":"Open 24/7, thank goodness!  When I start work before 6 am at the hospital next door, I stop by and grab a coffee.   Sometimes, for those extra long days, I get a warm biscuit with honey, just to give me an added little pep, lol.  Don't judge me ;)  I did try their Taquito with Sausage & Cheese. It was actually good. I asked for both the red and green salsa so I could taste test and see which I liked best. The red salsa won by a landslide.  The service at this location is always top notch. Friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Nothing pisses me off more than spending close to $30 and then being made to buy condiments. Cold food, slow service, bad employee attitudes."}
{"text":"Usually this place is really good, but I waited 15 minutes to get my food and all I ordered was a chicken sandwich and fries. I asked for cheese and ranch and got charged for both! But did not receive any of them! Very very pissed. I also so the cook touch his clothes and food that was laying on the counter multiply times and did not change his gloves afterwards, and he cooked part of my grilled chicken sandwich into frying oil."}
{"text":"My 1st memory of Whataburger was in the early 80's in Southern California sometime before I was 10 yrs old.  We had one on the main drag of the city I grew up in.  It was gone by the time I was a teenager.....however, I remember the distinct orange & white striped building and the Burgers.  I was excited to finally give it a try as an adult.  I ordered a Whataburger ($2.64) w/Bacon ($1.17) & Cheese ($.49)....and the cashier suggested I add Jalapenos ($.49).... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93E1eOQ2bQG0OyIMqdcTvg?select=YKkzLz967qEgfA5eqyqLdA yes, it's really a la carte pricing, LOL! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93E1eOQ2bQG0OyIMqdcTvg?select=Wb0gZDFFQxcuphBQ9eHCsQ  I was really hungry, so I also ordered a Honey BBQ Chicken Strip Sandwich ($4.64) & Sm Fries ($1.39). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93E1eOQ2bQG0OyIMqdcTvg?select=MJOS72B9ZlfsPbsNsznntg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93E1eOQ2bQG0OyIMqdcTvg?select=rjwgNh2n7fSapWGco38MoQ  The Burger was OK, nothing special.....it did taste just how I remember it.  The distinct flavor of the Onions & Mustard in the Burger brought back memories.  The Chicken Strip Sandwich was above average, which surprised me.  The Chicken is real, White Meat Chicken Breast, and the BBQ Sauce was decent.  The Fries were just OK.  Overall, it was an OK meal for a fast food joint.  Return Factor - 71%"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!! It was a manager at the drive thru. He made me order really fast. He didn't even let me get my full order said. Finally after than having to repeat it four times we get up to the window and the manager is rude. The order wasn't correct. We ordered two TWO large onion rings and they weren't there. Manager was very rude about it!! But I live the food so we'll be going back but I'll let this be known."}
{"text":"Nothing beats a #7 after a night on the town drinking the Malibu! Always friendly service and killer ketchup!! Ask for extra :)"}
{"text":"Terrible burger even for fast food. Bun was dry and stale. The meat had zero flavor. Strongest flavor in the sandwich was the iceberg lettuce. It was the double meat burger zero taste.  Fries were standard frozen and cooked type.  The ice tea was good."}
{"text":"In my travels to Arizona, I MUST ALWAYS stop here! There are TWO locations that stand out, Bell and 96 AV, and I-17 and Bethany Home. There is one in Mesa, but I can't find the cross streets at the time of this review.  As long as you kindly make it very clear just what you are wanting, You will know why they call it WHATABURGER!"}
{"text":"If there is anything I miss about TX food this is one of them. Whataburger blows normal fast food joints away, especially the archaic MCD's and BK's. Their burgers rival even the best restaurant burger, they typically have good and friendly service and the prices are reasonable. If you never had Whataburger give my a shot and I'm sure you'll agree."}
{"text":"I'd give 4 stars but they really make me mad.   For years I've gotten their free drink offer for seniors with a burger purchase.  But recently the girls have been giving me a little kiddie size cup instead of the usual regular size drink cup.  How cheap. How stupid can \"management\" be."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Stephanie acted as if she was bothered with taking an order. Sorry I wanted to add to my order after you rushed me at the drive thru menu but it wasn't like there was anyone else in line front or back. If you want better service from whataburger go to the 48st and broadway location."}
{"text":"All the sandwiches taste the same, but they charge you $1 more to put like 4 jalape√±os or something on the sandwich. The sandwiches aren't that great, so there's no point in buying anything more than the regular Whataburger. The staff is friendly, which is the only redeeming quality for me."}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone else on here is talking about; this Whataburger is super fast!  The entire drive thru process took a grand total of four minutes.  Great place to stop for a quick lunch when you work downtown."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Whataburger for almost two years and each experience is better than the last; they literally cannot disappoint me. They're food is always freshly cooked and cooked well. The burgers are juicy, the fries are crispy and the drink anyways quench my thirst. Highly recommended entrees: Patty Melt mean with fries, onion rings, Whataburger sandwich, and the Barbeque Chicken Strip Sandwich. If you want to get what you pay for, this is the place to go!!!"}
{"text":"So I've been back several more times since my last review & let me tell you that they have stepped it up a notch! The general manager Gibran is still there and since being there this place has improved 100%. The staff are more friendly & helpful, my order has been right every time for my last 6 visits and it doesn't take as long like it used to. This location is a training location now so that speaks for itself. It is clean inside & out regardless of what time I go. There hasn't been a change of employees in awhile either. Still my favorite place to get a green chili burger!"}
{"text":"We always receive great service at this location. Our orders are always correct and the workers are consistently friendly! Definitely one of our favorite fast food burger joints."}
{"text":"5 stars for fresh, hot and accurate orders.  Also the gentleman in the drive thru on most evenings gives excellent customer service.  I'm in the industry and this restaurant is definitely doing everything right to keep me as a loyal customer!  That gentleman deserves recognition and a raise."}
{"text":"So this come with a little bias. After getting off of my flight home from spending two months traveling Southeast Asia, Whataburger was my first meal back in the states. I was super excited to eat some burgers and fries again, having never been to a Whataburger I ordered a bacon cheese burger, fries and a chocolate shake. I received a 32 oz chocolate shake (really America?), and a burger the size of my face with the most full fries I could ever imagine. Super disappointing even for fast food."}
{"text":"Went to order breakfast lady asked me over the intercom do you need any help I said no I am looking at the breakfast menu or order in just a second she says OK but then when I go to order breakfast she says oh we stop serving breakfast 15 minutes ago then I just say I was looking at the breakfast menu ridiculous customer service horrible 15 minutes after breakfast service you can't serve anything horrible"}
{"text":"Love this Whataburger, especially their breakfast...BUT. We sat in the drive-thru line for 15 MINUTES waiting for two bacon breakfast sandwiches with hash browns & coffee!! The service on this Sunday morning was less than exemplary!  UPDATE:  I spoke with the manager of the restaurant, who promised me that he would investigate and take care of the situation. He offered two free meals in return for our \"return,\" which to us is well worth it because we love Whataburger!"}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes to get through the drive through just to have the manager not respond to the intercom for another 10 minutes. The service was incredibly slow and overall was a very negative experience"}
{"text":"The food is like dairy queen but what i love is how if u eat inside they serve u like u r in a restaurant with tons of employees avail to help u. They also have amazing jalape√±o ranch and are open 24 hrs."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of hamburgers so I usually go for their chicken basket, which comes with gravy like Dairy Queen's. You get a handful of fries and a very few strips so all in all not worth it but it does taste pretty good (just not worth the price).   This location is one of the few places to get food 24 hours in the area, however their employees are always rude, take forever to get your order, and consistently mess up. I have never gone to this place and walked away with exactly what we ordered. Which seems pretty ridiculous given that only my boyfriend gets a burger. We've called and complained each time and recieved their complementary meal, which still each time has been wrong from what we ordered. The last time we went and were given a free meal because yet again they failed to get the order right, we decided we weren't even going to bother returning.   It is a shame because my boyfriend does like the food from Whataburger but this place just can't get its act together."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Cashier was very polite. Our order was processed quickly and correctly. Restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that I wasn't very impressed with my visit to this location. The food was just bland. It felt and tasted as if it had been sitting out for hours before we arrived. Sadly, we decided to try this place after the quality of the food at the Whataburger near Central and McDowell seemed to be going downhill. Whataburger used to be one of my favorite fast food places, but with the food at two locations being less than satisfactory, I am hesitant to return. On the plus side, the employees at this particular restaurant at 1346 S Rural Rd were friendly and the establishment was clean."}
{"text":"Hot and fresh, not to mention superrr friendly service!  I don't know what is with the fancy ketchup but it is the best."}
{"text":"as you pass this whataburger you take a look at the restaurant and think how could the food be any good?  lol.  well, the food is freakin awesome!  i decided to visit when i saw a national chain hamburger ranking on yahoo and saw whataburger in the top 3.  so i came.  i love all their burgers!  no joke.  the fries are so dang good.  not sure if this is good but the fries and drink come as a large.  crazy i know but when food is this good i don't mind.  the service is above average when compared to other burger chains.  i know most whataburgers do not look appealing but give this place a shot.  enjoy."}
{"text":"The first time my family and I tried Whataburger we were in TX. I wasn't impressed at all. Since moving here we decided to give it another try, I have to admit our opinion has changed.  The staff here are friendly, fast, and accurate. I'm pretty picky and they always make my orders exactly right.   My only complaint is the milkshakes. On their app they advertise different sizes (16oz, 32oz, etc). But in reality if you order a 16oz they still charge for the 32oz.  Also I ordered strawberry and it was very tasty. It was almost like drinking nestle strawberry syrup right out of a bottle..  Other than that, reasonable priced and good food."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Staff is friendly, checks on you and your food as though you're in a restaurant, not just eating fast-food on your lunch break. Best Whataburger I've been to yet."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a burger early in the morning. Always fresh and never an attitude for ordering lunch for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"I am currently sitting in the drive-thru... it's been 30 minutes and I have no idea what the problem is. So much for fast food."}
{"text":"All I ordered was root beer shake. 20 minutes later and no one came to my table. Saw people who had ordered before and after me get their food- whole families with entire orders and nothing. I finally went to the counter and told the girl (the same one I ordered from) that I hadn't received it and she said \"oh\" and grabbed a cup and filled it and brought it back to me. I took it and walked away and It wasn't even filled all the way. If it was that easy to do, why'd it take so long in the first place?"}
{"text":"My husband and I were driving through Phoenix on the way back to Las Vegas from Tucson and we needed some nourishment for the rest of the ride. I spotted a sign for Whataburger, which they do not have in Nevada, so we decided to get lunch there...  Whataburger is good because they allow total customization of the burgers. My husband likes jalapenos, Whataburger has them on the menu. The actual meat isn't anything to write home about though, just a basic, somewhat boring burger.   Service was friendly and the bathrooms were clean, so thumbs up for that. I still prefer In-N-Out though..."}
{"text":"This is a good, 24-hour, fast food restaurant.  My favorite items are the charbroiled,fresh-tasting,  juicy burgers and fresh the hot, crispy french fries.   They also offer a patty melt, which is a little to big, and cheesy for my tastes.  Overall its one of my favorite burger joints."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Whataburger. This is the best managed Whataburger that I have ever been in. Fast friendly professional great food. Betty rocks"}
{"text":"I recall them years ago That was then Flavourless meat( the Whataburger) Cheap buns Weird ketchup Served barely warm (nuked?) Greasy onion wings Friendly staff"}
{"text":"My rating is based on only the Monterey Melt!  It is the only burger that I crave on occasion.  2 large beef patties, 2 different cheeses, special sauce, grilled onions, poblano and red bell pepper.  Delish!  I love you baby."}
{"text":"By the time you leave this place you'll be gasping for air saying WHAT A BURGGERRRR. WHEW! Carry on for my review.   I've been coming here for 2 years, so my review is a two year study. First thing first to get my 3 star rating out the way, this place is socially awkward. What I mean by socially awkward is the only time they care to speak to you is when they're offering ketchup and salt to you. They just don't greet people properly at ALL here. Someone will be see you walk-in and say nothing to you. Manager will be the only one who says \"be right with you\". They are lifeless to customers but if you watch them in the kitchen they are active and smiling with each other. I was stuck between a 4 star and a 3 star because of this customer service I have to be honest with you. This place lacks soil when it comes to customers, and the people they are hiring are extremely socially awkward. When you look up at them they look down and walk past you, no smile just lifeless until they head back into the kitchen. Who ever is hiring these people just needs to do better with hiring personalities as well, not just a fill in spot worker. It's not all bad though!   If you're wondering, yes, come here for food. ALL. THE TIME. The food has always been consistently mouth watering and fresh, the fries with the spicy ketchup is life (GET THE SPICY KETCHUP).  My favorite options are the Sweet & Spicy Burger, Honey BBQ Chicken Strip Sandwich and the WhataFish Sandwich. Again, the food is always great and always ask for fries no salt for fresh fries because they go crazy on the salt here and who doesn't like fresh fries.   This place is open 24/7 so if you're around this area looking for a 4 star bite this is it. This place is surrounded by an active homeless area but they want bother you, they usually come in for water and you will see them on bikes. No worries though. This spot is the very few 24/7 spots around and it's not one to miss.  As much as I said about customer service, if something is wrong with your order they will accommodate you after explaining. It's not often my order has been screwed up maybe once or twice.   With all this said, I hope you enjoy this burger place. Being from Chicago we don't have this place so it was a great welcome to the west burger joint. I always say What. A. Burger after every meal here. Peaceeeeeeee"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for several months now. Come in the early afternoon, my latest cashier (Her name was akin to Terrion I believe?) was the kindest soul you'll ever meet. I also come her in the late evening as well, and I've never had an issue. The fries can be a bit undercooked for my liking at times, but they're never inedible. The burgers are always warm and juicy. I've never poured myself a sweet tea and been disappointed, always freshly brewed."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of hamburgers, and usually only eat about 5-6 burgers a year.  But I've had 2 Whataburgers in the past month, only because they are so close to me and they are pretty darn good.  The burgers have always seemed fairly fresh and made to order.  The fries are very good also.  Plus they have Diet Dr. Pepper!  Not sure about the other locations, but this location is great for a fast food hamburger joint."}
{"text":"It's fast food, not amazing, but good."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of stopping at this location to get my fix of Jr hamburger & onion rings.  After a 15 min wait to get my order, everything was COLD.  It was horrible.  And when I provided feedback about my experience and requested a \"callback,\" nothing...they clearly don't care at this location or in general.  I wouldn't recommend this location."}
{"text":"Big fan of Whataburger.. It's the only fast food chain I will eat at.  Stopped in on my drive from TX.  Food was up to par but lots of flies in the restaurant... Not acceptable!"}
{"text":"Had to wait in the line over 30 minutes server is rude and disrespectful I don't understand why I waited over 30 minutes/ one month later and their doing the same thing food wasn't fresh had to wait 20 minuets this time, I'm just gonna stop going to this one and getting my hopes up!!"}
{"text":"For fast food, it's really good. Been going to this location since I was a college student and try to stop by when I'm back in town. Staff is always friendly and service is quick. It's a nice change from the traditional fast food chains. I always go with the green chile cheese burger and onion rings. The shakes are good too but the burgers are what they are known for."}
{"text":"Keep your receipt here. They will not replace a bad order without a receipt here. Their breakfast sandwich had dry egg on it that seemed like it was cooked hours ago. Thought Wataburger was made fresh to order, guess I was wrong."}
{"text":"Whataburger,  Within my first bite into my burger I pulled out a long black hair out of my mouth. Too disgusted to continue to try and eat the burger I threw it away.  Fries are good but salty  Ranch is 29 cents  Overall not worth at all just gonna go to Taco Bell next time. Whatawaste"}
{"text":"After reading the many laughable reviews and having eaten many, many burgers in my day, this one is clearly the worst burger I have ever had...well second wost considering McDonalds but I don't think many count that as a note worthy burger anyways.  The fries where good but omg, a flat, soggy and completely tasteless burger with little of anything other than cheese and what I assume is beef.  I was starving but still threw it out after two bites."}
{"text":"This location is terrible. They either take way too long to get the food out or they mess something up. Every time I go here there is some problem. Once I waited 30 minutes in the drive through. Once I was given an entirely wrong order. One time I got a chocolate shake that took 20 minutes to be made and it hardly tasted like chocolate. Just last night they forgot to give my debit card to me and when I called about it they asked which card it was as if they had more that they forgot to give back. They also don't put enough sauce on the honey butter chicken biscuits or the honey barbecue chicken sandwiches. They are stingy with the mayo on their cheeseburgers too. Nobody wants to eat dry food. They never give enough ketchup and they only give out napkins if you ask. This place needs to get it together."}
{"text":"Their drive thru is the slowest drive thru to the point you have to tailgate to get your food. Especially don't go after 6pm. The drive thru is 15 minutes for each car that's in it. Hope this helps you to never eat and waste your time on this garbage food."}
{"text":"This is only for the HONEY BUTTER CHICKEN BISCUIT. Stopped by on the way from the music festival at Steele Indian park. This is really the only place open past 10pm and I'm so glad we made a stop here. I was trying to decide between the burger and the biscuit but the person in front of me told me I HAD to try the biscuit. So decision was made. And I'm so glad I followed it. That chicken biscuit was so good ! That honey butter was really great. I could go on and on about it. If you are at Whataburger. It's a must get. Oh ! And they only serve the biscuit from 11pm-11am. So keep that in mind when you go."}
{"text":"Just tried out the Monterey melt. Pretty good. Its a relatively thin but wide burger (not like those thick burgers that end up being real messy) and its got that buttery taste.   The fries don't live up to the hype though. I found it quite bland."}
{"text":"I love their Green Chile Double & the fact that I can get it in Jr. size!! Excellent, fast location."}
{"text":"I gotta tell ya, it's the chopped onions.   My boyfriend asked an √úber we were in, to stop at Whataburger on Friday night. He got a \"doublecheese Whataburger but we got a double hamburger. Now, that's a key here at Whataburger: apparently you must say, \"Double Whataburger with cheese\". You don't have that problem at McDonald's.   Well, he took two bites, done, stuck it in the fridge. That left 3/4 of the burger which I quartered. I ate all 3 quarters, one at a time,  over the next day or so, each with different toppings. One was crumbled blue cheese: fabulous!  One was BBQ sauce and the last was more ketchup and mustard. Good burger!  Made like 3 meals!  And the chopped onions made --  MADE -- the sandwich!!"}
{"text":"As had been a custom for years in Texas, we went last night for a milkshakes.  As is expected, the chocolate was thick, mixed to the bottom and slightly too chocolaty.  After suffering lame and incomplete attempts at shakes in CA restaurants, it's really nice to be within reach of a solid shake maker.  The only thing we missed, was a warm apple pie.  :)"}
{"text":"Food and service were good.  This was not my favorite burger, but it was better than most fast food places.  If you like the old fashion style burgers you definitely should check this out."}
{"text":"Everything you could expect out of fast food. Within drunk walking distance from my house, so I can't really complain. French fries and soda is really all I get here, honestly."}
{"text":"Whataburger should be called Whatapattymelt! That patty melt is freakin delicious. The juicy patty, grilled onions, melty cheese, and the Texas toast that soaks up all that juicy goodness makes for a solid fast food sandwich. I also loved the onion rings and enjoyed the light and slightly sweet batter. Bomb. I am a huge fan of Whataburger and just wish it would make its way out to California!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, not expensive, friendly staff. Food was mediocre, at best. Who puts mayo on a patty melt? It's meat, cheese, and grilled onions on buttered and grilled rye. But they used sourdough. Weird.   The fries were delicious, however. Only thing that makes this a three and not a two."}
{"text":"We usually go to the whataburger on 91st and bell but we were close to this location so decided to come here my husband always orders a breakfast sandwich with egg whites only because he can not have yolk he is allergic to it, they refused to take the yolk out of the egg when the other location always has for the past 5 years. When we asked to speak to a manager to ask why she said she was to busy to speak with us and would not come up! We will never come back to this location one because they do not accommodate someone's dietary restriction and then the rude customer service when we just asked why the lady at the window said she wasn't sure that's when we asked to speak with a manager."}
{"text":"An older store, so expect a sometimes crowded dining room. But WELL worth the stop. Always very friendly and attentive staff. Have never had cold fries, always hot. Been coming here for years, and never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if I could. Guy at the window is a moron. All I ordered is a med fry... how could you mess that up? I asked for creamy pepper sauce right as I was driving away and he said \"we don't have...well it's 40 cents\" so I said well if you got it I want it. Gave him 50 cents with a 10 cent tip and what does he give me? Gravy.... I'm pregnant. I didn't get my sauce and now I'm not going to eat my fries. 0/10 wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"I never thought I'd review a fast food joint, but this place deserves it because of the SERVICE!  For a fast food joint, they have workers always checking on you for drinks, sauces etc. And the burgers here are much better than any fast food spot. And this being a sit down spot that's 24/7, can't go wrong.  The second time we came here we went through the drive through. Person was very polite. We let them know how impressed we were with there service there, especially it being a \"fast food\" Spot. Badda BOOM! Free meal coupons to come back.   If you just partied in Tempe/Mesa, skip Fillibees for once and peep this spot out. Cant go wrong with a Jalapeno burger lol."}
{"text":"Whataburger is right there with Taco Cabana-- How does a Cali girl know of these two places, the same as why I know about White Castle, my love of food knows no limits and I used to visit relatives in AZ and TX during the summer.   So we took the kids to AZ for a Summer holiday and low and behold I see the orangey-da-glo \"W\" for Whataburger a we drive by-- I get all bajiggity (nervous excited energy) in the car my hubby looks at me as if I am mad--and says NO!.. I slouch and say darn. But I plan the great escape to take the kids to experience a Whataburger OKAY?! and that I also want to relive my memories from childhood. Is that so wrong?   Lunch time. there is a line? since when? anyway- we order burgers fries, 2 pop's and a water ..... hmmm the Burger looks smaller, fries are good, they taste the same drowned in ketchup-- now I am leery of the burger its kinda sloppy looking and not meshing right, leaning if you will... but the kids waste no time and are chowing down- are they just that hungry or are the burgers that good? I am thinking In N Out might have been a safer option here..   I go for it-- I mean mentally and some of yu can relate to the whole food/memory thing a lot is riding on this first bite, years of memories and fun with my cousins spending the day swimming and then jamming all of us wired kids into a stupid little car to head out to lunch at Whataburger.   First bite, salty, a little dry but the burger in itself not bad, I think--I am loving the extra pickles.. ya Whata-good-burger.... So long story short - people are right, sometimes smells and tastes of food can trigger memories and at that first bite at that moment I was instantly teleported back to my childhood vacation just from a dang burger and fries..   Try as I might - I tried to drag the hubby back to try a Whataburger one last time with me and the kids before we left, but he was too snobby, sigh..  So why not 5 stars It has changed as far as customer service and attitude towards customers-, the gal who took my order was a bit too snarky for me attitude wise, for a teenager and She couldn't count back change, petty maybe but the checking to see if my youngest had soda in her water cup instead of water -- was a but mental for me."}
{"text":"First time ever there!!!  Ordered a salad with apples and cranberries among other things...no apples in the salad..what's the point of paying extra for a salad if you are not getting what is supposed t o be in it??  Never again!  I hate rip offs!!!  P.s.  Their french fries suck...my husband ordered them and their hamburgers were not even thick!"}
{"text":"I can't believe the other reviews have not mentioned the breakfast menu. One of my favorite times of the weekend is 11pm because that's when Whataburger starts serving breakfast tacos. (nom, nom, nom)  11p to 11a is the best time to go to Whataburger. They still serve the regular menu, but who doesn't have an unhealthy obsession with breakfast tacos? (Or is that just me?)  For the most part, I would rather be at Whataburger some time between 11p and 11m and eat my delicious biscuits and tacos and drink my Simply Orange than go to any other fast food joint.  I guess I'm a little biased when it comes to the whole In-N-Out v. Whataburger thing. I'm from Texas. I've been to the original Whataburger in Corpus, there's a Whataburger not two minutes from my dad's house, and the tiny town that my mother lives in has five (count'em five) Whataburgers for 75,000 people. I am a big fan of Whataburger.  I do have to agree with other Yelpers that the fries are weak sauce here. I'm actually a little disappointed. These aren't the Whataburger fries I am used to. Don't get me wrong, I like them and I think they are better than In-N-Out's fries, but they just aren't the same."}
{"text":"For a fast food burger Whataburger is great!  I've come thru their drive-thru many times over the years and never had a very long wait.  If you get a bad burger or something is wrong, believe me when I say it has happened to me once, I wrote to the corporate office, and they corrected the problem pronto.  Whataburger really cares to retain customers and make you happy.  I like the taste of their burgers, because they use....real meat!  I would rather go here than McDonald's, because I really am not sure they do use real anything there (i.e., fake meat, fake ice cream and so forth).  The biggest plus with Whataburger is if you ruin the turkey for Thanksgiving Day, Whataburger is open every day of the year including Xmas...LOL!"}
{"text":"This place remains consistent and still rocks!  Almost 4 stars...!  You are on your way :)  Upgraded to 4 Stars - don't eat fast food often anymore but when I do this place has the goods!"}
{"text":"My opinion its over rated, heard to much hype about this place and its just an ok from mee. Typical burger really. It is open 24hrs, service was ok cleanliness ok timely manner good. Would i come bak? Uuum maybe if there was nothing else open. I got the jalapeno burger n it was not all that great.!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't had a Whataburger since I left Florida four and a half years ago. So when I came through the doors with a big smile on my face, the cashier must of thought I hadn't eaten in a long time. She stepped up to my occasion and was really friendly and engaging in conversation. In reading Scottsdale area reviews it appears that locals do not feel like the customer service in this town is any good, I beg to differ. Coming from Las Vegas, everyone that I encountered (besides one person) was really nice in their interactions.   The burger that I ordered was hot and tasty and just like I remembered it. The restaurant was clean and well lit. We ate in and was having a great time with all the patrons. Wish we had one in my city. *hint hint"}
{"text":"Service 5 stars. The staff was really friendly and accommodating. The staff came around the counter to offer me ketchup and other condiments. The food was average, just another greasy fast food hamburger joint."}
{"text":"Trying again at the slowest Whataburger on earth . 7 minutes to take the order of the two cars in front of me. ...asked to wait before taking my order. 1.5 minutes wait before takin my order.  4 minutes to deliver orders to the 3 cars in front of me. 2.5 minutes wait to receive my order. Total 14 minutes for \"fast\" food drive through.  I might as well go to a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"I am very impressed how the manager took care of us after there was an issue. That show great  customer service skills. I wish there was a whataburger in California and I would want him as the manager. Thanks for a great burger as always."}
{"text":"Stopped in to have lunch with the two sons, who were standing next to me. The person who was taking our order was not paying attention at all to what was being said and messed up the very simple order that was given.  To top it off after waiting for the order to come out, they didn't have the cookie that comes with their meal.  I can understand running out in the middle of the night. It it is 10:41, come on people."}
{"text":"Maybe greet your customer next time I walk in and not stand at the other register and just look at me like I'm supposed to read your mind.  One of my go to places but at times the customer service is horrendous!"}
{"text":"Took a bite of my sisters burger (buffalo chicken sandwich) and I was in love!!!! like 5 star in love.  2 weeks later went to get one and they didn't carry it anymore :(  The manager on staff kindly allowed the associate to make me the sandwich since they still had the ingredients! Customer service like this will keep me returning and trying new things. But I am very sad that burger is gone which is why its a four star for me."}
{"text":"I'm super conflicted about this place. Sure, their patty melt is the bomb when you first eat it, as are their fries with the spicy ketchup. However, this meal had me feeling like there was a rock in my stomach weighing me down for days (even after multiple workouts to try to burn out the calories/fat!). So eaters beware: instant gratification is met with later bloating and a steep battle back to not feeling fat lol."}
{"text":"Dirty inside, dry tasteless burger, cold hard fries.. if you dont like where you work Jon... find something better but people don't patronize to be treated poorly.... and wash your clothes once in a while. Dirty employees. If the manager cared about doing a good job... he didn't show it. I walked in.... he looked right at me and turned his head. No one greeted me while I waited for someone to come to the counter even though the manager was right there.  All this hype on FB is misleading. Horrible. Horrible did I say horrible. Threw it ALL away."}
{"text":"Excellent chocolate shakes, burgers, breakfast honey chicken biscuit, and chicken tenders with the honey BBQ sauce for lunch!!"}
{"text":"I visit this Whataburger often since it's the closest fast food burger place to my job. The burgers are always great but it never fails that when I go through the drive through they get my order wrong. Also, they charge for ranch which I think ridiculous but I don't mind paying for it but it's happened multiple times where I purchase the ranch and they forget to give it to me. It seems that they are unorganized and all over the place."}
{"text":"Great burgers great food fantastic service. The guy working drive-through named Anthony, gave the best customer service skills of any fast food worker I've ever encountered."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas--grew up on Whataburger.  Visited this location twice--never too busy, great service. Must try if you've never."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch the other day. Placed my order and went out back to wash up. The restroom is like an old gas station where you need to ask for a key and walk outside. I got to the sink and discover there is no soap in the dispenser. I went back inside and told them how disgusting that is and got a refund on my order. I highly doubt the soap just ran out before I went in there. It could have been out for days. Meanwhile the employees are using the restroom, splashing their hands under running water and calling it good before making your food. I should have alerted the health dept.   Whataburger is one of my favorite fast food burger franchises but this location is a joke. And don't ever go here at night. You are practically guaranteed to get cold fries by the lazy night crew."}
{"text":"I am a Classic \"Whataburger\" Man, a Double with extra cheese and grilled onions Fry's and a Chocolate Shake too go. This store has seen better days but they do the job. I don't go there for their decor I go there for a Burger it has been there for forever and I hope they have no plans to close it,  Thanks \"Whataburger\" Keep on Fry'en,  Jerry"}
{"text":"They have a lot of different selection than other fast food joints. I like the retro pics of old Whataburgers. American reminders on walls. The staff is friendly enough. They deliver it to your table with a hand held tray of anem... anemin... anemic... condiments. I can't spell a.... Oh never mind. It's clean. WTH more do ya want? It's not steak house!"}
{"text":"Not fast food.... I ordered a large fry and it took them 7 minutes.... What a joke. Just go to the McDonald's down the block."}
{"text":"I don't get the comparison to In N Out on the West coast and now a bit further East.  This is not in the same conversation with In N Out. Not fresh meat or buns, patties looks smaller and are definitely drier.  They do have more choices on the menu and there were a few thing I wanted to try but only had one shot as I was traveling through town.  Not a bad burger but there is an In N out about 2 miles down the 10.  the Spicy chicken was fantastic, my buddy had that. The service was good, plenty of parking and seating."}
{"text":"This place really hits the spot at midnight. I had a double burger with cheese and medium fries. Im usually not impressed with the burger size, but this burger was impressive"}
{"text":"2 stars because the food was amazing, but the drive through was horrific. I can't blame the time being so long because of fresh food, but I can blame the guy working the window being snooty. Initially I assumed it was a moody teen, however, I was disappointed to see an older gentlemen being disrespectful to me and my friend. He initially got irritated while he was taking our order, and my friend asked for a drink that wasn't on the menu, unknowingly, and then his demeanor completely changed... I don't know if he had a bad night, but we were nothing but respectful to this gentleman and received nothing but poor customer service because he was clearly flustered... I have given this dying establishment loyalty for as long as I can remember. I am disappointing with the service I received tonight."}
{"text":"OMGOODNESS! This was the BEST Whataburger I've ever been at. The employees were all so nice and patient with me and my family. They brought us ketchup and salt (and wow pepper on fries is amazing). The onion rings were fresh and beer battered. The chicken BBQ sandwich was delicious and they went all out on the BBQ sauce. Perfect lunch."}
{"text":"As a Californian, they say it's In n outs competition. I gotta say the burgers were not bad!! We got druve thru & our order was correct, they even asked if we wanted the spicy ketchup. Something new & cool! will definitely recommend and whenever I'm in Arizona tht will be my burger place"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service at the drive thru. Hot, fresh, delicious food. Try the chicken strips with the gravy... yum."}
{"text":"I hadn't had whataburger in over a year because they don't have it in Las Vegas.  This location wasn't busy, staff was helpful.  Its great that they have spicy ketchup all year around now!"}
{"text":"So we had to try their burgers, everyone on base in California says they are comparable to In-N-Out, so we of course had to give them a chance!! We ordered a number one with cheese and a jalapeno burger with the fries and drink combo. These two meals cost us $14... We get our food and I was actually impressed with how large the burgers were. However, this food tasted like McDonalds... Actually I would have rather gone there because at least we would not have paid $14 for two cheeseburger combos. No thank you.. Greasy, lacking flavor, and the exact same pickles and fries as their ugly neighbor McDonalds. I think I will stick to In-N-Out. Thanks anyways though..."}
{"text":"Laura, one of the workers here was super nice and polite and kept checking on my family the food was great, my husband and me and all my kids left happy :)"}
{"text":"First time trying Whataburger. I've never heard or seen one of these before.  Guess they've been around for a while, but never expanded to Cal.  Overall the family had a great experience. One thing that I did notice was that they had excellent customer service. After placing your order, the food is delivered to your table. A friendly worker named Danny checked on us often, cleared our table of trash, and even refilled our drinks. How awesome is that for a fast food joint.  The food was on point with the tastiness. I tried the jalapeno and cheese Whataburger, which was good. Kids gobbled up their chicken bites and justaburgers. Wife's burger was so big that she could only eat half of the thing.   I would definetly try this place again. Good food and great customer service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Tx staples!  Never disappointed.  Great burgers.  Great service. Clean, quick, and tasty. Always impressed for an affordable chain.  Several others should take lessons."}
{"text":"I love Whataburger but the service is bad at this location. My order is always wrong and if you go after dark, there are crack heads everywhere. Make sure you take your gun."}
{"text":"So after gassing up my truck for the drive home the following day, I decided to drive through Wataburger since I was craving a vanilla shake. Since I kind of felt silly only ordering that I decided to get a chocolate chip cookie too.  So the shake was decent. Nothing extraordinary. It certainly hit the spot.  The cookie, however...well let's say for 99 cents I expected a LARGE cookie. This one was maybe a little over the size of a Chips Ahoy. Definitely not worth a buck.   The girl who took the order via the ordering stand didn't speak clearly. When i finally got to the window to pay she made a joke which, because she didn't enunciate, fell flat. Nice try.  I doubt I'll try any of their \"real\" food when I'm in Phoenix next time. It was sort of a miss, in my book."}
{"text":"So much grease I'm in my food. Ordered a hamburger, fries and onion rings and I couldn't even eat it I just threw it away. It was so greasy that it soaked through the bag."}
{"text":"Imagine the scene: driving through the inky dark of night, nearing the end of a cross country-road trip, and sadly assuming that you've seen the last WhataBurger you'll see for years when you left Texas. Then, miraculously, that bright Orange and White striped roof materializes through your windshield in front of you. Your girlfriend (at the time) and you let out twin war whoops, you pull over and order a Jalapeno Burger and fries even though it's nearing midnight and you've already eaten a real dinner just a few hours before. You even order an extra burger for your roommate waiting back home in LA, knowing he will probably not be interested in a cold burger that's been sitting in a car for four hours. But you wrap it up and take it home with you anyway, because you're a good friend.   This WhataBurger in Arizona was the last one I'd ever visited, and I may be overly sentimental about it. But I dream of those Orange and White Stripes, dream of returning there one day, dream of the spicy bite of the Jalapeno Burger. I dream of the infinite."}
{"text":"My first time having Whataburger. Tried the jalapeno burger was decent but the green chili burger is overrated in my opinion."}
{"text":"After driving by this place almost everyday I decided I would try there breakfast. I was pleasantly surprise! I had the breakfast platter which contains scrambled eggs, a biscuit, hash brown sticks, and sausage. Very well done WHATABURGER! There apple pie wasn't bad either! I would recommend it to everyone!   As for the location yea it's questionable and maybe not too safe at night but hey I went at 8am so it was all good! Lol"}
{"text":"I was expecting a greasy burger like I had in Austin! So, that was disappointing but I guess it makes it healthier. We ordered the jalapeno cheese burger and a regular cheeseburger.  They reminded me of a big MacDonald's cheeseburger. Service was great and they bring out a tray of sauces with your meal. The fries were ok. And there wasn't a restroom inside the facility."}
{"text":"While the burger I had (Whataburger Jr.) was just OK, I enjoyed the onion rings and malt here. The onion rings were made with whole slices of onion, rather than that nasty onion paste that other fast food places like Burger King use now. I had a chocolate malt, which tasted a bit like a Whopper candy.   The burger was a little smashed when it came to me, and was lukewarm. The meat tasted meh, and the bun was a little soggy on the bottom. There was a thin, wilted piece of lettuce in it. But hey, it's fast food, and I only paid $3 for it, what do I expect?  Service was fast and friendly. Our food and drinks were served in no time. I'll give Whataburger another shot, but for now, their burgers play second fiddle to their sides and drinks."}
{"text":"I visited the drive-through of this restaurant this morning and there were five cars ahead of me in line once I placed my order. 18 minutes later, only one car had moved. The purpose of a drive-through is to provide fast service to people on the go. It is totally unacceptable to make anyone wait that long. My only savior was my ability to get out of line and leavp"}
{"text":"Nice clean place.  Food as expected, given it is a burger place.  Fries nice and crispy, and the burger was done just right.  Good location just off the Thunderbird exit of I17 N"}
{"text":"It's my 30th Birthday and decided to spend it with my close family and do something low key this year. So we decided to go to Whataburger. The manager Kevin and staff made my experience one to remember! We get there and ask if they do anything special for birthdays, the manager kindly said they don't, but made an exception and let me choose a meal on the house. My sis- in law just celebrated her 40th a couple weeks ago and he said she could also get a meal on the house. We both were appreciative and enjoyed our meals. Toward the end, as we were about to leave, the manager and staff came out from the kitchen with two cinnamon buns with candles and sang to us. This may not seem exciting to most, but to us it was really awesome and such a cool gesture! Thank you Whataburger!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the friendliest stores Whataburger has.  It's not in the best neighborhood but the employees are outstanding.  Best onion rings. Staff super friendly."}
{"text":"Honestly I think Whataburger's food is on par with most fast food- nothing significantly better or worse.  I just love the vibe and how it's almost like a time capsule back to how places were when I was growing up. It just seems to have that old school burger vibe to me (not to be confused with 50's diner vibe)."}
{"text":"Well I just left Whataburger they had no soda. And all they did was bring up all my items separately and it was just as expensive without the drink. Worst experience at Whataburger ever."}
{"text":"So I was in Arizona and I hear about this place is comparison to in and out in California this is a drive-through restaurant/dining I think in and out is totally different pages so burgers and perfect in this place sells a lot of different stuff which is good but simply could always be better in my opinion but next time I go back I shall return to try over dishes"}
{"text":"This was the first and last stop at this Whataburger.  We stopped here after visiting friend's and we were starving.  We waited 15 minutes to get our food after going through the drive thru with only one car in front of us.  After that, we get home (near Gilbert) and notice there were no fries in our bag, which we paid for, and my husband found a 3 inch long thin, clear, hard plastic piece surrounding his burger.  Yep, never again."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place and was excited to finally be near one to try it out. Although the burger looked smashed I must say the flavor was amazing!! The fries were hot and fresh and service was great too. Can't wait to come back to Arizona for this place again."}
{"text":"Normally I love this place. I brag about it to everyone. However the customer service was not the usual, the food took an extremely long time. The food wasn't piping hot. It just didn't live up to its normal standard."}
{"text":"We always have a good experience at this Whataburger! The team working here clearly enjoys working together and has an appreciation for customer service. And I'd tell you that a Whataburger is better than any other fast food burger in terms of taste, size, presentation, and overall value for the price. Whether going in the restaurant or utilizing the drive-through we've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"First and foremost lots of kudos to this Whataburger for awesomely friendly service! We had an order for five with a number of special requests (no tomatoes, plain and dry, shake instead of drink) and the young lady waiting on us was patient and accommodating! It didn't take long to get our order and we were on our way. Two thumbs up for this location!"}
{"text":"Ehh, not bad for a chain burger.  I think what I enjoyed the most was the value - practically every sandwich is under $4 (not the meal) and yet is a decent size.  The taste is kind of there and I like how they have a person that goes around with a condiment tray (spicy ketchup, regular ketchup, bbq sauce, picante salsa).  Really, the biggest improvement to the burger would be meltier cheese.  The beef patty could use a tad more seasoning and the bun is about as exciting as Kristen Stewart's facial expressions.  With that said, I did have a blast assembling this tasty combination that I shall call The Whatafatass:  Bacon cheeseburger + Whatachicken + french fries + picante salsa & spicy ketchup."}
{"text":"Love Whataburger but very slow and poor service at this location. No ketchup, no straws, no salad dressing. Poor, poor, poor attention to detail and service."}
{"text":"For a fast food restaurant Whataburger has a good burger as well as chicken sandwiches. Their meat is flavorful and the entire sandwich is seasoned well. They have worked hard to make it more like an eat in restaurant rather than what most know as fast food. You order at the counter, they give you a number, you get your own drink and have a seat. Then when they come with your food they offer you napkins and two types of ketchup, regular and spicy. Then you're left to enjoy your meal just as you would at any other fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"I got a #5 from here once and they forgot the meat on my burger. How do you forget the meat?!? And they've also forgotten other stuff on other trips there... Given them multiple chances but they can't get it right. Never again."}
{"text":"The Manager Angela was talking to Tristan like a 2 year old in front of customers. This is why I give 1 Star.  TRISTAN WAS VERY HELPFUL. He has really good customer service skills. There is no reason why Angela should be treating her employees like this in front of customers. As a supervisor I would never do this to my employees. This manager should be FIRED. By the looks of it she makes the work place a living hell for these poor employees. Trying being a leader and an example for your employees, not a complete BITCH.  For the employees there are MANY OTHER fast food restaurants that are hiring. You guys don't deserve ANGELA'S way of being a \"manager\""}
{"text":"Our favorite spot to stop before leaving Phoenix. Great hot fries"}
{"text":"Im giving WB 4 stars, simply for the 'Full' factor.  Its Whataburger, cmon people.  Everyone knows by now, that fast food NEVER looks like the advertisements.  That's why I was not surprised when I got my Sweet N Spicy double the other day.  You couldn't even see the bacon on onions, unless yopu took off the top bun.  BUT the flavors were there.  And its a big chunk of burger. It takes quite a bit to fill me up, and a Whataburger double does the trick.  The fries were decent, as well.  I had avoided this place for awhile, as it never seemed busy, and that worried me. But it was all for not. Next I will be trying the breakfast on a bun sandwhiches."}
{"text":"Et Tu Whattaburger?   I'm sitting here pondering my stone cold burger...  Ordered around midnight.  Wondering if it was made last dinner rush.   The fries were nuclear hot.   What happened?  As added insult,  after declining ketchup,  I asked for ranch... Wrong...  38 cents please.   Wtf?  Stepping over dollars to pinch and save dimes.  Crossing another sellout off my list.   Ciao Whattaburger.   RIP."}
{"text":"For years, I have tolerated that this Whataburger is slower than sit-down dining, gets my order wrong, and overcharges me, mostly because the chain sometimes introduces menu items I like.  Today, I went in search of a jalape√±o breakfast biscuit, which is a truly fine idea. At 6:45, the place was empty except for two clerks sitting in the dining area. They stared and giggled at my bemusement that there was nobody to take my order, as apparently the manager thinks it makes sense to send everybody who can operate a cash register on break simultaneously.  Only when I started to walk out did one of the staff yell for attention in the kitchen. After much yelling, somebody in back said she'd be out in a while. Since there were no other customers in the restaurant or the drive-thru, I'm not sure what was more urgent than serving an actual customer, but I've known management to set some odd metrics that get in the way of customer service.  \"I give up -- you don't want customers,\" I said, and I went to get a biscuit at the QT across the street.  Larger fast food chains have a metric of time-for-service, and they're always trying to reduce it. Not Whataburger! Whataburger cultivates the pure Customer Contempt Approach."}
{"text":"I work late nights at my kitchen job and dont get off my shift until 2 am most nights. Needless to say there arent many food options for myself if I feel like having a lazy night. Decided to hit up this location around 4:30am with the expectation of weak service and even worse tasting food and a stomach full of regret BUT this was the most pleasant 4:30am drive thru experience Ive had to date. I ordered quick and got my food even quicker. The woman running the show made my day. Thank you guys for everything you do. This sad kitchen worker was made a little happier by your efforts."}
{"text":"I love whataburger. No, I'm not a bot or someone fake who is just trying to promote whataburger. I've eaten burgers from the pacific coast to the Atlantic coast and whataburger has the best, most consistent delivery to date of any chain. Every time I eat a double whatameat with cheese, I swear I can hear the angels sing. When I'm done, I always sit back and say \"amen.\"   On the contrary, my wife doesn't really like whataburger. Why? Because it's a Man's burger place. Also, you gotta give it to the employees that service the dinning room there. No other fast food place does what they do by walking the room and asking you if you want more ketchup or need some napkins."}
{"text":"Had a really terrible experience here tonight ... I pulled into the drive thru at 10:37pm (I know because I used my ApplePay to transfer money to my Whataburger account and had an email receipt). After waiting in the drive thru for 25 minutes, we finally got to the window and they didn't even have our order (one avocado bacon burger). We asked to speak with the manager, and he offered to do nothing about it, just stated that he had just got on shift and had the nerve to question if we had even in fact been in the drive thru! He didn't offer to make the burger or anything else, just stood there and made excuses about being short staffed. This is very unfortunate because this store is less than a mile from my home and we've never had bad service here before. Ended up leaving with no food."}
{"text":"Always has a great burger and the most helpful and polite staff. I see multiple willing to go out of the way to make sure you are satisfied."}
{"text":"Save yourself the trouble and go to Carl's Jr or something.  I came here at 1:30 am or so with two other people and the place only had a couple people inside. We went through the drive through ordered two chicken burgers, onion rings, and cookies. The burgers were mediocre at best, even for \"fast\" food (mine had a weird taste to it, the tomatoes were disgusting, and the bread was somehow burnt and almost soggy at the same time) and the cookies were rock solid frozen. The only thing that could be considered warm in that bag was the burgers which were maybe just over room temperature.   Now, why did I put the word fast in quotation marks? Like I said, we got there about 1:30 but we didn't leave the drive through window until just after 2:00. I understand that it's made to order and all of that, but seriously?  I'd never eaten at this chain or location before and needless to say, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Whataburger is guilty pleasure. When I'm looking for gut-bomb delivered with service that makes you proud to be American, this is where I go.  Usually I use the drive thru, and the last two times I've left with a burger I didn't order even if the receipt said I had.  The food is still good but if you're limited to drive thru there are better options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This whataburger restaurant is excellent,,I've eaten here several times,,the service  and food was great"}
{"text":"This has always been my fav burger place but last 3 times the burger was COLD!  Not lukewarm but actually cold. Also charged 50 cents per piece of cheese, really??  To the Manager @ the Bell location; plz serve hot burgers, we are happy to wait a lil longer. I hate cold burgers. Great staff here but the cooks are terrible."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Came here on New Years Eve and the burgers were cold and onion rings tasted funky.  Fail.  Yuck."}
{"text":"Very fast, very busy and everyone is friendly and working hard. Love their onion rings and bacon cheeseburger."}
{"text":"What can you say about a fast food restaurant. It's not gourmet food. LOL but the folks here at water burger have always provided fast service with a smile and the food is cooked right and is always hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Great customer service here! Dayson had accidentally gotten our burger order wrong. And he personally came out to apologize to us and bring us a new burger. He was very professional and courteous. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Whataburger is a very good place to eat clean service Fest and everybody should try it Lyle Lovett"}
{"text":"This manager sucked, he didn't great us... one of the costumers did as a joke. When the customer did the manager flicked his hand. After waiting to put our order in they said we had to wait 45 minutes for their best thing (the honey butter chicken biscuit). We left."}
{"text":"Whataburger with cheese and an order of onion rings is the most comforting of comfort food meals I can get at any restaurant.  Been eating Whataburgers since I was a kid going with my dad, who ate them for decades before me.  Yup - guess you could say I'm a second generation Phoenix Whataburger-er.  It's the only fast food I crave.  Their fries are awfully good too.  I think they still use real fat.  And where else can you get a diet Dr. Pepper to go with your 2 Million calorie  meal?  All the Whataburger restaurants are good, but this one is my central go to location.  They always get my drive-through order right and are friendly."}
{"text":"By far the worst Whataburger out there. Service sucks, food was cold, and I found a big bug in my burger. I called and took the food back and the manager there wanted to give me attitude bc they messed up. Never again will I eat at another Whataburger, and if I was any of you I would avoid the one on Chandler Blvd and I10."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here with orders from Postmates customers tonight and sometimes when they place orders we need clarification on what they are requesting. I asked Stephanie (the snotty chick working the drive thru) to hold while I figured this order out. Once I placed the order. Her comment on if I was sure that's what I wanted was not necessary. I was going to place another order for food for myself but quickly changed my mind. I'd rather give my money to another business. Hopefully I don't have to come back here tonight and if I do I hope she's not the one taking my order."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a good burger.  The lobby is always open and usually clean.  But just like every other whaterburger they take a while to cook your fresh food so it worth it :)"}
{"text":"I like this place it is like McDonald's but better I have been to a couple different ones before and they are all good. When I lived out in Az we use to go here. The whataburgers are great try the bacon and cheese whataburger and so are the whatachick'n. I havnt tried the breakfast yet so next time I am out there i will try it."}
{"text":"I stopped in here the other day and ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, fries and a drink.  I needed to use the restroom and was told the restrooms were outside?! Then I was given the key to the women's restroom because someone had \"stolen the key to the men's restroom\"?!  I placed the little table tent with my number, an empty drink cup and my receipt on a table while I was using the restroom.   In the three minutes that I was gone a woman had taken my cup, filled it with ice tea and was drinking from it. She had also taken the table tent and thrown it on top of the garbage can! I asked her why she touched my cup and she said \"I thought you left\".  Luckily, the young man at the counter gave me another cup. This store is small and dumpy. The food was good but I will never go back to this location!"}
{"text":"When Whataburger has their star players their burgers are really good! I'm a big fan but have had bad luck with Whataburgers all over the Valley this past year.   On this visit I ordered a double meat burger, fries and an \"Arnold Palmer\". For starters, the poor young lady taking my order didn't know what an Arnold Palmer was. My burger wasn't fresh (not hot and kind of chewy) and the fries were just warm, not fresh.   I would say I only got a good, hot meal from Whataburger on two out of the last five visits. And this has been at all different locations.     They should change their name to \"What a mess!\"  Too many good burger joints in the Valley to keep coming back to a chain that is this inconsistent!  I'm sure Smash Burger, Five Guys or In-N-Out would love to have my business!"}
{"text":"Worst whataburger I've ever been to. Started off going through the drive-through thinking it would be quick. I ordered a Burger with cheese and jalape√±os and had a coupon for a free burger with the purchase of a drink and fry. When I receive my order I received two burgers one plane and one with add-ons that I did not even ask for but was charge for bacon to be exact.  When I went in to try and fix the mistake the cashier had to rope for other employees in to try and figure out how to fix the mistake. In the end it took me 15 minutes to get out with the burger I had originally ordered and no apology."}
{"text":"If you are lucky you will get Betty Davis to wait on you!!! Shes an amazing beautiful lady!!!! Keep up the great work beautiful Betty!"}
{"text":"The wait is ridiculous in the drive through, we waited almost 45 minutes with only 2 cars ahead of us. And the customer service was terrible."}
{"text":"This place is the best.  The food is consistently delicious and the staff is always helpful and polite.  I go here several times a month especially late night."}
{"text":"Whataburger in Arizona!? Pulling over!!  The food is just great and and easy to customize! I always get the bacon cheese burger with the grilled onions best in the world!! I suggest get the fries with no salt much better :-) Went through the drive through very friendly service :-) The only lil thing was the service was a tad slow but great food worth the wait!! Sodas are great tasting For the kids grilled cheese they love it! So if ur from Texas and can't live with out whataburger hit Arizona in the way to California!!"}
{"text":"Been here for about 15 mins for two honey chicken biscuit... Never waited this long for fast food.."}
{"text":"Whataburger was the go-to, All-American spot before In-N-Out came to Arizona. I really don't see them around any more, but to run into one that's open 24 hours was refreshing.  It's super clean  Everyone is polite  The food is above average for the industry.   Get the patty melt.   Whoever manages this location is doing a great job. I usually say \"meh, it's just fast food\" when it comes to Yelp reviews, but if you're on the freeway late at night and want a quick bite, go here."}
{"text":"I am always so excited to go to Arizona - not for the hot weather, or the cactus, or the great sunsets, the pool, but to get a Whataburger! For those of you in California, you wouldn't know, but Whataburger is awesome - they are open all the time - you can get a burger at 4:00 in the morning or late at night and they are ALWAYS good!"}
{"text":"Been a long time since I had Whataburger,  not since I was living in Oklahoma,  and it was heavenly to taste again! Was quiet when we went in last night, and the staff was friendly. Would definitely recommend. A+++!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with this place. WORST customer service I have had in a long time! The girl in the drive thur should think about getting a job where she will have zero customer interaction. I can say we won't be back"}
{"text":"The worst tasting whata burger tried in Arizona. So proud of taking people to the joint, but instead the food had no taste like other locations. It was plain and not straight up nasty. This is -12 compared to other locations I've tried. Not sure if it's the way their meat is stored Or temperature, but don't come here for a good burger."}
{"text":"If my mind serves me correctly, this is the Whataburger within walking distance of Tempe Diablo. Stadium is in Tempe, but this is in Phoenix. I came here on a Saturday afternoon prior to the game, and while it was busy I got my order in about 5 mins.  Got the Double Cheese combo! It comes with lettuce, tomato, onions, and the whole shebang! Except mayo. The taste was great as it reminded me of a Double Whopper! Too bad, Whataburger is an AZ thing otherwise I would try the other items. And oh yeah, they have Spicy Ketchup here also."}
{"text":"I have to admit the service was pretty good even though they were understaffed.  They were polite and friendly and the bathrooms were very clean.  The food is just okay and compare it to burger king. I do like you have an option to get onion rings on top of that which is nice, but you pay a little extra.  They deliver the food to you and ask you if you want ketup on top of that.  Anyways it was just okay.  I just do not know why I was craving it."}
{"text":"Stopped in to have lunch with a friend ordered a #1 meal upgraded to onion rings only to find out ranch dipping sauce was an extra charge!!! WTH??? REALLY??? I did pay an additional $.35 for upgrade to onion rings...also barbeque dipping sauce is extra too...why not make all the condiments extra charge if that is the case??? This is ridiculous I think 2 dipping sauces should be free anything over that should be extra charge. RANT OVER!!"}
{"text":"Hahaha.  I've got to take offense to another review.  I was GLAD to see all the lemmings were over at In N Out, as usual.  I'm sorry, but in Texas, we don't need a super secret menu to sell our burgers.  I am glad Whataburger has found it's way to Arizona.  The ONLY thing In N Out has on Whataburger is their fries.  But the burger is bigger and better at Whataburger.  And after my recent visit to this location as well as a visit to In N Out just across I10, my prior experience with both chains holds true.  So take your double double monster animal pony, if you want to feel special.  I'll take a bacon and cheese whataburger any day.  And I won't sound like a tool ordering it."}
{"text":"I have seen this burger chain for years traveling across the country but have never eaten at one until recently. Like everyone else who enjoys a nice hamburger patty or two in between a toasted bun. I love a great burger. Something about the combination of good hamburger meat with some melted cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and bun bread in your mouth. It's just magic if the burger is done right. Whataburger does it right. Open 24/7, this place cranks out food nonstop. Delivered to your table, your order comes with assorted dipping sauces to pick from. I would recommend the spicy ketchup. By far my favorite condiment. While I stuffed my face with my burger oldies rock and roll played within the restaurant. Ever so often drinking my soda and eating a fry or two. The fries themselves remind me very much like Mickey D's fries which I like.  I usually don't review fast food chains but this place seemed different than other chains I have been to as far as quality and practices. Overall a great burger place. I was completely satisfied with my meal after. I highly recommend. Whatabuger has a new fan, me. Eat burgers here."}
{"text":"I'm done with this place I came here on my lunch to pick up food for coworkers and they left off some chicken bites A part of a combo. I went back and they were not so polite about it but I asked them to re-cook the french fries because they were cold. They said I would have to wait five minutes so I waited to give me the bag and I rushed back to work I got back to work and they didn't give me back the chicken strip burger that I had ordered with the original food. This is three times I had to go back and I am late for lunch it is very annoying to say the least."}
{"text":"Biggest College football game of the year and after the game we go here to whataburger and they have 3 people working.  Needless to say service was terrible 40 minutes for food and was terrible"}
{"text":"I was dissatisfied with my service the other night. 1st time they were out of ketchup and spicy ketchup. So I asked for another sauce and was told I'd be charged if I wanted one. RIDICULOUS!!! You're telling me that you've not ordered enough product for your customers, and you need the 38cents that badly. I would if I were an owner comp sauces if I were out, because it's my fault."}
{"text":"Yes it is fast food. But for a fast food place you have to give it exra stars because of the great service you get which sets it above other fast food burger places.  When you order to dine it they will bring to your table a condiments tray and ask you if you need anything else. No other fast food place does that."}
{"text":"What-a-disater  My very first experience at a Whataburger and I can not believe the variety of ways they managed to screw it up.  I was the only person ordering but this place was such a disorganized, chaotic mess that ordering a meal took a solid 5 minutes and required two employees and a Manager.  I got my meal and immediately realized that they'd gotten my order wrong. O...K, less fries and a larger drink are probably fine.  But I got a jalapeno and cheese burger and the cheese isn't melted. the jalapenos have no kick and the whole thing is smothered in the cheapest most repulsive American style mustard you've ever eaten.  I check out the fries and realize there is a 1 to 1 ratio of salt to potato. I have to roll them in a napkin just to make them palatable.  And the strawberry shake tastes like a cold chemistry experiment.  I hate wasting food but I looked at each item and had no interest in any of it so I gave it back to them and asked for a refund.   The Manger didn't hassle me about the refund and I considered a second star but the food was just too bad to justify it.  2013 #1 / 365"}
{"text":"Every chance I get we go to Whataburger since we don't have one in my city. This has been the friendliest I have ever been to. The cashier Maritza was a sweet girl who gave us a huge smile when we went up to the counter. She took our order and we sat down. When she brought us our food again she was very friendly. The food was hot and delicious as always. The fries were crisp and fresh. Halfway through our meal Maritza came back and asked us if we were ok, if we needed anything else. Will be back to this one when I visit Phoenix again. It's just fast food, nothing fancy but it's refreshing to see such a young employee take pride in her work and be so friendly and look out for the guest. Thank you Maritza. I"}
{"text":"9:00 P.M., the exact moment I realized that the talk on the internet about this place is not all that they say it is. Working in the food industry myself, cleanliness is VERY crucial and key to a great business! This place is not it. Walked in and instantaneously realized I wasted my gas coming here. The manager was at the counter, given not even smiling, strike one and we asked him a simple question, what would you recommend given it was our first time. He responded with an astonishing, \"I couldn't tell you, I don't eat here.\" Strike two, that's a terrible sign when your own employees don't eat there own food. This manager was not on a diet either. Working with food, regardless if you've eaten it or not, you give recommendations based off of what everyone else orders. Also as we are walking in, a girl is directly behind this man scratching her butt with a bag of chicken in her hands getting ready to dump it into the deep fryer. Strike three for obvious reasons. Lastly, the manager had a decent size bug on his hands. He played with if for a good minute with us standing in front of him and the girl behind him laughing. Strike four all in a matter of five minutes. Horrible service and business overall. I will be sure to spread this news around to all the locals. Waste of my breath. Go to Culvers!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience today. Adnan in the drive thru was on it and funny. The fries were super hot and perfect. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the burger did not have any flavor. Salt and pepper would have helped."}
{"text":"I've gone to Whataburger since I was a kid and not a whole lot has seemed to change. I enjoy their burgers much more then McDonald's, Wendy's and Burger King! I wouldn't say it's my favorite burger place, but it's decent and a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is what customer Service should be. Employees are courteous, place is clean, and food Is good.   We visited on a Saturday night and the place runs like well oiled machine. Manager that night and crew are all doing a great job. Very attentive to all patrons. My go to fast place from now on"}
{"text":"My favorite fast food burger joint. Never disappoints and at a reasonable price. It always gets packed around lunch time and seats are not always available.  Only thing that bothers me is that they charge extra for ranch when you buy onion rings. That's like charging extra for ice when you order a lemonade. It just goes together. Maybe they should charge after the second container of ranch but the first should be free. No worries, I found a perfect solution to that problem: Don't buy the dam onion rings, their loss. Just hate it when restaurants try to be sneaky about raising prices by adding them on to something else. One more thing, I could not figure out why my kids refused to eat here until one day I ordered a kids meal for my self and the burger was awful, just dry and gross. I would not want to eat that either so now we let them order a #1 from the adults menu."}
{"text":"Customer service is non existent at this Whataburger. Corporate needs to send some secret shoppers to this location, especially the drive thru."}
{"text":"Decided to give Whataburger a second chance and see what the real fuss was about and decided to get their Honey BBQ Chicken Strip Sandwich on Texas Toast, as recommended by some Texas folk. With of course some cola to complete the meal.  Drive thru service had a bit of a line and seemed to be a little slower than other fast food places. However, liked how this location is 24 hours and in a convenient location.  The sandwich was pretty hefty in weight, but found it to be pretty mediocre. The strips were crisp by any means and average, the BBQ sauce was good ... but then again I have yet to come across BBQ sauce that isn't good. Food was lukewarm. If it were up to me I'd rather have Raising Cane's if looking for a chicken strip style sandwich. Really holding onto hope and that perhaps, third time's the charm and go for a Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit next time."}
{"text":"A good hamburger, but it depends on my mood. I eat a lot of food from a variety of different places, burgers included. I like In&Out the best and then it's a toss of Whataburger and Five Guys. I really like the thickness of the burgers here and the diced onion with mustard only, classic. I remember eating here with my grandfather and dad after we would go bowling as a kid. This obviously occurred at a different location, but nonetheless, it still occurred and has a great sense of nostalgia."}
{"text":"On a recent holiday in Chandler, I was fortunate enough to sample Whataburger's bacon and egg \"taquitos\" for breakfast, which seem more like burritos where I'm from but whatever. I appreciate the server bringing the condiment tray to the table. Make sure to ask for some salsa, which they shrewdly keep hidden under the counter. That's some good stuff, man!"}
{"text":"This place has the best food and best service! Rachel was great and very nice. Thank you Rachel. We came on a Thursday night at 7pm. Very clean, food fresh, people very nice especially Rachel."}
{"text":"My first time here for breakfast ordered a sausage biscuit with cheese hash browns and a orange juice ..didn't know it was a la cart though it was on the way to work so it was worth a try . I still love my sausage egg white delight from the big M"}
{"text":"This location is near my work so if I want to get out and grab a quick bite I can do it.  I've gone though the drive-thru and gone inside to eat.  I have never been to a fast food burger place that brings your order to your table along with condiments and asks if you need anything else.  That is a very nice touch.  And they are friendly and smiling.  I am a purist and I usually eat my burgers plain.  Yes, plain.  No lettuce, no condiments, no nothing. I've been eating them this way since.....well.......since I started eating burgers and that was too long ago cause I'm old.  The burger was fresh, the bun was fresh and soft and the fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  I have no compliants.  Would this be my first choice for a fast food burger?  Not really but it's decent and they offer chicken options too.  It's busy at lunchtime both inside and at the drive-thru.  Service is fast though.  I honestly don't know how they keep the lines at the drive thru moving so quickly.  Thanks Whataburger for being a decent lunch option for me."}
{"text":"My favorite burger joint since I was a kid. My wife will even order something. The servers are very professional and of course the food is good. We've been coming to this one for years."}

{"text":"Poor poor service. The Drive Thru lady Vanessa was a total bitch. That Lengthy kid Nick Made my fries wet, and unsalted   Whoever made the burger did a piss pour job. Sauce smothered everywhere and the bun tasted like sweaty hands do these animals not use gloves? So Unsanitary.   I tried going in and asking for a new burger and fries but i has to stand at the front counter for 15 minutes and This ill-looking lady named Jeannie waddles out of some room in the kitchen and asks me something but i'm not sure what she said because she talks at the level of a chipmunk! After i explained my situation, Jeannie goes back to the kitchen. She tells the staff about my complaint and for the next 5 minutes as they remake my burger, they all give me dirty looks like i'm the one who made the shitty food. Ugh such assholes! Will not be returning.   -Wanda"}
{"text":"On 06/02/17 at 12:16 pm i went and had lunch with my son. When i was leaving i went and refill on my tea. Pulled the lid off and a long black hair was on the side. I showed it to the manager she took my cup tossed it in the trash and gave me a new cup. Nothing eals was said to me. Food was great but the hair made me wanna puke."}
{"text":"One of the slowest locations I have ever been at .. I swear it takes the longest time for something simple...the service is mediocre at best .. and even after all that waiting you would think the food would be warm"}
{"text":"Big burgers, VERY friendly service, manager came around and asked everyone if they were satisfied.  I'm impressed"}
{"text":"We were in town visiting from San Diego where they don't have Whataburger (blasphemous). Food was great but we have to give a shout out to Richard! Even though he's a cook he was attentive to the cash register making sure we were taking care of. Excellent customer service provided by him. Thanks to him we will be back! Thanks Richard!"}
{"text":"Usually we go through the drive thru, we will continue to do that because of the on duty \"manager\". Food was wrong and old fries not the norm. For this location. We brought out of state family members here who wanted to try it. They replaced everything it was great after that. However, the team leader Jeff was very rude about it. The cashier Joe was great and very apologetic. That's what I expected from Jeff not to have the replaced food thrown on our table without a word being said. Apology...don't hold your breathe. They definitely keep a clean restaurant, all the employees were busy cleaning. That was nice to see."}
{"text":"I'm from California so we don't get Whataburger out here.  Every time I'm in Tempe I stop here for my fix.  This last weekend I came here twice and my expectations were exceeded.  Great burgers, friendly staff and quick service..."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 3 times in about two months and literally every time they somehow forget one piece of my order, twice it was the bacon on my order and this time it was the cheese. You guys either need a new intercom system or to hire people that know how to listen. Won't be here again... at least this shopping center had a bad ass Dutch Bros going for it."}
{"text":"Love their burgers especially with avocado! I think it is better than In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Great burger, onion rings and super double chocolate shake.  The real winner is the Spicy Ketchup!  Definitely returning again."}
{"text":"Came in politely to order food and I was automatically turned away like a dog because of my $800 bike that I wasn't gonna leave outside.  Both the cashier and manager were very unpleasant. They refused to let me order unless I locked my bike up outside.  I used to work here too. Guess it's a good thing I left since this is how they treat their  original co-workers.I would have let someone bring their bike in with them or told them more politely instead of yelling at them."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good!  Don't mind the wait, if the food is great.  The burgers looked like real meat!  Amazing flavor even with the chicken strips. Can't find that everyday!  Service was good.  The only thing I could make a negative comment on is location and a small parking lot. I'm going to find time to get breakfast before I leave."}
{"text":"Horrible flies everywhere in the dining area. Cashier is horrible and rude. Horrible night crew. I ordered number 11. Once I got home the chicken was awful the presentation it self was disgusting, even though they gave me the wrong drink . The lettuce was old and dried out. The sandwich looked like it was sitting from the last order and the fries were super cold and stale. I do appreciate Andrew the night manager for giving me a free meal for next time. Thanks buddy"}
{"text":"First of all I love Whataburger, I don't eat fast food often but when I do it is always my go to.   I hear the entire menu is good especially the chicken strip sandwiches but I'm more of a classics kind of girl so I always get the standard Whataburger. Love the fact that I don't have to ask for no mayonnaise because they don't waste their time with that bs.   The spicy ketchup is so good, not very spicy but great with the fries and burger.   Some other reviewer was bothered by their selection of condiments and the presentation, have no idea why they were complaining because I appreciate it.   Last but not least, I don't know his name but there is a hotty that works at this location in the evenings and I'm always happy to see him when I go. Definitely keeps me coming back"}
{"text":"First time here. I only ordered iced tea that tasted like water. Our daughter and son in law ordered food.  They said it was very good. The coffee was also weak so they graciously gave us a large drink instead."}
{"text":"Had never had a Whataburger, but had read loyalists rave about them.  Tried them for the first time this week.  Ordered a double meat whataburger meal through the drive-thru.  Service was prompt.  Burger was cold, fries only warm and priced a dollar higher than the Quarter Pounder meal at McDonald's.....and you don't get cheese unless you pay extra.  Lesson learned....go one mile east to In N Out, get a hot burger, fresh fries and a coke for about the same price."}
{"text":"I love Whataburger. The burgers are far and away the best fast food burgers you can get. Don't even say that In-N-Out is better. I always get my burger the same way, #1 Whataburger with sliced jalapeno, grilled onions, bacon, and cheese... yes its indigestion central. The last 3 times I have been there I got home only to realize my burger was not how I ordered it. The first time, they gave me a whole grilled jalapeno. What the hell am I going to do with this other than get a firebomb in my stomach? and the onions weren't grilled. Who goes to Whataburger and orders a side of a giant jalapeno!?   Second visit, there were no jalapenos to speak of whatsoever, not even the giant grilled one. They got the onions, cheese, and bacon right though.  Third visit, I straight up got someone elses order. I got a friggin chicken sandwich. I'll make the trek to another store from now on. This one is just craptastic."}
{"text":"I love this place Marie amazing manager Alex Mendez great worker Marie is a great manager and takes care of her customers and employees."}
{"text":"It's Whataburger!!! Sentimental for me, I'm always happy to be at Whataburger. It may not be the greatest burger you ever had , but it's good and the people are always nice. Give it a shot"}
{"text":"Hamburgers here are fair, the best part of this whataburger experience is that soft bun of the classic whataburger meal. No napkins when ordering through the drive thru. Also the fact that sauces costed 38 cents is a little saddening, but they are a good size. I might go again."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this location. The restaurant is clean with plenty my of seating, even for 7 or more people at one time.   I ordered the patty melt with fries and drink. The patty melt was large, fresh and served hot.  The fries were plentiful and hot too. I am not one for spicy food but I do recommend trying the spicy ketchup.   Very friendly counter staff. Food will be delivered quickly to your table. Plenty of outdoor parking. Overall a very nice experience.    I hear the milk shakes are good too!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhhh!!!! The light from the heavens above shine upon this burger joint!!! Holy grail of burgers right here!!!!   Ok ok so obviously I'm in love with the burgers here, my god I was in Phoenix for 3 days and we ate here once daily  HAHA!!!! We couldn't get enough. I had the double cheeseburger with bacon and onion. It was so tasty and juicy and the only thing that upsets me is I could only finish half of it :(   The establishment was clean the staff was friendly but the only odd thing was the way they hand out condiments, they hide them in a tray behind the counter and the tray only comes out and is offered when your food is ready and the server has to walk it to your table each order. I don't know, is it like this at every location???? Just seems a bit much to me especially if it were to get busy in there, very time consuming :/   I really wish we had this burger joint in Cali otherwise it looks like I'll be visiting Arizona more often lol"}
{"text":"Whataburger is about as good as fast food burger quality gets. Freshly made when you order (which does slow down the fast a little). I personally NEED a Whataburger with cheese, bacon and jalapenos about once a month. I wish they stuck with the spicy ketchup."}
{"text":"One of the best fast-food burgers out there - You gotta try the jalape√±o bacon double whataburger with cheese. Holy crap!"}
{"text":"I called to see if I could pick up an order I was down the street he exasperated like I interrupted his day and he said yes in a very sarcastic way. He told me I had to come in to pick it up I couldn't drive through. The last time I came to this water burger place to breakfast order for everybody and I was missing food she told me that I could come in and get my food but this was already after breakfast because of course were a business and she told me well as long as I get my receipt I could have my food but again it's always something with this location."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru for a Whataburger with cheese, mustard, and pickle only. The fries were very good and the meal was filling. I used to shy away from Whataburger but I've grown to really like it."}
{"text":"I have not been to a Whataburger in about 15 years. After seeing the positive reviews on here I decided to give it a shot. I got a Whataburger w/ cheese (only ketchup, mustard, and pickles) and fries. The diameter of the burger is large but it's pretty flat. Tasted good- reminded me of a Sonic burger. I thought the fries were similar to McDonald's but not as salty. Pretty good meal overall. There are so many other good burger places out there, but I imagine I'll make it back here before another 15 years pass by."}
{"text":"So came here for a late night craving. I ordered the chicken melt with no bun \"I can't eat bread\". They asked me to 're pet my order a few times. When I got home they melted the cheese,onions,peppers on the the darn plastic  My chicken was bear has nothing on it. Why in hell would some.one melts the cheese on to the plastic. Yuck! Needles to say my meal went in the trash and I went hungry."}
{"text":"Amongst the worst fast food burgers.  A step up from Sonic, McDonalds, and Jack in the Box, but not nearly as good as the others.  \"Not nearly as good as Burger King\" ain't the biggest selling point.  What in the world is that crap you call a bun?  Easily the worst bun on Earth.  I've had better bread in Africa, no joke.  A step BELOW wonderbread.  Heck, a step below stale wonderbread.  Awful.  You know those burger buns you get in an 8 pack in the grocery store that are all stuck together?  The things you buy because you feel lazy or are strapped for cash?  Those are ok.  Whataburger isn't.  It's far, far, far worse than that.  Look at these pictures.  The bun is like play-doh or a circus peanut.  Gross.  Did you read the part where I said it's worse than food in Africa?  Because it's worse than food in Africa.  I've been here over 10 times because it's open late and I worked third shift for a couple years.  Well, I don't anymore and I tried this place for lunch at noon.  Still awful.  How the heck could anybody like this place?!  2 stars because it isn't McDonalds, although McDonalds has better buns.  But I'd still literally rather get punched than eat a burger with a McDonalds bun.  Whataburger: Worse Than A Punch   edit to add:  Also if you go to the drivethrough, expect to wait 20 minutes if there is nobody in front of you.  If there is, play a few hands of solitaire on your dashboard.  Slow as hell."}
{"text":"A Whataburger w/cheese & jalape√±os is proof there is a loving God who wants us to be happy."}

This location never seems to get too crowded which is a good thing for me. I would give this particular location four stars but, I can't at this time because the staff working the drive through window at night have been dropping the ball in regards to order accuracy."}

{"text":"Tasty burger!  I hadn't been to a Whataburger in YEARS, but I was in the area and needed food.   I ordered just a burger and drink. My first thought was that it was a little pricey at a little over $7, but I *did* order a double burger.   The people working there were very nice, service was fast, and the burger arrived hot and fresh. The double burger was worth the money, and the guy delivering it to my table asked if I needed condiments or a drink refill -- I thought that was nice.  I got the green chile double burger, which consisted of two patties, two slices of cheese and a pile of green chiles on it -- they added a nice little kick.   As some other reviewers mentioned, the burgers are a bit on the juicy side, so that could be a problem if you're eating in the car or just don't like your burgers that way. Careful, they come out HOT enough to burn your mouth!"}
{"text":"Hmm... I've paid for gravy 4 times now and it's never in the bag. Whataburger owes me 4 gravy sides. And this time the fries were dry and brittle :( disappointed."}
{"text":"I drove past a Whataburger in Lafayette, Louisiana for years and never bothered to stop in (it was right in front of Sam's Club). I didn't know anyone who had ever eaten there.  Moved here and finally decided one evening I would take the plunge, since In-And-Out was further than I wanted to drive. And I reallllllly wanted a decent burger.  THE GOOD The patties on my burger had a good flavor and the beef didn't seem overly fatty.   The onion rings (which I think were prepared fresh for me) were pretty decent. Even though it was a large order, I wanted more.  The malt: not half bad! Now bear in mind that Lafayette, Louisiana has one of the only (if not THE only) Borden's Ice Cream Shops left in the country, conveniently located just off the campus of University of Louisiana at Lafayette. It still makes REAL malts, shakes, etc. So I'm spoiled. But it was good to taste the malt; I find shakes bland and seldom order them.  THE NOT-SO-GOOD The overall burger taste was bland, uninspired. If there was mustard, ketchup or mayo on the burger, I couldn't find it, at least not enough to enhance the flavor. The chopped lettuce fell out of the burger with each bite, making more of a mess than I would have liked. And the lettuce was bitter.  The fries: again, nothing special. The large serving was plenty--I didn't finish them. And since I despise cold fries, the remainder went out for the birds to nosh on the next morning. Got the spicy ketchup. What's all the yelling about with that? Ketchup with a little (tiny) kick. Meh. (And I was given all of three containers of it.)  Overall: I can now say I'm no longer a Whataburger virgin. But I wouldn't make a special trip just to go to one again."}
{"text":"We visited this location Saturday through the drive-thru around 1:40pm. We ordered two combo meals for the sweet and spicy bacon burgers. The employee at the first window was nice. When we got to the second window we asked for honey mustard. The girl at the second window said it would be about .35 cents for sauce. When she was given the change she rolled her eyes and made a ugh sound. Her attitude was off putting. If I am going to pay almost $18 for two combo meals I would prefer less attitude. I hadn't visited a Whataburger for a few years prior to this visit and it is doubtful that I will ever return to this location. The food was pretty good as well as the honey mustard though ;)"}
{"text":"Should be called...Whataletdown....Under cooked French Fries. Needed at least another three minutes in the fryer. A burger that wasn't even like warm. I wouldn't call their bacon REAL bacon. Obviously made way in advance since I was there a mere minute in the drive thru.    Wish there was a In & Out or a Five Guys nearby."}
{"text":"Out of: all sandwiches other than kid sizes, Texas toast, gravy, chicken bites, Dr Pepper... soooo what can you get here? I'll never know... Hope they get their ordering straight, cause Sunday night was not a good night for the (potential) patrons of this location."}
{"text":"Drive out from Moreno Valley ca. To watch a dodger game and first stop was whataburger. So so good"}
{"text":"So upset. July 16 as we're driving back to California we stop To get food for the road there, since we already had breakfast. Two hits intoning drive we divide the food up. My burger is missing. I was so mad I really wanted To try them because my sister now who use to live in Phoenix told is it's a must when we visited. I am so mad I didn't get to trying"}
{"text":"The food was okay. Other than my order took a little too long, they actually have a nice customer service.  La comida estuvo bien. Aunque mi order tard√≥ un poco, tienen buen servicio al cliente."}
{"text":"I have never had Whataburger before but I had to try it out after hearing a podcast about it. I was a bit disappointed they didn't have the Monterey melt anymore but I tried something else instead. I can't remember what it was called but it was a couple of burger patties in between Texas toast. It was pretty darn good! I also enjoyed the different kind of sauces I could get with my fries. The inside is a bit Bland but I think that might be typical of Whataburger establishments. I plan to try again in the future and see if I can up my rating. Very pleased though from a Whataburger virgin!"}
{"text":"Been going to Whataburger since '70. I love their burgers & shakes/malts!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed, I ordered a hamburger for lunch and it was not appetizing at all. The bread was hard, the meat was dry and they put mustard, I didn't see a drop of ketchup. The Dr. Pepper tasted weird, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came in 11/28/17 ordered about 40.00 plus in meals to go all fries with meals were old no heat at all. Burgers had absolutely no lettuce cold bacon added to 2 of the meals. I Love whataburger but this location has to suck. Never experienced anything like this but here. Glad I don't live near this location I happened to be passing this way going home. I didn't even bother calling the manager I simply will never come here."}
{"text":"I grew up in Texas, we had a delightfully experience eating the Whataburger and their onion rings.  Living in Vegas, there isn't anything here like it.  So when I get a chance to get one of the burgers, I go for it.    Today, even though it's morning, I want a burger and that's what I get.  They grill the bun and it makes the burger.  I avoid mustard, not on my burger!  I love mayo and ketchup, with old fashion lettuce, tomato and pickle!    The onion rings have changed a little, but I still like that batter and the freshness of the onions.   This was a good burger and definitely brought me back home!"}
{"text":"I say, Whataburger always has stale buns that are completely tasteless. Fries are really salty and undercooked. The meat on the burger is OK, the lettuce and onions as well as tomatoes seem fresh. I just can't get past the buns. I throw away the bottom bun immediately because it is just a dried out piece of Styrofoam. Top bun is a bit softer but no taste at all. Whatever happened to the crinkle cut fries they had in the 70's?"}
{"text":"Half hour in drive thru to get to window and be handed a bag of cold food. Not even warm on the bottom of the bag. So, if I wanted microwave food at home I would have just made a microwave meal. Terrible."}
{"text":"Liked how when they brought the food they brought a tray of the ketchups to choose from. Employees aren't that nice and don't really look like they are enjoy their time working there. Place is dirty and really outdated from the hard wood spinning chairs. Like how they have hand sanitizer though."}
{"text":"Big ass burgers. Damn good fast food. It's still a fast food joint so dont expect the most amazing tasting or healthy type food but its still good. Service wasn't amazing but i have no complaints about it. enjoy"}
{"text":"There is no other place like Whataburger. Best burgers everrr! I tried the Onion rings thanks to Bobby Hill and I'm gonna have to say that they are the best onion rings I've ever had!!! I love the chicken strips too with gravy and the salads I strongly recommend"}
{"text":"Whataburger...how I love the name and I don't know why. Open 24-7, which is usually a scarey thing, they totally hammer out a fresh, yummy, fast food experience every freakin time. Whataburger? I say Whatabusiness! U guys deliver a fresh In N Out experience with the hours of a local taco stand. Bully for u Whataburger people. Of course the burgers are great....no need for me for a double, a plain ole single with cheese and bacon makes me mouth water. Whata Size it and you get a super size situation. Not my thing acutally. When I'm cheating and doing fast food, I stick to the basic small order. But I can't resist the side salad. For $3.50, u get a HUGE side salad, always fresh and always eaten after the burger to help push through the grease and carbs I've just ingested into my temple. Ok, so it's not quite a temple. Geez, give me a break. Rickie introduced to the Whataburger experience and I can't thank him enough. Well, I can, and believe I do my best if u know what I mean...wink wink. Ok, ok, enough rambling...fresh fast food u actually wait 10 minutes for is so worth it. TIP: Enjoy Amy Winehouse, I Don't Want To Go To Rehab  while ur waiting at the drive thru. God...ok, don't judge me...so I had a few shots of Patron and a Corona or two....Over and Out Yelpers!"}

Comfortable seating way different than other locations, great smiley staff.  Quick service!  5 stars, thank you!"}
{"text":"I missed so many restaurants on my way to this Whataburger, plenty of other choices healthier and cheaper,,, well my fault hehehe  I like their better quality meat they use.  Ordered a green chile, well knowing what green chile taste like, after the first bite it was bland,,, I opened it up and found hardly any green chile on it.    I ordered this before and I know how much green chile this sandwich had before many times,,,,   It's extremely embarrassing for me to complain about food, so I walked up with my card and my sandwich open and said- if this amount of green chile looks right to you can I please buy some more :)  Polite diplomatic way right! You would think they will say oh no let me add some more for you,,, they took my card and charged it lol    Fine,,,, my green chile that I paid for separately came out it was also few pieces at the bottom of a mayo cup!   Well,,, this wouldn't be the last time I order a green chile here but it is the last time I visit this location :)  This has nothing to do with the service, rather it's  the tasteless burger I had and the overcharge for an other petty quantity of green chile, also the frustration on a limited lunch break, never again!    Perfect example of save 50 cents and loose a customer forever.   Forgot to mention, Tuesday 3rd November 2:50 pm"}
{"text":"I'm going to focus largely on breakfast in this review and I'll admit to being a little sentimental in writing it.  I'm suffering from a bad case of burger fatigue. That said, Whataburger serves a quality (for fast food) burger. If you're complaining, with all the options Whataburger offers, you just didn't order it correctly. I always ask for grilled onions.  Breakfast is served until 11:00 a.m. What distinguishes Whataburger from other fast food breakfasts is their limited use of the microwave oven. Order pancakes, and you will receive pancakes freshly prepared on the spot, not pulled out of a freezer and zapped. Since they operate more like an old style short order cook, they'll customize virtually anything for you. Want your bacon crisp? No problem. Want a side of scrambled eggs? No worries.  The people at this location are very nice. I used to take my mother here for breakfast 2-3 times a week when she was a snowbird. She loved the free senior coffee and we'd split a meal. Always out the door for $6-8, which is what a nice breakfast for two cost in 1973, the benchmark year to which she seems to compare prices. The staff would often help me with her wheelchair and engage her small talk, a big deal when you're disabled. I was surprised, well maybe not that surprised, to see one of the same nice servers still there on this recent visit.   It's also great that you can settle in and read... while waiting for your breakfast to be prepared. They deliver it hot to your table when ready. It may take a minute or two longer than the microwave competitors, but it's worth it. The dining room is also much more relaxing since they updated it and said goodbye to the Whataburger orange and blue!  A five star Whataburger location. At best a three star restaurant, typical of fast food. Throw in a dash of sentiment and this Whataburger earns a four star rating overall."}
{"text":"Visiting Arizona (grew up here but moved away 8 years ago) and my son insisted we hit Whataburger while we are here. I had forgotten how awesome it is!!!  Good burgers, good prices!!  Wish there was one in Utah!!!"}
{"text":"I have always seen these on my trips to AZ but I have never been.  Stopped by tonight after the Diamondbacks/Cardinals game.  Went through the drive through (Open 24 hours) and ordered a double Whataburger and a medium vanilla shake.  I added cheese to my burger.....kind of lame here is that they charge you 50 cents per slice....so since I got a double burger, it was 50 cents per patty= $1.00 for cheese.  Oh well.........  My total was just under $9.00.  Here is how the burger and shake were.............  Double Whataburger w/cheese-  Damn Gina!  This thing was a hefty ass burger.  You could tell by the bag the dude handed me it was large and in charge.  I parked and unwrapped this beast.  The Whataburger comes standard with mustard, lettuce, onion, pickle and tomato.  This thing was damn tasty.  They use 100% all beef fresh meat.  While I was waiting for my food in the drive through, you could hear the sizzle on the flat top grill of freshly made hamburgers.  I was impressed!  Everything worked.  It reminded me of a Wendys type burger but better.  The patties were huge, the cheese melted nice and the mustard gave it a good tang.  I wouldn't hesitate to get another one of these burgers.  I liked it better than the burger I got last night at Lucky Boy.  Vanilla Shake-  This was a tad of a disappointment.  It was kind of icy and not as smooth as I like my shakes.  It is still a shake though and no man in his right mind would ever waste a shake.  I drank that thing till the straw hit the bottom of the cup and nothing else came out.  I don't know if I would get one again from here.  The texture was messing with my enjoyment of it.  Overall I was very impressed with the quality/taste of the burger.  The burger is a mans size burger...no skimpy shit here.  Price was a little high though and the shake was just alright.  3 stars for now."}
{"text":"I have to say....I am becoming a huge fan of Whataburger.  Sure, its a little bit expensive for \"fast food\", but in the end its worth it.  They cook everything fresh, their burgers are always juicy and huge, their fries are always salted well, they have spicy ketchup!, and I recently found out that they have a secret weapon....its on their breakfast menu.... the Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit.  Wow!  A freshly fried crunchy chicken strip nestled inside a freshly baked buttery, soft biscuit and then they drizzle this thing with their honey butter mixture.  WOW!  Possibly the best breakfast biscuit sandwich out there (Chick Fil-A is good, but this one here is a notch above that) right now!  They are only like $2.29 too, which is not bad at all.  Everyone I have encountered at Whataburger is very friendly too!  I'm glad we have them here in AZ.  CA could sure use one!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need a Green Chile Double.    Ever since moving to Phoenix, I have discovered the power of Whataburger.  It kind of grows on you.  The first couple times there, it was good but I was not overly impressed.  But, the more you come, the better it gets and the more you appreciate it.  It is now my go to fast food burger joint.  This Whataburger is a quick drive down from where I work (5 minutes).  The drive through is pretty speedy but I have received food that seemed like it could be more fresh...mostly the fries, a bit underdone sometimes and once or twice the burger buns seemed soggy and \"rushed\".  I usually don't choose that option anymore.  When you go inside, its a whole other story.  Their workers are extremely friendly and its always the same 2 older ladies that help you out.  They are very personable and provide excellent customer service.  The last few times here, I have gotten the Green Chile Double meal.  It's a huge double patty burger topped with both American and Monterey Jack cheese and green chiles.  That's it!  Simple and to the point. They cook the meat fresh when you order it and they also butter their buns.  I usually upsize the fries to large because they are pretty darn good.  They always salt them perfectly.  One of the best things about Whataburger is their option to have Spicy Ketchup.  Its ketchup hooked up with red jalapenos.  It's not burn your mouth hot, but it does provide a nice little zing to your tastebuds.  The stuff is addictive.  I've even threw some in my pocket to take home and eat with my burgers I make at home.  It's really tasty.  The only thing here that I have not been impressed with is their onion rings.  The breading is too \"puffy\" and the onions fell apart easily.  Not horrible, but their fries are way better and I wouldn't get the onion rings again.  I've had their breakfast a few times...only the Honey Butter Biscuit.  Fresh biscuit, chicken strip and honey butter.  It is freaking delicious!  Reason alone to stop.  Whataburger is really growing on me and I'm glad there are a few of them in AZ.  California could use some of these!"}
{"text":"So, I was helping my friend clean up some brush, and I was sweaty, hot and hungry.  What did I want to eat at 9:45am on a Saturday morning?  Yup....Whataburger!  This one was located pretty close to her house so I decided to hit it up.  This may be one of the older Whataburgers in Phoenix.  The signage and inside of it seemed a bit old school.  I went with their Sweet and Spicy Bacon Burger combo.  I really only get 2 things at Whataburger...the Green Chile Double and then this burger when its available.  This thing is great!  It comes with 2 huge patties (Whataburger patties are some of the biggest patties in the fast food industry...and that is a good thing!), American and Monterey Jack cheese, grilled onions, bacon, mustard and a sweet and spicy pepper sauce.  This thing is delicious!  While my other favorite, the Green Chile Double, is pretty simple and straightforward with its approach, this burger blends a bunch of different flavors all into one.  The sweet and spicy pepper sauce is delicious!  Not even really \"spicy\", but it has a pepper kick to it.  Like a cross between a jazzed up bbq/teriyaki type sauce.  It's really tasty!  The meat, cheese, bacon, onions, mustard and sauce all play well together and make it a really enjoyable burger.  I wish they would carry it all the time!  Also, their fries are salted very well, and there is no better condiment to dip them in than the Whataburger spicy ketchup!  So damn good....worth coming here alone.  That spicy ketchup is the shizz!  Washed everything down with a Coke!   Overall, it was a very good brunch!  Whataburgers are pretty consistent for the most part.  This one was a bit shy of 5 star worthy because of two things.  1.  The guy who brought out my food, mishandled my tray and knocked over my fries.  They went spilling onto the table and he blurted out, \"I hate when that happens.\"  Yeah, me too buddy lol.  No big deal since only like 2 or 3 fell on the floor, but still.  How hard is it to place down a tray on a flat surface?  And, the bun of my burger seemed a bit stale like it was approaching its expiration date.  Not inedible stale, but I have had way fresher buns at all my other Whataburgers I have been to before.  Anyways.....2 little nit picky things, but I would still come back.  It's right off the 17 freeway and they are open 24-7."}
{"text":"After leaving my Yucca Tap Room, I wanted some grub.  Whataburger is always tasty, always open, and always reliable.  I decided to stop here for a burger and fries before my drive home.   I went with my old standby of a Green Chile Double and a Large Fries with a bunch of packets of spicy ketchup. I always enjoy a Green Chile Double....definitely one of my favorite fast food burgers.  Can't beat the buttery buns, huge, freshly cooked patties, tons of melted cheese and a nice amount of green chiles.  It really is a great burger!  Fries were nice and crispy and the spicy ketchup is the best!  Service at the drive thru was friendly and prompt.  I would not hesitate to come back!  Always a great burger and fries at Whataburger!"}
{"text":"Of all of the Whataburger restaurants, I've been to this one is my favorite. The booths are a little wider and the A/C is always cold. I usually opt chicken strip dinner because I love the sausage gravy and toast that it comes with. Also, don't forget to get a shake because they are huge here. The staff is usually friendly and my only issue is can get crowded at lunchtime and if you're coming from the East on McDowell it can be tricky to get into. I definitely will be back when I visit the hospital down the road."}
{"text":"OK, it's been a while since I had a fast food burger, but it was moving day for my lovely daughter Whitney, yesterday. The menu selection for moving day lunch is \"bag of burgers\" for the moving crew, of which I was a part. If you are going to do chain, drive through burgers, you can do far worse than Whataburger (I mean you MickieD, and you too, Burger King!). I like the fact that Whataburger toasts the buns and smears on a little butter flavored...something, grease, oil, lard...I have no idea, but it adds to the taste and doesn't make me ill, so thumbs up! They don't get the order wrong any more often than any other drive through place, and when they do, they have remade the order without attitude, so that's nice. Over the years, I have tried a couple of other things on their menu, and they do a pretty good job with a chicken sandwich and sausage biscuit from their breakfast menu. Again, far superior to some of their national competitors. Good for the moving day \"bag of burgers\", but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there (BTW, when is Lucky Boy going to put a place in Old Town Scottsdale?)."}
{"text":"5 stars because Michael S. was very personal and connected with me. Kudos to him for being positive at 4am and genuinely caring about his guests."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night with my boyfriend. He ordered a patty melt and the honey BBQ chicken strip sandwich meal and I ordered a burger and the 6 piece chicken bites. Most places skimp on the sauce packets, but here the sauce packets were huge! More than enough for the chicken that I got. The chicken itself was a bit crunchy.... probably give them 3/5 stars. The sandwich.... more than likely the reason you came here.... is huge. For $3 it was as big as my hand and fully packed with a delicious patty, lettuce, tomato, and sauce (no onions due to allergies) Go to McDonald's and get a quarter pounder. It will be smaller, more expensive, and less tasty than this. It was a little salty tho. All our food arrived hot and delicious. The minus one star is because the service was slightly eh.... could've been faster, But they did get me tea from the drive thru when the one in the store was out.... Oh... the pattymelt is amazing. Just saying."}
{"text":"Came here late on a Friday night. Ordered a patty melt with no onions and a chicken tender honey bbq sandwich for the goofball and I got a double meat whataburger with  avocado. Total came out to around $18 and I was given a bag with three individual paper bags with three huge sandwiches. The food was consumed with a smile and all the food was prepared correctly including the no onions request  While these burgers are a bit expensive they are definitely quality."}
{"text":"Staff here seem to be well managed. Recently had a mistake with my order and the manager took care of it right away. No hesitation and did it all with a great attitude. Some of my worst experiences have been with fast food places so it's refreshing and reassuring when I find a place that I enjoy going to. Good food AND good service is a great thing no matter where is comes from."}
{"text":"Patty Melt is the item I most enjoy from this place. Used the drive thru and we were in and out in no time.  Hope to have a whataburger in Los Angeles County in the future. Until then only when in Arizona"}
{"text":"Best Patty Melt I have ever had at a fast food chain.  Stopped by on my way out of Phoenix before hitting the road and ordered a double bacon cheeseburger and a patty melt on Texas Toast.  A few hours later while at a rest stop had the double cheeseburger and it was good. But to me the patty melt is where it's at.  Check them out for the Patty Melt not the Burger."}
{"text":"When you ask for extra ketchup that means more than one! I ordered a lot of hashbrown sticks and had one effing ketchup to use. Were they not thinking?? Worker lady, if you have more than one order of hash brown sticks and the customer asks for extra ketchup. Please put two and two together and give me more than one ketchup! Not that hard... I have never posted a review and I'm just tired of this lady not comprehending my requests. Good grief."}
{"text":"I love this place friendliest managers ever I love the breakfast they are super quick and always smiling fast food with a 5 star restaurant service and a like home feeling"}
{"text":"I feel like there's always something wrong with this place it's the closest to my house and there not another near by. So we came and it was closed due to construction okay came another night super slow! Then I come by and their drive thru is closed! So I go inside and see a guy wiping the windows down. Idk if it's their drive thru system not working but it's always something wrong with this place. Love the food tho but think Imma go elsewhere for burgers."}
{"text":"Um, yeah, not what I was expecting at all. Honestly, the meat patties where really thin. I'm glad I ordered a double because I woulda been like that old lady in the back-in-the-day Wendy's commercial: \"Where's the beef?\"."}
{"text":"Yummy food. They took our order quickly got the food alright. It looked clean even though it was very busy. I will be going back there when I can. I recommend this place if you want Whataburger"}
{"text":"I got the bacon avocado Burger taste really good fries are fresh service was fast just sucks that they were out of ketchup"}
{"text":"Great food, but best of all great service! After a long day of work I come home and turn on the game and this commercial comes on my tv, what do you know WHATABURGER! I haven't had it in so long even with it being down the street from me. So I decided I would give it a try after the commercial made there new green chile burger appear so amazing. I walk in and I am greeted by the lovely most nicest person Lynn! She was so sweet and even waited our tables and gave us refills, not something you would expect from a fast food chain but it's service like this that will make me be back! And the burger was good but next time I will try the BBQ chicken burger!"}
{"text":"What a burger is a great place to eat at for fast food. However this locations managers are terrible lady by the name of Alyssa (night manager) gave the worse service I've ever experienced at any place ever! Employee would ask her specific things about a burger and she repeatedly yelled at them saying \"I'm busy taking orders\" she wouldn't answer any of the girls questions. I will not be visiting this location Any more because of this lady. To Whataburger itself you guys need to check your managers before they run into the wrong customers with a worse attitude then Alyssa and get into trouble, I mean your not in a good area, just saying."}
{"text":"Compared to In-N-Out, Whataburger definitely tosses more food at you. The double burger is a solid 150% as big as the equivalent at I&O, although you do pay a little extra dough for that extra beef (or mystery meat, however you prefer to think of it).  I still don't like the fries. But they made up for it by actually pushing in the buttons on our drinks to indicate which was Coke and which was root beer! I don't believe anyone else has ever done that for me, and it felt special."}
{"text":"Poor service at Drive Thru.  Fries and onion rings were ice cold by the time I got them home 5 minutes later.  Received argument from staff about getting honey mustard when I spent over $20 on lunch order for office staff.  Don't go here IMO."}
{"text":"Despite it being a common topic of discussion on yelp, reviewing a fast food chain is quite useful. Sure the food and prices will be pretty much the same at all locations, but the employees, service, the environment, and other quality issues will vary greatly. The staff at this whataburger are very nice and competent. My only criticism is that sometimes my chocolate malt is not mixed all the way and I get my first strawfull of nothing but chocolate malt sauce. However, this is a hand mixed shake which is a rare luxury in fast food nowadays, and I am receiving 32 ounces of chocolate malt for around 3 dollars and 50   cents. That's about twice as much as you get for the same price anywhere else. Can't beat that. Plus, if you only get a beverage or fries and there is a line in the drive thru, you'll often get to pull up into Lane B, which is shaded and you won't have to wait for the suv full of screaming teenagers or the van with 5 blue collar dudes ordering $14 dollars worth of food EACH. They'll bring it it to you, collect your money, and on your way you go."}
{"text":"A lot of my Midwest friends rave about how good their burgers are, being from California I've never had the opportunity to try one, until today.  Immediately I noticed the size of the bun, this thing is huge! I enjoyed the burger and fresh ingredients, the bacon and jalape√±o added a great touch to the burger. I guess I'm spoiled in California with options such as habitat burger and burger city , i would not say this burger is better than In-n-Out or Fatburger , sorry friends.   Customer service was nice, I liked how the cashier comes to your table with all the different sauces you can have. Tried the spicy ketchup, has a nice mini-sized kick too it."}
{"text":"Never been and decided to try it out. Holy WOW the burger was much larger than anything I have ever ordered. I will definetly be going back to this joint."}
{"text":"Whataburger is my first lunch stop in Arizona everytime I come in from California for Spring Training. It's always delicious! Wish they had Whataburger in California!"}
{"text":"These are greasy burgers wrapped up in paper that reminds me of \"Dick's\" Old Fashioned Burgers back in Seattle.  I do like that they also give you the little ketchup dipping containers instead of ketchup packets.  Much easier when doing drive thru.  I had the green chile burger most recently and it was very cheesey and tastey.  It was hot, the cheese was all melted and it wasn't drenched in a bunch of sauce.  Sometimes the drive thru here will take a while, but it's worth it.  Their fries aren't anything special but not bad either."}
{"text":"Mmmmm Green Chile double cheese burger.  So good.  I love the fries here too.  Probably some of the best fast food fries around.  I love how the cheese on the burgers is melted on and it's hot, unlike some burger places.  Delicious.  The drive thru had a bit of a wait the last time I came here though."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and approachable at this location. We decided to eat inside and they brought over our order to our table when it was ready. Great service!  The original Whataburger and Patty Melt are my favorite. When I treat myself, I order the strawberry shake. I'd recommend the shake over the malt because the latter is a lot sweeter.  You can add Jalepenos for 50 cents to Whataburger which is the same as their #4 (Jalepeno and Cheese Whataburger) without the cheese. This is my usual order because it's slightly cheaper and healthier (as healthy as fast food can be) without cheese."}
{"text":"Decent place, I've only come here past midnight at least a dozen times. This location is across the street from a Quiktrip. The employees are generally nice and the food is decent. It never seems to get really busy here, but it is a bit slower than your typical McDonald's/BK drive-thru experience."}
{"text":"Just your standard Whataburger. It's alright but nothing special. I'd round up to 4 stars because they're 24/7."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries with the drive through open all nite. Really lives up to it's name. Surprising to me was they serve breakfast. Very delicious breakfast. Gravy and biscuits. Nuff said. Excellent."}
{"text":"Great on the go! Milkshakes are amazing, burgers fantastic, and price no my bad.  This is the best alternative when Chic-fil-a is closed and you can't take another day at McDonalds. Change it up.  Service is slower, but still amazing grub!"}
{"text":"This is NOT a bacon, egg and cheese biscuit. That's sausage! I had to wait 10 minutes for it, you'd think they could get it right."}
{"text":"Very good business just a little slow with the drive threw but it's okay the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Went to pick up,lunch.  I come here all the time.  Always very clean and the customer service is outstanding!!  Much better than any other fast food place!"}
{"text":"I am from California and we don't  have this chain so when I saw the name I had to try it. My daughter and I had the burger and fries, it was very good. My son had the chicken strips and loved it.   Overall my family really enjoyed it the food was good and swerive was good."}
{"text":"Hadn't been in a Whataburger in so many years I'd forgotten what it was like. Uh, now I remember. Dry, cooked-to-death patties on a hamburger bun that was oddly way larger than the meat, forgettable toppings, overall lack of flavor. Lots of good options out there for a fast-food burger - this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Places like this is affected by the quality of the people it employs.  This location, in the last four visits i have made, has always been excellent in service and quality of the food. I should have paid more attention to the name of the front person. She is polite, attentive, and very hard working. They're lucky to have her. My chicken sandwich was excellent all around. My onion rings scrumptious with ranch dressing. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Came to eat at 7pm on Friday. Excellent customer service and quality food. Clean restaurant - will be back when I'm in this area again."}
{"text":"Good service kind always fresh never any problems during the day or at night usually places open 24 hr u avoid them after 10pm never had to worry about that at this location. Lived around the area for ever. Only place I goto from 12am to 5am in the area"}
{"text":"Nasty!  I don't know how people eat here. I ordered the green chile burger and it was tasteless!  How can green chile have no flavor??  None...not even a hint of green chile flavor.  The hamburger itself was gray, tasteless.  The only thing good on the burger was the cheese and it wasn't even melted.  I don't know how they are still in business because it was disgusting.  I would never eat here again.  Not even if I was starving."}
{"text":"Love their Pancakes, orange juice and chicken sandwich!"}
{"text":"Worst customer experience at a whataburger ever for me. Not only once but 4 Times... I gave his place a 2nd 3rd and 4th chance to get it right and least I can say is I'll never stop here again. All 4 visits I informed the drive thru worker I am allergic to pickles. All 4 visits I got home with pickles on my burger. Very disappointing as I called after I got home and didn't even get an apology for my time and money wasted. Poor service. Whataburger is the bomb.com but not this location."}
{"text":"Currently sitting in the drive thru. I'm going on 20 min so get a jr bacon cheeseburger. I'm not even at the window yet. I'm stuck here behind a Yukon and I can't even leave. I'll never be coming here again.... also $11 for two things"}
{"text":"I really love their burgers but every time I come the fries suck and the container is not full. The fries are barely warm and sometimes too hard. It's getting annoying... great customer service tho."}
{"text":"Love me some Whataburger!!  We don't have them in my part of the country, so when in AZ, gotta grab a burger!!  Love being able to add green chilis to, well, EVERYTHING!!  Been to this location a few times.  Inside the joint there is plenty of tables for dining, clean, spacious, and someone is around every few minutes cleaning up.  Usually go through the car line, our meal has been right EVERY time.  We have even orders single items, and the ordering clerk has coupled them together into a \"meal\" so we can get a \"deal\".  Thank you for that!!  Their to-go bags are thick, and don't allow for spillage or rips.  They give ample cutlery, napkins, and condiments.  The employees are always easy to hear and understand, and are very welcoming!!  I really appreciate this location!!  See you guys in a few months!!"}
{"text":"I am ashamed to be reviewing a fast-food joint but I love me some Whataburger. Specifically the #8 with a Coke. Two chicken fingers, small fries, Texas toast and white gravy. It is the only thing I ever eat here with the exception of their soft-baked chocolate cookies. Does that not sound like the dream meal to you? Well, it is to me! Yeah, it stinks waiting in line but I can't complain that they make your food fresh to order. Seriously though, W, do we need that much soda with the meals?????"}
{"text":"Won't be eating here again service was extremely slow out of drinks the girl behind the counter actually smelled bad decided not to even bother eating there ,gave my food to a homeless person probably the worst service I've ever seen it this location"}
{"text":"It was 1am on my way to Tucson and it was either this or mcdonalds, i went with the hype of wanting to try this random looking place out and let's say I regret not getting the 20 pc chicken nugget @ Mcds. This place was saltier than the pacific ocean. Also the man charging was handling money and food at the same time. whataburger *sad tone*"}
{"text":"I come here a lot and it's good. This review is of my last visit. They got my order totally wrong. 555628 on 9-8. I tried calling the restaurant, rang for 10 min then hang up on me. Called the corporate 1-800. Same thing. Wow."}
{"text":"I really liked the staff here, but the facility is substandard (cramped, bad seating, no bathroom inside), and it seems to attract unnerving customers."}
{"text":"I love what a burger and will keep coming back for the food. BUT i just went through the drive thru and getting a large fanta and they didn't even fill it up all the way. Not even like I'm being whiney like its missing a good quarter of soda if two people are sharing like we are. I told my boyfriend to hand it back and ask to fill up the actual cup and the guy said \"I can't fill it up all the way because it's a large\" that response doesn't even make sense.. So i ended up having to get out of the car and use the self service which defeats this purpose of going through the drive thru in the first place. Dumb"}
{"text":"Beyond underwhelming. Burger just tasted like mustard and wasn't even served hot. Fries were even more bland, just rectangles of cold potato. I'd honestly pick any other fast food joint before eating this again. The one good part of the meal was the Coke. Whatafail."}
{"text":"When it comes to burgers offered by major chains, Whataburger's tends to be among the better tasting.  Whataburger might not have as varied a menu as some of their contemporaries but what they do offer is typically done well.  But while the food itself is okay enough, there were some things I noticed on my most recent visit to this location.  The manager was joking around with some other employees and engaging in some conversation that didn't seem quite \"workplace appropriate\".  I'm all for having fun on the job and keeping things fun and friendly but at the same time when you work at a place where you can be overheard by customers and the customers could potentially be of any possible age, background, or sensitivity you need to be much more careful.  I sat back at the corner table and I couldn't help but notice both walls there seemed to have some odd smudges on them.  The waitresses bring everything to your table and check up on you periodically which walks a very fine line between friendly service and possibly intrusive and annoying.  Still I did appreciate someone actually being right on top of taking my tray and clearing off my table as I was finished.  Like most other businesses, their prices have inflated and where ten years or so ago I would have been more apt to call them one of the better priced/valued burger places, I can't say the same in 2015."}
{"text":"So I used the drive through and was over charged oh surprise and had ordered two meals when asked about catsup I told them what I wanted and got 3 catsups. Is the catsup at wataburger coming from employee pay or what the hell. Quit being so stingy on every little thing if you charge for it put it on the damn sandwich. So annoyed I know it's fast food but what the hell. The drive through little girl was rude as hell too and practically threw my food bag in my face and shit the door to the drive through. If you eat at this location go in so you can make sure your order is right and can get whatever you need because customer service for drive through is nonexistent."}
{"text":"Burnt old dried up meat on my patty melt! Cold soggy frys! Yet the service is still slower then molasses! Drinks were flat! Last but least forgot one of our burgers! Then when I came back made me order it again because he swears he put it in the bag.. last time I come to this whataburger! Oh yeah and I paid for honey mustard, ask if it was in the bag when I received the food. He said yes, I drove off and it wasn't. Only reason I ate any of this is because #1 I paid for it, #2 Im hungry, #3 whataburger is one of my fave spots and my friend had never had it, #4 just got don't partying and we needed our grease fix."}
{"text":"I know it's fast food, but the manager was the most rude human being I've ever met in my life."}
{"text":"This place is basically a Wendy's having a bastard child with a Burger King, and then that bastard child having a child with a Carl's Junior. It was ok."}
{"text":"First, there are no bathrooms inside and the parking lot is really small. We waited at the counter for several minutes before the lady finally came out to take our order. Having never been to whatburger, I was excited to try it. While we waited for our food we tried the tea, which was spoiled (aka not fresh, for those of you who don't know UN refrigerated sweet tea goes bad in about 4 hours). The food came out fast, but the onion rings looked burnt and the bread on our burgers cracked like they were old/on their way out. My husband got the chicken. While he said it was cooked well, it left the after taste of a place that hasn't cleaned their oil pit in quite a bit. The fries were good. It was cheap. $21 for three meals. To sum up, I won't be back. Whataburger was more like what-a-disappointment."}
{"text":"Always fresh hot burgers! Also great buscuits and gravy! Karla rocks great smile and customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Whataburger is what it is. Every time I don't check the meal I was given I find out when I get home that they missed something I paid for.  The avocado bacon burger is delicious I'll probably go back soon and get another one, but this I'll check to make sure what I ordered is all accounted for."}
{"text":"Whataburger was very Yummy!! Service was great and the food came out Hot and cooked just right!! They have spicy Ketchup and Regular Ketchup."}
{"text":"Fast food breakfast done right here.  Pancakes are actually made to order, with real batter on a real griddle.  No microwave flapjacks here.  Taquitos not bad either, and biscuits are above average too.  Friendly staff to bring out the food.  Teens working the counter seemed a bit goofy though."}
{"text":"Old school seating is well preserved at this location, and the breakfasts are still among the best for fast food - pancakes made fresh on the griddle and not microwaved like other places.  Staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"For fast breakfast, hard to beat - they actually make the pancakes with batter and a hot griddle (not some microwaved stuff like other fast food places).  Taquitos are fairly decent too, and the eggs on the biscuit sandwiches aren't perfectly square or round (McDonalds).  Nice, friendly service when they bring out the food to your table."}
{"text":"What?! Pancake batter on a griddle?  It is!  This isn't McDonald's.  They actually make your pancakes when you order them, which explains why they aren't uniformly shaped like the pre-made crap at the golden arches.  And gee, my egg on the biscuit sandwich is irregularly shaped as well - I wonder why.  As far as *fast food* breakfasts go, Whataburger is hard to beat.  Oh, and they bring the food to your table with a nice tray of condiments and such.  Friendly staff, cheap prices, what's not to like for a fast food breakfast?"}
{"text":"There was literally a fat lougie spit in my soda. I didn't do anything to deserve that shit."}
{"text":"Place sucks and is no way fast food. Went inside because I had a coupon and waited 15 minutes to get my order! Nothing better than waiting inside and watching six drive-thru orders get filled before yours. Also love how they charge, .85 for extra condiments! Young lady that took my order was really nice and best thing about this visit. Will drive extra distance to another location and try them out."}
{"text":"We were told to give this chain a try. And since we don't have any in California - we had to stop and give it a try before heading back to Cali.   Overall the burger was okay. Meat seemed too thin, almost like the bun over powered the meat and bacon.  We thought it tasted like a Dairy Queen burger.   The fried were good, the onion rings were very tasty. We all agreed for a fast food chain the onions rings were the best!  The spicy sweet and sour sauce was on hit! Along with the spicy ketchup.   We are glad we stopped and gave Whataburger a try."}
{"text":"So I've lived near this whataburger for 2yrs now and we frequent it late at night, and normally receive GREAT customer service, but tonight, we went, it was my fiance's birthday and he wanted Whataburger, so I took him there. We pulled up and began ordering our food, me and my fiance wanted a mushroom and swiss burger with lettuce and mayo, no aujus sauce, large fry, large sweet teas no ice, my brother wanted a number 5. The young man that was taking our order seemed to be having trouble taking it, he repeated our order correctly about 5-6 times, and on his final time repeating it, the manager ( Janaya) decided to jump on the headset and start incorrectly repeating oir order, when I tried to interrupt her to correct her errors she continued speaking over me, despite the fact that I said \"excuse me\" several times, so I raised my voice and said \"Hello?\" She shouted through the mic \"YOU DONT YELL AT ME!\" I replied \" I'm sorry, but you got the order wrong and I'm trying to tell you and your just continuing to speak over me. \" she then said again, \"YOU DON'T NEED TO YELL AT ME! YOU KNOW WHAT? NO, HAVE A GOOD NIGHT!\"  and ignored me, she refused to serve us our food, and then we were stuck waiting in the drive through for 10-15 minutes just to get horrible service and no food. As much as we love whataburger, this will unfortunately be our last visit. I'd rather spend my money at the Jack In The Box down the road where the customer service is on par to what this whataburger used to be like. Don't waste your time at this Whataburger, and if you need it, go to a different location. Whataburger, your managers need to check their attitude at the door when they come in to work, as they are a representation of your company, sadly that did not happen tonight."}
{"text":"A good fast food burger - simple and lots of meat. I always stop by to get one when I am in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I feel like such a loser posting a review on a fast food place but after last night, I have to.  It was very late, around 3:45am but I really wanted some Whataburger fries and that ketchup (that I  and is like no other) so I go inside since their drive thru always takes so long.  There wasn't a single person in the dining area and only one person in the drive thru line...I walk up with a smile and that must have pissed her off.  She walks up and knowing most order combos and multiple items I said \"actually, I just need a large order of fries please\" to which she sarcastically replied \"ACTUALLY, it's gonna be a few minutes if you want to wait\" I said \"sure I'll wait\" and the bitch said \"well it's gonna be more like fifteen minutes..at LEAST\" and that was IT!  She just walked away!!!  I was shocked at the level of cuntiness.  What a rude bitch!  It's not my fault she's a human garbage bag.  There was NO need to have such a massive attitude with me.  And let's address the at least fifteen minutes for French fries.  Since when does it take \"at least\" that long??  Since never!  It always seems like I wait AT LEAST fifteen minutes every Whataburger trip because they are always slow, but it's not because of the fries.  That girl does NOT need to be working with the public.  Maybe she should try working in a stock room somewhere or something. Terrible people skills."}
{"text":"Stay away from that expensive Green Chili Double Meat burger.  NASTY!!!  I tried one yesterday.  All it was was two patties, some kind of white cheese, and a gross, funky type green chili pesto spread.  Awful.  I actually though it would come with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, etc with green chili's.  WRONG.  However, walk-in service was fast and friendly.  I may try this place again for the regular Whataburgers."}
{"text":"WAS expecting the deliciousness of In-N-Out times two plus the options of Five Guys.... NOPE. Pretty much glorified cafeteria food. Hard store-bought bun, white iceburg lettuce, and limp pickles.  No unusual hamburger combos (like blue cheese, arugula, etc). No juicy beef patty. No fresh, ripe ingredients. No like!  Plus the sodium on their fries is enough to cause a person to contract acute pitting edema :)  Why all the hype??"}
{"text":"Customer service was great. Didn't catch the guys name but he had a sincere smile. Told me to enter lane B and why. He was kind enough to tell me where I could get the hot ketchup from."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm a fan, always have been always will be. This location is the closest to my home which in honesty isn't that close and the area is not so great. This is a smaller Whataburger but it's always clean, usually full and staff has always been really nice. The restroom was clean at this visit, our food was made exactly how we ordered, I wish there was one closer to my home though. But like I said I'm a fan... so I'll travel that extra mile."}
{"text":"Whataburger is the best of the fast food burgers.  Maybe because regional not national?  Who knows but they make a pretty good burger pretty fast.   They also don't go nutsvover special requests.   This location also has a terrific postervof Barry Goldwater."}
{"text":"We walked in at a busy time and they were going down in flames ,,, every order seemed to be coming back to the counter with some sort of complaint that needed \"fixed\" .Despite our misgivings , we ordered . Our order came out perfectly prepared , so we were lucky . I tried the Sweet & Spicy bacon cheese burger... it was huge & double cheese but had a fistful of coarse diced raw onions that I thought was a bit excessive. My husband like his mushroom Swiss burger , he said it tasted like \"beef stroganoff\" in burger form. We also sampled a fish sandwich. We really liked the cornmeal breading but felt it was drenched in mediocre tartar sauce , so I would skip that next time, but we would return for sure . Just for the onion rings alone...."}
{"text":"The 1st time I ate here. My friends chicken strips tasted like sausage. The strips were replaced with chicken tasting chicken. The second time, they omitted the guacamole that I ordered. They gave me guacamole in a small paper cup. The third time I ordered large onion rings and got fries. Complained and got medium onion rings. My friend noticed that I got the wrong size. So I called the manager back. The manager thought it was a complicated order. Really, a complicated fast food order that you read off a screen. Got my large onion rings and the manager they us two free meals for the next time. The next visit was fine. Went back on 03/25/2014 and the order was fine. Then at about 6:30 PM that day I got a call from a manager. I told him the two times after the 1st three were fine. He had the audacity to falsely accuse me of trying to make him look bad. I have never had issues at a Whataburger before. I will go back to other Whataburgers. But not that Whataburger. Next time I will spend more money. For better service at Giant Burger that is in the same mall."}
{"text":"Get the Whataburger as is and the onion rings are a little sweet but good."}
{"text":"Writing a review of a chain restaurant is like staring at the sun during an eclipse: it sounds like a good idea at the time, but...   This is the first Whataburger I ever went to in my life and each time I've been since it's either been a nightmare or a pleasant experience. It makes me feel like that ping pong ball in Priscilla: Queen of the Desert. Well, not *exactly* like that. This one time, after Charlie's, Robert M and I stopped by here to sober up a little in the drive-though. I ordered the chicken tenders because I wasn't eating red meat at the time. We brought our order home, I put vodka in my soda and started eating. You know that drunk delay you have? Well, I ate a whole chicken tender before I realized it was raw in the middle! Don't worry; I survived. Then this past weekend I went for a breakfast bacon sandwich and everything was perfectly cooked. And the service was splendid.   I'm certain if I keep coming back and they maintain this level of good food and service, I'll update with a higher rating. But, for now, I'm still tasting that raw chicken in the back of my throat. That, and they don't take reservations. So, there you go, so."}
{"text":"JD was an amazing person. I had to wait for my chicken strips and he made the time go by fast. He had a great personality. Thank you for making my experience great! Food bomb like always :)"}
{"text":"I come to this location a lot because it is close to my school. Nice, quick, yummy bit before school starts. I am a loyal whataburger eater and tend to just get a burger and fries. Occasionally, I have had problems with my order but I call and they quickly fix the situation."}
{"text":"Me? Eat at a franchised burger joint?  Not many Whataburger left in Phoenix.  Out of all the franchised places this is the one I enjoy. Everyone is always nice. I am not speaking of just this one but all I have eaten at. I ate at them years ago in Phoenix. Then I started working in El Paso Texas. They are many there and I liked their burger. Maybe because they don't put a special sauce on it. They come with mustard just the way I would fix it if I was at home. Nice large tomato and lettuce.  The personal touch is they deliver it to your table along with any condiment you may want.  Always a smile when you order and when it is delivered to your table. OH! And most times when I leave I get an invite back and have a good day.  Whataburger wants your business and acts like it.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"For a fast food burger place this is my favorite. I like the fact that they don't load your burger with special sauce. Mustard is their spread of choice and this is how I like my burger. No special sauce or ketchup. The places are always clean, the people friendly. You make your order and it is delivered to your table. I do like the favor of their burger with green chilis.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"2747 E Broadway Rd, Mesa, AZ 85204 Great Location to go to. Every time I come here, Jennifer is super Awesome to deal with. The Head Manager is just great he shakes everybody's hand. Makes everybody feel welcome.   If you ever have trouble at this location they will fix it right away."}
{"text":"As a child my uncle use to bring me a Whataburger in New Mexico. I remember them being so large and crammed with tons of fixins. Not anymore! In fact, I took one bite and might as well have bit into a salt rock. I gave the rest to the dog. It was so unbelievably aweful. All I wanted was a taste of my childhood and what I got was a mouth full of artificial sodium. Does that mean my childhood was salty (grrr!) or bloated (bloated - ugh!) ... I guess one might say not to place childhood emphasis on a burger."}
{"text":"Someone before me wrote \"You get what you pay for\" meaning that this place isnt cheap but the quality is really good. I can only agree on that it isnt cheap......  I tried a big bacon/cheese burger with jalepenos, fries and the whatachicken thats like chicken tenders/nuggets.   First of all the burger did not look very nice and had more of the \"Five Guys\" scruffy sadburger look but without the \"FG\" taste to it.  The fries where soft and the chicken tenders where tto big with a thick layer of breading and superdry in the meat.   I would say this was one of my lowpoints when it comes to american burger places having tested In n out, Fatburger, The Counter, Wendys, Sonic, Jack in the box, Five Guys, Hodads etc etc.......  The price is not very good for the quality with a meal price for burger, fries and soda at around 10 $. I would take my money and go to In N Out for a cheaper juicy quality burger but maybe thats just me......."}
{"text":"Time to see what all the hype is about. If you're from California, you've probably have never heard of this burger. However, if you've been to AZ or Texas this is just as big as In-n-out. However, while tasty and a huge giant in the burger scene.. The Double Double still reigns supreme in the burger category.   *Priced liked a 5guys, add-on toppings like Fat-Burger, looks like a Mcdonalds Burger, and taste somewhat like a Double double from In-n-out. Love that you can add Avocado on your burger...   *I was actually really impressed with the quality of this burger. It was extremely hyped from all of my homies who have tried or are from the Lone Star state and I was super excited to try it for myself.   *The fries/onion rings were horrible and I wasn't a fan of their one super-size foam cups either. Their table side service also reminded me of 1990's Carls. jr.   **Big fan of the burger though for $8.50 for the burger I ordered it's just not worth it when I can get a Double Double for about 1/2 of that and be just as satisfied.   ***If I were to rank the burger joints it would be...  In-n-out, Mickey D's, Whataburger, 5guys, and Shack Shake dead fuckin' last...."}
{"text":"Great tasting bacon cheese burger. The fries came fresh out of the fryer. Happy the don't salt your fries for you. Staff was friendly and they bring your food to you along with condiments you may want and need. Like spicy ketchup"}
{"text":"I really like Whattaburger. Their regular-size burger is great if you want one the size of a bread and butter plate (and occadionally I do ).  Salad only goes so far sometimes, but their salads are a delicous value too.   Their employees are always friendly and responsive and make your order right, even if there is a mismade burger. The store on McDowell in Midtown Phoenix is equally good, but the 90th Street location is a lot closer to home.  A former coworker who hales from New Mexico, got me into their burgers with green chillies, mustard and pickle. Try it, it's great.  The true mark of excellence in a burger joint is their onion rings (ORs). If those are awesome, the rest of the food follows. Whattaburger serves quality ORs.   Do ask for the spicey ketchup, which tops nearly anything off well here."}
{"text":"I went here this morning and wanted to just get a quick jalepeno cheeseburger meal. Only two cars in front in the drive thru so i thought it would be quick. After 15 minutes of waiting i finally got to the window, a little upset that i had to wait so long, but i get it, sometimes things happen in the store i am not aware of and it delays orders. As i reach out my car window to give the man my payment, he said no charge and apologized for the wait. I really appreciated that when i did not expect nor did i ask for it to be free. So i just want to give a shout out to this whataburger."}
{"text":"Nice and clean fast-food place that serves full breakfast. Good biscuits and gravy at fast food price and speed. Staff was friendly and dining area super clean."}
{"text":"For reals whatabuger?!  This is what you call Texas toast?  This is not Texas toast at all...  only reason I go to whataburger is because they have a buffalo ranch chicken strip sandwich... fries were fresh and the chocolate shake was delicious"}
