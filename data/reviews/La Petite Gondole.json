{"text":"So far I've only tried their smoked meat and was impressed. It is the only place that I know of that serves authentic Montreal style halal smoked meat. The meat had a little more fat than my personal preference but the flavor was all there. Looking forward to trying some of their other menu items, will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place with its halal sandwiches and its location in a strip mall plaza on the east end of Montreal gave me a very Scarborough vibe. 

If you're in Montreal, and you are looking for halal smoked meat and you can't bring yourself to eat at Schwartz's, definitely make a trip to La Petite Gondole! We come every time we are in Montreal. 

Plenty of parking in the plaza, comfortable eating booths, friendly service by the bearded brothers (at least one of them is fluent in English!), delicious poutine and hefty sandwiches -- it might just remind you of home, even 600 km away. :)"}
{"text":"My last visit at this location was over a year ago .. Since their renovation the place looks very nice even the dining has been reduced due to new maroccan type sweets and pastries... Their smoked is very very good and worth the drive if you want hallal smoked meat ! Well seasoned but slightly fat ! The meat is prepared at their location it is seasoned and steamed for over 10 hours ! Really woawww, we also ordered a steak peperoni submarine and it was delicious ! I would call la petite gondole the Hallal belle province :)!"}
{"text":"Good halal food and made fresh when you order it. The workers speak mostly French but we were able to get what we needed. Got a huge order of poutine which was really delicious. Also tried the smoked meat sandwich and the club sandwich which were both quite tasty. One morning they also made us a nice cappuccino which was surprisingly good as well. Definitely would return if I was in the area."}
