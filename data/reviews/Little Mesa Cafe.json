{"text":"I am a native of Mesa Arizona! This used to be one of my dad's favorite little restaurant... I was hoping that I would feel the same way about it today! Unfortunately that is not the case, the workers seem to be in a bad mood not happy to be there... The food was just OK at best... So sad"}
{"text":"Our family eats at the Little Mesa Cafe several times a week.  A quiet cozy place with friendly employees and delicious food.
  
It is very clean restaurant but I hope one day they can redo the interior because it needs an update.  Anyways, take the time to dine here!"}
{"text":"I ordered a BLT on rye.  When it arrived it even looked unappetizing.  I sent it back and the replacement was not much better.  This time the bacon was only overlooked and dry, instead of actually burned.  The bread wasn't replaced, and was dried out.  The 2 slim slices of tomato were, well,ugly.

I understand their ad for new cooks and wish them well.  The services was also ho-hum."}
{"text":"I'm very sorry to have to give this restaurant only two stars because I'm a long time customer and notice that this restaurant has gone seriously down hill. First off, the decor is so old and the dining room is so dirty and worn that it really makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like. The carpet looks like it hasn't been cleaned in 20 years. Ends of booths are completely off and the wood exposed and the booths are in disrepair. Nothing's been dusted in probably the same 20 years.
That said....the food. I used to LOVE the food here, they used to have the BEST chicken and dumplings, home made soups and great fish fry.
The last few times I was there the food was terribly over salted and when I pointed this out several times (on different occasions) to the owner, she shrugged it off and said \"oh, they must have used too much base\" and she didn't offer to replace the order or take it off the bill or do anything about it. This has happened several times, with soups and gravies both. I was with several others and none of us could eat some of the food because it was so over salted, particularly the clam chowder (which we used to love) and the turkey gravy and chicken gravy.
The fish fry used to be the best in town but the last two times I was there, the fish was undercooked and made me queasy just to eat it. 

I will say that the home made pies are the BEST I've had here in Arizona but usually by the time you get there they're out of almost everything. 

The rest of the food is standard diner fare, but just a notch above Denny's (which isn't saying much at all).
The side salad is some lettuce in a bowl (usually chipped) and the plastic drink glasses are so old and worn that it's scary.

All that said...I will say that the servers are very nice, albeit slow sometimes. You have to know what section to sit in to get good service from the only one quick server they have who's really on the ball.

I'm really sorry to say that I think the owners have stopped caring and putting the love into this restaurant that made it so popular originally. It's really sad because they're good people and I'd love to continue to support this small, local Mom & Pop business instead of a chain restaurant, but unless they clean this place up and raise their food quality standards some, I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Why I even bothered to return to this mess hall for breakfast is beyond me.  First of all, I take back about what I said about their breakfast.  I ordered the country breakfast, two eggs, two sausages, 2 pieces of bacon and two pancakes.  The pancakes were horrid, they were so hard you can play baseball with them.  Needless to say, the help has turned into an I don't know what.  One of the waitresses apparently just gave birth, good, I am happy for her.  So the owner is waiting on tables.  Without warning, she approaches our table all giggly and laughing, \"Sara just had her baby.\"  Then she goes from table to table, \"Sara just had her baby, it's a girl, c-section.\"  Oh please.  First of all, I did not ask about a baby or someone's pregnancy or child birth.  I came to your diner to eat not to hear about some woman's labor and delivery experience.  Diner beware, the owner is nuts.  Most people do not want to hear about childbirth over a meal."}
{"text":"We used to receive several buy one get one free coupons with purchase of two beverages, but now they are just buy 1 get 1 half with two beverages. Their breakfast is tasty, but without the coupon a little pricey. We used our coupon for dinner once, but it was still way too expensive, and the food was just mediocre. The service was ok, but very dusty, and outdated decor. Has lots of potential though. Not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch & it will be the last time.  The food was very mediocre and  unattractive.  My husband had a hot roast beef sandwich & it was very bland. My salad was a little better."}
{"text":"Stopped into this little diner well I was waiting for my car to be tinted. That waitress know that I was kind of a picky eater and could not stomach grease. She assured me that the egg and steak breakfast came with a good steak. The steak was unseasoned and it appeared to be boiled with oil all over it. The potatoes on the side were greasy as well. It was one of the worst meals I have ever had in my entire life. On a positive note the waitresses were friendly, the coffee was excellent, and the bathrooms were very clean. It was simply poor quality food. Did not eat my food took it home to feed my dogs."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast/brunch and it was delicious! I had biscuits and gravy with a side of home fries and a cup of hot chocolate. 

The biscuits and gravy were better than other places I have been to. The biscuits were cooked and not moist or floury. The gravy was also scrumptious not too many spices just good. It had bit of sausage and was great!

The home fries were pieces of sliced potatoes and not greasy at all. They were excellent. 

The hot chocolate was also delicious. Sweet and creamy. 

Overall it was good!! No complaints here!"}
{"text":"If you call a plain egg \"omelette\" topped with straight out of the can chopped tomatoes a \"spanish omelette\" then eat here."}
{"text":"Good coffee , comfortable home feel setting eggs over easy perfectly done, pancakes are just amazing!!! 

Fast friendly service from Jen 


w lots of refills of Coffee."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about ten times and always had a good experience. The food was always above average, same with the service.

I'm trying to eat a reduced carb diet and they were always more than willing to substitute things to help keep me on my proper diet, never a hassle, always willing to accomodate me. 

This is becoming my most frequented restaurant in east Mesa."}
{"text":"Oh man where do I begin about his place. First off I received a coupon by mail and noticed how appealing the picture of the breakfast food looks on this coupon so it got my attention. That weekend I decided to go check it out. Pulling up the building looks old and when we went inside it was no different. The decor/people who ate and work there looks like something you would find along a middle of no where truck stop. When I entered the place it had a old musky smell. I tried to not let that bother me because I was there really wanting to try the appealing food that was shown on the coupon. The waitress right away sat us at our table, asked us for our drink order but literally took for ever for that women to give us our drinks and really couldn't understand why since there was hardly anyone there and there was a few ladies working. When we finally ordered and got our food I was really disappointed. The picture and the food they served us did not look alike. So I tried to enjoy it but the food had a funny taste to it so I ate half of my plate. I was still hungry so I ate my daughters leftover pancakes she didn't eat. That was good. I mean how wrong can you go with making pancakes. I was taking a bite and I noticed a hair cooked in the pancake from that point I got up and paid for my meal. I was so disgusted from that place I had to leave quickly. After we left I was so grossed out I had to wash my hand because my hands smelled like that place and I would gross out. I will never eat there again and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"i think this is one of those neighborhood haunts that is only appealing if you actually live in the neighborhood. i know. i have one of these places right around the corner from my house.

the decor was nice enough, if not a little dated. and the staff was okay, if not a little inexperienced. but the food quality wasn't good for the price. the kids meals are a horrible value, unless you like paying $4.39 for a handful of fries and five banquet brand chicken nuggets.

it's the kind of place that should serve breakfast all day but doesn't. they wouldn't allow up to use the entertainment book coupon on a holiday, which made the meal insanely overpriced. i dined with three other adults, and we all agreed that we would never go there again."}
{"text":"Great food and an old time atmosphere. You have to ask for sweetener for your coffee. They don't have it on the tables."}
{"text":"I had to double check the address to make sure this was the same restaurant that everyone talked so highly about .....   we tried it twice and on different days and times and we came away with the same review...way too expensive for the quality and quantity.  $15. for seafood platter that of course was taken out of the freezer bag and mixed vegs - same.  Limp fried potatoes to go with.   Mine was a horrible looking pork loin - flattened and covered with a coating that tasted quite fried.  Pork chop was ok.  but not worth the total price of $25. + tip.    This should be tagged $$ rather than $ unless you don't eat.
Back to Red Lobster!"}
{"text":"My husband and I like to support local/small business as much as possible.  However this place just didn't do it for us.  Awful service or better yet lack of! And the food was beyond greasy! I get the whole \"greasy spoon\" concept but my goodness this food was dripping with grease not to mention there was a freakin hair on my plate entangled in my food!!! Gross!!! The service lacked severely... We were seated pretty quick but then sat there for god knows how long and not even water was served to us much less anyone taking our order!!
You would think that with a hair being found in my food (yes they brought me a new dish) but as you can imagine my appetite was gone by then... And then the business still had the audacity to charge me for that plate!! Did they think I would honestly eat anything thy came from that kitchen?????  We will never go back !!! I'd pick Denny's over this place and that's saying a lot!!! Lol"}
{"text":"Love this place brings me back to my childhood in the 80's. Love the food, customer service and the price."}
{"text":"I like this homey cafe.  Service is good.  Food is good and if I don't like it I send it back and they are super nice about making right. It is comfortable for sitting and chatting because it is rarely crowded.  Good homemade desserts."}
{"text":"I tried this place 3x in a year time. 2x for breakfast 1x for lunch. It was horrible each time. I wont ever go here again. Yucko.
Food was nasty. The place is dusty and dirty. There is old decor. They have a plate collection on shelves above the tables and i noticed one of the shelf brackets had broken. Ready to fall any minute. I told the flighty waitress and she said, \"Wow, that is bad! I will have to tell the owners\". And she continued taking orders.
The place smelled like a dirty restroom. We noticed the smell as soon as we walked in. 
Also, many older people go here. So you have to deal with their snorting and clearing there nasal passages while your eating. Older people just dont seem to care where they pass gas or blow their nose. So we had to deal with the gross sights smells and sounds while we tried to eat our nasty food.
Oh, and the old rude german sounding cashier topped it off. She was snippy to the people checking out including me. She didnt even say thank you. And the display case up by the register was full of dusty handmade things that you may see sold at a flea market....in 1970.
I like to give places a fair chance. I gave this place 3 chances. And all were fails."}
{"text":"We were not greeted when we entered. There was a young man at the counter and he was preoccupied,  he aked if we wanted a table or booth. We replied a booth.  He said, if we could direct ourselves to that 1st booth, someone would be right with us.  We sat here for 5 minutes before a waitress came over. She was not the waitress for this section and overheard my husband say out loud when are we going to get service.  She came over and replied,  I am sorry, I had to take a phone order. Then brought us water. Then the actual waitress came over. I think she was as old as the decor. She did not seem friendly or helpful even after I stated this was our first visit here.  The patronage here all seemed to be the geriatric variety.  Now as the food goes, it's average.   Nothing special let me tell you!!! The Biscuits were fluffy but tasted like a mix, not fresh made. The chicken fried steak is pre-formatted and frozen, again not fresh prepared. The home fries were not chunky or cubed, they were smashed and fried. They had no flavor or texture. The sausage links were equal to what is served in hospital or buffet line. This was our 1st and last visit."}
{"text":"Cozy little café, nice waitress and food and coffee were hot. Mostly older crowd but not snobby."}
{"text":"I love Little Mesa Café. The food is like home cooking and the staff are like family. They have the best chicken and dumplings and breakfast here is amazing. I highly recommend that you bring your family and friends to dinner or breakfast here. It is hard to find food like this anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Exactly what a previous reviewer said. Interior dated (but clean). Kinda homey actually. Stopped in for breakfast and it was very good and perfectly cooked. The home fries were especially delicious. A quiet, comfortable place for breakfast with great service."}
{"text":"Doing some car shopping, my mom and I stopped here for breakfast. Looked like a cute little country home cooking spot. Nice quite homie atmosphere. They have handmade items like aprons and pot holders for sale by the door. Pretty much locals, everyone was on first name basis. So we got the out of towners glares. (We live in chandler too) place does have a musky smell. My mom wanted soup but the waitress said they only serve soup for lunch. We both ordered breakfast. The food was real home cooking but mediocre. A bit over priced for a small cafe. A local couple was seated next to our table (again on first name basis) and they ordered soup and no mention of the soup rule?  :-/ . My mom found floaties in her hot water for her hot tea and there was a staple on top of her pancakes. We tried waving down the waitress but she was too busy gossiping with the table by the door to even notice us. We got our check from the women at the register, paid and left. Cute looking, but won't be returning here. Or will not be recommending."}
{"text":"It's a bit of a time warp. Decor is rather 1970's. The service was friendly. Prices are reasonable. It's a casual, sit for a while kind of place. The regulars all seemed to order pie."}
{"text":"This is an old style cafe. The food is really good, as well as the prices. The ambience is that of grandma's! It's very friendly and cozy."}
{"text":"This review and the 5 stars is strictly for the food and the service.  The atmosphere is a little dated but it all appeared clean.  It's a small local cafe and we thought it was amazing.  Prices were very good too.

We were hoping to find a little diner with lots of home cooked food.  That's exactly what we found.  The soup of the day was hamburger - vegetable.  It was wonderful!  A different home made soup is served each day.  We're excited to try more of them.

We both ordered the hot roast beef sandwich.  The roast is cooked in-house and the potatoes were real!  Delicious.

Our server was friendly and excellent.  The only other thing I can say is that we will be back."}
{"text":"This place is a diner, and if you're expecting anything else you'll be disappointed.  But for a diner the food is fantastic!  I had the eggs and bacon with an english muffin. I ordered my eggs over very easy and they came out perfect.  The bacon was thick cut deliciousness.  My dad's girlfriend had the french toast and it looked amazing.  My dad had pancakes and let me try a bite - fluffy wonderfulness, in my opinion.  The orange juice is from concentrate, but again...it's a diner.  Please expect a diner and review as such.  Oh yeah....the price is right too.  About $25 for breakfast for three!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch because we had a coupon from the entertainment book.. They are very accommodating when you have allergies... The navy bean soup was very good, along with the club sandwich which was big and had lots of bacon.  They even have hot green tea and honey...due to my allergies I had the pancakes which were better than butters and butterfields in scottsdale....they do not use butter only margarine and they use soybean oil which is terrible for you.  They do crack all their own eggs rather than using a mix, but lots of canned foods and not healthy ingredients.  they make their own pies and will go back just for the pie...the prices are very good and inexpensive - coffee, tea and drinks are less than $2.00 and a full stack of very delicious pancakes are only $4.99....the place is outdated stuck in the 1970's...the waitress is very nice and the owner is a veteran....nice inexpensive place to grab a good bite to eat at a very reasonable price plus on Saturdays from 3-8 all entrees are buy one get one free.."}
{"text":"The little mesa hasn't let us down for breakfast. It is a family owned an operated place. The coffee has always been good.  Service has always been cheerfull and attentive. If you expect
canned smiles and fake. Take your self important attitude to the trendy places.come here for solid breakfasts from a family that is consistently on target with a welcome and a hot meal. As a tip.. always ask for blueberries on your pancakes it is worth the upcharge."}
{"text":"For lunch I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with swiss cheese and a side salad. The grilled cheese sandwich came out too greasy and the side salad was ice burg lettuce, some cabbage and croutons. No tomatoes, no cucumbers, nothing. I asked for ranch dressing and they DROWNED it. It was ranch soup with lettuce flavoring. I returned it and asked for ranch on the side. There was still too much ranch on the bottom meaning they didn't even rinse the bowl out. On the plus side the coffee is refilled and they did not charge me for the salad."}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant many times before, so when a freind recommended meeting here for breakfast today . . . I said great.  Not really sure what has happened . . . but this place has really gone down hill.

Service was a little slow . . . definitely could use more than three servers with a almost full restaurant.

Food took a little longer than I remembered . . . and when it arrived . . . it was missing a pancake . . . which my server told me would be coming, since they only made two and not three.  This was probably the only really good thing about the meal . . . becasue by the time the missing pancake arrive . . . I had finished the other, and it was nice to have a hot one.

Definitely not my first choice . . . but would return . . . if not in a hurry . . ."}
{"text":"This is the place you wanted to find the last time you did a road trip theouh Iowa or Kansas. Just plain good home cooking. A simple decor, friendly waitresses, and a good cup of joe when you need it. Prices are reasonable and the parking is plentiful. By the way they offer some cute gift item; yeah, very reminiscent of the Midwest."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the food isn't bad, service is ok. Last time we went was a better trip, dunno if we will come back again. If your gonna eat here better to have a coupon just to try the place out paying less than you would have by just stopping by."}
{"text":"Everything about this place screams Robert Irvine come help. We walked in and were hit with the dated decor and peeling wallpaper. The waitress forgot our order for coffee and coke ( they only had R.C.). The food was mediocre at best I had to send back my eggs because the whites were runny ,(at least they were real eggs). We won't be coming back but do give them point for kitsch."}
{"text":"The best chicken and dumplings anywhere - absolutely anywhere!!  Friendly service - a place where you come back to for the people and the food."}
{"text":"Breakfast isn't overly prestigious but tastey and its a bargin.. The pancakes are delicious and pretty much everything I ordered was amazing. . The servers are wonderful and warm, it looks like the place is full of lifetime patrons, which makes sitting down for a meal that much more comfortable. Having dined for both breakfast and dinner i would say hands down breakfast is the attention grabber. . Try breakfast first if your in the area..."}
{"text":"I wrote (2) reviews about this 'same' place, and both times I didn't have a good experience. So I really believe that this time, I can actually say that this could be the most thorough review. Only because there are two sides as to why this makes THIS times review GOOD and BAD. 

What makes this place BAD (or what COULD make this place BAD) is that when it's crowded, you can be left and forgotten about. Which I can understand that's not going to be their fault ENTIRELY. But I think they should, however, acknowledge people as they come into the door and automatically sign them in as first-come-first-served basis. That way it's FAIR and everyone can't secretively jump in front of others. They should ALSO walk outside to see if anyone is seated out there and thoroughly ask whom is whom and if they're names are on the list.

Another thing that can make it BAD is the attitude of the waitresses. The first two reviews I wrote about this place was the waitress. We saw her again this morning and she still carried the same attitude as she did last time. So we can see that her attitude wasn't just based on 'us', but that she's like this with everyone. That's not a good thing. I'm sure if you asked others that work with her, they might say \"Oh, that's just how ____ is.\" Mildly laughing, shrugging their shoulders and walking away. It's still not a good look on the entire restaurant and staff. It really shouldn't matter how well she may know the menu items, ect. Her attitude just plain sucks. Luckily, she wasn't our waitress this morning. Otherwise, I'd be giving THIS review (1) star.

Now for the GOOD points about our brunch experience. It all goes to our waitress. She was so joyous, helpful, thoughtful, willing to do her job with sharing the laughter with us and other customers that were sitting around us. And I'm sure her customers were enjoying her too!! She didn't mind giving us refills, asking us if we needed anything else. And what I especially loved about her was how she found an alternative meal, being absolutely mindful of our wallets.

I wanted a waffle which was about $5.++ but also wanted eggs and sausages which were about $2.++ for each as a side. I asked her if the waffles came with any eggs and sausages. She said No, and so I was instead going to order one of the specials. That's when she pointed out a meal that had a waffle, (2) eggs, (2) sausage links and (2) bacon strips for about $5.++ Better deal, right?! So I went with that. With that being said, I thanked her for looking out for us as soon as she mentioned the cost will be a lot lower.

So with what I said before about this place (which can be any other place) being GOOD and BAD, it REALLY has to do with:
1. The wait time (being crowded).
2. Acknowledgement
3. The attitude of the waitress/waiter.
I'm mentioning only these (3) things because they were my biggest turn-off's ever since I've been introduced to this place.

Of course, there are other things like cleanliness, how quick the service is, how quick the food reaches your table, how good the food is, ect. But in our case, since those other times we came here, the service was really bad due to the waitress giving us the impression like she didn't want to be there servicing us. Not to mention, all the wait time and people cutting in front of other people, it was really BAD. 

So really, all my (5) stars goes to our waitress. The food and the quickness and acknowledgement were on point this time!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"We had a buy one get one free coupon, so we decided to try this place out.  Sorry to say, it wasn't even worth that.  As a over the road truck driver, I have eaten at many places  around the country where the food was marginal at best, and most of those places are better than Little Mesa Cafe.  The food was pretty much tasteless, as was the decor, and the service was slow and unattentive.  It's obvious that this place caters to the older crowd...  Those who have lost their taste buds and don't have anything better to do than digest their food.  A better bet for this style of food would be the Hoosier Cafe or the Iowa Cafe, both of which have food that you can taste and more reasonable prices."}
