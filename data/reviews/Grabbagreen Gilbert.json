{"text":"I ordered the Tokyo Bay and while it was very tasty but it was only about a cup worth of food maybe cup and a quarter.  All the photos show a FULL box - maybe it was the employees?  My friend requested a special order and they got that all wrong and it ended up being a bunch of spinach (supposed to be kale) with just a few of the veggies. We both left hungrier than when we came in and for the $10.50 price tag we won't be ordering  again.  I'm going to go back and try their smoothies - fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the bad reviews are about.  Went in with my family this evening.  Staff was very friendly and knew there stuff.  They explained there menu well and we ordered some grabbagrains, greens, acai cup and mac and cheese.  We thought it was all excellent.  This area needs more innovative different options."}
{"text":"When they first opened the smoothies were really good.  Now whenever I stop by the consistency of the smoothies are always different.  The same smoothie that used to be thick and purple/red comes out green or light green and is the consistency of water.  If I ask them to make it thicker they just mess it up more.  If it happened every once in awhile I would be like mistakes happen, but it seems to happen on a regular basis.  I do not go there as much as I used to because I am taking a chance on wasting my money. It is too expensive to take the chance that it might come out right.  I would rather go to whole foods or 24 carrots for a smoothie where it comes out the same every time, even though I love the oxidation smoothie when it comes out right."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! Got home with my Gulf of Mexico salad and more than half the shrimp are raw!! This was my first time dining at this establishment and I can tell you this is definitely not an $11 salad! Attempted calling the store because it's too far to drive back. Left a message and hoping someone will call back. Don't know that I'll be back unfortunately"}
{"text":"First time here, had the veggie hash.  Fresh ingredients and the right portion size.  Will be back for other menu items.  Nice staff BTW"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but it was not a good experience and I will not return.  1.  Food is served on disposable dishes with plastic silverware. 2.  Charged for ingredients that I didn't ask for on two out of the three items in my order. 3.  Within minutes of being served, we were told they were closing and that we would have to leave in two minutes.  (Every other restaurant says \"No hurry, but we are closing soon.\") 4.  No fountain drinks, just overpriced bottled beverages. 5.  Food is nothing remarkable."}
{"text":"Love this place for a healthy choice on the go! All fresh ingredients. I ordered the Mediterranean bowl and the oxidation elimination smoothie. Oh so delicious, and fresh,  so good I ate it all before I remembered to take a pic lol but I took a pic of my empty bowl and a picture off there menu so you could see what it looked like! Yummy I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff who were very knowledgeable and able to share their favorite menu items and why. Also lots of substitutes available  ex I could get almond butter instead of peanut butter due to allergy. Once she knew I had a peanut allergy she double checked all of the sauces to make sure there were no allergens before suggesting it. I got the Patagonia and substituted the chicken instead of steak. It was a little pricey (11.32) for a medium size box of food  but the food is filling and packed with flavor!"}
{"text":"My sisters and I each tried a different smoothie and they were all so good! I had the oxidation elimination and it tasted like an açaí bowl in smoothie form. I also really like the energy one that has coffee in it. The staff was very nice and the space was very clean. I will definitely make this one of my regular spots!"}
{"text":"Recently I have frequented Grabbagreen for smoothies as a post workout drink.  The smoothies are much better that the typical smoothie place and much healthier as well.  Unfortunately eating clean is more expensive than your typical fast food place, but I love having the option of eating well when I'm out if I haven't meal prepped for the day.  I will definitely be back!  The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and the owner is a delight!"}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered this great little place last month. I'm addicted to the Tokyo salmon, but not nearly enough fish is in the dish (I add extra fish, you have to pay for extra). I agree with others it is a bit pricey and can add up if you go here multiple times a week.  My husband did the 3 day juice cleanse, he seemed to like it. He lost 5 lbs and felt great after he completed it.  My only complaint is that there is a young woman at the counter who is not friendly and feels completely  put out for any request made."}
{"text":"First time at this particular Grabbagreen, been to the one in North Scottsdale a couple of times. Couple of things, walked in the door two individuals behind the counter, one helping a customer at the register with a GC, the other standing there doing nothing. No acknowledgment no what can I get started for you, just continues to stand there and then says Hi to the person who walked in 5 mind after me. So I order a $7.50 Smoothie, Pina Protein, with donation it costs be $9. Damn that is expensive, but ok. Get it quickly enough take a drink and start choking a bit. Pina Protein is Coconut, Pineapple, Agave and Whey Protein and Coconut Water. Each drink I take I end up coughing right after, way to much Whey. So I end up only drinking half of it and head to my yoga class where I get nauseous about half way through. I had planned on finishing up my smoothie after but it went directly into the trash. Not sure I will be back, I understand eating healthy is not cheap but I would rather go to Nekter for my smoothie fix."}
{"text":"It's great to have a healthy restaurant in the local neighborhood. It is right by the gym and the owners provide the best customer service one could expect in an eatery. It's perfect to grab when on the go and also clean if you decide to dine in. I've had the acai bowls, breakfast bowls, and will continue to try more. Everyone I have recommended it to has also told me that they've had equally great experiences."}
{"text":"It was my first time to a Grabbagreen. The owner was there, she was helpful with explaining the menu and options. The food was fresh, plus there were many options available. It's one of those places I'll have tot day a few options before finding \"my\" dish but it was a nice healthy choice served relatively quickly."}
{"text":"Expensive for a box of unchopped spinach and tasteless chicken. They only offer spinach or kale as the \"green\" for the salads. Not a mixed or chopped salad. 2 salads and it was over $20.00. Definitely will not return."}
{"text":"So we live in Tempe but drove to Gilbert for smoothies and juice. I was appalled to find out that if you do not want ice you be served a smaller size than what you ordered. I paid for a large but received a smaller cup size still with some ice. My question is exactly how many ounces of juice do we actually receive in a 16 ounce cup?  Maybe that should be listed on your menu. I feel deceived. Neither Jamba Juice or Chop Shop do this and they are much closer to me. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Amazing food that is actually healthy!!! Loved the quinoa Mac and cheese... Portions are smaller but a good serving size for lunch."}
{"text":"First time trying Grabbagreen and it was amazing. We work in the nearby shopping enter and we're fortunate enough to have them bring by samples for my coworkers and I. We tried two smoothies and they were creamy and the flavors were well balanced. Can't wait to try more items off their menu."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment my food was RAW. The manager was nice and I asked to have her credit my friemds credit card back. Be wary of the Shrimp!!!! Please look at picture of cooked shrimp versus raw shrimp!!! Don't risk going to ER."}
{"text":"Avoid this place.  Gave it a try and it happened to be the worst dining experience I ever had.  Rice were overcooked and not edible.  Good idea but bad execution.  We called back to voice our displeasure and the staff did nothing.  We ended up throwing away most of the food.  Such a waste of money."}
{"text":"Wow! Hubby and I spotted this place a week ago when we were used-car shopping in the neighborhood (there are two big auto malls on Gilbert and Val Vista just north of the 202). Unfortunately it was closed for the evening that day, but we vowed to return. Luckily, tonight when we went to pick up the car we decided to buy, it was earlier in the evening and they were still open. We popped in and were extremely pleasantly surprised by what we found. Clean, fresh and friendly is how I would describe the place, the staff and the food. It's all extremely simple, healthy ingredients, including plenty of vegetarian and even vegan options (hubby is vegetarian and I'm mostly vegetarian). Hubster had the Mediterranean Sea bowl with brown rice, and I had the quinoa macaroni-and-cheese dish with edamame for my protein. So delicious, portion size not too big and not too small, and even the beverages were awesome. I had the \"Immunization Station\" smoothie (banana, apple, strawberry, kale, etc.) and hubster had the cold-brew coffee with agave. Can you say YUM-O!?! This place proves you don't have to sacrifice taste for clean, healthful eating. Even though it's a fair distance from where we live, we will definitely go out of our way to return and try some of the other wonderful looking things on the menu."}
{"text":"Worst Acai bowl I've ever had. Paid almost $10 for it. Maybe got the wrong toppings. Was eating rock solid ice.. otherwise it's a cute place and staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Saw this place near my house and trying to eat much cleaner so it grabbed my attention. Walked in first thing in morning and staff was very friendly. Place was very clean. I mentioned to the cashier that I am staying away from meat and dairy. She recommended a salad or one of their hash bowls. So, I ordered the veggie hash. When she brought my meal it was the steak hash. Ok, simple mistake. I was in a hurry so didn't want to start over so I decided to just pick out the meat. Once I realized outside of the meat and egg, there wasn't much to it I decided to take it back in. The staff was apologetic and offered to remake with only veggies. I opted to just exchange for a pressed juice.  So, no big deal on the mistaken order, but feedback on the hash. I agree with other reviews that portions are small. I'm good with the theory of portion control, but then don't charge $7.50 for what might be $5 worth of food. For a buck more you can get a vegan breakfast at Liberty Market down the road that is much more food with much better flavoring. The main flavor in this was just a hot spice. Which I like spice, but if I didn't, it may make it tough to plow through.  I also agree with the criticisms on the container. If I am going to sit down somewhere and eat, it loses some of the enjoyment when you have to hold your 4 sided box lid out of the way while you dig in.  The pressed juice was fantastic. Overall, I am hoping they make a few changes to improve the experience and flavor on the hash. I am rooting for them since I would love another good food option nearby."}
{"text":"Quick summary: Food is good but overpriced and loses its attractiveness since it's served in a to-go box. The pressed juice was a complete disappointment! Good service at the register.  Update 4/14/17: Ordered French quarter again and it was good but after I was done saw a review here on Yep about undercooked shrimp now I am a bit worried but I think mine was cooked enough.  Kudos to manager and her response to my Yelp review. I substituted the red onion with yam and French Quarter was still good.   Did not order any drink this time because price too high for what you get.    Previous review  3/23/17: Detailed review about the meal: I liked the \"French Quarter\" meal I ordered which comes with shrimp, brown rice and greens. However, there was way too much red onion which overpowered the meal. About half way through, I picked out all the red onion (there was a lot!) and ate the rest of the meal.  If I go back I will probably order the French Quarter again and ask for no red onion (even though I do like onion) or substitute it for something else.  The amount of the meal was good but if you are really hungry or like big meals, this is not enough food. I wasn't that hungry and thought about ordering something else but decided not to because of the prices.  Detailed review about Pressed Juice: I will NEVER order a pressed juice at Grabba Green again. I ordered the \"Green\" juice and it tasted like 10% juice and 90% water, seriously, I think they added water to make it hit the 16 ounces, which appear small for the $8 price tag. I also asked for ginger as an add-on and it tasted like it had NO ginger (they charged me $.75 more). I asked the woman who made it if she added ginger, she said yes, but if she did it, it was not enough. I doubt any ginger was added because most people can taste the tiniest sliver of ginger immediately.  Detailed review about the Service: On the bright side, the girl who was at the register was very helpful, after asking a ton of questions I asked her if she was the manager and I found out she had only been there three days and knew a lot about the menu and she sounded excited about all the options. If it weren't for her, I would have given this review two stars.  Prices: My total was over $20 after tax which explains why I labeled this place as \"pricey\". In other words, if my wife and two kids were with me (family of 4) we could have spent $80 just on lunch if we each got a juice (which tasted like water). If you are taking your family and you are on a budget I would say you would want to try somewhere else. This is good if it's just you (or maybe one other person) and budget is not a priority.  Final comments:  Try one of the meals and decide for yourself if it is worth paying $10.50 again in the future. Do not order one of the pressed juices, (unfortunately I paid $8.75) instead, go to ChopShop, Raw Juice bar, or Whole Foods for the large juice."}
{"text":"Tried this place with my wife and 2 kids tonight.  I read it was a healthy option where you order at the counter with a lot of organic ingredients so we were in. The staff was helpful in explaining the different meals. I got a \"grabba grain\" meal with chicken an quinoa, my wife got the Gulf of Mexico shrimp salad. For the kids, the mac n cheese and a smoothy. Mine was fairly good but my wife was definitely  underwhelmed. For the kids Mac, it was called a \"youth\" portion but in reality it was a miniature container that was half full ($5).  I looked at it and was irritated. My daughter is a small 11 year old and after she ate her meal said \"okay, can we go get more food somewhere else, I still really hungry\".  The smoothly my 8 yo drank gave it a thumbs sideways and was still hungry as well.  They don't offer fountain water (or drinks) so you might want to bring your own water or pay for bottled water.  I overall felt it was okay but you don't get much for the price.  We spent $43 and we're all basically still hungry.  Disappointed bc we really wanted to have another good healthy option.  I might go back but not w my whole family. Not a good value for sure."}
{"text":"I like the idea of grabba green but good is extremely over priced. It's not going to fill you up and the flavor won't blow you away but it's a nice healthy option if you don't mind paying the high prices."}
{"text":"First time eating here, really cool concept if you are looking for something healthy other than a salad. The manager was really friendly and proficient in the menu. The food does come in a small box, but it filled me up quite a bit! For something healthy with a lot of organic stuff which is trying to give their customers portion control at the same time, I can see why their prices are a little higher. Love that you are able to easily modify the dishes, my Chicken Mac and Cheese (sorry i don't know the right name) was delicious. Had an opportunity to try the PB and J with Whey and it was really good too. The protein wasn't overpowering and you always got good flavor with it and it come's in a good size too. I live super close by and will definitely be back to get more protein smoothies after a workout and to explore the other options on their menu :)"}
{"text":"The BEST healthy organic lunch choices near our home! So many delicious options to choose from! We will continue to dine here!"}
