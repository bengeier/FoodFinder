{"text":"Dumplings is always good choice. I think they have two chefs. Dishes are not always good, especially at lunch. But most of time it's fine."}
{"text":"Nothing special. It tasted like the chicken was boiled in the kung pao chicken. Green beans were okay, but not fresh. I've had better dumplings at other restaurants and I was surprised there was no dipping sauce for the dumplings. Pork fried dumplings were good, but not worth another visit."}
{"text":"Incredibly cramped entree way you have to wait in to get a table and its really unpleasant. Space is wide enough for one person, but you constantly have waiters coming through to give an order to the dumpling ladies at the front and people coming past to the cash to put in a takeout order. Once you get a table, its ok. Pretty dressed-down place, with good steamed dumplings. Their fried dumplings look ridiculously oily so I haven't tried them. 

They only serve steamed dumplings in portions of 15, which is ridiculously too much for one person, I really wish they would let you do a half order. They have 2 vegetarian options, which are both ok. 

Service was good enough, they constantly come around to fill you water glass and bring the food quick - BUT they rush you out. They brought the check before we were finished the dumplings and before we asked for it, and immediately took the dishes away when you finished it. I guess they like a quick turnover, but its definitely not appreciated. 

Note there is no dessert available. 

TL;DR: decent dumplings, huge portions, ok service, entry-way unpleasantly tight. Can't decide whether I'd recommend here or Mother's Dumpling (where the service has sadly been awful this year)"}
{"text":"This has become one of out favorite eating  spots. We began with their amazing dumplings, always have one boiled and one steamed(love the pork and fennel). Then we moved on to the green beans in chili and garlic so crunchy and good. The braised eggplant with chili is delicious and the xin jiang chicken with wide homemade noodles is perfection. Wonderful food and such friendly service. The hot and sour soup with long chewy noodles is also one of our standbys. Couldn't be better !"}
{"text":"Ohmygod, this restaurant. I go here once a week or something and the food is awesome, I'm a huge fan. Personal favorites - sweet and sour fish (it's really well-cooked) and pork&shrimp dumplings. The service isn't perfect - only few people actually know English, but seriously, the food is too good to subtract a star for that. Recommend to everybody."}
{"text":"I have been a frequenter of the Spadina Dumpling joints for a long time, but this weekend I tried out Dumpling house on Gerrard and I was impressed by the price and the size of the dumplings! 

I liked that their pan-fried pork and chives were larger and more robust (they didn't reserve the size just for beef ones, better value). They were delicious and my Chinese friend and I agreed that they were authentic, like the kind we had in Asia when we lived there. However, even better was the pork and celery steamed dumplings where you could actually taste the flavour of the celery! 

No-nonsense, reasonably priced dumplings and Chinese food is hard to come by in the East, but this spot is DEFINITELY worth checking out. They are open pretty late too so I plan on picking some up for a snack tonight too."}
{"text":"Tastes homemade, not too salty or fatty. Filling, tasty and cheap."}
{"text":"Dumpling House is my new favourite Toronto Chinese food spot!  The food is authentic northern Chinese cuisine.  Love that Mama starts rolling out the dumplings shortly after ordering. Have tried the entire dumpling list and can report that none have disappointed.  My personal favourite is the steamed pork and fennel! Other dishes are terrific, too. Highly recommend the fish in chilli broth.  

The decor is unpretentious and the room is long and narrow.  One draw back is that there is only one large table at the back that seats more than 4 people.  Have never had to wait to get a table, but that will change as word gets out.

What surprises is the value.  We paid about $15 per person. It doesn't get any better than that."}
{"text":"Another great Asian restaurant in the east end. Cheap prices, fast service, tasty food, extensive menu!  Decent ambiance and decoration - clean and modern.  

Not just for dim sum - all sorts of Chinese dishes are available."}
{"text":"If you like Mothers Dumplings on Spadina you will like this place better.
The dumplings are freshly made and they are delicious with great skin and moist fillings. They come boiled, steamed and pan-fried.
Best of all, the prices here are very inexpensive for the quality offered.
Other dishes are great too.
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Narrow place,but kinda authentic food.Been there few times.But up to the surrounding neighborhood ,I more prefer hang around Yonge and bloor area."}
{"text":"I keep going back and the food is authentic and delicious for a great price
Try the deserts, you'll be delighted"}
{"text":"Second time here. 
Friendly staff. Good place to go if I miss Chinese food.
Ordered dumpling and rice cake?
The dumpling is 3stars. It is had a taste I don't really enjoy. 
The rice cake is really nice."}
{"text":"come to east china town people, food is great in this place. Dumplings are good. Overall good food. I come here often and their food is never bad, I have tried many things here."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this restaurant and had a terrible experience. Food comes out fast but much of it is poorly executed and some items were simply inedible. The entire staff went on dinner break while we were in the restaurant and did not take our additional orders until they finished. They did not provide any service without being prompted and we had to go the front cashier to get and pay for our bill. Also noticed that they prepare the food right opposite the cash. The entire time we were trying to get service, one staff member sat in a chair playing on their phone - even when we were asking to get a menu - ended up getting it ourselves."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with 2 others looking for some nice dumplings and noodles to hit the spot. 
Not today and certainly not in the future. This place is a frickin dump hat qserves dumplings available in most supermarkets  (KJ Brand) and then goes on to steam them to create a soggy gelatinous lump. Even though they are cheap (12 for $ 6.95 ) gas station cuisine is way better than this crap. 
Hot and sour soup was dominated by cheap rice noodles and very little or no meat at all. AVOID.
Shanghai noodles.  Worst I've ever tried . used Chow mein noodles .NO flavour  AVOID.
Kung Pao chicken.  Not bad . Like any other.
Service was not to bad. 
All you so called dumpling aficionados that think this place serves good dumplings and post about them just go to demonstrate how basic and unsophisticated your taste buds really are. Peasants."}
{"text":"Ok, if you're craving dumplings downtown.  I had a serious hankering for xialongbao (soup dumplings) and convinced my friend to meet me here.  Quick service.  XLBs had the right thickness of skins but meat inside was not as flavourful and not nearly enough soup, as what I would have expected.  This resulted in a slightly salty tasting XLB.  All to say, it was not bad - just not amazing.  It's worth the trek to either XiaoLongBao or DingTaiFung to eat better XLBs.  Of note, they served a solid beef brisket noodle.  Very reasonably priced (as one would expect) and a solid restaurant in the East Chinatown area."}
{"text":"Grabbed some takeout from here. The dumplings were great, price point is good. Hot and sour soup could have used a bit more flavour. Would come back."}
{"text":"As a matter of disclosure, we have had very bad luck with Chinese takeout in Toronto. It just seems as though whatever we order here ends up being this bland, grey, stringy goop. So it's seldom that we eat Chinese outside of a handful of carefully selected restaurants, and almost never that we chance takeout or delivery.

However, we were in the mood for Chinese and decided to try this place, which had a professional looking website and decent reviews. I biked over and waited for the food to be ready and then quickly biked home. I had the food on our plates in under 10 minutes from the moment it was handed to me at the restaurant - so as to minimize any deterioration due to the food sitting in styrofoam.

We ordered a won ton soup, which was bland and desperately needed salt. But it was won ton soup, which I dutifully ate - I cannot hate a won ton. But it was all downhill from there. 

The chicken fried rice was bland, if inoffensive. The diced chicken with cashews was an unappetizing orange - orange cashews, orange sauce with stringy bits of orange chicken. Why oh why did it have to be orange? 

The beef noodle dish was this light brown / grey monotone of goop - basically a pile of bland grey noodles with the occasional bit of beef mixed in. The beef was the same colour as the noodles (grey) so it became very difficult to tell beef from noodle - not that it mattered since the beef was essentially irrelevant to the dish. Vegetables you ask? Even a token piece of onion or green pepper? Don't be silly. Eat your noodles.

The vegetarian dumplings were as bland and pointless as everything else in the plate - just mushy soggy starch with some nondescript bland filling. I think I saw something green in there - it was probably the only green in the whole meal.

My wife simply refused to eat anything beyond a few bites, calling it vile. My mother-in-law (who treated us to the meal) rolled her eyes a few times at my wife's pickiness, but very quickly tapered off, having given up herself. Our two year old drank some broth and refused to touch the solids which she did not seem to acknowledge as edible. I soldiered on longer than anyone, piling food onto my plate and eating mouthful after mouthful until it occurred to me: what's the point? Why keep going? What do I have to prove?

Most of the food went into the garbage - no leftovers wanted. My mother-in-law apologized and promised to take us to a real Chinese restaurant next time.

Do yourself a favour - just head over to the nearest mall food court and take out from there."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday evening and was seated immediately. Service is quick, tea is complimentary, and the dumplings are alright. Not to die for, but good enough. Will return to try out their other offerings soon."}
{"text":"Pretty good, no frills Chinese food in the area. To be honest there are quite a few just-ok Asian places in old Chinatown. You have to try them to see what the quality is like. I was surprised by how good this place was. BF had the beef noodle soup (I assume it's meant to be Taiwanese style) and we got a serving of pork and cabbage fried dumplings and fried string beans. The fried dumplings were juicy as hell and not too crispy- I would say they're pretty perfect. Flavours were nice too.

As for service- it's not great but that's not what you come to a mom/pop Chinese place for. You come here for good cheap food and this place delivers. 

We're definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"I got takeout from here on my last trip to Toronto.  Great food and very nice staff.  The decor is basic but the food is very good and very authentic (TVs on with Chinese language programming and plenty of clients of Asian extraction). Dumplings tasted great, very fresh and amazing value for money.  Oh, and the best part....I left my phone here and they held it safe for me and gave it back to me the next day.  Good and honest value, I highly recommend the Dumpling House if you are in the area. You really can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"We gave up on Gerrard for Chinese food about 3 years ago after the River closed and Pearl Court was the only \"bad\" choice,

Dumpling House is a refreshing bright light in the otherwise tired strip that will soon make a transition to gentrification.

Our order:

Soup dumpling with pork $6.99 for seven,  come soo hot & steamy, watch you may burn your  mouth, they should include a diagram how to eat them so you won't.  The flavour was fantastic and they give you the red vinegar with ginger slivers to enhance the beautiful bounties of love.  Ask for more of the vinegar not enough.

Pan fried Chicken dumpling w/leeks $5.99 for 6.  Another winner no grease on plate just cripsy on skins and succulent juicy chicken with a hint of leeks.

Shanghai Noodles $6.99, perfectly cooked noodles with chinese cabbage, onion, pork strips and shrimp, sauteed in a sweet soya.  

Stir Fried Chinese Broccoli $6.99, steamed to crunchy perfection, stri fried in a garlic oil, not greasy though, just the right amounts.

Two women stand at the back making these treasured dumplings, and the interior is modern enough and very clean!!  A Chinese American Idol version played on TV, fun entertainment.

One star off for waiter, he did his job, but robot like, didn't say one word to us. Smile it won't kill you.

Tea Free   $28.40 + tip."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic Chinese dinner this is the place to get it. Although the dumplings are amazing and a much better price than most other places I've tried, come for the century egg and tofu and the spicy sauteed green beans. You won't regret trying The Dumpling House in fact if you're like me you'll quickly become a regular!"}
{"text":"We live in New York City and visited this place in January 2015 while we were in Toronto.  The dumplings were delicious and the staffs were very friendly and nice.  It was our first time visited this place that we were so touched that this restaurant gave us a complementary dessert pancake.  This was certainly enjoyed by the group of us even we were already full by the food we ordered.  If you like home and hand made Chinese dumplings that this will be a good place to visit."}
{"text":"Only eaten here once so far, but these dumplings were damn good. Very flavorful. Will go back to try out their selection of non-dumpling chinese food as well."}
{"text":"Ordered their soup dumpling and zha zhang noodle. The soup dumplings were average nothing worthwhile to say. The noodle dish was a huge mistake. I didn't taste the distinctive salty fermented bean paste in the sauce but instead just a sweet hoisin. Never had it sweet before and probably won't order that from them again or come back.  Are they trying to canadianize their food?"}
{"text":"This is as authentic as it gets.  We come here whenever we're in the area.

It's not fancy by any means, but this place serves what I feel are authentic given my travels, and my own dumpling cooking as well.  Not only are their dumplings good, but they have a wide variety of other foods available for order.

What's also nice is that the price level makes it affordable for visiting more often.

The authentic Chinese TV programming also makes for great conversation, entertainment, and laughter.  Not that we understand a word of what they're saying, but it's funny enough on its own!"}
{"text":"The dumplings were okay, but the green beans were the real winner!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered some food for pick up early this week.  Accidently we got the wrong order.  The lady felt so bad and called us back and offered us a discount on the next order which we really appreciated and she even offered to hold the food for us if we wanted.  Honestly, even though we got the wrong order, the food we got was still very fresh and delicious.  It was clean and not oily, very flavourful and cooked to perfection.  So even with the slight mishap, we still have to give them a full 5 stars!!  We will order again- they are our new favourite go too!  Thank you Dumpling House for the great food and humble service!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. Decor is different from the other resturants on the strip. Dumpling tasted great.  Love their eggplant dish on of my favourite. Service is good."}
{"text":"Tried the Assorted Vegetable Platter w/Pork, Vermicelli because the picture looked interesting. Didn't know what to expect. The takeout container opened up to actually look like the picture. Nice. Unfortunately, the broth had leaked out into the bag, so there was a bit of mess to clean up first. 
The best I can describe it is 'one of the best pasta salads I've ever had.' The dish isn't heated, but has a fair amount of kick in a satay-like base. Slivers of carrots, pork, yellow things, cucumbers and a spice mix with these inch-wide really long noodles. A big sloppy, tasty mess. The noodles were challenging with chopsticks due to how long, slippery and heavy they were. Totally enjoyed this, ended up with enough for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Service was good, food not so much.

Shanghai dumplings - the skin/wrap was too thick, the meat too dense

Pan fried lamb dumplings - lamb had ok flavour, but the dough was undercooked.

Steamed pork dumplings - meat too dense.

Beef onion pancake roll - was served cold, tasted too much like hoisin/oyster sauce, not much beef filling.

Brocolli shrimp egg white - ingredients didn't taste too fresh, a bit too salty."}
{"text":"This place won't blow your mind with new age technology or crazy ingredients. It's quality basics, at an affordable price. So if you are in the area and in the mood for some dumplings, this place is perfect. They probably have the most extensive menu of dumplings I have seen at any chinese restaurant. It's also a great way to introduce yourself to the famous soup dumplings which are usually more expensive(asian legend) or far away(scarborough). 

The menu is quite big, and the overall experience is pleasant. If I am in the area I'd definitely come back. 

PRO TIP: when eating a soup dumpling, bite a tiny piece of the top knot bit of the dumpling off. This will allow it to cool faster, and you can then suck the juice from this hole. So you don't spill it everywhere."}
{"text":"Delicious! A little pricey. We had the beef brocolli, cabbage pork dumplings, stir fry broccoli and egg & shrimp fried rice take out. Total was @$30. Paid w debit to avoid $0.50 credit card fee.
I'd go again. This can now be our neighbourhood Chinese food resto.
Was pleasantly full for a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the dumplings whether it be take out or dine in.

The place is clean and the atmosphere is like any other regular dumpling place ... But the true highlight is the dumplings all are good but the fried being my favs then the steamed"}
{"text":"i'm a regular there as i live across the road and here is how i've been treated:
 i order spicy fish soup, i got only 2 piece fish fillet that r fresh, the rest hide in the bottom smell like left over for a week. it cost me more than 10 bucks.
i order stir fry tomato and egg, i got only 1 tomato and 1 egg in a big foam take out container and it cost me 7 bucks.
i purchase their frozen dumplings for home cooking, 10 bucks a bag 30 pc. but i got at least 2 pc stinky spoilt meat inside each time each bag.
their food is just plain, nothing wow at all. thats all i can say. 
oh and don't order shredded pork and eggs with black fungus, it taste nothing but soysauce, the only dish that gives a big portion but just a whole plate of soysaucce colored shit with disgusting human hair hiding in."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to Chinatown-east. Dining room is small and narrow (only one table for party of six or more can fit in there), but the decor is pleasant. While dumplings are their specialty (and they are quite good), the hot & sour soup and shanghai noodles are also very tasty. As a bonus, the prices here are even cheaper than the dumpling houses on Spadina/Dundas. The service is pretty much a one-man solo job on the floor, without a great deal of energy, but the kitchen makes up for it by being quick on delivery."}
{"text":"Good food. The service was fairly prompt and the dumplings were delicious!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a DT location since most great dumpling places are uptown now.

Looks like it was recently renovated and service was decent.

I still prefer Dumpling King uptown."}
{"text":"came here with two friends to try this place out and I was pleasantly surprised how good the food is here. I haven't had good shanghai food in this area since Beijing house restaurant closed down a few years back(one owner decided to open Simons wok), but this place is probably more authentic. we ordered a bunch of dishes to try, noodles, pan fried dumplings, xiao lung bao, etc and AL the dishes were delicious. just be careful biting into the xiao lung bao, my friend made the mistake and paid the price with soup/juices/grease squirting onto his shirt."}

Street parking

Cleanliness: clean and spacious washroom BUT the cloth they use to wipe tables is just disgusting...wet and grey....and the worst part is they just serve food and tea without washing their hands (expected). The lady who was making dumplings right next to the cashier was barehanded. Containers for the condiments on the table were dirty and sticky (didn't even bother to use them) Because of this reason, my third visit will be the last visit. 

We came back to this area to have pho...both of the pho places we wanted to go were closed (Thursday at 7pm). So we just dropped by here because there really aren't many options to choose from in this area.

Ordered steamed chive&pork dumplings ($6.49 for 12 pcs) and Shanghai style fried noodles with pork and shrimp ($6.99). Noodles came out very quickly (5min). They make all the noodles in house except for vermicelli. I would give 3/5 for fried noodles: lack of flavour, too oily, and lack of proteins. Dumplings, however, deserve 4.5/5. Juicy and very flavourful. I could eat all 12 of them if I didn't eat noodles."}
{"text":"Really terrific Szechuan Chinese food and amazing dumplings. Clean and courteous. No delivery but quick take out that's well packaged."}
{"text":"Wonderful green beans, but rather soggy boiled dumplings. Fine soup dumplings and very good spicy wontons. Rather greasy tables but worth the trip notwithstanding."}
{"text":"This is a one of very few Chinese restaurants that I enjoyed their service.  Family run place. Every one was friendly, polite and happy.  The food was just like any other Chinese cuisine. It was good. Fresh made dumplings were very good. The spring onion pancake was very good. The Turbot fish was very good but drench in gravy/sauce.  Not the cleanest place. I give 3 stars for the service."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Just came from there and I have never had more tasteless dumplings in my entire life.  Worse than frozen ones I tried once. Better to go to a real Dim Sum restaurant and order there.  I never knew I couldn't like dumplings till I came here."}
{"text":"Alrighty, the restaurant is small and cramped and makes you feel like being in a crowded railway dining car. The dim sum menu skews towards dumplings. And the lingua franca skews heavily towards Mandarin.

But you know what? This is your best bet for a quality Chinese sit-down meal in little East Chinatown, since practically every other Chinese restaurant options in the area are shit. The menu is extensive, but the noodles are hot and delicious, the xiao long bao and other dumplings big and juicy. It's clean, it's no-nonsense, and it's the real deal. Dumplings House delivers a simple and satisfying experience that doesn't fail to shine a glimmer of hope in East Chinatown's declining dining scene."}
{"text":"I've frequented this place a number of times in the past few months.  I really like it.  My have items are the pan fried dumplings, I prefer the beef over the chicken.  I tried the other kinds but in general i like the pan fried ones best (I like the crunchiness it adds to the dumplings).  The crispy sweet and sour pork is also good.  We like the onion and beef roll appetizer (truth be told the ones at asian legend are better).  This is still quite good and walking distance to our place.  It's also nice to support little mom and pop shops."}
{"text":"Definitely my go-to spot for dumplings in the city. I've always had a thing for mom and pop shops and this definitely lives up to that and then some.

All the dumplings here are handmade, the noodles are handmade, the desserts are handmade; you name it, it's handmade. That's the way it should be.

No there's no over-the-top flavours and out of this world creativity. There's no 5 star service and you're not going to rave to your friends about how clean and inviting this space is. But in the end it's just a great comforting and delicious meal that won't cost you an arm and a leg.

You can really taste the difference of freshly made dumplings and noodles. There are no freezer burns and that freshly thawed taste to their stuff. There are no cold spots and dried dumplings here. You can literally see the freshness as the old folks are always hard at work by the cash counter kneading away at fresh dough and patiently folding and pinching each and every little dumpling.

I can't tell you which dish is the best and which one is a must because they all are great. It's a testament to their craft and prove that with fresh ingredients and great care you can't really make a bad dish out of anything.

Definitely a must try if you are still considering."}
{"text":"This place should be called Noodle House instead of Dumpling House. I've had both the noodles and dumplings here and the noodles were by far the stand out item! My mom - who grew up in Shanghai even raved about the noodles and how authentic they were! She loved the white oval noodles (I cannot remember what this dish was called unfortunately but it is pictured below). For me, my favourite dish was the braised beef noodles in soup. I don't feel like this dish could get any better! It is simple and the homemade noodles really stand out. 

The dumplings on the other hand I feel like they were good but not a standout. The wrapping was a bit too thick for my liking. I still find The Dumpling House on Spadina to be superior in terms of dumplings. Also they don't have pork & shrimp dumplings which are my favourite! 

That being said, I wish Dumpling House was closer to me. I would love to get the braised beef noodles more often - they make such a comforting meal!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a number of times - always delicious. My go to is the pork and chive dumplings. Sichuan vegetables and general tao chicken were tasty as well. Good service and value."}
{"text":"Food: Food was oily and luke warm. I went with a friend and we ordered dumplings, hot and sour soup, and their shanghai noodles. The dumplings were oily and found it rather pricey for 6 dumplings. The hot and sour soup tasted watered down and there was a really weird raw pork taste to it. I found their shanghai noodles lukewarm and like it was reheated it in the microwave. 

Service: The server thought we didn't want our chance back (aka left them a 30% tip) and we sat around waiting for our change back. I had to ask him for it back and he had to scramble to find the receipt and recalculate the change. Anyway, I think they need to do better with this. Make clear that you are expecting change!

Overall, food was subpar and service could be better. I'm not sure how this place got such a high review to be honest. Definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is more of a 2.5-star review. It's a small place where they've squeezed in as many tables as they possibly could with a narrow pathway to access all the tables. Their food is decent enough that I would visit again if I had some serious soup bun cravings but it's just decent. However, I do enjoy their onion pancake."}
{"text":"I just tried the soup dumplings, a dish I have really enjoyed at Mother's Dumplings (on Spadina in Toronto) and in New York's Chinatown (very famous place - but the name escapes me right now).  I'm afraid Dumpling House gets a very unenthusiastic 2 out of 5 for their soup dumplings.  Not enough meat inside, and the flavour suggested (though I can't be certain) the use of MSG.  I'm headed straight back to MOTHER'S for their awesome \"juicy pork buns\" - which is their name for soup dumplings.  Maybe Dumpling House has other items which are more appetizing, but I've lost interest.  Spadina isn't that far away - and that's where I'm headed for my next installment of Chinese comfort food."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place a few weeks ago and I wish I could just eat there every day.  It still isn't as good as my favourite place to eat in Vancouver but it is a close second, and also CLOSE TO ME!!  We need more awesome Chinese places in East Toronto.

The dumplings we had were good, but I liked their variety of Northern Chinese cuisine, like their pan fried rice cakes, and onion pancake.  The noodle soup dish was a good option, not greasy or anything, which was perfect for my son.  I'm excited to go back and try more of their dishes, especially their spicier stuff."}
{"text":"Was here last summer.  Cramped seating, not many tables for big groups.

Food was good. Dumplings were good. 

3-3.5stars for the food.  
Service was good."}
{"text":"Small obviously family run place where parents and uncles sit around reading newspapers and kids are taking orders and bringing food out. 
We ordered two dishes of dumplings and a soup, they give you complmentary hot green tea in a pot. We had to write the order numbers down on the back of a piece of paper and hand it to the waitress haha. Didn't mind at all because the food was cheap-ish and we were hungry and craving dumplings. 
Pay attention to the numbers you're ordering, some of them are out of order BUT YOU HAVE TO PUT THE NUMBER THAT'S ON THE MENU. For example 18,19,20,210, 22, 23,24 is listed on the menu? Don't tell her 21 if you want dish labelled 210. Tell the waiter 210. Idk why they have this like this, but I don't make the rules so.....
Probably would return for cheap dim sum IF I lived in Toronto, but if not find somewhere else"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I always visit here when we're feeling like a local spot. Food is always hot straight from the kitchen, and it's very cozy. I love the Sichuan boiled fish in chili oil. My boyfriend always gets the donut sticks!"}
{"text":"Ohh the dumplings are so good here... this place should be number one dumpling house in toronto ... can buy fresh and frozen ones... good is great here as well love the fried rice"}
{"text":"Cozy little place in East Chinatown.  The inside is a little run down, so it's a good thing the dumplings are on par with some of the better dumpling places in TO.  Worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible meal, fried rice was soggy...tea had more grounds then even the crappiest steeper would produce...soup was flavorless and pork dumplings in it were bitter, ordered steamed chicken and after two bites I was very turned off. Waiter was pushy and on top of me way too often. First and last time here"}
{"text":"For the price (cheap!) this place does quite a good job. Dumplings are fresh and tasty. The spring rolls are crisp and not too greasy with a really interesting sauce. Hot & sour soup was quite tasty. 

I didn't particularly like the pork & fennel dumplings - kind of an odd combo with too much fennel for me. But they tasted fresh and full of flavor - just not a flavor that made my taste buds happy. 

The portions are HUGE. The large hot & sour soup could serve 8 people. 5 normal sized spring rolls in one order. A dozen of the same dumpling. So this place would be best with a group of at least 4 so you could get a better variety of dumpling types. For two of us it was a bit much

And the waiter pretty much does not speak to you."}
{"text":"Clean setting, great Chinese dishes, and fast services! Our favourite are Shanghai small dumpling, Shichun Spicy Fish slides,and North-East China Fresh Three Vegs (please see the photos)."}
{"text":"Some of you Yelp reviewers are messed up giving this place anything more than 3 stars. What is wrong with your taste buds and standards of quality?

Had the pork rib noodle, soup came out lukewarm and pork tasted like nothing. They must have boiled the flavour right out of it. At least the vegetable was raw in my soup. The dumpling was skin was thick and the filling not so fresh."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I gave this restaurant another try. Nasty pan fried dumplings that come out COLD and soggy. 

their so called Shanghai noodles are not Shanghai noodles you'd typically get at other Shanghai restaurants. Anyways even that tasted horrible. 

Nothing came out hot or even warm.

Don't recommend. If u want a good dumpling fix go to dumpling house on spadina"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Chinese food, you're not gonna get it here. Well, at least for the pan-fried dumplings and the chicken fried rice. There's no dipping sauce for the dumplings. The fried rice is just bland and sad."}
{"text":"We go here almost 2-3 times a month. Our favourite is the steamed pork and chive dumplings. The Gong bao chicken is another must have. General Tao's chicken is yummy as well however it's  sometimes too sweet and soggy. 

This place is shut on Tuesdays and is a cash only place. The waiting time is around 5-7 mins on busy nights."}
{"text":"We had the spicy green beans, spring onion pancake, soup filled dumplings with ground pork, and fried dumplings with pork and cabbage. Wow; maybe the best meal we've had yet... so simple and homemade by the lady behind the counter!"}
{"text":"I went to this place after reading the reviews and was not disappointed.  I originally went here because I didn't feel like driving to Spadina, but now I have a closer awesome dumpling place!  had the chicken, and the veggie dumplings.  Both had amazing flavors, the veggie probably had fennel (the vegetable not the seed).  The chicken was so good you could eat it without sauce.  The hot and sour soup large is big enough for two hungry people, and is quite spicy, tons of tofu, bamboo shoots and mushroom pieces.  Also tried the deep fried tofu, which was a large portion, and was in a brown sauce.  Restaurant is long and narrow, very tidy, and a woman was making the dumplings behind a counter.  Great find!  Oh, and Sheila, why do people like you post reviews?  One star off for the waiter because \"he did his job, but robot like, didn't say one word to us\"?  This is not helpful to anyone, and quite frankly not fair to the restaurant.  If you want to go somewhere to socialize, try a bar with a friendly barkeep."}
{"text":"Cute little Chinese restaurant with a huge choice of things to order.  Their multicoloured dumplings are great for an Instagram pic but also yummy.

They also have some other great dishes like the braised eggplant worth potato and my mom loved their beef salad with tripe even though it was a little spicy for her.

Great place for cheap eats."}
{"text":"(Just found this review sitting unfinished/unsubmitted) - posting it belatedly.

Did put in at least one other visit last fall (2014)...do recall in terms of the desserts, the unique option is the deep fried egg white custard stuffed with bean paste and rolled in sugar. An order is enough to share with a table of five (if not more). 

Back today (2015) - glad to see DH going strong even as newer options open up on Danforth. 

Have to say, boiled dumplings are where it's at for me. We went with the three flavor (shrimp, pork, chive) - juicy and dozen to an order. (and you can get other stuffing choices if you prefer). XLB - once choice only - not that they're bad - thin skin, juicy inside - but less variation if you want to change things up.

Niu rou mien (beef noodle soup) is right on. Tender noodles (and the beef) - not over but not fall apart - I didn't miss the chew. 

Love the tofu preserved egg app. Cool with a hint of tangy-ness and rich! 

Did get the beef potstickers - not terrible, but pales in comparison to what else we had on the table. 

Star dessert this time: get the salted sesame pancake bread. It's not so much the sesame (there's a couple black sesame seeds), but the salty light flaky fresh bread! Enough to change your concept of a post-meal dessert that has no sweet in it."}
{"text":"One day venturing for a late night snack, this place for the description of what I wanted to eat. I ordered a take out but the man on the phone only spoke in Mandarin. My girlfriend had to take the order for me since my mandarin is limited to, \"xie xie.\" (Thank you)

We ordered an abundance of food. The egg fried rice with shrimp was $7, the shrimp were very small and the egg was not as expected. It literally was an egg fried rice when we envisioned more of a creamy glaze with egg. Our second dish was the lamb dumplings $7 which looked very lumpy but they were delicious! I would order this dish again! Then we moved on to the beef scallion rolled up in a pratta like material. It was mediocre at best, I would have liked a bigger portion since it was $6 and it definitely needed more scallions. Our last dish was a red bean dessert that seemed like a good way to end the meal, $3 but it was very thin. In fact I could fit 3 in a toaster to heat it back up. I liked the thinness but it could have used more red bean paste in the middle. 

Regardless, we ended up paying only $25 for the entire meal which was a steal! Next time I would order a meat dish to balance all the gluten! This place is very small but the prices are definitely reasonable!"}
{"text":"We lived in China and are always looking for and jonesing for good authentic Chinese food. This place is the bomb for good dumplings, Ma Po tofu, noodles and other great Chinese dishes. While it mainly has northern Chinese fair, they have a fair amount of Sichuan dishes. Best part...They offer frozen dumplings to steam at home. Highly recommend the dumpling house!"}
{"text":"So good!  We drove home from Buffalo, NY in search for the best Chinese food in the area.  DH did not disappoint.  After living in the Shanghai area for 11 years we have come to live and respect Chinese food.  The food at DH was as good as what we ate in China.  The dumplings were the best I've had in North America...and were as good or better than the dumplings I had in China.  This place is awesome.  Cash only so be sure to hit the ATM before you come."}
{"text":"The price point here is good and the food is also tasty. The service was okay, the server didn't really check up on us but tbh I didn't really mind. My friend and I got some soup dumplings, pan fried cabbage and pork dumplings, sweet corn and egg drop soup with surimi (imitation crab), and a Sichuan chicken with white rice. The soup dumplings weren't very soupy but they were still tasty, great flavour. The pan fried cabbage and pork dumplings were great as well. I think it came up to about $16/person which was great. I'll definitely be coming back here id I'm in the area."}
