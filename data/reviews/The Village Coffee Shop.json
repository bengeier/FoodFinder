{"text":"Great find! If you want a great cup of java and a light crepe fix I would you recommend eating here. I had a strawberry and blueberry crepe and a cup of coffee. Don't expect a large restaurant it is a very small cafe. I enjoyed the uniqueness of the restaurant. If you're tired of the same old boring burgers and sandwiches for lunch you should really try this place. it's all so perfect for me after dinner treat."}
{"text":"Had a delicious smoked salmon crepe when I stopped at the Village Coffee & Creperie this afternoon. It seemed to be a slow day, which left me pretty happy... Plenty of tables to choose from and I was able to use the free wi-fi to get some work done. The staff was super friendly and very attentive. Since I live close, I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"From someone who knows crepes (just a slight obsession), this place ranks high on my list. Great choices for sweet and savory and a large drink menu to quench your thirst! Love it here."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this coffee shop.  Friendly staff.  I had a delicious dessert crepe and the biggest cup of coffee ever. My crepe had chocolate & hazelnut Nutella with fresh strawberries and I ate the whole thing. My Americano with cream was piping hot and rich in flavor. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We have bee following this place from the old place to the current location. The owner, Marina, is super sweet and very customer friendly, she cares for her reputation.  However, we have been so disappointed with the food and service whenever the owner isn't around.  We understand she has been busy with her personal life but the employees need extensive training.  They never got the order right.  Wrong drinks or wrong food. It happened many times in a row.  We stopped coming for 6 months because we were so tired and exhausted with all the mistakes. We tried coming back today, and yes, they are still doing the same thing.  Wrong drink and wrong food, and the employee argued with us. We won't be coming back probably till Marina comes back"}
{"text":"Amazing sweet and savoury crepes! Definitely a gem of the desert. And the capuccino and cafe au lait were outstanding. Outstanding customer service too - the owner had to remake one that wasn't to her liking so she gave us a free crepe coupon for the delay. Definitely the best crepes in AZ! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Was disapointed...if a place is going to specialize in crepes you would expect that their basic crepe dough would be special, I have had ones that were, theirs is not.  The fillings are fine, service was very slow."}
{"text":"Great find. The breakfast crepe was delicious. They serve a very large portion for a great price.  We also tried the sweet cinnamon swirl and lemon zest after... So delicious. My husband and I have tried many crepe places throughout the years and this is definitely one of the top. Fantastic coffee and great breakfast/sweet crepes. We will head back soon to try the savory ones."}
{"text":"Quaint and relaxing.  Very small!!!! Outdoor seating with nice views.  Please don't go there for a quick bite to eat.  Go there for great food and delicious coffee.  We had to wait awhile for our food but what a great place to relax and have conversation.  Friendly staff!  A Carefree gem!"}
{"text":"The coffee is made fresh on the spot. The crepes are incredible. Although yesterday my coffee was served cold and was barely filled to the top with the $5 latte I ordered. Usually I always have a great experience. They must be either short staffed or their barista is poorly trained. I'll definitely have another person make my drink nex"}
{"text":"This is the real \"Jewel of the Creek!\" Everything about this place is amazing. Its beautiful location, its outdoor patio area, and especially its coffee and crepes! The owner is super friendly and will make you any crepe you want as long as she has the ingredients for it. I love all the crepes but my favorite sweet crepe is a tie between Nuts for Bananas with strawberries or the Teenage Dream. My favorite savory crepe is the Pesto Chicken. For coffee I recommend the almond roca frappuccino to satisfy your sweet tooth. There are tons of options to choose from and the menu changes according to the new fresh ingredients she has in stock!  Don't miss out on stopping by this crepe shop! Once you come here you'll know why everyone loves it so much and you'll have to come back again!"}
{"text":"Tasty crepes and great service! Breakfast bagel sandwich on the jalapeño cheese bagel was amazing! Bacon is perfectly crispy! Also Try an ice chai latte, you will be happy you did ;)"}
{"text":"Found this cozy shop while looking for commercial real estate in the area. We arrived 10 minutes after the  2:00 PM closing time.  As we walked in we were greeted with a warm welcome.  The owner was sweet, open, and a delightful conversationalist offering a very warm and inviting atmosphere.  This place is rather cozy, large parties may wish to occupy the seats available outside.  The owner mentioned she would happily serve us and discussed the location with us and her menu options, which were rather vast.  There is a very large drink selection of coffee, teas and other warm and cold frothy treats.  The crepe menu selection was very well, with both savory and sweet options.  We selected ice coffee and a mixed iced tea for drinks along with \"The Californian;\" with chicken, sun dried tomatoes, goat cheese and basil, and the \"Pesto Chicken.\"  As we mentioned we would share the items, she was gracious enough to divide both items evenly on two plates.  The portion size was moderate to large and absolutely delicious.  I am excited to try this place again.  I am certain it shall quickly become one of my new favorite places."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! Marina is so friendly and loves her customers! She mixes the ingrediants fresh in her kitchen, and then makes the crepes right in front of you! I tried the raspberry chicken crepe, and it was amazing! There was so much food I could hardly finish!  I would recommend this place to anyone; not only because of the charm, the amazing location, and Marina - but because of the delicious food she creates!  I can't wait to go back and try one of her sweet crepes :) Thanks Marina!"}
{"text":"Coffee here is so good. Not bitter or over roasted. Have now had both a savory and sweet crepe, both are wonderful! The wait can be long but in July they are moving 2 suites down to a much bigger space and will have 6 crepe griddles. If you have an hour, they are worth the wait. Free wifi or friends will make the time fly."}
{"text":"I went here with my mother in February on a Sunday morning. I expected them to be busy, its Sunday, I get it. But you would think they might be properly staffed?? The one cook/owner took no less than ONE HOUR to make our 2 crepes.  the enormous coffee I was served was stone cold by the time I got half way thru the mug. . Why did I stay? No idea. Owner was patronizing. yuck. The poor waitress. I felt so bad she had to bear the brunt of the complaints for the ill-prepared chef. Food quality was fine but the time was insane. sorry."}
{"text":"This place is like heaven! If you're in town visiting then it's definitely the place to see while you're here. There aren't too many places out there like this! Came in on Sunday during a cool art festival. Real friendly staff and roman took great care of me and made feel welcome! Come check it out!!"}
{"text":"A Chai latte, cappuccino, strawberry crepe and a savory ham & swiss crepe all amazing! Waitress was friendly and helpful. Only downside, we wish this place was closer to home! We will be back! Oh and we grabbed a lemon bar and chocolate chip cheese cake brownie thing for later. ...also soooo yunmy! Go. Try it. :)"}
{"text":"The Village Coffee Shop! CHANGING THE CREPE GAME!!! The staff is awesome, the crepes are amazing, the whipped cream is freshly made, and the coffee is as good as it gets!  I highly recommend if you are driving past stage couch village in Cave Creek, that you get off your motorcycle and try this place out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food and coffee - 4 stars Service - 0 stars   We got our coffee and then the crepes came .... ONE HOUR LATER! They told us that they had only two griddles and it would be 10 more minutes. When I told her to cancel it cause we're going elsewhere the crepes starting coming out one after another after another. Obviously they forgot our order    Tip: make sure you check on your order every ten minutes cause the service sucks and their order tracking system needs some work"}
{"text":"The Village Coffee Shop is AMAZING!! My mom and I have been to this restaurant a few times and every time it was fabulous. We love the Red Rose and the Pesto Crepes. And for my 12th birthday, when I got the Red Rose Crepe, they wrote happy birthday, and the number 12 on the crepe, along with the crepe came a very nice birthday card. Please go and try The Village Coffee Shop and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. :) ~ Shannon's Daughter"}
{"text":"Found this little spot on Yelp, drove up on a Sunday morning for breakfast and wow.. We loved it! Tried out 3 different crepes, all were amazing. Will be back many more times. Well worth the drive up from Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Im a coffee lover and try every coffee shop with good reviews. I was kind of excited to try that one out because of the good reviews and the good looking coffees. I choose a café Au lait. And was more than badly disappointed with what I got. The coffee didn't even taste like there was coffee in it. It is really one of the worst coffees I have ever tried in a coffee shop. Quality definitely not better than any cheap free motel coffee. :-( I don't recommend this place to anyone who loves a cup of good coffee! Other than the coffee, the place is small but cute, has kids toys and tables outside. But the service itself wasn't how I would expect it either."}
{"text":"I would've given them 5 stars but the service was so slooowww!! Waited almost 45 minutes for my crepe!  And they were not very crowded.  Just one server and one cook.  Food was excellent tho.  Will go back, just hope they improve on their service!"}
{"text":"Delicious crepes and wonderful service. Great bakery also. Ate here twice on our vacation."}
{"text":"Oh, my!!! Started off with a giant, delicious coffee! I had the veggie crepe, daughter had vanilla yogurt, grandson had ham and cheese and granddaughter had salted caramel. The crepes were delicate and perfect! We were comfortably full and happy. I have madd eating here a tradition every time I am visiting from Charleston and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. I had this restaurant in my Que to give a five star. Husband and I went there to get a Nutella crepe w/ coffee. The coffee was good. The crepe had a generous amount of Nutella. We went back the same week for lunch. We didn't realize how expensive the savory crepes were so we ordered the Nutella crepe again to hold us over until we went elsewhere for lunch. This time, the crepe hardly had any Nutella and it was not even edible. Your experience varies based on who is working here. The older woman, I am guessing is the owner made us a delicious crepe. The young woman that was there the 2nd time basically gave us crepe batter.  As for the prices. Seriously need to lower the prices. Both times we were there we were the only customers. My husband and I work from home/coffee shops. If you are good we are there several times a week ordering throughout our visit. We are local. We want to support Cave Creek businesses but not when we feel that we are being ripped off. We go to Grotto and Janey's on a regular basis. We even drive down to downtown Scottsdale and Tempe for some coffee shops that we like down there. We would support them more if they were on-par with other coffee shops in the valley in terms of cost.  Maybe if they were cheaper they would have more business (and in return make a larger profit). Just a thought :)"}
{"text":"Net als alles in Cave Creek is dit ook weer een bijzonder relaxte plek, ik heb hier twee keer ontbeten maar ik schrok wel enorm van de rekening. Die was torenhoog. Het eten was prima, ik had eerste de salted caramel crepe, was lekker en de keer daarop had ik iets anders met slagroom, ook erg lekker maar erg duur. We ontbeten met ons 3-en en ik was meer dan 60 dollar kwijt. Ook betaal je extra voor glutenvrij, begrijpelijk, maar toch...."}
{"text":"Good food once it shows up. Definitely don't be in a hurry when you go. There's only two people working and they are so busy making fancy coffees that the actual cooking takes a while. Also, expect around $40 for two crepes and two coffees. Kind of expensive for a simple breakfast. So, bring your wallet and patience."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this amazing coffee shop. Enjoyed a delicious iced coffee and the smoked turkey crepe for lunch. Loved the atmosphere. I will certainly make your coffee shop a destination stop from now on. I purchased two very delicious pastries on my way out and my husband and I are enjoying them this morning with coffee, while writing this review."}
{"text":"Had lunch there last week. Awesome! My husband and I shared a Mexican crepe and a fruit bowl with yogurt. Both were excellent. The crepe was outrageously good and the fruit bowl was a good size and fresh. We live in Chandler and decided that going to The Village Coffee Shop for lunch would definitely be a worthwhile excursion we see in our future."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall place is worth popping into. The coffee shop is tiny with some outdoor seating. They have very good coffee, a very clean bathroom and awesome crepes. The crepes INCLUDE savory....none of this sugar only stuff.   Right next door, they actually share the door, is a barbershop. Simply quaint. Excellent service and excellent coffee."}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious savory and sweet crepes and lite bites. Perfect service and good value."}
{"text":"Amazing lemon zest crepe, and scrambled egg crepe with bacon....plus a frozen mocha! Heaven!!!"}
{"text":"The best food in town this is the only breakfast joint that I go out to . Everything is so fresh and tastes awesome,"}
{"text":"Lovely place! Venture off the beaten path in the heart of downtown Cave Creek to check out this coffee shop and creperie.   The menu is creative and very appealing (I ordered the Almond Joy crepe- which includes almonds, coconut, and a drizzle of chocolate). They can also do every crepe gluten free! The coffee offering is diverse and includes delicious options like a white mocha latte. I enjoyed a large purple mug (think \"Friends\") of a decaf cafe au lait. It was perfect!  The service is a little odd. It's not immediately clear if you're supposed to order at the counter or seat yourself. It turns out they do have table service, and they will come to your table, but the menus aren't there waiting for you and it took a little while for someone to come over even though the place wasn't very full (we had to ask)).  I would definitely return! It's a nice change of pace from typical breakfast joints and since it's just outside downtown Cave Creek there's a quietness and serenity that feels just right on a no-rush morning. They also have a TV which doesn't have the volume on but plays cartoons that don't require sound so children are entertained while mom and dad relax."}
{"text":"I had the cinnamon swirl crepe, my mom had the special of the day, which was a mixed berry with creme fraiche, and my dad had a strawberry crepe.  They were all very good, however, my crepe was flat while my mom's was stuffed with the great berries.  I know I didn't have much inside mine, but a little more filling (butter/nuts) would have made it great.  Nice little place and drive from Scottsdale.  Will definately be back."}
{"text":"I was looking for a spot for crepes and I came across multiple locations on yelp but this one had 5 stars so I said, \"why not?\" even though it was quite the drive out. The shop was small but the outdoor seating area was adorable.   Now let's get to the important part, the food. Overall, I can't say I was mind blown like everyone was...I've had crepes in numerous locations and I would say this place ranks at the bottom. I ordered the raspberry chicken because it was highly suggested by the waitress and I'd have to say, I wasn't a fan; personally, I thought it was way too sweet to be a savory crepe. I thought I would give them a second chance and try one of their sweet crepes so I ordered the triple threat. The triple threat was pretty standard with strawberries, nutella and bananas, except that day I just had a double threat since they ran out of bananas (how do you run out of bananas??). It was good, not great...you really can't go wrong with such a simple crepe. What I was really disappointed about was the fact that my crepes (BOTH OF THEM) were HARD and I bit into something that almost chipped my tooth! What was it? I have not a clue and I didn't want to make a scene so I went about my meal so that I could just be done and leave.   I also ordered a vanilla latte which was a little overloaded with milk...for a second i didn't think that were was in even coffee in it!    A place specializing in coffee and crepes but can't offer good coffee nor crepes? Fail."}
{"text":"Excellent crepes, we had a savory and a sweet.  Friendly owner.  Coffee in a really big cup."}
{"text":"Took a drive out of the city to find a unique Christmas gift for my mom. First thing on the agenda was a cup of coffee. After a quick yelp check we came across this little gem of a shop.   They clearly take pride in presentation as their crafted lattes looked as yummy as they tasted. There is a good variety of crepes on their menu. I chose savory over sweet, and I'm glad I did. Ordered the special which had ham, cheese, onions. It was delicious.   They are located in a new shopping plaza, it's still under constitution so we weren't sure they were open. Glad we drove down, around, to the back. Friendly staff, quiet atmosphere, and posts to hitch your pony."}
{"text":"Definitely surpassed my expectations and as a customer I will definitely be returning even if it is a bit of a drive. The coffee and crepes were equally delicious and the service was speedy and friendly. Not too busy of a place so it's perfect for reading or meeting with friends! Hope this place is very successful and it will be recommended to many of my friends and family as well. Great place and very true to itself!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find. The shopping complex itself is easy enough, but once you get in and parked and consult the directory- either they moved or that thing needs to be revised to be a little more clear. We walked around the entire building before finding our way in through the back door. The facilities are clean, the place is spacious, bright, and airy. There are ten tables inside and appeared to be three or four out front. The person at the counter was friendly enough. We ordered two 16 oz black coffees and it was under $7. The coffee was just okay. I was definitely expecting better. Next time we're in the area we'll check out someplace else."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes & friendly staff- what could be better?? I work in neighboring Carefree &occasionally treat myself to a crepe & iced latte at The Village. I've also taken crepes to-go for my coworkers, & they all love the made from scratch goodies :) We've found the savory & sweet crepes to be equally deliocious. The staff at the Coffee Shop is so kind, and even remembers my order from my monthly visits! This is also an excellent environment to relax with some reading or get some studying done. Skip Starbucks & enjoy your coffee/breakfast/lunch at a wonderful locally-owned gem!"}
{"text":"Could not be happier with my first visit there with my twins today.  Marina is as nice as can be.  Place charming though small.  But the porch seating is the place to be.  Crepes and coffee are the main attraction.  But my twins thought Marina's scrambled eggs were the best ever, in fact they even put away a 2nd order.  Nice menu of savory crepes and a 2nd menu of sweet ones.  Didn't get to try a savory one but saw many coming out that looked and smelled terrific.  Did try my twin's bananas foster crepes and loved them.  Cafe americano with a bit of skim was so good that I had two.  Zoom zoom :-)"}
{"text":"WOW!! I usually never leave reviews, but after eating these savory crepes at what is now my new \"place of relaxation\" I just had to let everyone know of my amazing experience. First of all, when I would hear the word crepe I would always think of France; now thats all in the past! First thing that comes to mind now is The Village Coffee Shop!! I never knew that one person can make so many delicious meals out crepes... from salads on a crepe to lunch crepes and even desert crepes. Barrie and Jon were absolutely right about \"HOLY CREPE,\" the owner Marina just blows your mind with all her creativity in making sure that you get exactly what you want when you enter through the door!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding and friendly service - and looks doggy friendly - and the crepes are spot on in comparison to my favorite French made crepes of Colorado's crepes n crepes.  The coffee was amazingly delicious - had the almond milk mocha mint, highly recommended! Go visit or frequent this place!"}
{"text":"What a find . I can't decide if this is a 4 or 5 star. Since they make a lot of things from scratch it can take a bit to get a order to the table. Also I would dice the chicken in the quiche about half as larger. But that's nit picky.  The pro's. Friendly, relaxed, neighborhood place, great place to sit, have a coffee and read the paper. Off the Cave Creek touristy area so it feels like home."}
{"text":"Had the savory crepes - Chicken Caesar and Ham and Cheese.  They were delicious, even reheated (had left overs).  Friendly owner, cute shop.  Reasonable prices.  A must try when you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great service! Huge cup of coffee and my son couldn't eat the crepe fast enough. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Being a fan of small businesses, I especially loved this place with their smoothies and crepes! Not use to eating crepes I asked the cook to make me something that is sweet and popular. In Which he did.. I had a berry covered crepe and also tried their scrambled egg crepe.. Both were amazing! Their Nutella smoothie was more then a smoothie.. It was the most amazing flavors all mixed up in a bottle to help bring you back to childhood fun days! This shop was great! The service was extra ordinary.. The place is designed to be more then just inviting it's art works both me back to how I love to travel! Coming from NY where we don't eat things like crepes everyday.. It was a great experience especially because of this place I will come back again to enjoy more! I can only wish the best for this mom & pop coffee shop!"}
{"text":"HOLY CREPE....Yes, crepes are just what you and all of Metro Phoenix are missing. Our quest to discover the \"Hidden Crepe Den\" began as we entered a mostly vacant Stagecoach Village. Straight thru to the rear, turn right and park, (next to the barber shop) is where the magic happens at The Village Coffee Shop.  One of the ONLY authentic French Crepe machines within state limits is turning out award winning crepe options along with a perfect cup of coffee. We ordered one cinnamon, sugar & walnut and one savory BLT crepe to share and sipped the best Cafe Au Lait as we sat on the patio viewing Tonto National Park vistas. And, then it happened, yes, the crepes arrived and the heaven sent owner left us to enjoy each any every single morsel of crepe.  Both sweet & savory crepes were perfect = not drowning in sauce and spice.   The Village Coffee Shop is TINY and adorable with only 8 seats inside... BUT, the fabulous patio has Tonto views & heat and seats around 20. YOU must go, seek and taste what you have been missing.  The owner Marina Matatov is heaven sent creating delicious miracles."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and decided to try their crepes.  We were not disappointed.  Tried the club crepe...large enough to share...and finished with  peaches and cream...also a nice size to share.  Both were delicious.    A delightful lunch."}
{"text":"Great crepes and coffee. A special treat for my kids. Savory crepes and sweet crepes, we have tried them all. You won't be sorry you stopped here to a special treat. Plus the coffees are delicious - better than anything at Starbucks for sure! It's tucked away, but a gem nonetheless."}
{"text":"I finally got around to going here with a friend yesterday. The food was excellent! I had a gluten free savory crepe, very yummy and very gentle on the tummy! The owner is so sweet and hospitable. I can't wait to go back. I ordered tea, and the tea was made and brought to me sans tea bag; it's so refreshing to find a place that can actually make tea correctly!!!!"}
{"text":"What a gem. My favorite coffee spot in the Valley and I'm really picky. If you want great coffee, a great crepe and perfect location in the mountains....look no further.   They are also really nice ladies!"}
{"text":"Cannot say enough great things about this place! We took our relatives from France here for breakfast and also to celebrate my daughters 14th birthday. The owners went out of their way to make us all feel like family (we have 13 people total) The food was delicious, coffee was to die for (not to mention generous portions), and their ice tea was a refreshing unsweetened prickly pear (soooo...good!) They brought us not one, but two, desserts to celebrate my daughter's b-day (completely complementary). The second arrived after we all learned one of our out of town guests just recently celebrated hers. I don't find this sort of hospitality regularly these days, so when I do--I thank them from the bottom of my heart and hope others get to experience it too."}
{"text":"What a little Cave Creek Gem. Great food! I love the crepes both sweet and savory. I took one star away because the person serving you is also the cook which makes service really slow. Other than that I have nothing but great things to say."}
{"text":"The ambience here is top notch.  Very warm and accepting environment, the ladies were super friendly and accommodating and crepes are incredible.  I am also extremely picky when it comes to coffee drinks and I had one of the best mochas I have ever had, so good I had a 2nd before continuing with my day (Look Out) haha.  I will be back often and I recommend anyone in the area make this place a MUST STOP."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon and they were fairly quiet. However, the service was great and the food was good. Instead of trying their signature Breakfast Crepe, I tried the chicken Pesto and I wasn't disappointed. Great choice overall and I'll be back."}
{"text":"We had a lunch crepe and two dessert crepes. All were very good!  Coffees also great and served in those big oversized cups. Only a few tables inside so we sat outside which was fine. A nice place for a Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Love crepes so we had to try it out! They are fantastic, light and airy, perfect amount of filling and beautifully plated. Got peaches and cream and it was stunning. Also the coffee is good, which is really important, and in really big cups"}
{"text":"This relaxing, colorful, cozy cafe is a great find in the StageCoach shopping area on Cave Creek Rd.  We were there just a little after noon.  I was disappointed that they were out of their \"Quiche of the day\" so early in the lunch period.  But to our delight, the food we did order was delicious'  My husband had the apple crepe, which he thoroughly enjoyed.  I ordered the Lemon Zest crepe.  It was light, delicately flavored ( not over powered with with too much lemon) and served with freshly made whipped cream.  Loved every bite!  The Cafe Au Lait was smooth and delicious.  Be prepared to wait a bit for your crepes.... They are made to order.....but well worth the wait!  The staff is friendly and attentive.  This visit I stopped by just to have my favorite Cafe Au Lait.  It gave me the \"pick up\" I needed on this hectic day.  I hadn't intended to order anything to eat, but I saw they had homemade quiche....so I gave in and had \"brunch\"!  Their quiche has been highly touted in reviews by others, so I was eager to try some.  While tasty, light with just the right amount of bacon, unfortunately it must have been sitting for quite awhile because it was a bit dry.  The piece I had was one of the last two pieces remaining.  I am sure when the quiche first came out of the oven, it was delicious.  I will definitely add this to my list  of \"go-to\" places for breakfast or lunch.!  Today I tried the cinnamon crepe and it was very good.  If I had to choose between cinnamon or lemon zest which I had at my previous visit, I would go with the Lemon Zest for certain! This trip I decided to go for the Triple Threat which is a delightful crepe filled with bananas, strawberries and Nutella!  Excellent choice!"}
{"text":"Miss Marina makes the most amazing crepes! This one is Dijon Chicken. AHHMAZING!! And the Coffee is to die for!!! Yummm!!"}
{"text":"Really relaxing and friendly atmosphere. The crepes along with the Russian tea and latte my wife and I had were all excellent. Great job Village Coffee Shop, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Simply Fabulous.  Savory crepes are equally as delicious as the sweet.  We had Veggie crepe and the smoked salmon crepe.  Desert was the Almond Joy crepe.  Along with the perfect iced tea and EXCELLENT customer care we enjoyed one of the most delightful meals to be found in Cave Creek and Carefree.    This place is legit."}
{"text":"Possibly the best chai tea latte I have ever had! This is my go-to place. Never have had an issue with service and the employees are always so friendly. The crepes are also to die for. I never leave here disappointed!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service with no apologies.   I ordered a large almond milk latte and bagel sandwich to go. The place wasn't busy or packed with people so this shouldn't take too long.   After about 5 minutes I finally got my latte but it wasn't to go, so they had to take it back and put it in a to go cup. 15 minutes later I finally got the bagel sandwich, again not ready to go and again had to go back and get a box for it. The manager could see me looking repeatedly at my watch and could tell I was annoyed, and didn't say anything about the wait, much less thank me for my business.   The coffee was good and the sandwich was alright, but it wasn't worth a 20 minute wait.   Why are almost all coffee shops so poorly managed?"}
{"text":"This place is awsome and very intresting art .cofea is better then starbucks.most come back"}
{"text":"We have been eating at the Village Coffee Shop since it first opened at Stagecoach Village.  Their new location is spacious with a pleasant atmosphere. The crepes are made to order and well worth the wait. The homemade pastries and coffee are excellent.  My favorite is the Lemon Bar.     KUDOS TO MARINA - OWNER"}
{"text":"We have returned to The Village Coffee Shop four times since my first review. We met the owner Marina. Marina is so caring and wonderful. Each experience is consistent which is very important to us. We are extremely satisfied with all aspects of this wonderful shop. YUM! YUM! YUM! Do yourself a favor and take something home from the bakery case for later!!! Everything is homemade and delicious! Marina, thank you for all your hard work and passion to provide us with such delicious food!!"}
{"text":"----- This review is for the booth The Village Coffee Shop had at \"Taste of Cave Creek\"-----  After tasting the cakes that this place had to offer at the Taste of Cave Creek event (held 10/16 & 10/17) we cannot wait to give this location a try in full!  The chocolate layer cake was to die for with a cookie like base layer, moist chocolate cake layers, and some light whip cream style filling.  The staff that was handling the booth itself were incredibly friendly and answered all of our questions about what was what on the table.    Overall: A Can't wait to give the coffee a try too!"}
{"text":"WONDERFUL HIDDEN GEM  Ate here for lunch today. Absolutely delicious! Came with my mom and my 3 year old. Their caramel macchiato was the best I've ever had, and i don't even usually like coffee that much. Their crepes are generous in size, so it was perfect to split a savory and sweet crepe with my mom. Had the club crepe and the Nutella delight crepe. Both were fantastic and made fresh! As a bonus, they made a kids crepe in the shape of a teddy bear with fruit complimentary for us! I am a customer for life now. Can't wait to return with my husband and try more delicious creations!"}
{"text":"I've spent a total of about 9 weeks in France over 3 trips, and this is the best place I've ever found in the United States that serves crêpes.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover this little gem.  The savory crêpes are easily big enough to split with another person, so bring a friend or bring an appetite!  Also, their coffee is absolutely delicious.  Feel free to ask for something creative!!   The owner is just as sweet as the dessert crêpes as well.  :)  I hope everyone tries this place -- it's great!!"}
{"text":"Half way through my hair service at Salon Mila (across the street from The Village Coffee Shop) my stomach was growling like a angry monster locked in a closet! My stylist recommended having one of the receptionists get me a crepe from The Village and man alive, I am so glad I did! The Yin Yang crepe was honestly PERFECT. The marshmallows were melted and gooey and the banana was just warm enough to make it a comfort food! I had a hot chocolate to top it off... HEAVEN!  I went by the shop after my appointment and met Marina the owner. She was friendly and inviting, and I could tell she truly loved running the shop! I will definitely make this a regular occurrence during my hair appointments!"}
{"text":"Quiet & relaxing place to enjoy with friends and have a good conversation with friends and family. Has a French- Russian mixed selection.  There's a yummy selection of homemade baked goods. I was lucky enough to try a plum rugula with hand picked plums from Prescott."}
{"text":"I love going here for breakfast! I don't live in Arizona, but when I visit family down there we usually go here at least once. My favorite is definitely the strawberry and banana crepe. Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Love the savory and sweet crepes here! Lovely people, owner and good service. Enjoy their music choice as well. A nice place to come back to more often."}
{"text":"Wonderful crepes!  So far, I've tried two of the savory crepes and one of the dessert ones. During both my visits the staff was friendly and attentive and the crepes were fantastic."}
{"text":"Stage Coach Village can look pretty empty sometimes. But, don't pass on this one! I had the crepe with chicken and pesto. Since I've only had dessert crepes, I didn't know what to expect. But, I took the chance (I LOVE pesto) and am glad I did. It was SO good. Hubby had one with ham that he said he'd order again. The kids had nutella and strawberry ones. Everyone was happy. Without realizing it, we got there just before closing. But, we weren't rushed at all. Sitting outdoors was cozy. And, there's good music playing, too."}
{"text":"After sampling these crepes you will feel like you are in the SOUTH OF FRANCE@! Seriously, the batter, and types of crepes are so FRESH and home made that they will make you want more  Prices are reasonable but the atmosphere is fabulous.....!LOCATION IS AMAZING, TOTALLY LOVE IT THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE PLACE....DOGS WELCOME!"}
{"text":"After my initial visit in 2012, we heard the place renovated and store front changed.  We gave the Village Coffee Shop another try on a Sunday morning and the ambiance, space and location was so inviting.  My husband ordered a coffee and a sweet crepe and I had a cup of tea and a savory crepe.  Everything was delicious and attentive customer service.  We will visit again."}
{"text":"Looking forward to this small town coffee shop which uses beans roasted across the street by ROC which are great.  Well, that's the best part of this place. The decor is $20 prints of the eiffel tower and Audrey Hepburn in an attempt to look French that is as authentic as french fries. They even have electronic rotating electronic banner ads.   The $5 espresso based drinks (lattes, cappuccinos) are all made with one of those 1 touch machines. No barista to be found. This is just not a real coffee shop. Maybe their crepes are good."}
{"text":"Good food and coffee. Very expensive. 2 coffees, smoked salmon crepe, club crepe and it was just under $45. Cute place."}
{"text":"We are locals and stayed at the Carefree Conference Resort for the weekend.  We were looking for a breakfast place locally owned.  Did a search on Yelp and found this place. OMG it was terrific, we had the Breakfast Bagel Sandwich, the Crepe Omelet and the Lemon Crepe.  They were all sooooo good.  The coffee comes in these huge mugs, steaming hot and you know each cup was made individually.  We will definitely be back.  Also, the gentlemen that greeted us was very pleasant and our waiter was also.  Great job Marina for bringing crepes to this wonderful little town."}
{"text":"I love love love this place, it's definitely worth the 1/2 hour road trip for me, their crepes are to die for and best of all are their coffee drinks, the ambience is great, staff is super friendly, marina is the sweetest person ever, very humble and down to earth, had no idea she was the owner.... Have not had any crepes that come close to these, texture and flavor is just perfect, we love the Nutella strawberry banana crepe, but we always try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"First Split an omelette crepe, then split a peach crepe for desert.  The food was very good, the veranda is very peaceful with a great view.  The owner served and cooked for us.  She was very nice and very interested in making sure we were satisfied.  Definitely worth visiting for breakfast or lunch. Have to go back to try the banana nutella crepe!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy. We ordered 2 crates they were so good we shared a 3rd!!! The apple crepe and the strawberry. And the chocolate peanut butter. Yummy yummy great food. We also liked the couches and games for our toddler."}
{"text":"Wonderful crepes! And delicious Coffee drinks...way better than the chain coffee place"}
{"text":"wifi does not work   No drip coffee  You will have your coffee drank before the food order arrives.  Food is good"}
{"text":"Probably the best crepes I've ever had. I go there once a week with my dad. The staff is so friendly, the atmosphere is nice and quiet. I love the drive up there and the area. Both savory and sweet crepes are delicious. They also have the best gluten free crepes. I would highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Brilliant. Opens at 7.30 i think and despite being a little tricky to find it was wonderful. I had the best strawberry crepe of my life this morning and the service was great. There are a few tables outside and we had a lovely quiet breakfast. Definitely back tomorrow."}
{"text":"This review is based on one visit for a Sunday morning cup of coffee, and one food item - a breakfast crepe.  One was great, the other was surprising.  The great one was the crepe - freshly made and tasty on its own, with a deftly balanced filling that showcased each of the ingredients (egg, spinach, cheese).  The surprising one was the coffee.  I had a regular coffee and my wife tried the cappuccino.  Both were so watery that they had hardly any coffee taste at all.  Were it not for the color, I would have said someone forgot to add the coffee. (Sorry, I'm not exaggerating).  The cappuccino tasted like steamed milk and cinnamon.  Fortunately my wife likes steamed milk and cinnamon.    Is it possible that a coffee house could serve coffee that isn't coffee?  It's hard to believe, so maybe what we got was some kind of mistake.  I hope so."}
{"text":"Charming and delicious place to eat. I had the chai latte, and smoked salmon crepe. Several of us had the delicious lemon zest crêpe, and the Russian crêpe, which were absolutely delicious. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"BEST creps I've ever had here. Came here with my mom and we shared a breakfast crepe and the \"daily special\" pear dessert crepe and both were outstanding. Our cappuccinos were delicious as well. The owner is very sweet and welcoming and is an excellent chef. I highly reccomend The Village Coffee Shop and I know I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Zero stars would've been more appropriate. When it takes 1:10 minutes to get service and food to four people and three tables ate and left ahead of us there excuse of \"I'm sorry we were short staffed\" doesn't cut it and the food was marginal at best. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I enjoy the Matcha Smoothie, the omelets and crepes here.  Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the crepes, as I didn't order any, but this place clearly misses the mark for a coffee shop.  Watery, cold coffee that I had to ask to have microwaved.  Stale bagel.  Non-functioning Wi-fi despite 3 separate requests for clarification of the password.  Ended up using my Iphone hotspot.  Music is LOUD and not at all conducive to conversation or study."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my best friend's belated birthday. Overall, we both had a good time and we liked the crepes we ordered. I liked how the menu was split into sweet and savory crepes. However, for the price, the crepes were a bit small, very thin, and not filling. My Italian crepe was about $13, and to order another one, it would be $26... To put that in perspective, that is a bit much for just TWO crepes. I've seen crepe stands at festivals much cheaper and you know they are overpriced. Nonetheless, it was still pretty good; I am happy to support small businesses. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the iced caramel macchiato. It was more milk than coffee... But I love their yelp check-in deal. My friend didn't like her white chocolate mocha with raspberries either. Their hot coffees look promising though. I also like the atmosphere of this place. It's very spacious and comfortable and the staff was generally nice. I really like the music they play as well. I will probably come back."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have only been here about 2 or 3 times early in the morning and every time I have been here it has been amazing. The Pomegranate Tea is amazing and I definitely recommend it! The strawberries & cream and the nutella crepes are the best ones there!"}
{"text":"Another GREAT meal for another birthday celebration!  This time I had a Club Crepe and it was so yummy!  I also sampled 3 different dessert crepes and each was a delight.  My friend with the birthday can't wait to bring her sister and husband back for more crepes!"}
{"text":"Delightful crepes & excellent coffee/espresso! I love the music...old school Sinatra, rat pack era!"}
{"text":"Gone down a star since my last review. I've been here three times now. The first time was my first review. I sat outside. I was given a menu. The service was slow but friendly and my crepe was a little watery but good.   The second time I went, I got the same drink (chai latte), and a sweet crepe (lemon zest). The chai and the crepe tasted great, though the crepe seemed a bit too crispy. Again, I sat outside, was given a menu and my order was taken. Again slow service (chai was out quickly, but the crepe took forever). But I kind of expected it this time.   Third time - ... Why it went down a star.  I had decided to only go when I get my hair done right across the way, but really wanted that lemon zest crepe that day. So I made the drive. It's really not close to me. Got there, was greeted, said I was going to eat inside (a change from my last two times). She asked if I wanted a drink in the meantime, so I ordered a chai. She went to go make that, so I sat myself down in the little corner table. I had a stroller with me so sitting here pretty much blocked me in. Chai was delivered, no question about weather I was ready to order. 10min later, and after my baby started fussing and more people had arrived, she looks out over the counter and asks \"we're you going to order something?\" ... Well, yes. But not anymore since my baby is fussing now.  What's the protocol at this place? Are you supposed to order at the counter? Because I was told to find a seat and they'd bring me a menu the first two times. I assumed it was the same inside. My bad. If it were easier for me to get up I'd have gone to the counter but I was blocked in by my stroller and then trying to soothe a fussy baby. Really though, for the majority of that time I was the only person there. I didn't want to shout over to the counter to grab her attention and wake my baby. Would it have been so inconvenient to ask if I needed anything? It's not like there were other customers needing orders."}
{"text":"Always love this place. Great Coffee and Crepes! Thank goodness Cave Creek has a place that does not just serve grilled food. Charming and cute. The place is small but has a big heart. There is a barber shop that is connected to the establishment. I believe it is the owners fathers shop. I would highly recommend trying this place out. The owner may have to rent more space if more people find out about this place."}
{"text":"I have gone to this cafe twice, I was made to feel at home immediately, they are warm and welcoming and friendly. The food is sensational, I will definitely be back again. I had the veggie crepe and ate the whole thing which is rare for me. Charming, delightful, happy place, really loved being there! I loved the atmosphere of the Stagecoach Village, everything about this place is special."}
{"text":"The lady was very nice. She gave us time to look at the menu. My soy latte was yummy and had great foam. We shared a pumpkin scone! It was perfect! Spicey and soft but not crumbly. Loved it. So cute  too"}
{"text":"Went to cave creek for a quick shop and see. Somehow ended up at this shopping center and in quest for finding water we ended up here.  I ordered the green smoothie which was a pretty solid choice.  I don't think they have other options in the shopping center."}
{"text":"The staff is very nice but to no fault of their own, very slow. 10 minutes for anyone to come by with menu's, another 10 minutes for coffee... Maybe if the owner invested in a few more people (only 2 working) service would improve. The food and drinks are good, no complaints"}
{"text":"Yes! This place rocks! Friendly and relaxing place to hang out. The coffee is delicious and food is served fresh and so yummy. I wasn't too hungry today so just opted for fruit bowl. It was freshly cut fruit mixed with nuts and presented in a beautiful extra large mug. Can't wait to go back; I'm dreaming of their crepes now..."}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us were drawn in to this tiny cafe by a road side sign on our drive through Cave Creek. We had been out the night before partaking in Wild West festivities, so crepes sounded like a glorious remedy for our post-bourbon bellies. While the shop is quaint and welcoming, \"tiny\" is not to be mistaken for an exaggeration. There are 2 or 3 two-person tables inside, and about 4 tables outside, 2 of which can seat a group of our size. With 1 server and 2 crepe griddles, they were not equipped to handle a full house.   The quality of food and beverage was fair. But not enough to forgive the inordinate amount of time spent waiting for it. A simple order for black coffee took more than 20 minutes to arrive, and one of our girls ordered coffee with cream and sugar - it came with the cream and sugar already mixed in. So I guess they have a telepathic barista. As we sipped our coffee, we started feeling more alive. And as we waited for our food...and waited...the coffeee turned our stomachs into grouchy mongers demanding some sort of caloric prey to slience the wrath of a hungry hangover. Yet nothing came. After another half hour, we saw the table next to us who arrived a few mintues prior to our party finally receive out crepes. Super - so with their 2 griddles, about 15-20 minutes later we finally saw and end to the misery.   The crepes were tasty, though some were quite burned on the edges. The filling was simple and hit the spot. The wait however was exceptional. Even the most luxurious meal on the laziest Sunday morning should not call for a near 90 minute wait from sitting at your table to eating your food. Despite a smiling apology, mere words didn't really heal the pain.   My overall takeaway: don't come hungry."}
{"text":"I can't say I've ever had a crepe before, but after having one here I probably won't have one anywhere else. The latte my lady had was delicious, the breakfast crepes we both ordered were beyond incredible...the décor was modest but attractive, the location was very quaint and quiet (great for a brunch escape), the staff was friendly, prompt and courteous, and the banana bread...my goodness, the banana bread. So glad I got more than one piece since I live so far from this shop. The only negative thing I could have to say about this establishment is that it is located too far from me to be able to enjoy it more often. Have you considered relocating? To Avondale/Tolleson perhaps?"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Brought my daughter here for a crepe treat but she was more interested in the colored pencils.  Delicious crepe.  Wonderful small business here where the owner herself is making the crepes.  Limited seating though, so get there early (or late?)."}
{"text":"I eat here for lunch pretty regularly. The breakfast crepe with bacon is my jam.  Employees are friendly, and it's a great spot to hang out. Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"We visited the Village Coffee shop for the first time this morning.  The restaurant was clean, pleasant in appearance, and the weather was beautiful (there are a few outside tables).  The service was reasonable and we found everyone to be very personable.  We ordered the Breakfast Crepe and the Quiche of the day.  As much as I regret having to say it, the food was (in my view) poor.  The cheese in the Breakfast Crepe tasted very much like a Kraft American cheese slice, and the meal was generally tasteless. The Quiche was similarly unimpressive; neither of us finished the dishes.  Of all the restaurant reviews I've done, this was the most difficult because I hate being critical of such nice folks.  Perhaps they were just having an off day?"}
