{"text":"I was thoroughly disappointed.  I expected higher standards from an brand organization like Wolfgang Puck and chose that restaurant over Chillis Too that was across the lobby - big mistake. I ordered a Turkey club and received a sandwich with processed meat instead of real turkey after waiting over 10 minutes for my sandwich.  There appear to bit of disorganization chaos with the staff.  Rather than making my sandwich, one staff member spent over 2 minutes calling for a order pickup that was never picked up.  I assumed the customer had a flight to catch and couldn't wait for the confusion to clear and left.  There were 3 people making pizza while one part time person making sandwiches and doing kitchen cleanup and chores.  I'm wondering if I get the same experiences at the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"I used to work here and eat at the back at the same during work! lol SMOKED SALMON PIZZA is this place all about! Most fun work time w/ Shayna marie gano Vergara, Donald Mysz and bestest Manager Cheryl Vergara!"}
{"text":"On a trip back from Vegas I stopped in this restaurant to get something to eat because I didn't want to eat at a place like Quizno's.  Big mistake.  First the service was horrible.  I asked the cashier (no waiters) if I had to take a premade salad or if they would make one fresh for me and she insisted that I had to take a premade one if I ordered it, then the guy behind me ordered one and it was made fresh for him.  The salad was alright but still premade for a plane so it had the usual browning of the edges of the lettuce.  The pizza I ordered had a soggy crust and was drenched in olive oil.  To top it off it was piled at least an inch high with raw onions.  My friend got a pizza that had five heaping tablespoons of raw garlic on it.  WTF?  Wolfgang got his start doing upscale pizzas; he should know better.  Where is the quality control?  For twenty bucks I could have got 4 subs at Quizno's and each would have been consistently good, but at WPE, all $20 bought me was disappointment and the taste of raw onions all the way home.  Definitely skip this place."}
{"text":"We had time before our flight so I decided to get a pizza.  I wasn't expecting much from a restaurant that has the word \"express\" in its name. But this was the best farking thin crust pepperoni pizza I have ever tasted. It was piping hot with cheese goo, the right spices in the pepperoni married with a flavorful sauce. I really didn't want to share it with Hubby but we didn't have time to get another. My tummy was happy on the flight to Portland."}
{"text":"The food was not bad, but it wasn't special - especially for the cost. They also don't seem to have a strong customer focus as I had a lot of annoyed eye contact while leaning against the wall before anyone bothered to take an order.  I'll try Swiss Chalet next time for sure."}
{"text":"Was so happy with the quality of food here that I had to write a review.   On a long layover I was desperate for something fresh and delicious. So desperate in fact that I decided to make the trip over from terminal C to terminal D (fyi it's near gate D17). Decor is not particularly exciting and it has a kind of lame sports bar vibe, but don't let that deter you from ordering the delicious (albeit a touch pricey) food.   I had just come off a week of junk eating so I was ridiculously happy to see their various salad choices. I skipped over the meaty salad options and decided on something a little lighter ie. kale and quinoa salad. Sounds leafy and terribly boring? To each their own, but this salad gave me life. A nice hearty serving of fresh kale and other finely chopped veg dressed with just the right amount of tangy and bright tasting dressing. I was in salad heaven...yummmmm.  It's not a perfect five because of the lame decor, the paper plate and plastic utensils (hello! for that price I want at least some form of ceramic and metal composite) and the millenial service."}
{"text":"The siblings and I were bummed out that we didn't get to have Wolfgang Puck's legendary pizzas in Vegas before leaving. But, as soon as we saw this at the airport hungry and with time to kill we knew we just HAD to have it. The lady at the register seemed to be new but the pizza's were out in no time. I got to see them be made and everything.   The three of us split a Margherita Pizza and a BBQ Chicken Pizza. They were awesome for being \"airport\" food."}
{"text":"I have to review help others make wise choices and so if possible people think twice about spending hard earned dollars here. the chicken alfredo taste like watered down cream soup and nothing like alfredo. also the chicken was probably dehydrated chicken cubes. not sure how to attach a pic but you can't even see a thick alfredo look. the cook looked very depressed probably because no one likes the food."}
{"text":"I intend to eat here tomorrow.  I first experienced this chain at SEATAC in Seattle and I was blown away not just because it provided a very nice dining experience but that it was in an airport where normally food is the same ghastly stuff served along the 401 Hwy in Ontario.  The exprience was not perfect at SEATAC:  some tables were left uncleaned and the atmosphere was a-la McDonalds.  But all is forgiven when IN AN AIRPORT one can experience really good food at embarrasingly low prices with fast, friendly service.  What more could you want in an airport?"}
{"text":"Compared to other airport food, Wolfgang Puck is usually my preferred choice when I travel. Ordered the rigatoni bolognese and the butternut squash soup. The pasta is ok, nothing special. The sauce is not as thick as I would like it to be.  However, I do love the butternut squash soup. It's creamy, with a delicate balance of savory and sweetness to it. Bill came to a total of $27. Not cheap but the quality is definitely much better that most airport food."}
{"text":"I'm talking about the Wolfgang Puck express in gate D.   I ordered a Greek salad and the lettuce looked and tasted like it was a week old.  The tomatoes seemed to have been dipped in vinager for days.  It was disgusting.  Doesn't this company have quality control?"}
{"text":"Thank your Austrian stars for this delicious lunch spot, a welcome reprieve from the banality of hospital food. Located in a great alcove of the beautiful Seidman Cancer Center, this place boasts great natural light and a very modern atmosphere. The service is commendable and the staff are friendly and efficient! Reasonably priced and delicious too, I highly recommend Herr Puck's casual fine dining establishment.  Now for the menu: Roasted Turkey Sandwich: delicious; salt and sweet with caramelized onions. It comes with a salad or fries. I love both. The salad is fresh and has a little baguette sliver with I think goat cheese on it. Yum. And their fries rock. I mean they're fries but so worth the calories. Isn't that the whole point? To make the calories worthy of the fat? Chicken Pesto Sandwich: cold and a little on the bland side. Not my fav. My favorite is the Cavatappi Chicken Alfredo: It's a rich alfredo parmesan waterfall over squiggly pasta with peas, bacon and chicken. My heaven is made of cheese so when the cashier recommended this, I hopped on it like a kangaroo. This pasta-god is the reason I have not tried more items on their menu because I just can't stop ordering it. Believe me, worth every last serving of unsaturated fat. I wish I could pour that cheesy sauce over everything. On steak? YES. On Pizza? Hell yess. On Cereal? Don't mind if i do. Just pour some on that plate there and I'll just lick it off.  I recommend you try other things on the menu and then let me know so I can know what to order next time should I stray from my love for the cavatappi."}
{"text":"When you're a UH employee and you forgot to bring your lunch, this place makes a nice change from the cafeteria food.  While I would say it's a little overpriced for what you get, it's still pretty good quality food, and I've always had good service.  I quite like the build-your-own pizzas, and people rave over the chicken tenders (never had them myself).  Their sandwiches are pretty good, too.  The only thing I would recommend *not* getting is the meatloaf; it's been a while since I've had it, so it may have changed, but I thought it was more like a meat brick wrapped in gooey, uncooked bacon.   Other than that, it's a decent option."}
{"text":"What a disappointment, the food was bland and the pastas were watery and sloppy looking.... Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. They have a very small and misleading menu different than on their actual site for the express menu. Server was rude and didn't care. We walked out. Not worth the time. Stay away. Plenty of other choices in the airport."}
{"text":"Got a $10 ham sandwich from the airport on Sunday.  Wasn't very good and ended up getting food poisoning the next day.  Thanks for starting my week on a good note."}
{"text":"Located at Terminal 1 at Pearson International Airport, it's one of the few places at the terminal that serves hot meals before entering the security check point.      If anyone is familiar with Wolfgang Puck's expertise in cuisine, the two recognized signature thin-crusted pizza and rosemary chicken are available at the terminal.  Like any traveler who is on the go, I ordered what I thought would be the simplest meal to eat, without using a knife and fork, the pepperoni pizza.   For a personal size pizza (the size of a picnic plate), it is  tasty. There is more cheese than crust as it should be with thin-crusted pizzas. Although, they could have added a bit more pepperoni if they're going to charge just below $10.   The butternut squash soup is served with a larger bowl is tasty and filling.    As for service, it could do better. The woman who served food could be more polite and helpful. It looked like she was not happy serving food to customers at all. A smile is always welcome to a weary and hungry traveler.  However, the young male cashier was friendly and polite and showed effort in helping the customer feel satisfied, especially when I had to wait for a few more minutes for them to pick up the pizza from the oven.   The time it took for the pizza to cook in the brick oven was quick and was served to me just as I finished paying at the cashier approx. 3 minutes."}
{"text":"I am so glad that we are finally getting amazing restaurants here in Cleveland, and this is one of them. I went here one day while my father was in Seidman Cancer Center and was most beneficial. It is a great way to get away from the awful hospital food by Aramark, and before that was that was available.   I went with the signature Grilled Turkey Sandwich with French Fries, and was most delighted with the results. The turkey was cooked to perfection and so were the french fries. The ambiance is quiet yet elegant, a quick reprieve from the relentless hustle and bustle of being in a hospital. The prices are fair, and if you ever find yourself near the place, I would definitely recommend checking it out for a quick lunch or dinner. Yes, I would definitely eat here again even if my father were not at Seidman Cancer Center."}
{"text":"Never again.  SLOW, very, very slow. The clerk should have told us when we ordered that it would take almost 45 minutes for our order. Not in an airport!  Pizza was OK, but nothing special - even after the lengthy wait.  I've had much better at other airports, but will most definitely skip the one in the Las Vegas airport in the future."}
{"text":"Turkey melt is great here. During the busy time like lunch expect to wait anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Just had the Italian meats sandwich and it was delicious. A little pricey but it's an airport. Flight delayed and was the best option as far as healthy (compared to most other options at airport), quality and convenience."}
{"text":"Great place to get a bite near gate d17. Fast and not  cold. Cal pizza kitchen took 30 min before they attempted to take our order. This was fast, friendly and fresh. Maybe the best kept secret in terminal 1 d gates."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a terminal at the McCarran Airport.  The bartender was fantastic. Nice, attentive and quick with our drinks (Love that!)  I ordered a pizza and my husband got a sandwich. The prices are very reasonable for airport food and the food was fresh, I just didn't care for my pizza.  I ordered the Margarita pizza and it was basically a cheese pizza with a teeny tiny bit of basil. The center of the pizza had some sort of drizzle or oily goo on it. It was too greasy for me and rather bland, definately not what I was expecting. It also didn't have any sauce or tomatoes. But, you may like it.  the drinks are great."}
{"text":"The food is pretty decent here they have chicken and mashed potatoes very good and your soups are excellent the meatloaf is very good and the rest of the food is good too little high and in price"}
{"text":"Don't eat here unless you want to get food poisoning. I ordered the turkey and white cheddar sandwich and I've never gotten so sick in my life..... there are so many restaurants at the airport stay clear of this one!"}
{"text":"I love Wolfgang, but our experience at this Wolfgang Puck Express was a fail.    Believe the reviews when they say this place is not quick.  Believe the reviews that say the quality is poor for the price.  But above all else know that THEY HAD NO MUSTARD FOR MY HUSBAND'S HAM AND CHEESE SANDWICH!!!  How can you serve a grilled ham and cheese sandwich and not have mustard?  So they do not have mustard and will not take the sandwich back, and my husband is all, \"if you don't have mustard I don't want the sandwich.\"  UGH!  We try not to eat tasty garbage (garbage being unhealthy food full of salt, nitrates, fats, chemicals, etcetera) but when we do eat garbage, we want to enjoy it.  \"Without mustard, I am not going to enjoy this; why would I eat it?\"  He has a valid point.  Solution, he ends up walking up to the diner in the terminal hub, filling his hand with mustard from a mustard bottle, and bringing it back to the Express to eat his sandwich.  I wish I had thought to take a picture of my husband's hand with a big ass puddle of mustard in it.    I cannot recommend to you this Wolfgang Puck Express."}
{"text":"I was surprised at all the negative reviews on here but I've never tried to eat here.  This is my normal stop in Concourse D on my way home.    They make a nice stiff drink here and while it's not cheap it's not over the top for an airport bar.  On this day, last Thursday, we waited until we saw a table open up.  The bar was jammed and the bartender was making drinks as fast as she could.  The YS was holding down the table and our carry on luggage at the table as I went up to the bar.  I placed an order as she checked my ID for legal age and then informed me that she would need to see the ID of the other person drinking.  Hey, I get it there are cameras watching her every move, gotta go by the book.  I went back and got his driver's license and that was good enough.  I said, \"See he's old enough to know better, too.\"  She said, \"Yeah, that really takes the fun out of it doesn't it.\"  Heehee.  Two drinks and under $25 with tip.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"A pre-made sandwich from a refrigerator case and a bottle of water for my 5 hour flight was just under $20. Not unusual for airport pricing. Turkey club sandwich was just okay, hard bread topped with a ton of avocado, which made for a messy mid-flight meal.   I vaguely remember having a burger here once during a flight delay at their dine-in counter, and it was unremarkable. Might be better for liquid libations instead."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick lunch today. If you want a hot meal, you can order from the menu on the wall by the cash register or call ahead of time and pay at the register if you don't want to wait. Another option is the the Grab-n-Go area for cold foods like salads, sandwiches, fruit cups, and yogurt parfait a.m. I picked up a Chinois Chicken Salad, in the Grab-n-Go Area, and it cost a little over $9. The portion size was just right for a light lunch, and the salad and chicken tasted fresh as expected. I appreciate how all of the additions to the salad were packaged in separate containers (I.e. The cashews, the Pickled ginger, the crispy fried wonton strips, and the vinaigrette dressing). Also the pickled ginger was a unique addition to the salad, and really gives the meal a nice kick to the flavor, especially when mixed in the dressing. I think this place is a nice alternative to the Atrium cafe within University Hospitals, and the dining area is surrounded by glass windows that allow lots of sunshine and a scenic view. There was plenty of seating in the area after the lunch rush hour - I went around 1pm on a weekday. I have yet to try the hot food options, but overall I think this restaurant is a good choice for lunch!"}
{"text":"I work at UH and go here for lunch on special occasions. Any food I've had is really good but it is just far too expensive for lunch and given the area it is in. You can easily pay $15 for a to-go meal. I used to always get the grilled chicken sandwich but they removed it from the menu and now have a pesto chicken (its like a chicken salad mix) sandwich so since they removed that grilled chicken sandwich there really isn't any healthy lunch options outside the salads which is disappointing. The black bean soup is very good."}
{"text":"Why are people so unfriendly these days.  No smile. No acknowledgment. I hate to say it but maybe it's time to try another country. People just seem so miserable. Maybe places could have an upcharge if you want pleasant service."}
{"text":"What a horror.  Stopped by this location in terminal D for a bite.  Before I could sit down I had to clean the table of the debris left by the previous diner.  In addition, the menu contained the remnants of old lettuce and mayonnaise.  This was filth over and above what you might expect at an airport eatery.  I can only imagine the filth in the kitchen if the public eating area was kept in such an unsanitary condition.  It was enough for me to pass on ANY Puck location in the future."}
{"text":"They should a get zero for this pizza, you can throw a stick anywhere and nyc and get better pizza than this. It was bland and soggy. Worse part is you expect bad, but when airport Pizza Hut can smash Wolfgang pizza... it's a sad day."}
{"text":"Probably the rudest bartender I have ever met. It's 0030 and she stated she was closed. Sign says 0100. Numerous people wanting service but she was to busy cleaning up. My advice stay away!!!!!"}
{"text":"I grabbed dinner here before my return flight back home. Seeing I have never been to a Wolfgang puck resto before, I couldn't miss out on this opportunity. Located near gate D17, this express counter has a fast food counter, complete bar and seating area. The menu compromises of pasta, wraps, pizzas and salads. I picked the odd one out at the menu ordering a WP burger (4/5) with white cheddar, herbed aioli, remounted (sauce similar a thousand island dressing as explained by the chef). Burger was 15$ with tax. The beef patty was thick and juicy, with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and sweet pickles. Very filling!"}
{"text":"You're going to have to wait 15 minutes for whatever you decide to order so keep that in mind if you arrive late to the airport. The pizza is good and the butternut squash soup is my favorite during the winter. As far as airport food goes it's pretty good for the price. I also love that if I'm in a hurry I can grab a pre-made salad from the to go fridge."}
{"text":"After a night of partying and rolling balls at EDC, this was the place to go to before an 11am flight.  Their Rigatoni Alfredo pasta was the dankest that's ever laid in my mouth. Creamy rich sauce, & tender pasta, mushroom, chicken and goat cheese. It felt like that was the first time I've eaten all weekend (which is probably true).."}
{"text":"Salad yummy. Sandwich not so much. 24 dollars for a sandwich, salad and drink. The salad was worth the 10 dollars, sandwich not so much? Shared with the hubby and was enough food to keep us full!"}
{"text":"This is a Wolfgang Puck restaurant or his food at least? Ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza and wow this is what I get - unimpressive crust and a very oily mess. I know I'm at an airport, but there are restaurants putting out very good fare. And 7 people working to make his food . . . I'll make the extra walk to get a better quality meal when I fly out of here again"}
{"text":"The chicken fingers with fries and ranch dressing are amazing!!! This is my go-to to for quick lunches. The chicken ceasar salad is also good, though fairly expensive. I think a large salad with chicken (which really is not very large) is $10-$12. The chicken fingers are $9ish for the large. Very busy at lunch time, worth calling ahead for both dine- in and carry out."}
{"text":"Stopped by before our flight out with a coworker.  I had the Chinois Salad and friend had the Tortilla soup. All was great and they had a nice selection of beer at the adjacent bar."}
{"text":"Bottom Line:  It's my Go-To when I have a quick turn at the LAS Airport.  The first time I stopped there I was in a rush.  I asked the guy what can I get quick?  He said an egg sandwich.  I thought \"It's a little late in the day for that......\"  forgetting that I was on West Coast time. Well I'm always up for breakfast so I said sure.  Dagnabit - when he told me how much $11.25 - I thought \"Well they got me this time but I'll never fall for that again!\" I was wrong! I have willingly and cravingly (yes, it's a word!) been back several times.  The sandwich comes on 2 HUGE slices of sourdough toast.  The egg is cooked perfectly - not hard and not running down your fingers runny. Perfectly melted cheese and ham (optional).  It also comes with some very tasty breakfast home fries.  I've had a salad with chicken and was very disappointed.  A lot of lettuce and the chicken tasted way pre-made, no pizzaz whatsoever.  The pizza is also very good.   I see a lot of people get on the flights with some great looking sandwiches.  If it's a flight that I haven't gotten off and grabbed something for myself, I spend the first half of the flight having a severe case of food envy!!  Yes, it's a little more than I like to spend on a fast meal but the quality is well worth it - especially in an airport.  Hmmmmmm, let me check my schedule - when am I back in LAS"}
{"text":"Go to California Pizza Kitchen instead.   When we got there, there were no customers. We ordered a sandwich and a pizza. The Wolfgang Puck Express employee said it would be 10 minutes. 15 minutes in and there were 3 employees standing around not cooking our food, 30 minutes later, they gave us two pizzas. The cashier took our order wrong. Since the receipt said two pizzas, we were stuck. They didn't even offer to make the sandwich we wanted.   When we started eating the pizzas, they were so soggy and wet, we couldn't pick up the slices. Had to eat them with a fork and knife.     Not happy."}
{"text":"I love Wolf Gang Pucks restaurants and have been to many, I have even met the man. I never think twice when going into a Wolfgang restaurant, including the airport restaurants. From the moment I arrived the bartender was not only rude but had the personality of stale bread. I even heard him muttering sarcastically \"I love my job\" which it was apparent the entire time that quite the opposite was true. The menu listed several items without stating there was meat in them, being a vegetarian I delighted to see an item that only listed veggies and cheese. Only problem it came out with chicken on it. I pointed it out after picking all of the chicken out and he shrugged and said that I was the only person to have ever brought it up. He was not accommodating in any way, not even an apology.   I observed him interacting with other customers, has attitude was snide, snotty, and all topics he brought up with either negative, completely downing Las Vegas (where he grew up) or making fun of the obvious lack of selection at this shame of an airport eatery. I shake my head."}
{"text":"While I have dined at Wolfgang Puck's full-service restaurants and loved the experience, I never believed I'd be a fan of his express locations. Especially since I've never been a fan of his canned products in the grocery store and assumed his food at WPE would exactly the same. Boy, was I WRONG!  His WPE location in Terminal 1 (behind section B) at Pearson Airport is absolutely incredible! On 3 occasions, I've experienced nothing less than stellar food - breakfast, lunch, and dinner. His famed Chinois Salad, served pre-packaged is nothing short of the Chinois Salad served at his full service restaurants. The cabbage is fresh, the chicken seasoned perfectly, and wontons crisp. I figured the wontons would be disappointing given I grabbed my salad out of their crisper, but no - their texture was perfect. Just the right crunch to add a little snap, crackle, and pop to an already amazing salad.  If you're a pizza fan, consider yourself in luck! They have a pizza oven at the far right corner and your pizza is made fresh - thin, crispy crust with just the right amount of char. Who would have ever thought you could get this in an airport?! I actually allow myself extra time before every trip so I can be sure to stop by this spot and eat before my flight - no matter what time of day it is. I highly recommend others do the same!"}
{"text":"Since we didn't get a chance to eat at one of Wolfgang Puck's restaurants while in Las Vegas, we decided to grab a bite from the express counter at the airport on our way back. The staff was polite and let us take our time in deciding . We got the chicken burger which was not the usual chicken breast . Instead it was a chicken mince patty with spices. There was an avocado based sauce in the burger, however it was a little dry. The Ham & Swiss was grilled to perfection. The bread was so fresh!! It was a generous portion of ham and cheese.  There is a bar attached which makes it a nice place to chill at before hopping on a flight."}
{"text":"THE BEST CAESAR SALAD!!   The romaine is crisp and fresh, the dressing is like no other , the chicken has a nice kick to it, the shaved parmesan is an added bonus not like your spaghetti store bought parmesan, croutons are nice and buttery.  I also love their 4 cheese pizza ... what can I say? I love cheese! With pesto sauce, goat, fontina, mozzarella and parmesan cheese, with tomatoe.  Their soups are also yummy - Tortilla and Butternut Squash!  Also try their breakfast potatoes, freshly diced potatoes marinated in olive oil, green and red bellpeppers, salt and peper, dash of garlic overnight then grilled and sauteed over open flame stove. Nicely seasoned!  Not too bad for an airport restaurant. Oh did I mention they make their dough fresh? Tossed and kneaded ? You hardly see that anywhere plus cooked in a brick oven? Sweet!"}
{"text":"We come to Vegas a lot and tried most of the dining options in the D gates and this is the best food I ate by far!  Also I had a real martini made be a bar lady so if you are looking a good drink this is a nice surprise!  This is why I gave a 5 star. It would be better if it was a comfortable restaurant but until then!   The only suggestion is that the sandwich we ordered was supposed to be a grilled sandwich and it was not! Just make sure when ordering!"}
{"text":"Again, it's an airport in dirty Vegas.  However I am a little shocked zzaat za Vooolfgang has putz his namen on zzees piece of scheiza."}
{"text":"My first puck experience other than pizza. What s lame disappointment.   I'm writing this half hour after arriving. I cannot get attention of the waitress to get a drink.   The cook does not know what's in the food ( diet issue).   Just a mess. Pretty much a low end chain so not sure why he's so popular."}
{"text":"$9.92 for 2 fruit salads that were not fresh, so in the garbage they went. I had to run to catch my flight or else I'd go back and rip the Puckin cashier a new one."}
{"text":"Had the American breakfast. Was served in an open plastic container that kept sliding on the table. Potatoes were soggy, bacon and sausage were just ok. The butter, wrapped in it's little package, was hidden under the eggs. Very very sloppy."}
{"text":"I ate at this place for breakfast while passing through the airport so I can only report on the breakfast.  Thankfully the menu had omelette options, so I was pretty sure of a good meal.  I wasn't convinced that the cooks understood gluten, but still, an omelette is pretty safe.  I did have to keep a careful eye on the cooks though, because one was about to dump some (likely gluten-coated) potatoes on my omelette and I had to yelp so she didn't.  My only available side was raw tomato slices."}
{"text":"Well it was close to my gate and had fresh ingredients- unfortunately they made salad after salad in the same used metal bowls - who knows how long they had been using those bowls? I was there at 8pm - all day? With dressing and food bits left in each bowl waiting for the next salad... My stomach is turning."}
{"text":"Is this a law in Nevada?  This morning I ordered take out and was told it would take 15 mins.  So thought no problem, I'll wait at the bar which has 12 seats of which 2 were occupied. I did this Add not to take up their tables... As I sat down I was asked what I'd like to drink... I informed the lady bartender who was also restocking items... I'm just waiting for my order... And was told I can't sit at the bar... No other suggestions... Not a good service experience. Assuming it is a law... they should have offered to seat me at a table or point me to some where to wait.  Hoping the food will fair better.  $20 lunch..."}
{"text":"Okay food with fast-food quality service, a fast food feel bundled with sit-down restaurant prices. It defiantly fed me, but I have been to Denny's that had better service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wolfgang Puck Express is one of the few dining options in the D gates at McCarran that sounds remotely appetizing. But, if you decide to dine there or get food to go be prepared to wait. My pizza took about 15 minutes and when it gets really busy don't be surprised if your wait is longer. It's also common to see confrontations between staff and customers. During my last visit I saw two different customers lose their cool because they didn't get their pizza sooner. So, if you're in a hurry dine elsewhere.   The food itself was disappointing. The crust on my pepperoni and mushroom pizza was limp and the toppings slid right off after picking up the first slice. Maybe I should have waited for it to cool down and for the cheese to congeal before eating. What was worse was seeing the huge pool of grease in the center of the pizza. I needed about five napkins to soak it all up.   I've had decent food from this particular WP Express before, so I won't rule out a return visit. But, this last experience was a fail."}
{"text":"when you have the option of terrible cafeteria food vs terrible wolfgang puck food, both overpriced, both not very healthy, you go for the classier join of course, and that's wolfgang. here at least the menu sounds more appetizing, if not the food itself. quinao and bean salad.  arugula and something or other. meatloaf sandwich.  it all gives me heartburn.  their recent change in menu has even more limited options. at least they kept the only the i actually like, the butternut squash soup. i'm pretty sure that has abut a stick of butter in each 10 oz cup though.  maybe i'm complaining too much. at least there is the option of this as an alternative to the caf!"}
{"text":"Soup was oookk, but pizza was greasy and not good, waste of money.."}
{"text":"good, fairly consistent food  I recommend the mushroom pizza, the chicken tenders, and the meatloaf chicken tenders are super crisp on the outside, super juicy and tender on the inside  stay away from the 4 cheese pasta (or the chicken bacon one). just way too bland.. and for a pasta that tastes like it is cooked primarily with heavy cream, way over priced  all the sandwiches are great as well!  usually really busy during lunch on weekdays quality of food is a little weak on weekends  but your safest bet is the chicken tenders for sure. ps- it comes with salad, fries, and 3 sauces to dip :)  OH i forgot to mention, they have GREAT tortilla soup"}
{"text":"Great place to get a quick bite to eat between flights.  Problem was I wasn't sure what exactly what I wanted.  I browsed the shelves and looked at the menu.  I wanted a pizza but didn't want to look like a huge pig eating a pizza by myself and I knew I wouldn't be able to take it with me on my flight.  I opted for the turkey avocado wrap.  Great mixture of flavors wrapped up in that tortilla.  The avocado was nice and fresh, the bacon was cooked to perfection and I couldn't get enough of the turkey.  I wanted more of it after I finished.  But I restrained.  If I ever stop in this airport again, I'll definitely stop in at this spot again and make sure to sample more."}
{"text":"This Wolfgang Puck Express is located in Concourse D. There aren't that many food options here so you take what you can get.  I got the Turkey Club sandwich for $12. It's pretty expensive yes but I thought the food was not bad. They toast the bread. The meat tastes fresh. They also give you chips which is $2 anyway so I guess the sandwich is closer to $10."}
{"text":"Not my first choice.  If you are waiting for a flight in this part of the D concourse and you've got the Puck or Chili's and you just want breakfast. . . well, no wonder I stood in line here.    I don't see breakfast pizza at a ton of places.  Breakfast pizza makes me think of  Boston, where I first had the experience of pizza dough, beaten egg, and breakfast-y type toppings.  It isn't a bad concept.  I opted for the sausage breakfast pizza, especially since the other pizzas (pepperoni, four cheese) were $2.00 more and not in my palate at that time of the morning.  They do a good job balancing the egg and the cheese here, plus throw on some juicy baby tomato slices to counteract the sausage.  The poor staff at Wolfgang Puck Cafe were absolutely slammed, so props to them for managing the crowds and cranking out the pizza.  Still, they could barely keep up with stocking napkins and wiping the tables down was not part of the package.  I doubt that I'd eat here again. . . unless I'm caught between them and that other chain."}
{"text":"So you know the drill, late-night flight and hungry, everything was closed and so Wolfgang Puck Express was it. This is the one in the D gate area of McCarran Airport.  Long story short, we ordered two Caesar salads, one with chicken and one without, a sirloin burger and 3 sodas. Total... \"Drumroll Please\" $52.00. I mean I know we are talking about airport food and that it is normally pricey but WTF!!! Completely overrated, salads were subpar with way too much dressing. The waitstaff looked miserable and have extremely poor customer service skills. I learned my lesson this time and will not repeat it! Gosh darn you Wolfgang Fcuk you robbed me! (See Receipt for Proof) I want you to be well prepared price wise so you can know beforehand what price range you're looking at."}
{"text":"This Wolfgang Puck Express (WPE) is an embarrassment to the Wolfgang Puck, and even the WPE brand names. NEVER COME HERE!  The restaurant was completely empty (shocking), with two cooks sitting idle during the downtime. As one of the only two people in the restaurant, I order a pizza to go, and take a seat while it is freshly cooked for me (or so I expected). One of the cooks gets up, and starts to make... something. I know a pizza can take a while to cook, so I take a seat and relax. Finally, 20 minutes later, the chef in the kitchen calls a number... it's not mine. It's a sandwich... for the other person in the restaurant.   The guy who ordered this sandwich was sitting at the bar getting drinks from the bartender. He was so drunk he couldn't walk all the way to get his sandwich, so he starts leaning against the walls dragging himself to the counter. He obviously can't make it back to the bar with his sandwich, so the bartender helps him carry it. When he sits down to eat his sandwich, he falls out of his bar stool, and pulls his sandwich down with him. It lands on his face... juicy side down.  After waiting 20 minutes, I found out they hadn't even started making my pizza yet. 35 minutes later I actually get it, and it's totally burnt beyond recognition. The service staff told me to fuck off and deal.  Awesome. This restaurant should be shut down."}
{"text":"Kudos to the bar staff at this location.  I have to admit I dined at another restaurant, but needed some alcoholic beverage to bring me from hang over to normal.    Sat at the bar and both bartenders (I have unfortunately forgotten their names) were a hit!  They were so comical and fun, it was like seeing a \"Dueling Pianos\" but bartender style.  The female of the duo wore glasses and she was a riot!  Very comical.  Snappy come backs but not sarcastic.  That's hard to do.    The pizzas ordered by the folks sitting next to me honestly looked mouth watering.  If back at Las Vegas I'm so here waiting for my flight out."}
{"text":"We are staying at the Courtyard by Marriott across the street. This place is a hidden secret because its located in the University Hospital (Street floor - Seidman Cancer Center). There are very few choices fro a quick (good) breakfast in the area. We have had a great breakfast here every morning for the last week."}
{"text":"This place is anything but express. The guys working are just goofing off and making mediocre food. When the food was ready, they called out people's name so quietly what seemed like on purpose. Worst service. But what else do you expect from an airport."}
{"text":"The Sirloin Burger is delicious! Mouth watering delicious! Though yes there is a wait. It takes about 10-15 minutes for food to come out. Hey you can't rush fresh food!"}
{"text":"Not sure how I missed the fact that it's located inside of the cancer center. Parking was just hard to find. In guessing this is a place you dine if you are visiting the hospital and want a quick bite to eat. Non the less the turkey melt was tasty and my friend enjoyed her salmon."}
{"text":"The food was great but had a bad experience. Ordering 2 meals and going back to order a second will get the manager inferring if are trying to skim a second dish for free. I will not eat here again. Go to Chilis."}
{"text":"Wolfgang Puck shouldn't endorse this place!   I took my girlfriend here before our flight to the east coast and I was not impressed. We ordered 2 hamburgers , no fries, and 2 beers .. $50 and 20 min later we got our burgers. We went to sit down and eat and the blood coming out of my girlfirend's burger was pouring out onto her plate... it was UNDERCOOKED!    We took her burger back to very snide manager and we were told they would \"Refire it\" , It must have been at least 10-15 minutes later and we hear the manager yelling at us to come get our burger!!! How rude!   This place was over priced with terrible service and way too \"Express\" if they cant let a burger finish cooking!     Yuck!"}
{"text":"I am very sad to say this is my first negative post I have ever posted on Yelp. We arrived 45 min early to our gate before our flight left so we thought we would grab a drink and maybe an app before our flight. We sat at the bar at 4:50. We didn't get acknowledged and the bartenders even went right next to us to clear the spot from the previous customer and to retrieve their tip. We waited 30 min and finally just decided to leave from being neglected. Worst service I have ever had. Simple eye contact or an \"I'll be right with you\" would have been better than nothing. Instead the bartenders were just talking with each other and ignoring us. I will never be giving my money to this company or referring it."}
{"text":"As an animal lover, it's great to see genuine service dogs assisting the handicapped. However, I find it extremely inappropriate to bring a \"psychological comfort\" dog, sans any service dog cape, into a dining establishment. I'm pretty sure that the only exception to \"no animals\" where food is prepared and served, is to service dogs. It is inappropriate that the staff chose to ignore the dog who was both begging for my food and barking at the staff member who was clearly afraid of it."}
{"text":"Mixed review about this restaurant.  Tasty food, well prepared.  Pricey, but close to being appropriate for the quality of food.  Dining room is limited in size.  No outside areas around it to sit and eat.  If I worked here, could not afford eating here every day.  If I was a patient, likewise.  Service was a bit inconsistent as well.  They have ready to go cold sandwiches and salads.  You order the hot entrees and they bring it to your table.  There was inconsistent delivery in my group, with one person having to ask for their order again.  The food was good, generous portions, well seasoned and prepared.  OK if you are in the area, but not worth a special trip."}
{"text":"We travel often and sometimes stop in Las Vegas between flights to the East Coast or Midwest. I know there will be a longer leg ahead, so I will pick up food to eat on the plane.   The options at this airport are limited to fast food or sit down restaurants, so I decided to pick up a salad and sandwich for our dinner on the flight. Healthier options.   I picked the Italian sandwich on Ciabatta bread with olive tapanade and the butterleaf lettuce salad. Both were great and easy to take and eat later."}
{"text":"Located inside the cancer hospital this restaurant actually takes you away from feeling like you're inside a hospital.  They have a great selection of salads and sandwiches.  I enjoyed the meatball sandwich with a side salad. They also have delicious pizzas - I have not had one that I have not loved.  Meals are about 10-15$.  Definitely a better option than most hospital cafes."}
{"text":"Gross! We stopped at the Wolfgang Express in the airport before out flight, only to find out the swanky name didn't measure up to the food or service. Service was slow and rude. Food was premade and extremely unhealthy for no reason. My sandwich was filled with saturated fat and like 2,500mg of Sodium, 105% daily value. I can understand if it tasted amazing, but it didn't. Never again Wolfy. You stay on QVC, and I'll stay away from your restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that this place was a huge disappointment. The drinks at the bar were well made, and thats the only good thing I can say about the place.  We ordered a pizza and two soups. The butternut squash soup was ok, but nearly indiscernible from the premade soup available at trader joes. The tortilla soup was lacking in both seasoning and texture. The pizza was the worst, ridiculously greasy and had too much chess and the dough may have been cooked through but was soaked with grease."}
{"text":"Pizza is always good here can't go wrong with that. Service is fast in and out and for an airport this is a great place to sub out the nasty fast food The Bolognese very good to and the pizza is delish."}
{"text":"For lunch I grabbed a small container of fruit and a baby kale and quinoa salad.  I can't say either one was drop dead amazing, but the portions were ample and it was nice to find a healthy lunch option in a land of fast food places and sports bars catering to students."}
{"text":"I am rarely one to complain, especially about airport food, but this Italian Bistro sandwich is possibly one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had. If the soggy, thickly cut white bread masked by the name \"sough dough\" doesn't turn you off, the herbed mayo slapped onto the outside of it definitely will - and earn you a few crumpled napkins. If you dare to continue, ignore the mediocre cold cuts inside and just eat the side of chips. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Generally, the staff and food are great! I'm here every couple weeks because I fly so much. I  love that I can get a Sam Adams Boston lager on draft. The bartender Sean has the personality of a door knob, unless of course, you are a beautiful girl dressed to the nines."}
{"text":"There's not much to choose from between here, Starbucks, and Chili's To-Go but this place def looks more appetizing, especially if you want to grab something to go.  Chicken Caesar Salad: Must Grab! This is so delicious, with what looks to be fresh Parm, crunchy Croutons and thick delicious Caesar Salad dressing. Very Fresh!  Butternut Squash Soup: Grab! Very rich and creamy. Mmm!  Asian Chicken Salad: Pass! Tasted bland.  The staff is always friendly and funny."}
{"text":"What's with all the bad reviews? I tried this place because of the name behind it. I had the turkey club sandwich and baby kale and quinoa salad. The salad was ok , it had raisins and cheese which was different but overall not mind blowing. The sandwich on the other hand was close your eyes and enjoy every morsel in your mouth good. I'm not sure if it was the crisp bacon, guac, bread or \"special sauce\" but that was a damn good sandwich. This place is a bit pricey but you gotta consider the location and the brand. I definitely want to try a restaurant location now, just hope he moves up to the bay. :)"}
{"text":"I am not sure why people are complaining about the wait. I know it's an airport, but do you want your food pre-made? And it took about 15 minutes, not like 40 minutes. I sat at the bar. ..I honestly am not a big Wolfgang Puck fan, and never had anything impressive by him.. Frankly, I don't get why he's famous. Also, this place is at an Airport, so I guess I didn't come in with huge expectations. I got the standard burger, beer, shot combination. Pretty solid pre flight meal if you ask me. Bartender offered the shot, as it was half off. Burger was pretty good, flavorful. Stella and a chilled Ketel One shot, really hit the spot. Very good service. Burger came out in a pretty timely manner, as I was told when I ordered it would be at least 15 minutes. For a place located at the Airport, it wasn't half bad and not all that expensive."}
{"text":"The prices are outrageous but my chicken caesar wrap was actually really good. The application of dressing was perfect and the salad crispy and fresh."}
{"text":"The only pros I can think of about this place is that it is very convenient/has a good location near the D gate terminals in the airport and that the bread they use is super fresh. Other than that I found my turkey sandwich to be EXTREMELY salty and the turkey to be far from fresh. I don't expect airport food  to be gourmet but when it's a Wolfgang Puck place, I expect much better than this."}
{"text":"Butternut squash soup is over the top sweet. The tortilla soup is ok but would be good if there was chicken in it."}
{"text":"Maybe the food sucks like the others suggested. But with my late flight back home, this was the only place open around and I really wanted a Gatorade. I got my drink and I received service with a smile. So to me, this place delivered."}
{"text":"I'm thankful for the hot food made with freah ingredients, but this is really a poor excuse for an express restaurant. Please fire everyone working there or pay them more so that they can at least pretend to care a bit more.   One lady looks like she's making sandwiches half asleep slapping it together and having the arugula fly everywhere then stuffing it back in the sandwich. When a customer asked where his pizza was, the pizza girl had a whispered conversation about the customer with the cashier.   The pizza was soggy, but acceptable for airport standards."}
{"text":"Experience:  Stuck in D gate at 8:00am. The only choices are Starbucks and Wolfgang Express for food.   Facility:  There is food service on one side and a bar on the other with tables and chairs in between. Clean and typical decor of airport restaurants. There is an oven for pizza that you can see the fire going full blast...that's cool.   Service:  Didn't exactly open at 8am...more like 8:10. The cashier wasn't friendly but want rude either. Love that the cooks are making my food right in front of me fresh. Said thanks to cook and so did the guy in front of me, but he didn't acknowledge either of us.   Food:  I was pleasantly surprised by the look of my food. I ordered the egg breakfast sandwich which was made with ham, tomato, egg, mayo and cheese on sourdough. It came with breakfast potatoes, so that was a nice extra. The sandwich was big, cooked nice and good.   Overall:  I would eat here again. It was pretty decent food for an airport. It was decent food for outside an airport too, but of course with airport prices. Ouch!"}
{"text":"needed to get something to eat for breakfast while i was waiting for my plane.  i had chicken sandwich with aioli.  it was alright, not bad and not xlnt, but alright.  i mean its express and at least it wasnt prepackaged and served cold or zapped in a microwave, so its definitely a step above that.  it was more or less prepared by a cook."}
{"text":"Great place for sandwiches and salads, especially if you work in University Hospitals and don't want to walk out in the cold to Jimmy John's or Panera.  The restaurant is in a nice location in the lobby of the Seidman Cancer Center.   Sandwiches: Very big and worth the price.  I wish the specialty sandwich would change more often, but what's served is good.  I usually get the rotisserie turkey club or the meatloaf sandwich.  Both are delicious.  All of the sandwiches have great sauces and fresh vegetables to complement the meat, which is plentiful.  Salads: Also well done.  My favorite is the Rotisserie Turkey Cobb salad.  The salad has a large variety of items, including turkey, green beans, bacon, and avocado.   The chicken tenders are also good.  Pizza served here is good, but I feel it's expensive and not as good of a value as the sandwiches and salads.  One thing I don't like is the butter lettuce salad which comes as an optional side with the sandwiches.   The salad comes as a whole head of lettuce, which needs to be cut.  I would rather have a side salad which doesn't require a knife.  They changed the fries recently - I liked the old ones better, but what they offer now are still reasonably crispy with a healthy dose of rosemary."}
{"text":"One of Wolfgang Puck's Express sandwich and pizza chain spots, located in the LV airport.   We shared the chicken aioli sandwich ($10). Average ingredients; it's all about the sauce. It would have been much tastier if the bread bun was crispy and well-toasted properly, but then again it is a fast food service. Don't think Puck would have been satisfied."}
{"text":"I am a former employee for D-Gates WolfGang Puck Express. This place has the BEST Chicken Cesar Salad and Chinios Salad - Better to have it Hand Tossed to ensure Freshness. The hand tossed pizza's are of course delicious! The Four Cheese Pizza was my favorite out of all, of course the menu has changed since I was last there. But the zesty pesto sauce, with tomatoes and FOUR types of cheeses on a 9in. pizza. It is really an excellent place to eat for the airport - you can go to pizza hut and spend $6+ on a single size serving but wouldn't you rather spend $9.99 on a 9in. 12 slice pizza to share?... Sandwiches were always one of my favorites - particularly the Pesto Chicken Sandwich... I mean, theres nothing much to explain you would really have to try it yourself to see what I am talking about.. They Also do Free Sampling, so if you are unsure of what to choose of the Chef Designed Menu, feel free to ask for a sample and the Cashier or cook will be more than happy to assist you.   If your flight is delayed or you just have a few hours to kill, there is also a full service bar for the adults - Bartenders are there to give you one last laugh while in Las Vegas, and again - prices are Wolfgang Puck really are not expensive at all especially for the Airport. They are the same prices as the actual restaurant.   Cooks take pride in what they do, and the outcome of each dish - I only know this because I did. Seeing the excitement and satisfaction on each guests face as they opened their package to check their order for accuracy would make my shift so much better.   I cant speak for how the employees are now, but I do know on what it was and what it should be - and you should expect nothing but 100% THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN LAS VEGAS!   Be sure to check this place out! Trust me YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!   MY RECOMMENDATIONS:  -Four Cheese Pizza -Chicken Cesar Salad or Chinios Salad -Chicken Pesto Sandwhich"}
{"text":"the pizza from here is pretty good! it is probably the best place to eat at Pearson..."}
{"text":"I wanted to grab a bite before my flight, and this was quite close. I though nice...Wolfy has a fast food place. Neato.   Well, the prices certainly reflected the fact that I am a total dumbass and tool for eating at a place called wpe. Unlike holiday inn express it did not make me smarter. What I got was the chicken aioli. Which ended up being slightly mushy, and over cooked. I'm not sure how they managed to do both. I really blame myself for this dining misadventure. The only positive was the staff warned me that there were cheaper places closer by.   Funny Lady....."}
{"text":"I had the soup and sandwich. I had the tortilla soup. It's a very nice fresh tomato taste and can taste the ingredients in the soup. The chicken aioli sandwich as really good. A grilled chicken with pesto aioli served on a nice bread. Great food."}
{"text":"Delicious food with great flavor and wonderful service!  A pleasant surprise in a hospital setting - far cry from normal hospital fare!"}
{"text":"I know that my coworker and I looked like two zombies sitting here at the bar ordering dinner - three days in Vegas for work can do that to you!  So I'm incredibly grateful for the bartender who was completely attentive even when we weren't... waiting for our much desired flight home.  We both ordered pizzas and I got the Spicy Chicken one that was good.  But really it's the service that helped end my trip with ease.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Love the pizza and pasta here! The pesto and mushroom pizza are my favorites and a good amount of pizza! Loved the pesto shrimp pasta and chocolate chip cookie is amazing! They have a great breakfast and the service is great! Pretty high quality food but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice place, Wolfgang Puck to UH cafeteria is like Seidman Cancer Center to Hanna House. Very nice atmosphere, clean and classy. Typical American foods, I enjoyed the pizza and mac and cheese. Good serving sizes."}
{"text":"While waiting for my flight back to San Francisco, which was delayed by 2 hours, I knew I needed me a drank.   Las Vegas is known to be super glitz and glammy, but the airport itself lacks that kinda flare.   In the domestic flights terminal, the food court seemed like an absolute ghost town. Barely any shops, sparse food vendors, not even enough chairs to fit the amount of tables present. Felt like I was involved in some sort of zombie apocalypse aftermath, minus the survival guilt.   After scanning a bit further, I noticed a Wolfgang Puck's Express. Hallelujah and an ameeeen! Some familiarity in my corner!   I think by now, most all people have either heard, seen, or experienced food from Celebrity Chef, Wolfgang Puck. I mean, he even has canned soups and TV dinners available!   At this small restaurant, there are pre-packed salads to go, bottled specialty drinks, fresh fruit, and snacks; all available for quick purchase at the register.   They even have a casual restaurant section for sit down meals offering pizza and sandwiches, beer on tap, vodka shots, and wine if you will.  Having the unpredictability of when my flight was going to take off, I grabbed some snacks and opted for a simple glass of Cabernet from Wolfgang's signature line.   Prices are steep and expectedly so being located in an airport. 9oz pour was approx. $15.  Service was really attentive and quick. She responded promptly when I asked for the bill and closed the tab. As I was walking back to my gate, everyone had already boarded and I was one of the last few to trickle in.   Phewww!  Cheers to Wolfgang Puck's Express for easing the pain of a seriously delayed flight!"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast and got the egg white omelet combo. It comes with The Omelette, potatoes, and grapes. The omelet was a little greasy, but overall the meal was pretty good. It wasn't really very much food though, because I was still hungry once I had eaten everything. The staff was very friendly and the food comes out quick. It was definitely the best breakfast option around the terminal."}
{"text":"Airport food is really fun for some reason. even if it's not the ideal setting to enjoy a meal, the Wolfgang Puck express is a great place for a moment of respite and replenishment for the journey. Got the american breakfast (with sausages, scrambled eggs, potato wedges and whole-wheat toast) on my visit and it was pretty good!"}
{"text":"This Wolfgang is more of a bar, serving bar food. We wanted one last drink before we flew off into our 40's. Unfortunately, no Bud Light lime on tap so we just drank regular beer.   The Italian sandwich was just ok. The bread was from a sliced loaf so it tasted like something you would make at home. I would just drink here and not order food.   The bartender was super friendly."}
{"text":"Their Chicken Wonton Salad was ok.  Pricey but that's not too surprising being that we're in an airport.  Plenty of seating inside and outside."}
{"text":"Great choices, great service. My favorites Meatloaf Sandwich: delicious, the fries here are always the perfect amount of crispy. The meat in this sandwich is seasoned well but my favorite thing about it is the tomato remoulade (?) it comes in when it is just made. it's great! it lasts 2 meals and heats adequately well. The chicken tenders: they are pretty standard but good, the salad it comes with is awesome and adds lightness to an otherwise heavier meal and also comes with fries. Love the variety. I have tried most of the other sandwiches and don't love it. the spaghetti (with tomato and basil) reheats well, is reasonably priced and edible.  Don't love the alfredo (normally I love alfredo) it is too heavy. But overall! better than the cafeteria. I love having this option for food."}
{"text":"Expensive small portion but not very good selection either. $10 for veggie salad that was leaking so I couldn't carry it on"}
{"text":"This is actually my second time in a year checking in at Pearson airport's Wolfgang Puck. Both times I found the think crust pizzas to be fresh and tasty, but a but on the oily side.  Unfortunately the lip service and attitude make me want to hurl up my food every time, and they always have interac issues of some sort. Add the inflated airport prices and 3 stars it is.   EXTRA TIP: Swiss chalet across if you aren't a pepperoni pizza kinda gal/guy"}
{"text":"Pizza made to order at 6:30 AM, Anyone??  Wolfgang Puck Express for sure is an upgrade compare to McDonald's... but with the price to match.  Thin crust pizza fresh from the oven VS having more fast food?   I am willing to pay a little extra for that."}
{"text":"I Love Wolfgang's service, food, and the setting .. In my opinion best food thus far.. The quality and quantity of the Wolfgang Puck food is excellent.. The staff from waiters and waitress to the chef's is just immaculate.. Then the setting is always clean , however the setting uu be a little bit bigger.. Besides The size of the setting Everything else and I mean everything else is excellent I mean it's the best.... If you think of going to visit the Wolfgang Puck... Be my guest I promise that you won't regret it.."}
{"text":"Hmm ordered the Alfredo pasta  It took over 15 minutes even though I was the only one waiting  And from the photos looks like I didn't get the bread  Service was not good and slow  I've yet to taste it as it was to go for the plane ride"}
{"text":"So the order took a total of 28 min which should have been disclosed. There was no one there to even start the order for first 10 min and it was only 9pm in Vegas so isn't that like 3pm everywhere else? The line then grew to about 6 people patiently waiting for their orders also. The pizza was a tad doughy so not so hot but clearly the D squad was on the clock."}
{"text":"My pizza is awesome, way better than I expected.  I got the specialty meats with goat cheese.  Soooooo delicious. Plus friendly service."}
{"text":"On our flight back home, my friend and I decided to grab 1 last meal at the airport since we were didn't manage to eat anything that morning.   I ordered the BBQ'd Chicken Pizza and my friend had the Caesar Salad. My pizza had a nice thin crust, juicy chicken and yummy BBQ sauce. I think it might have been a little too oversauced though, because my pizza was quite soggy. It wasn't gross soggy, but I think because of juice of the tomato and the sauce (and it was quite greasy), it turned out to be more soggy than it should have been. It was still quite good though. Loved the cilantro in there too.  My friend had the large caesar salad. No biggie, just a caesar salad. I think it was a little bit overdressed, but that wasn't a huge concern.  Fast and friendly service. Good value for the food. $11 for a huge pizza is pretty good.  3.5/5 stars for me. Would I come back? Probably not. There are so many other places at the McCarran Airport that I would like to try."}
{"text":"It is an express place not the actual restaurant where you think you'll get service when you find a seat. I've sat down at a table and waited almost 10 minutes and yet no one comes to take orders or take our care. I waited until there was an open spot at the bar. One lady is working and she was kind of rude but she tries not to show it, although it's there. It seems as if I'm wasting her time by sitting there but, i just asked for water and to see the menu and yet the pictures reviews on yelp was a great advice! Because it didn't look that great! Plus the portions seem to be very small and the prices were expansive. I know it's a franchise and it's the name brand but since I didn't get great service or feel as if it's worth my money, I left. I didn't feel bad either. Located in Vegas international airport."}
{"text":"After an all night drinking escapade and only getting a few hours of sleep, I was forced to be at the airport before noon to catch my flight back home.  I needed something to absorb anything stale that was still sitting in my belly.  Props to these guys for having multi-grain bagel breakfast sandwiches that I could munch on.  Not the tastiest breakfast because I found the bagel to be too thick and bready but it did ok in a pinch."}
