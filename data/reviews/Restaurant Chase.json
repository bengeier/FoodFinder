{"text":"Amazing Lebanese cuisine, everything we ordered was perfect!!! The eggplant salad was perfectly prepared, the shish kebab was very tasty, the raw kibbe  was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood restaurant. 

Just make sure to make a reservation and you'll be set. Great value. On a nice summer day sit out on the terrace!

The grilled meats are great so are the salads."}
{"text":"We came to Chase on Monkland a few days ago. The place is small, with the kitchen at back. We ordered a shish kabob, which was 2 beef sticks with your choice of fries or rice and a shish taouk, 2 chicken sticks with the same option. They early on gave us some pita. The food was good, and the portions were good as well. The best thing was our waiter. Very pleasant, we thanked her on the way out. Overall, good food, good service, and good staff."}
{"text":"Good restaurant with good value. This is a good restaurant for a family or a relaxed evening. The food is good, but the decor of the restaurant lacks, it's fine, but definitely nothing special. However, for $34 for a platter for two, it can't be beat. This includes a large fattoush salad, 5 kebabs which consist of 2 chicken, 2 beef kafta and a filet  mignon kebab, as well as hummus and baba ganoush. All of it is delicious, and most definitely enough for two big eaters! This is a good place to go for consistently good food at a reasonable place. Note, their take-out is just as good."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with this restaurant :) delicious And fresh every time. I love their sole and salads. The chicken skewers are amazing too."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the shawarma. Filling vegetables are what you would expect from subway not a legit Lebanese restaurant.
Vegetables provided with hummus were weak and pita was dry."}
{"text":"I brought my mom there for lunch today. I have to say it was very average. We were the only people in the restaurant for the most part of our meal. The waitress was either absent minded that day or she really doesn't like her job, I'm not sure which it was but she didn't seem happy to be there. We both ordered the Lunch special : Shish Taouk. We weren't very impressed, the fries were the Cavindish Extra Crispy fries that you can buy in bulk at Costco. Which I do! Which is why I knew they were store bought. You can't say your food is fresh if you are buying frozen store fries. The shish taouk pita was slim (3 chunks of chicken and a bit of lettuce), not the usual stuffed pita you would find at one of the many Slovakia joints in NDG. I've heard their other food is good, but from what we ordered, a lot left to be desired. I would consider going back, but I would not order a pita or fries there again."}
{"text":"Portions are fair, food is delicious.  I just wish they had a slightly bigger location.
I often go for lunch when it is less busy, but some evenings the place gets too packed.
Service is good, I have never had a service issue, but on the same note, there is nothing exceptional about the service either.
A wonderful place for a small dinner!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant ! Great terrace , great prices and fresh and delicious Mediterranean food . Their shish taouk and their baba ganoush were excellent and all ingredients were fresh and well prepared"}
{"text":"I have been in Montreal for two weeks and been here twice. It is by far the best Lebanese food I have had. I am not a fan of ordering chicken at restaurants because it always comes out dry, but there chicken skewers are moist and full of flavor. I like tabbouleh somewhat, but here I eat an entire bowl."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Monkland village in summer. The atmosphere is so lively and the restaurants are of a good variety. Getting a table outside is a must and this place has an elevated terasse ( its a patio for those who dont live in Quebec lol ) so you get a really good view. 

The food and the prices are equally amazing. I think this place has the best garlic sauce I ever had. I had the 3 meat trio with only salad and baba ganouj but usually it comes with fries or rice and Hummus. I was able to substitute for no additional cost which I really appreciate.  They also give pita bread, the marinated pink stuff( beets I think? Lol )  and hot peppers free of charge as a starter. 

Definitely recommend this place if youre in Monkland village."}
{"text":"Not bad, lebanese food, nice place , good service, nice terrasse, why not if you really want to be served at your table ... Because remember there is a good Basha not far in the same street Monkland..."}
