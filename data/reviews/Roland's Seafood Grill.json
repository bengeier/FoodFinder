{"text":"How is his place still in business? The food ranges from mediocre to awful.  The calamari in particular might be the worst I've ever had."}
{"text":"First off... I didn't even get bread as a starter while i saw everyone else around me have it at their table. !!! Second off the waiter got confused when I was in a party of 15 like can't you make separate checks dumb bits. Speaking of bits, the meat served on the \"Filet Mignon Bits  Sandwich\" was as dry as my DMS. I asked the waiter for \"French Onion Soup\" and she kept coming out with a damn \"Clap Chowder\" ??? My girls pasta was as hard as my poop ? It wasn't even creamy! I asked for butter.  Comin on UP with that \"cheese pizza\".... too MUCH DAMN SAUCE! LIKE I know Rihanna say \"you know I got the sauce, you know I'm saucy\"... but the sauce just took over the thin ass bread... couldn't enjoy it. Did I mention?  Extremely horrible service. I couldn't even call my grandma in the hospital. To conclude we couldn't even get separate checks when we mentioned it since the start. Awful. Awful. Awful. The waiter was rude and impatient. Never would I come here again. The food was awful. The end. Bone African feet."}
{"text":"only gets 1 star, because I can't given them 0.  ordered a chicken salad to go and to be nice, it sucked.  awful.  lack of chicken and brown, mushy lettuce.  better off getting a salad from some fast food joint.  I see why this place is hurting for business."}
{"text":"There were 3 of us on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Surprisingly Roland's was 3/4 full. With 3 waitresses. They were RUNNING to fill orders.  The fish was hot and crispy. It was fried but it was good. The French fries with it tasted as if they were fried in the same grease or an oil that should've been changed several days ago.  The Mussels were OK.  But the Clams Casino were inedible. The clams were served raw with a burnt bread crumb topping. The crab cakes were also bad. Both went back.  The waitress never asked if we wanted something else or if the rest of the meals were fine.  The New England Clam Chowder was good but overpowered by the smoky bacon that was added to the soup.  No, we won't go back..the food was lackluster(better fix at Wholleys) and the service was terrible. It took 20 minutes to get someone to take the bill."}
{"text":"After reading reviews I was afraid of what kind of service we would encounter.   The bartender was lovely and attentive. He offered drinks promptly and kept an eye on our needs. The Bloody Mary was fun and showy with 3 Green Olives, a lemon, a lime and a huge celery stalk and had a light Old Bay flavor, which was a nice touch.  We ordered the Lobster Nachos ($15), which were delivered to us piping hot and in less than 10 minutes. While it was a large serving of nachos for 2 people, the portion of lobster was paltry. They tasted fine but I would have expected more lobster for the price.   I wouldn't order food here, again.  Still, nice, fast service with a smile and a fun open space. Very conducive to lively conversation and easy people watching."}
{"text":"While visiting family from Florida,  they decided to take me here for dinner and I have to say, was quite impressed with the quality of my seafood. Not only were the shrimp and mussels cooked perfectly,  the price was amazing.  Maybe I'm used to paying West Palm Beach prices but $20 for a dozen large  shrimp and a dozen mussels is unheard of.   The atmosphere was bar like  (noisy), large TV, etc but that's what this establishment is and was expected.   Will certainly visit again the next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Extremely disapointed, we signed our receipt for a total of $55 later to find out we were charged $88,  I guess our waitress needed the extra $30.  Never going back, letting our bank handle this one.  Would love to see the receipt copy we left again!"}
{"text":"Nothing like sitting outside on the second floor on a beautiful weekend afternoon enjoying a drink and sandwich.  My experiences here have always been great with service and food except when they're super super busy.  Love the Irish bartender too."}
{"text":"Amazing portions, flavors and service. A must visit for a fish sandwich or oven fired pizza during any trip to the Strip."}
{"text":"First, I can see why there are many bad reviews here... service leaves a LOT to be desired most of the time.  However, the lobster roll and seafood in general are very good... possibly slightly overpriced but I tend to think that usually because I'm a little on the cheap side at times :-)  If you're looking for a night out with some friends, the bar atmosphere is a lot of fun and in general it is a very cool place.  My family and I have been here countless times so I've had many experiences to justify the four star rating."}
{"text":"In the Strip District, there's not many options when you're hungry. Walking up and down, the Strip district is filled with booths of steelers and penguins gear. There was a breakfast place and Primanti brothers that was packed. So we were dying for some food and ran across Roland's. We got mussels and banana peppers stuffed with sausage for our appetizers. I also got a lobster roll. They gave us a lot of mussels slathered with garlic and butter. Surprisingly good. And the banana peppers were not bad too. I also enjoyed my lobster roll. Buttered toast and big chunks of lobster meat. I had no room left to finish off my fries.   Now, I can't decide if the food was average or below average as we were pretty hungry. I'll give Roland's the benefit of the doubt. Don't expect anything spectacular, just food that fills your belly."}
{"text":"Consistently some of the best service, food and atmosphere in Pittsburgh.  A real Pittsburgh gem."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday afternoon for lunch with some coworkers. We were a party of 12. Even though the restaurant was busy, they were able to get us a table. Apparently there is a second floor room that can be rented out for parties, but they don't take reservations.   The interior of the building is nicer than I thought, judging from the outside and other Yelp reviews. They have a lot of large televisions, which would make this an ideal spot for watching a game.   Our server was very pleasant and friendly, but some of the staff has that native Pittsburgher gruffness, which some people might translate as rude. There do seem to be some staffing problems, though. A latecomer to our group asked another waitress clearing a nearby table if she was our waitress. The woman said \"no\" and walked away without offering to get our server. It was a little weird. Our waitress also had people at the other end of the table yell their lunch orders, even though it was very loud. She could have easily walked over, so that was odd, too.   Not being in the mood for fish, I ordered the white pizza. It was very large, much bigger than I expected. I ended up taking the leftovers with me, and it fed me for two more meals. So, while the prices are a little more than you'd expect to pay at a similar restaurant, many of the portions are huge. Two people could easily split the fish sandwich.   The pizza was pretty good, with a paper-thin crust and plenty of tomatoes and pungent garlic. I think the garlic was from a jar. The cheese was a tangy blend.   All of Roland's pizzas are oven-fired, and some of my pieces of crust were burned black. This may be a plus to some people, but I don't much care for it.   In all, it was a decent meal, and the rest of my party seemed to be happy with their food. I'd like to come back here and try some other menu items."}
{"text":"great service. extremely welcoming. had a lobster roll that wasn't a lobster roll. some sort of seafood I guess, spiced and placed inside a huge piece of bread. the entire thing was bread....tasteless bread  and I have no clue what the meat was. I have had  a lot of lobster - fresh caught in New England and Lobster rolls in Boston, Maine and Atlantic Canada. This was just not good. 2 stars due to great the service."}
{"text":"We (3 in our party) stopped in to Roland's while in the lively and interesting Strip District. We placed our drink and food selections with the waitress. She brought our soups, which luckily had spoons in the huge bowls. All were absolutely delicious. The lobster bisque actually had lots of pieces of lobster and the onion soup rich, beefy taste with lots of onions. The clam chowder had tons of clams and the portion was large enough for a meal!!! Our shrimp appetizers ...fried shrimp and shrimp cooked in a beer broth were excellent. Unfortunately our server had no clue how to actually serve people in a restaurant...we had to ask 3 times for napkins and when they were finally brought to the table, she acted as if she was doing us a Big Favor. Then after our food was brought to the table and we asked multiple times for eating utensils. The first time we asked her we were polite, then asked another server, then when we asked at the hostess stand we were told \"oh we told your waitress to bring them\". When she finally brought them to our table she said \"if you had asked nicely I would have brought them sooner\". Can you believe that!!! The floor manager came over and while he apologized, also made excuses for her confrontational behavior.  5 stars for food and food prep, 0 stars for rude service or lack of service."}
{"text":"Food is always on point. Good bar food style. My favorite calimari! John is by far one of the most stellar bartenders around. He will definitely entertain you."}
{"text":"I think one star is being HIGHLY generous for this restaurant. My family and I visited Roland's on a Sunday afternoon for some lunch. It was by far the worst experience at a restaurant I have had. My husband and I both ordered the Lobster Rolls and I order my daughter pasta from the kids menu. It took the staff SO LONG to bring our lunch and when it finally came, my husband and I both got our sandwiches, but my daughter got nothing. Of course she was not happy about that at all, and trying to calm her down, we were giving her our food so that she had something, but she really wanted her pasta. My husband went to talk to the manager, and our server came over but STILL NO PASTA. 15-20 minutes later the pasta finally came out. And of course it was scalding hot. Not only was the pasta so hot that it was inedible (especially for a kid) there was a POOL of greasy butter and oil in the bottom of the bowl. I think my kid ate more of the grease than the actual pasta. It was DISGUSTING. This was such an absolutely horribly disappointment of a restaurant. Not to mention that the lobster roll was not even that great and definitely not worth $16. (Maybe it would have been better if it didn't sit on my plate for twenty minutes while I waited for my daughter's food).   Don't waste your time here, especially if you have kids. The staff (minus our waitress who was really nice and it wasn't her fault) are a bunch of bozos."}
{"text":"I have never been to Roland's before but today was my first and last time!  My boyfriend's family and I (a party of 6 and a baby) asked to be seated.  There was a wait but they told us we could go upstairs to the patio which was first come first serve and the manager was setting us up a table and highchair.  No he didn't!  We pulled together our own tables and an hour into us arriving at the restaurant we had to go get our own highchair.    We ordered food and drinks right away.  While I was ordering I asked the waitress if I could have white sauce instead of a red sauce on the specialty pizza.  The waitresses response was \"No, I don't think that would be good.\"  Oh, I am so sorry that the paying customer asking for the meal thought it would be a good.    Out of the 6 of us, 5 people got pizzas and 1 person got a fish sandwich. The fish sandwich arrived nearly 20 minutes before the rest of our meals.  We never were offered refills on our drinks and silverware had to be requested multiple times.  The service was horrible, the atmosphere was chaotic and uncomfortable, and the food was just horrible."}
{"text":"Always my favorite spot to eat on Sunday's. The Mussels are what I crave when I dine here"}
{"text":"Stopped in on the Fourth of July for evening cocktail and small meal. From horrible service to terrible seafood...would never return. We waited a very long time for cocktails and order to be taken, when there was little crowd around in the restaurant. Then, our oyster order came out on a plate of water, not ice. They were small and shriveled up and warm. Next, the mussels in white wine sauce....hahahah. Um, no...it was more like garbage sewer sauce. Mussels were freezing COLD. Had to search for a server to get the check, took a long time again. Normally, I would complain right then and there for such terrible food and service but it was one of those days that was going so nicely that complaining about food would just ruin mine and my husband's infrequent night out without kids. I did feel strongly enough to write this review. How can a seafood place serve terrible seafood? I have never given a 0 star review and have worked in the food service industry. This place is terrible. Spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"The Lobster Roll Caesar Salad was very good, and the service at the bar was great!"}
{"text":"dirty bathrooms, weak drinks, waiter didn't remove one plate from our table the whole visit, disgusting boiled seafood platter ($28) consisting of dry tuna, soggy scallops, crab cakes that tasted like mouthfuls of old bay seasoning, and insanely overdone red potatoes.  the shrimp were shrimp."}
{"text":"I was immediately displeased by the snaggle toothed hostess and her surly demeanor. The air conditioning was non existent, which is a hangover nightmare. While waiting for a table the bartender ignored us for ten minutes and couldn't even transfer our drinks to the table. He also casually instructed me that one must pay per beer - duh! I'm not a beer drinking novice. The acne-ridden server was friendly enough, but seemed forlorn and was overtly sweating. Bringing drinks to a table isn't neuroscience and I don't drink tap water. After sitting at our table for a few minutes it was very apparent that the entire serving staff is haggard. Appetizer - crab artichoke dip. Bland. Where's the crab? Also, did a toddler arrange the plate? Apparently. Meal - fish tacos. Came quickly and surprisingly flavorful. However, our server never once checked on our status and we had to beckon him to fulfill our needs. I shouldn't have to ask for napkins at the point of need. No tip, never coming back."}
{"text":"I gave this place a 3 star because the service and drinks are great. It's a great place to have a beer with friends  but the food is gross...."}
{"text":"Fabulous beer selection, enjoyed eating outside, and great famous lobster roll sandwich. Thoroughly enjoy eating here and people watching in the Strip! And I've never had to wait long for a table even though they are always packed! And the waitstaff is very attentive but not annoyingly so."}
{"text":"We visited Roland's on Sunday for an early dinner and drinks. The hostess at the front felt her conversation about another customer was more important than greeting and seating us. It took about 5 minutes for her to even acknowledge out presence. After we were finally seated, it then took another 10 minutes for a server to take our drink order, in fact, we were just about to leave when he made his way over. I didn't think it could get any worse....but it did. He brought us waters first then our beers, little did we know these were the only drinks we would get. The restaurant's doors were open and the day was hot and humid, perfect for enjoying a lobster roll and cold beer. Our waiter brought our food, we ordered a second round and he was never seen again. I witnessed more apologies to customers that day than I ever have. It wasn't even crowded. Having my own experience in the food service industry, I realize how hard this job can be but this was unacceptable. The type of service you receive will make or break a restaurant and I highly doubt we will be back. This was our second terrible visit and I am not willing to give a third strike chance."}
{"text":"If you're into mediocre over-priced sports bars with average food, slow service and cackling hyenas, this place is for you, hands-down."}
{"text":"This a great spot for a Lobster Roll. Yeah the service is going to be a little slow since it seems like it's always busy here. The food and atmosphere is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I use to love Rolands. However, the last few times we have been there it has been terrible.  While the food remains okay, the service leaves something to be desired.  Our waitress took longer than 15 minutes to come over and get our drink order; we had to get the hostess to find her.  She did not come back to the table for more than 20 minutes at a time.  The waitress was rude and less than helpful.  Our 1 drink and lunch took over two hours to complete.  Good thing they still have a good bloody mary."}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch last Saturday, party of five. The service was extremely slow and every beer we tried to order, got the response \"We are out of that one\".   Finally when we got our sandwiches (after a long wait) but no coleslaw and fries were soggy and stale. When asked the waitress for coleslaw (which is supposed to be the side with every sandwich), the response was \"I think we are out, but let me check\". And the waitress didn't return until after we were done eating.  Forget about getting a refill for your drink or water.."}
{"text":"It was fine. The Maryland chowdah was a little spicy as stated. The New England chowdah lacked clams and clam flavor. It was almost like a cream of potato soup. The lobster rolls were in a huge, thick toasted bread. Can't even fit in your mouth to take a bite. I just ate it open faced with a fork. The lobster quesadilla was greasy and heavy from so much butter, cheese and oil. The mashed potatoes were the best though.  Service was good with our party of ten."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here with a group to celebrate a friend's birthday.  My overall opinion is that the service was terrible and the food was overpriced.    Our drinks took 15-20 minutes to arrive.  We were drinking beers, so I'm not sure why it took so long.  We had to wait an extremely long time for our food, I would estimate at least 45 minutes.  We had ordered calamari and bruschetta for appetizers, but they were served with the entrees.  When we started to eat it became very obvious that our food had been sitting for a while.  Anyone who had french fries said they were cold.  I ordered the rosemary shrimp scampi, which came with mashed potatoes and a broccoli/carrot mix.  The mashed potatoes were lukewarm at best, and the vegetables were cold.  I ate the broccoli, but I don't like raw carrots so I didn't eat those.  It honestly looked like they just threw a handful of baby carrots onto the plate.  As for the shrimp itself, it tasted good but wasn't what I expected.  I was expecting a pasta-type dish, but it was just 5 or 6 pieces of shrimp in a garlic butter bath.  And I don't think a few pieces of shrimp and cold vegetables should cost $23, especially when I was still hungry after the meal.  To top it all off, we realized halfway into our meals that we were never given napkins.  We had to ask twice for them to be brought out.  The only good thing about the experience was the beer selection.  If I ever come back here I will just stick to the bar and not waste my time or money on the food."}
{"text":"Ordered the clam chowder. It came out barely warm. The calamari was terrible unless you like calamari the size of Texas onion rings. There were a lot of people there, so maybe it's just a good place for drinks, but if you're looking for good food, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"In the heart of Strip district, it can be a pretty fun place on a game watch day. The place is setup nicely and overall clean. I ordered the grilled chicken nachos while watching the game as the place was bustling with fun yinzers. I just wanted an App, not a whole meal. How could you screw up nachos after all?. For $11 they were pretty underwhelming. Very little dry queso cheese. Dry chicken pieces cubically cut. Not enough for the size of nachos plate. Nachos themselves were dry, salty and cold. Totally unmemorable. If an appetizer was below average not sure how entrees would be. I'll probably be back for drinks and overall atmosphere but would not go out of my way for the food. The patio seating looked nice."}
{"text":"Like a glutton for punishment, I hit up Roland's again last night while in town for business. I tired Kaya, but the wait was 30 + minutes.  Here's the big clue I keep ignoring....the restaurant is EMPTY when everywhere else is crowded. Another issue is there's poor A/C in the dining room, which kind of sucks when it's 85 degrees and humid outside.   I had a grilled vegetable sandwich and clam chowder. Same as before, it was just OK.  Service was better this time though.   All in all, I preferred my to go taco salad from doba the night before to this meal.   Save your money and try somewhere else.   PS. Beer selection is impressive if you want to drink beers from all around the world."}
{"text":"I regretted coming here almost immediately. It took 10 minutes just to get our waters. All of our entrees came at different times. My friend ordered the seafood stew and the oysters were extremely chewy and nearly inedible. I had to spit the oyster out in a napkin. This is the first and last time I'm coming here."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night, not crowded at all. Had to get up and go find someone to wait on our table....overheard who was supposed to be our server telling the hostess she didn't wait on us because she didn't want another table. The food was good, lobster roll and fish sandwiches were great. Service was just awful."}
{"text":"As others have said, nice location and sitting on the patio is nice in the warm sunny months, but the food is not anything special.  Fried seafood, decent lobster roll, other non-impressive dishes.  good for a few drinks and a quick bite if in the area."}
{"text":"The good. Lobster roll was very good.  Now for the rest.  Shrimp po boy. Just ok. A little cold. So were the fries. Service was very slow.  Needed to return a dirty fork. Kids said ice water tasted like seafood.   With so many other options I wouldn't stop here unless you just want a drink at the bar and a lobster po boy."}
{"text":"Don't, just don't...the food leaves a lot to be desired. The steamed mussels arrived in a grey broth that looked like sewage water. The crab cakes were cold and overly salty. It was so loud in there, you had to scream across the table to talk. The saving grace was the friendly, professional waitress."}
{"text":"Service was great, however, the food was mediocre.  Hostess needs to be more educated about the menu, she was unable to give details on menu items. Lets start the with fries that seem to be mandatory with each entree.  They had to be cooked prior to us ordering, or even getting there.  They were cold, limp (pause) and over salted.  The burger was just eh.  Grilled onions seemed to be just warmed on the grill, and the beef patty could have used a bit more flavor.  Fat has the flavor people!  Oh, the floor at our first table was filthy.  Then the table at the second table was filthy.  What's up with that?  Overall, this joint was not that great."}
{"text":"Rolands was the place to go after work each Friday and it was for good reason. The food is good and the prices are fair. I like the fish sandwich because it is freaking massive! The lobster roll is expensive, but well worth it....whereas many lobster rolls are loaded with mayo this one is just large , well seasoned chunks of claw and tail meat on a great roll. Upstairs is great because ... well... the bartenders treat everyone like friends. I have left many times with several craft beers for under $10. The bartenders are also really cool because every now and then they will give you a free beer :)"}
{"text":"I ate here one night after going to Pittsburgh Winery and Maggie's Farm Rum because I, you know, needed some food. I'd never been in Roland's before, but a friend insisted that we go there because it is less expensive than Luke Wholey's. We sat at the bar. The service was fine although we had to ask for food menus. Maybe the bartender figured that if we wanted food we would have gotten a table.  I got the lobster roll and was really disappointed. It looked good and was on a huge hunk of Mancini's bread cut about ninety percent of the way through to make a roll, but the lobster itself was tough, rubbery, and overcooked. All I could taste was the garlic butter. Granted I'm a little spoiled because I once lived in New England, but a seafood restaurant should know how to cook lobster so that it isn't flavorless and chewy. You do get a good amount of food for your sixteen dollars as it comes with hand cut fries and cole slaw, but I'd rather spend the extra money elsewhere if the food quality is better."}
{"text":"Absolutely a waste of time and money. Service is just terrible. Wait staff was more focused on sweeping under our table while we were still seated, then pre bussing our table. The food was terrible and way overpriced. I never even had the opportunity to complain about my food because our server never asked. I'm leaving and my table is still covered in all of the dishes and empty beer glasses. Just awful."}
{"text":"This review is about an experience my husband and I had perhaps more than a year ago, so I'll do the best I can. The service was slow all night (forget drink refills). The dinner salad consisted of brown and white lettuce and cafeteria-esque Italian dressing. Our two meals of pasta were so bland that we, almost simultaneously, asked each other to try a bite just to make sure we weren't missing something. And I have been known to enjoy a dinner of buttered noodles, but our pastas weren't even as flavorful as that! Once we finished, our waitress said, \"I hope you didn't want dessert because we're out.\"  So classy. The last straw was being reminded of what we would have to pay for such a crappy meal. Never again."}
{"text":"Yummyyyy! Lobster nachos were great, Matt the bartender/server Was great and silly! Hubby's famous fish sandwich was fish  gigantic and delish!!  I highly recommend the rooftop deck or street side deck. Lots of great performer are on the street around you.  The bar inside is great too. Love it here!!"}
{"text":"Pasta di mare was fantastic. The servers are strange and they seem like they aren't sure who has what table, but whatever the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the steamers and buffalo chicken pizza. Great place for family and friends. We love going here for dinner after boating all day. Everything they make is huge from the appetizers to the sandwiches.   Rolands also has a large variety of specialty beers on tap. The bar is a great place to watch a game, have a beer and enjoy the time with friends."}
{"text":"Here on vacation and the waitress seemed annoyed we wanted food. Who know we wanted food at a restaurant."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here on a Tuesday night for dinner somewhere around 7 o'clock. Our waiter, I wish I could remember his name, was awesome. They were understaffed and busy and he really did a great job.   The stuffed mushrooms were big enough to be an entree and were delicious. The sicilian pizza definitely has a spicier flavor than what I had expected but it was great too.  We checked in here on facebook and it gave us a deal for half off an appetizer with the purchase of an entree. The drinks were great too and the draft/beer selection is awesome."}
{"text":"Just awful.   My companions each ordered an Alfredo pasta and they both honestly thought (through the entire meal) that Roland's had served mashed potatoes on the pasta.  We thought \"maybe it's a 'burgh thing.\"  Nope, we were informed at the end of the meal by the waiter that it was indeed Alfredo sauce and that the chef \"just liked to use a lot of parmesan cheese in his Alfredo.\" This stuff was about the consistently of cold oatmeal with oil poured over it (no exaggeration) and there was a bucket full of it on each plate.  Anybody who would serve what was on those plates has no business whatsoever in any kitchen.   By the way, my lobster roll was a buttery, greasy fail as well.  What a complete disaster."}
{"text":"I'm really not wanting to hate this place because I like the atmosphere but this just isn't good. Bad service, horrible Bloody Mary's (maybe the worst), the beers were warm, and we only got to the appetizers (Chicken nachos) before deciding to leave. The four of us were afraid to order anything else. This place was recommended to us by my sister in law. I've always though she was a little nuts and this proved it."}
{"text":"Lunch on a Wednesday with 4 people. Lobster rolls= excellent!  Crab cake sandwich= excellent!  Yummy, warm fries! Very good service and warm food!  Was worried when we saw poor rating on Yelp. Very happy and will come back!"}
{"text":"I am not a picky eater; however, this was perhaps the absolute worst food I have ever been served at a restaurant. My brother and I came in here on Sunday because we were hungry after a day of walking around the strip. Worst decision we have ever made; we actually laughed at how nasty it was. I think that the calamari we were served was actually pieces of chopped up and dyed car tire. Then, my brother got the prosciutto and arugula pizza. there were like 2 pieces of prosciutto on it, and then they thought it would be a good idea to literally just throw pieces of ice cold arugula on top with unmelted parm cheese and some sort of lemon sauce. it was nasty. My chicken sandwhich was also made with rubber chicken. truly a horrifying experience. Oh, and they seated us in a huge room, alone, it was so awkward and the waitress was rude and short. THIS FOOD TASES LIKE PLASTIC. OH YEAH AND THE FRENCH FRIES WERE LITERALLY SOGGY PIECES OF MOIST PLASTIC  HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. do not go here unless you want to throw up"}
{"text":"If I could give it a lesser star I would.  This place was terrible.  The seafood tasted old.  It was super chewy and tasteless.  The service was very slow and the waitress spilled fish broth all over one of the members of our party.  The bathrooms were gross and probably never clean.  I am just hoping that I don't get food poisoning later tonight."}
{"text":"They have got to be known for their Lobster rolls.  Its a generous portion of lobster meat and their fresh cut fries with malt vinegar is a homerun.  This sandwich should be the Pittsburgh sandwich at least in my opinion."}
{"text":"Extremely Slow Service!   We have eaten here many times and, while the fish sandwich is great, the staff and management have yet to figure out how to manage the tables. This establishment can become quite busy and, if you don't aggressively pursue service, you are likely to wait 20 minute or more just to get a menu.  This is particularly true if you are sitting in one of the outside areas."}
{"text":"Fish sandwich was mushy, soggy and generally terrible. 10 minutes later had stomachache. Avoid the fish! Lobster Roll was great."}
{"text":"Raw bar was great  , fish tacos worth sitting down for . great atmosphere ,                         fun place to hang out ."}
{"text":"Poor excuse for seafood!   The place is overrated.  Good place to have drinks on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon-but that's about it.  The employees are anything but friendly. Unless you sit at the bar, the service is poor. Isn't even that great at the bar.  If you want good seafood, go a couple blocks up the street to Luke Wholeys.  So much better quality!  This place is definitely not for those with sophisticated palates!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to rest, have a drink and a little food when shopping in the Strip District.  I was so happy I stopped here.  Great atmosphere.  Italian wedding soup was amazing.  Stuffed peppers excellent.    Pizza was ok.  Service was very good.    I will return."}
{"text":"Hit Roland's on a Saturday around lunch. The place was packed but we got a seat in a back bar area which was nice, quiet, and air conditioned. Our server was friendly and working hard.  I ordered the lobster roll. The lobster was drenched in garlic butter and served on a very fresh, thick slice of Mancini's bread. The only complaint was that the lobster itself was a bit dry. If it had been more melt-in-your-mouth, fresh-textured, I'd be singing its praises to anyone who'd listen. Too bad, the other elements were great.   My mother said she'd had the lobster roll at Roland's a few years ago and she had the exact same experience.   So c'mon Roland's...you're in the Strip...figure out a way to make that lobster roll PERFECTION."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating at Roland's  seafood Grill the first time I had a great experience the food was excellent the service was great even though they were busy we got really good service and everything was really fresh and good this time the food was needless to say very poorly prepared the service what service we got seemed more interested and everybody but the six people setting at our table. It took a couple of tries to get refills on drinks I asked for a cup of water I didn't even get the cup of water the pasta was more like wedding soup my medium stake was almost completely pink all the way through very undercooked my nieces pasta had more onions in it then it had sauce I will never visit this place again!!! It wasn't that busy tonight but we stood there for almost 15 minutes waiting for them to get us a table. I spoke with the manager and explained my concerns to him I just can't see me spending that kind of money for the experience that I had tonight again."}
{"text":"The Calamari Fritti is by far the best Calamari I've ever had. Nice stop for lunch in the strip district."}
{"text":"Great waiter.  Disgusting HAZMAT level bathrooms.  Sickly hunk of fishy tuna thrown on my mom's salad.  My chicken caesar was decent.  My dad loved his French onion soup.  Good beer selection  Even though this place calls itself a seafood restaurant, I wouldn't hazard any unfried ocean fare. Not so fresh!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have never had a bad meal. The prices were a little expensive for what we got. They took one of my favorite dishes, raspberry maple scallops, off the menu so I took a star off.  Tonight we had the calamari which was fresh, lightly breaded and fried and huge pieces. After that we had the Cajun shrimp. It was decent but nothing special and only had 6 small shrimp. The mango salsa was nice but didn't add much to the dish.  I ordered the land and sea and got the beer battered shrimp. The shrimp for the entree was bigger than the appetizer and done well. My steak was cooked right and tasty. Overall it is a good restaurant with good service. Not the best but far from the worst. I will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday for lunch with my wife.  The clam chowder was awesome and so were the lump crab cakes.   The place was hopping too!  Waiter was good too."}
{"text":"We had our company party at Roland's last week and once again they knocked it out of the house. We take the entire second floor and had about 175 guests. The food and service was incredible.  The next days brought many more thanks and compliments. The Carrozzi family treats you like one of their own.  Thanks again guys..Tony D"}
{"text":"This place is fun and casual with pretty good food.  The hot lobster roll was slightly tough but had a great flavor.  The real fun is in the raw bar where you get to watch them prepare all of your seafood fresh.  Wood fired pizzas too!  My boyfriend had a fish sandwich that was HUGE and perfectly cooked.  Crispy and tender! Overall it's a little pricey but I'd say worth it."}
{"text":"It was raining and we were in the Strip district craving some seafood.  We decided to stop by Roland's Seafood Grill.  We were seated right away close to the bar in front of the big screen projector where the US open was playing.  Our orders were taken right away then we waited for 30 minutes before our meals came out.  We were glad for the US Open entertainment.  My dad order the clam chowder soup, which was chunky and bare of any clams.  My mom and I shared a couple of appetizers, the calamari was great but the crab cake was just ok and a bit salty.  Service gets 2 stars and Food gets 3 stars.  Overall, this place gets a 2.5 stars.  If you are caught in the rain and do not have any other choices in the strip area, stop by.  I would recommend scoping out the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Bring some Mrs. Dash.  Friday night. The front of house staff was relaxed. The service was a touch blasé, which normally I find endearing, but it was more Judy Funnie than April Ludgate. The food was bland at best.  We got seated within the estimated wait time, which is always nice. Alas, the bisque tasted like wheat paste. The water was pretty good though.  I may have mentioned this already, but the food didn't actually taste like anything. I had high hopes for my lobster pizza, and then it tasted like nothing. On wet cardboard. Maybe I just ate the box?  If you hate zest, pep, pizazz, and bees knees, then this place is your jam. Else, you will find better value and experience elsewhere."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited on a Saturday afternoon. We tried mussels, clam chowder, jumbo shrimp cocktail and a burger.  The mussels were an appetizer portion and were enough for three people. They were perfectly cooked and very sweet.  The shrimp are sold a la carte. I ordered 6 of them, and was a bit let down that 2 of them were a bit dry. The cocktail sauce served with the shrimp had wonderfully spicy horseradish and was perfect.  The New England clam chowder was not overly thick and had lots of clams in it. Lastly, the burger, topped with gorgonzola cheese came with fries and cole slaw and was excellent.  The only reason I give this review 3 stars is because our waiter got overwhelmed by a few large parties and disappeared on us.  We had to flag down the hostess to get our waiter to bring us our check. Other than some dry shrimp, and the service issue, we had an enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"I was NOT impressed with Roland's and after eating there, I now understand the 2.5 star review. It took about 10 minutes for the hostess to come to the \"please wait to be seated\" sign to add our name to the list, with a line out the door also waiting to put their names in. The wait was an hour to get a table for 4 around 2-3:00 on a Saturday. It's so crowded there isn't even anywhere to stand. I was hoping it would be worth the wait, but it wasn't.  Once finally seated, it took forever to be greeted by our server, but he was very nice. Seemed like he was running around like a maniac and they were short staffed. It then took forever to get our drinks. When we finally got our food, we had no silverware or napkins. We asked our server for them, but after about 5 minutes of him not returning to the table, our food was getting cold. We flagged down another server and asked her, and she was SO rude. I understand she was not our server and was busy, but as a server of a restaurant, you shouldn't treat customers that way. When we finally got silverware, we were only given little drink napkins from the bar and our food was no longer hot.  Moving on to the food, terrible. I got the crab cake sandwich and it was very dry and tasteless. The crab cake itself was really small but on a huge roll. The sauce it was served with had a bad taste. My husband got the fish tacos and didn't like them. Our friend had the lobster roll, which was recommended by the server and it was so greasy and rubbery. The lobster was way overlooked. Our last friend got the Maryland crab soup and it tasted like a shaker of salt. Nobody liked or ate their meal.  I wanted to complain, but still felt bad for our server bc he seemed so busy, so we didnt want to bother him. I do not think I'll return to Roland's. So many better places in the strip district to eat with better, faster service and food. Roland's was really disappointing. The only thing I liked about Roland's was they serve full pint white lightening, which is sometimes hard to find at other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Brought my niece and nephew to Rolands.. because they love seafood.  The upstairs patio was packed but there were a few tables..  I was hesitant in staying because we were pressed for time and I didnt see many waitresses.  We were greeted by Tonya our waitress not long after we sat down - and she didnt miss a beat.  Hot and humid... tables were soon full - and she was amazing. I was glad we came. .. cuz he kids loved it.  We didnt have to wait for anything. My nephew got the prosciutto wrapped shrimp and loved them. He is 11 and I have taught him about yelp and he said I should give the review 5 stars!!  Samantha my niece is who is a little older - loved her classic mussels.    I wasn't too hungry (humidity kills my appetite) and just ordered the the sweet chilli wings and they were ok - \"meh\".  They were not spicy at all and very mild- not as much flavor as I expected.  I am tough critic when it comes to wings.  Walking through the bar area to get to the ladies room after dining.. I was reminded about how much fun the upstairs area is at Rolands..   The restrooms on the second floor - have been totally revamped.. love the new look.   I am still and always will be a fan. Thanks Rolands. .. see you again real soon. mawh"}
{"text":"My husband has enjoyed lunch at Roland's several times, so when he had a hankering for seafood, we headed down to dinner on a Saturday night. We were seated and given menus right away, which was a nice surprise since it was busy. But that's where the \"nice \" ended. It was ten minutes before a harried waiter came over, gave a us two napkin rolls and said \"I'll be right with you.\" Ten minutes more and he returned to take our drink orders. We could tell service was going to be slow, so we were prepared with our full order. We ordered water, two bottles of Newcastle Brown Ale, a half dozen raw oysters, salads and entrees. Ten more minutes go by and he brings the waters and tells us he'll be right back with the beer. So at this point we have been there 30 minutes and have water and silverware (I guess we should have counted ourselves lucky because we watched two tables receive food and NO silverware, and after asking for some and waiting, ended up going into the bar to get napkin rollups themselves from the bartender). At the 35 minute mark, our beers arrive -- two draft beers, not the bottles we ordered  When he delivers the beer, he says that our oysters are ready and he'll be right back. We take a sip of the draft beers, only to discover they were completely flat. We waited another 10 minutes with no sign of the waiter or the oysters, so I looked at my husband and said \"Let's vamoose!' and we got up and walked out.  It may be a great place for lunch (and I understand the food is good!) but we won't be going back for dinner."}
{"text":"Great beer selection,  bartenders are awesome and very friendly and lobster Mac and cheese and chicken nachos are amazing.  Definitely recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"WARNING ,,,,, this place is for SUCKERS ONLY ..... funky smelling ,worse tasting seafood ... overpriced ..... raunchy,un-clean restrooms .... only reason anyone goes here is because this is a ''tourist trap '' type neighborhood with some fun shopping spots nearby and this restaurant is positioned in the center of everything. As P.T. Barnum once said  '' There's a sucker born every minute '' ...... stay away ... any other restaurant will be better ."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a bite to eat and some drinks before seeing a show earlier in the week on a Thursday. It wasn't very crowded and we were immediately greeted and seated. Service was okay not the greatest but not the worst either. Waitress came off as kind of nonchalant, but she checked on us throughout our meal and according to other reviews doesn't look like they even got that. Kitchen staff was slow in execution especially for not having a big crowd.   I wasn't in the mood for seafood so I opted to try other things on their menu   LOBSTER BISQUE --  Huge portion. I didn't expect to get as much in the bowl as I actually got. Although shallow, the bowl is large and you get a pretty decent serving in it. Despite the size, the flavor was lacking as well as texture. I've had some pretty delicious basques before and think it could be improved with a pinch of salt and corn for texture. It's missing something.   GARLIC PARM WINGS --  Got an order of wings and they were good. Not an over powering flavor of garlic and not super duper oily. They used real garlic and it was served with it - minced. The wings were deep fried to a nice crispness so it added a little crunch which I liked. Served with common celery and your choice of rand and blue cheese. Not bad.   MARGHERITA PIZZA -- Looks better than it tastes. This can be easily split between two people - not a single server. The pizza is cooked in a wood fired oven and made very thin so it gets a nice crispy crunch. The crust was actually very good. It has a good texture to it and the lightly char taste you get from wood burning ovens was nice. I typically don't like that taste. Though I enjoyed the crust and what not - there was like no cheese on the pizza so it was way too saucy and lack-lustrous. Not what I would have expected so I was quite disappointed"}
{"text":"I used to be a frequent visitor of Roland's...the food was always good and the beer was always cold.....well not this particular Friday afternoon. I went there with a friend just after the lunch rush....we sat at the bar, because we a little short on time. There was only 1 bartender working so the service was a little slow. We ordered 2 beers and 2 fish sandwiches.......the beer was luke-warm....it came out of the tap with so much foam I could tell before he sat it down in front of me.....then he tried to argue the fact that the beer was warm.....NOT A GOOD START! He finally conceded to replace the beer with some that were a little colder (but not much) and gave a lame explanation to why the temp was not right, took our order and then we waited, and waited, and waited for about 45mins for our sandwiches to come out...... I want to say the fish was very hot, but it was also very greasy as if they fried it and then refried it then let it sit in the dirty brown grease...not to mention the fries were very cold. So after waiting another 15-20mins the bartender asked how is the food....of course we complained know we waited 15 more mins to talk the manager TIM.....he was snarky and sarcastic....when we told him the fish was greasy he returned with \"well it is fried in grease\".....DUH! TIM! we kinda knew that!......needless to say we did not finish our beer or our food....we went down the street to Wholey's and got a hot fish sandwich minus the grease."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0 stars, this is my first time even writing a review, just so I could warn people about this place. The waitress gave me the complete wrong order, and she was air-headed and all over the place the entire time. Forgot our orders twice and had to come back and check with us, she wrote all of our orders on the back of an old receipt and mixed them up over and over again. The place was completely empty and the food took 45 minutes and came out cold. The \"shrimp and scallop combo\" made me violently ill an hour after I ate only about 1/4 of it. Don't come here, don't waste your money, the food is gross and the service is bad."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Sunday night.  It was quite loud, and on the evening of a Steeler's game, but we hadnt anticipated a loud crowd at 5pm.  Then again, we were in Pittsburgh, so it's a given.  The waitress was slow getting around to us.  We felt like an inconvenience rather than a patron. The kids each ordered a pizza and they said it was awesome. I ordered the lobster roll and maybe my expectations were too high given the reviews, but I was disappointed.  My husband ordered the swordfish and he was unimpressed.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"We headed to the strip district to soak in the atmosphere like any good tourist should do.  Unfortunately we love to sleep and showed up a little late and by the time we were ready to eat (around 4pm) our list of recommended places to try were already closed for the day.   Roland's was open though. As an added bonus they were showing the Steeler's game and there is nothing that Pittsburgh loves more than supporting the Steeler's and Penguin's. The atmosphere was great with everyone dressed in black and yellow and really into the game.  We ordered wedding soup (pretty delicious) and Portobello Mushroom Pizza. Maybe our mistake was not ordering seafood, anyway the caramelized onions on it were actually cooked in sugar (eww) and the sauce itself was just as sweet. It felt like we were eating candy.  As for the staff, Pittsburgh in general has some of the friendliest people I've come across in a long time. The staff here may not have been quite as friendly as we had come to expect from the rest of this lovely city but they were just fine."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, had some good beer. Ordered oysters, they came out fairly well chopped up, they were fresh and tasty, but the person who opened them needs more practice.  I ordered the beer battered fish sandwich. It was large enough, a touch greasy but tasty anyway.  The fries were not crisp, seems like they waited under a heat lamp. Portion was large, but I didn't finish them. An ok place along a touristy location."}
{"text":"Fresh shucked oysters and parm & arugula pizza great!  Quality Pizza crust, hellava lot better than IL Fornio and better price!  And this is a seafood restaurant!  Service was attentive and professional.  Bloody Mary tasted watered - down otherwise you would of gotten 5 stars."}
{"text":"well all I can say not so good. To start our server very friendly but winey I don't care who didn't show up to prep or that the manager had to take tables.  we ordered two ice teas the lobster roll and the filet sandwich each came with fries and slaw.  Well I went to get sugar out of the sugar caddy to find a blood stained band aid stuffed in it, that should have signaled me to leave, but I didn't. we each got our sandwich the fresh cut fries were so cold and hard they had been sitting for awhile. the filet sandwich was good but my lobster roll was so fishey and the bread was saturated with butter it was dripping. Then halfway through lunching one of the umbrellas from the upper roof top deck blew off into the street. it was almost impossible to pay we had to go inside and hunt down the server, the sink in the ladies room was missing the hot water handle. Overall pretty crappy considering I had this lobster roll about three years ago and it was fantastic"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm giving a 4 stars cause I'm in love with their margarita pizza. Its definitely not fine dining but for a local bar with food, I think they do it right. Their service has always been on point and their food is consistent. They have a great patio and on a nice sunny day its a great place for a cocktail and a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Seem to return here every few months due to location and their balcony is fun when the weather is nice. The food and service is generally ok. We were there on 1/6/17 for happy hour which is decent.  As we were enjoying our drinks, I spotted a mouse hanging out behind the bar.  A bit unnerved,  I pointed it out to the waiter.  \"OK thanks\" he said and that was it. No one else came to investigate and no one seemed to think it was a big deal.  Needless to say  my appetite was gone.  Where is the health dept when you need them?"}
{"text":"went back here last night and the service was extremely slow.  in fact our waitress may have been tipsy.    we waited for a solid 20 minutes before receiving menus.  we asked for drinks at least 3 times.  thankfully, our food was good and made it out after we ordered at a somewhat normal pace.    the calamari was good and enormous in portion.  it comes with a side of marinara with red pepper flakes.  i liked the kick.  it's garnished with sweet peppers and pamesean cheese.  yeah for the calamari!  hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal. Had the lobster nachos. They were very good. And ordered the lobster roll. It was also good. Only draw back was they brought our salads and then our appetizers almost at the same time. And then our meals came and we were still trying to eat apps and salad. Otherwise very enjoyable."}
{"text":"A fantastic place in the Strip District of Pittsburgh to enjoy food, beverages, family and friends...and not necessarily in that order. I ordered the seafood stew prepared by Chef Joe...Outstanding!!! My sister ordered New England Clam Chowda, also delicious (I've ordered it before). My other sister ordered beer battered shrimp and side salad, no regrets.  Needless to say,our bartender, Rhett was wonderful! Y'all or Y'enz just gotta go to Rolands."}
{"text":"My family came in to town for the Steelers Christmas Day game. We chose Rowlands because we came in to town the previous June and had an incredible dining experience. This time I ordered the crab dip because it was so delicious the last time. The dip came and I ate a couple of bites and realized there was no crab in it. I asked for it to be removed from my bill as we were on a time constraint. Waiter said he couldn't do that as it was already rung up.  He instead came back to our table with cash reimbursement and that I was still being charged for the dip on my bill and told me I could not take the remaining dip home.........Now, im back in the burgh. Should I dare try again?"}
{"text":"We loved the seafood. The waiter suggested The appetizers and they were great. The lobster sliders were amazing and also the lobster nachos were very good. Will go back again  The service was great."}
{"text":"Tried it out on a workday afternoon, and wasn't disappointed. Came in again another day, and holy crap, these people move at the speed of snails on LSD. Unless your are here for a beer, forget about it."}
{"text":"Here's a little story...  The first time I ate here was with 3 friends right after the Pens won the Stanley cup this last time. All of us got violently ill despite eating different things.  The bathrooms were atrocious. There was toilet paper everywhere. There were some bugs in the ladies room.  This was mid-day and NOT the southside so I found it a bit surprising.  The last few times I've eaten here have been in the last 2 years and everytime I find the food and environment to be mediocre.  It's never horrible. Hasn't made me sick, again.  It's just sub par.  My s.o. likes the lobster roll here and says it's great.  I don't eat seafood often so I wouldn't know. I've had the white pizza with basil and it was pretty good.  Good cheese to crust ratio for sure. I wouldn't say not to go here, but if you're looking to get something delicious and exciting I'd suggest finding something else in the strip."}
{"text":"I had an ok experience at Roland's on a Sunday afternoon a few weeks ago...honestly nothing to write home about.    Lobster roll: the servings were really big and very different from the lobster rolls I've had in the past...the bread was really thick and kind of greasy (which wasn't bad, but it was almost too much with the lobster sandwiched between it)    Drinks: mid-day mimosas with one of my best friends were a positive touch Service: decent  Atmosphere: meh, nothing special"}
{"text":"Meh. Roland's seems like it would be a signature restaurant of the strip but it didn't quite live up to the reputation it has for good seafood. More like a grease fest. I ordered the lobster roll and the hubby ordered fish tacos. I can't say any of it blew me away, but it was okay. However, for the quality of seafood you're getting, I think the pricing is just too high. Especially when you're paying for mostly grease. The portions look huge but you're paying for mostly fries."}
{"text":"My first time eating dinner here, will prb only go back for an app and drinks, Roland's is a seafood grill however the seafood we ordered lacked flavor. I ordered the stuffed crabmeat shrimp with broccoli and carrots... the veggies were over cooked and limp, the shrimp was ok but there was barely and crabmeat on my plate. My friend ordered the pasta di mare with white sauce. It was very bland, lacked flavor and sauce. Overall, we were very disappointed with our meal and wasted $60 on subpar food. Roland's need to step it up!! I would never recommend this place for dinner to anyone."}
{"text":"Hot, dirty, poor service. We only had one drink at the bar, the facility is disgusting."}
{"text":"I should have trusted the Yelp review rating. Place was busy, so I thought I would give it a try. Ordered lobster bisque and lobster roll. Bisque was more like tomato soup with some fishy flavor, disappointing. Lobster roll was on a very thick toasted oversized hotdog bun, way too much bread. Lobster was like rubber (possibly pre-frozen?) and tasteless. Fries we're luke warm at best and tough. Trust the YELP!"}
{"text":"I popped into Roland's while on a Bike Bus Tour in Pittsburgh the other weekend. We had 11 shots and the bartender gave me two pint glasses to thank us for spending three digits on one second's worth of alcohol consumption :) The bathroom was clean, the bartender was cool, and we were in and out of there with our big group in under ten minutes. Got mean mugged by a few families that might have been jealous of all our fun-having, but hey- it seemed like a cool place and I wouldn't mind cozying up to the bar for a cheap beer if I was a local!"}
{"text":"We took my dad to dinner here for his birthday. There were only 6 of us, and it was a Sunday evening - not too busy, but they seemed to be understaffed. We were able to be seated immediately, which was nice. All of the staff was very friendly. Those are about the only positive things I can say about our experience.   We all ordered appetizers. When the waitress brought them out she admitted that she had forgotten to put my dads order of stuffed mushrooms in. Actually, she didn't even remember what he had ordered so we had to tell her again.   My appetizer was Cajun shrimp, which was WAY over seasoned. I couldn't even see the shrimp underneath the thick crust of Cajun seasoning. It was at least 1/4\" thick, and had to be scraped off. But there was so much that I couldn't even taste the shrimp at that point, only crusty dry chunks of seasoning.   My sister ordered oysters. She said they were not shucked/cleaned correctly, so there was grit in her oysters.   My dads stuffed mushrooms finally arrived well after salads. They didn't discount them or take them off the bill or anything, which I find annoying since the waitress admitted she completely forgot them and they arrived about 30 minutes after they were ordered.   As for our meals, it was a series of mediocrity and mistakes. My steak, which was ordered medium, was served well, as was my fathers. I chose to send mine back, which meant I got my steak after everyone had already finished their meals. My lobster tail was chewy and the \"stuffing\" in it was not very good. My father said his scampi was \"okay\".  My sister ordered the Pasta Di Mare - which she said was basically pasta covered in olive oil, which was largely bland and unseasoned, instead of a wine sauce.   My other sister had the crab cakes, which she said were bland and dry.  My brother in law had the lobster roll, which seemed to be the winner of the night. He said it was decent. Not great, but decent.   My sisters fiancé ordered the seafood stew and he described the sauce as \"milk, with old bay seasoning in it.\" He said it was \"gross\".   The mashed potatoes were great, everyone agreed on that.   I did see my sister pull a hair out of her salad dressing.   I also had a big ol fly land, twitching, right by my plate as I was moving my steak. I could have sworn it popped out from under the wilted piece of lettuce that my steak was served on...but my sister said she didn't think so. She killed it with a napkin since it seemed it was in the throes of death already.   The bathrooms were disgusting.   This is probably the worst review of a restaurant I've ever written. I feel bad because our waitress was really nice... But this place was just awful. I probably should give it one star, but I felt like the waitress was really trying her hardest to give us a good experience. I feel worse because now we need to take my dad out to another dinner to make up for this - he is not a complainer but I could tell he was disappointed.   We will not go back and will not recommend Roland's."}
{"text":"We had raw bar oysters which were very good and lobster rolls.  The lobster rolls were served warm which was interesting but the seasoned butter sauce took away all the taste of lobster.  Would be willing to go back to try something else but wasn't overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was fast. Our server was pleasant and very friendly.  Will come back for sure"}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed with this place. I got the lobster roll with fries. The fries were ok, nothing really wrong with them. As for the lobster roll, it really was just bland and not memorable at all. We also ordered a margherita pizza, and I did not like that either. It was soggy, like wet cardboard, and the toppings didn't seem very fresh either. It didn't help that service wasn't the best. Although we got seated fairly quickly, our waitress barely came back to the table. I don't think it's worth it to come back here for me, especially not for the price."}
{"text":"Can't rate their food because I never got a chance to eat. Their bartender was the absolute biggest jerk I've ever met in my entire life in any establishment I have ever been in any State I've ever traveled to.  The attitude of the entire staff is mildly one of, \"Please don't talk to me, you're just an inconvenience and I'm just trying to get thru my shift.\" However, this one bartender went out of his way to make me feel like my business was not only not appreciated, but that he wanted me to leave. What did I do? Nothing, I guess because I happen to have been by myself, I wasn't worth his time or bother to serve me a beer, so he simply ignored me, and then went out of his way to make me feel uncomfortable by switching channels of a football game I had come in to watch and giving me lame excuses as to why he couldn't put the game on even ONE tv set. He proved he not only was a jerk, but a liar on top of it. If you love being treated like garbage when spending your hard earned money, then this is the place for you, if on the other hand, you want to have a little service, and made to feel like your business is appreciated, then avoid this place like the plaque."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years especially to get the lobster roll. Had out of town guests so I wanted to take them somewhere Pittsburgh! Lobster roll was good but not awesome like I remember. It was dry but I just asked for extra butter and lemon. The waitress however was rude and I'm hoping just having a bad day. She brought out wrong appetizer when I brought it to her attention she snapped \"that's what I wrote down\" I know I would never have ordered it. So I said it's ok just bring the correct one and she never did. I  always tip well cause I'm in the restaurant business myself and this is one of the few times I thought about not tipping at all. ( I gave her 15% not 20%) good polite service staff makes a big difference even when the food is off. But when you have bad service it's inexcusable."}
{"text":"Turn around, exit the building, and don't look back. I asked our waiter \"What is your most famous local brew that you serve here? Coors light , miller light.\" hmm...okay..maybe he needed a more precise question. \"What does the white lightening brew tasted like?\"    The server responded, \"I don't know. My table yesterday ordered it and they liked it.\"  Are you kidding me?  If the world has fallen apart, and this is the last place available, sit outside.  The indoors smells like urine.  Bathrooms are not clean at all."}
{"text":"The wait staff looked like they were bussed in from a homeless shelter. The strange hostesses seated my party of 4, & it took 25 minutes to get our first beers. Ordered an app & left 25 minutes later, the lobster nachos never came, which sucked because I was quote excited about those. The place is gross! There was food & trash all over the floor & I watched several women exit the restroom with very disgusted looks on there face because the restroom was so nasty. This was confirmed by my wife. Skip this place & go anywhere else in the Strip District"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and unfortunately spent about 2 hours here because the kitchen was backed up.  Luckily for us we had the time to spare.  Came down to the strip to pick up some stuff for Christmas Eve party and ended here  for some lunch.  I got the lobster roll and it was delicious.  The roll was practically soaked in butter, so that could be an improvement but the lobster meal was great and warm.  They also have a great lobster bisque as well that I'm sure is made from pure cream.  My wife had the crab cake sandwich, and was only mediocre.  It wasn't crispy and bland.  I would come back here again but would so for the lobster roll.  The waiter was great and attentive but the food did take FOREVER to come out.  He did warn us of this and I don't blame him one bit."}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburgh and searched for the best lobster roll. Roland's seemed to be the most popular. I got the lobster roll and the clam's casino. Both seemed very cheaply made and lacked any taste in my opinion. The service was ok and the bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"Ok. Spoke to soon. Bar server took the bad raw bar off my bill.  Still worried about what bad clam is going to fo to me!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite for the first time. Had Lobster roll and thought it was really good. Waiter was friendly and helpful and we didn't wait long, but they weren't really busy. I think I'll go back again."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Buffalo shrimp dip was excellent. The fish sandwich was also fantastic and too large to finish. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times.  The best thing about it is the outdoor seating and the fact that it's usually open when other places around it are closed.   The food isn't great.  I've had the pizzas before they are not spectacular.  On the most recent trip, I went with my seafood loving friend.  He got the clam chowder and the Roland's Seafood Stew.  He said it was just ok.  Nothing special tasting about either of them.  I got the wings and a side of fries.  Wings were good, but the fries were nothing special.   It was just nice to sit outside on the sidewalk and find a place open on a Tuesday after a holiday.   We would come back if there was nothing else open and wanted to sit outside."}
{"text":"I've taken my daughter and gf here a couple times.  The food isn't bad, but it is rather overpriced.  Good selection of beers, though.  On the last visit, our waitress spilled food on my gf while bussing the table.  She was irritatingly unconcerned.  Service here is generally rather half-assed.  If you are going to charge nice place prices for Tipsy McStagger's Family Restaurant quality food, your staff really ought to do a better job of kissing up to the customers."}
{"text":"Roland's lobster roll.  You could drive all the way to Maine, but why do that?   Roland's knows not to mess up a good thing.  Butter, lobster, and grilled Mancini bread.  Nothing better South of Massachusetts!"}
{"text":"We like to come here for brunch on the weekends. As far as the Strip goes, Roland's doesn't usually have a terribly long wait if any.  The food is good, especially if you're a seasoned visitor - you know to order the lobster roll! The best part is the balcony deck on a sunny day with a bloody mary. There are tons of options here for those who don't like seafood- sandwiches, pizza, nachos."}
{"text":"OMG what a nightmare. I was there last saturday at 9pm with a group of 10 people in the second floor bar area. The bartenders acted like it was a big inconvience that we were there. ordered drinks and didnt even get a thank you. the bar was dirty and littered with dirty glasses. The restrooms were filthy and didnt even have toliet paper . We left the bar and spent a HUGE anoun of money up the street.. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Every time i'm in Pittsburgh which is a lest once a year for a Steelers game I come.  I love their Happy Hour yummy and affordable.  I will take a $3.50 beer any day of the week.  Raw bar selection is nice and their mussels so yummy.  I can'rt remember his name but the older gentleman behind the bar is awesome so friendly."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend and another couple for my birthday dinner. I looked at reviews on this site and I was surprised to see all the bad ones. I had been to Roland's once about two years ago and remembered loving their food. I now know why there were so many bad reviews. I was really disappointed and had a really terrible birthday dinner. The only reason I gave this restaurant two stars is because our waiter was fantastic and was so attentive. I am a waitress myself so I appreciate good service so much. Anyway, I got crab stuffed shrimp with broccoli. The shrimp were so small that they should never be stuffed with anything. And the amount of stuffing was a joke because of it. My broccoli was basically raw. My boyfriend got Ahi Tuna which he normally loves. His tuna was so rubbery. It was horrible. His broccoli was also raw. I never complain at restaurants but I told him he could send his tuna back if he wanted to, but he didn't \"want to be a jerk\". The other couples food wasn't as bad as ours but it wasn't anything great either. I get some restaurants don't have great food, but the worst part is Roland's menu is fairly pricey. I believe my dinner and my boyfriend's dinner were around $25 each. They need to lower their prices significantly to reflect their food or do some work to improve their food. I will never go back to Roland's."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday November29, 2014. Entered establishment at 5:30 pm. PROS.....Very good clam chowder...biggest bowl of it I've ever been served. Sandwiches... 2 lobster rolls and 1 fish sandwich.....Both very good, although the fish was slightly overcooked. Again...huge portions.   CONS...After being at table since 5:30, nothing but our empty pop glasses were in front if us. After being told said clam chowder was being freshly cooked, 15 minutes later it was served. As good as it was, it certainly wasn't hot enough to claim it just came out if the pot. Our sandwiches finally came out after other tables around who had ordered well after us received our orders. They may also want to schedule a couple more servers on a Saturday night. The best though was the incompetent hostess. The hostess with the leastest. Talk about someone who didn't have a clue. From screwing up where we were supposed to sit, to watching her continue to do the same thing with others, at least it gave us something to talk about while we waited. What a twit."}
{"text":"Just OK and that's all I can really say because you will not be mad or super upset if you come here most likely but you will also not be blown away based off food and prices... just OK and definitely better options in the strip District for sure"}
{"text":"The beer selection is great, the atmosphere is awesome and the food is to die for. Get the lobster roll or the steak tip roll. The only thing that baffles me is every time I come here, they always have signs out front giving you specials of the day and every time you come in and ask them about it no one knows what's going on. So please change the signs every once in awhile if you are in fact not giving out those specials anymore."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night because we wanted to 'step out' of our usual places on Carson St.  The place was rather busy and was pleasantly warm on a cold Saturday night.  We found seats at the bar and a friendly bartender greeted us and took our drink order.  The drafts arrived right away and we requested menu's...    We ordered 2 shrimp cocktails and a calamari.  The shrimp arrived within 5 minutes and came with a small bowl of cocktail sauce with a dollop of horseradish on top.  I mixed mine as I love horseradish but my friend would have preferred it on the side or in another bowl as he isn't a fan.  The shrimp were big and fresh and delicious.  I mean- can you really mess up cold shrimp...?  The calamari took over a half hour to arrive.  It was pleasing to the eye and smelled delicious.  It had grilled onions & peppers on it with a slight spice dusted on top.  I thought it was delicious but my wife wasn't digging it.  She thought it was overcooked & rubbery.  Our friend isn't a fan of calamari so we didn't have a 3rd opinion to be the deciding factor...  Then things went south... My wife went into the ladies room and came out with a straight up disgusted look on her face.  I saw her stop a waitress and after the 'chat' the waitress turned away and rolled her eyes.  Well, my wife said the bathroom was disgusting- Toilet paper & paper towels all over the floor, 5 stalls with only a half roll of toilet paper to be shared between all 5, no paper towels to dry your hands off after you washed them.  Does the employees have a separate washroom to use or do they use this one also and just don't notice???  The health dept signs say \"Employees must wash & dry hands with soap & hot water\".  Then I visited the Men's room and found almost the same thing- paper all over the floor in the stalls, I didn't notice if they had tp in there, and no paper towels to dry your hands with.    To us- the bathrooms must be clean & well stocked or we wonder what the kitchen & other 'back of house' areas look like.  If the bathrooms are in this much need of attention- the kitchen must be worse...    We paid our tab and left..."}
{"text":"Crab cakes were okay. Ask for the fries extra crispy, and they were a little oily and not so crispy. Salad with blue cheese salad dressing was average. Blue cheese dressing was Marie's from a jar. All in all, I left reasonably satisfied but far from overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Large beer selection. Large bar and nice upstairs bar. The patio is a great spot to have a drink in the warmer months.   I get the same thing every time I go - lobster roll and fries. It's really good...you get a lot of lobster and nothing else added.  The lobster is the star of the dish. I've had various appetizers and they were all good."}
{"text":"On a slow night it takes:  20 minutes for water 30 minutes for beer  60+ minutes for soup and raw entrees  Come hungry, leave hungrier and bitter because you wasted time and money."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after shopping at the strip on a Sunday afternoon. The Steelers were playing, so the place was packed. We were able to sit outside on the patio, which was nice. Our waiter was friendly, very busy. He said they were under staffed due to sending staff hime early. Rookie mistake for an older place like Rolands. He kept us happy the best he could. Ordered the stuffed mushrooms which were not bad. Split the beer battered fish sandwich. It was huge! Glad we split it. Pretty crispy and very hot! The drink specials were good during the game 3$  for 16 Oz Coors light. The womens restrooms were dirty. Overall not a great experience, but not a terrible one either."}
{"text":"Good selection of craft beer. We went in there totally unplanned, but found out we weren't in the mood for seafood( PS: it's our first time in Pittsburgh) .., the server was really nice, we got 2 to go beers... which was cool!"}
{"text":"THERE ARE RATS HERE. Eat here if you're into dining with rats.   My business partner and I went to Pittsburgh for business and weren't picky about our food but rats is on a whole new level. We didn't see this rat until the end of the meal. Before I saw the rat, I told my business partner that my pasta was the worst plate of pasta I've ever had in my life but ate it anyway because I was so hungry. I regret eating it...  Towards the end of the meal, the rat ran past our table and lingered around the booth areas for awhile and didn't even look scared. It was DISGUSTING.   We told the server who went to get the manager. 5 minutes later, he came out and said \"oh well you know we leave the door open sometimes and they just come in.\" What does that even mean?? He was rude, unapologetic, and nonchalant which made us think this is a common thing for them at the restaurant!  He didn't offer to waive the bill or do anything about it and we stood there in shock and paid $55 for the two of us for a disgusting meal, bad service from the manager, and a RAT running around our table.  Health inspectors, please come look at this restaurant so RATS will stop roaming around."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a Sunday brunch and had a great time.  Ordered the calamari which came with roasted peppers and onions.  Very good choice. For my entree, I had the meat trio pizza.  It was good, not great but had an overall pleasant time at Rolands."}
{"text":"First time there and the food was amazing. Definitely recommended place to eat, drink and enjoy the company"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. Great mussels! And plentiful too! At least a couple dozen in the serving."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch while walking the Strip. Lobster roll was excellent. Had a good selection of craft beers. Our waitress was very attentive and personable. We liked that they allow split entrees (we only wanted a light lunch)."}
{"text":"I hesitate to even write this review because technically we didn't eat here.  But after reading the other reviews, I thought \"Eh, what the hell.\"  We came in and were seated at 5:45pm for desserts/drinks.   By 6:05, we still hadn't seen our waitress.  We decided it wasn't worth it and just left.  I did eat here a month ago, and yes -- the fried fish was fried to the point where it was beyond greasy.  And then to pay around $20 for that?  LOL.  Right.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"We figured we'd give it a try even though the reviews weren't great.  Brother in law enjoyed his wings and the beer wasn't bad.  Bartender was helpful."}
{"text":"Oyster and Clams were excellent. Main course was delicious and the beverages very cold! The bar tender was very nice and friendly. A very welcome site. Had a great experience. I would return."}
{"text":"Overall, my experience was okay. We sat at the bar and our bartender was very friendly and helpful. We got the scallop appetizer and it was TO DIE FOR! I will 100% go back for that! That being said, it was downhill from there. We got the lobster roll and lobster ravioli...and both were \"ehhh.\" The lobster roll had a ton of lobster on it (yeah!) but there wasn't any other seasoning or any type of dressing to tie it all together. The lobster  ravioli was the biggest disappointment because it had absolutely NO flavor....I had to grab the salt shaker and even then it barely had a taste. I can't even comment on the lobster inside of the ravioli because the whole thing just tasted like nothing.  I'll go back for the scallops, but wouldn't recommend anything else."}
{"text":"Wouldn't give this place one star. Mike and Nick were the absolute worst. Supposedly one was the owners son and can't be confronted for his behavior. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I have only been to Rolands for Happy Hour.  I can't say anything about dinner service or food other than Happy Hour items.  It is a great happy hour with $.60 peel and eat shrimp, oysters, wings and clams.  I like the fact that I could go and eat just one oyster, if I felt like it.  Some place you have to get certain increments, but there it can be any odd number.  Sometimes you want 7 of anything, and you get 7 of anything.  (I am not into structure)    The bartenders have always been attentive and polite, yet I have only been there between 3-6 pm and there has never been a crowd.  If anything, go to the happy hour, but go early."}
{"text":"Great place in the strip district. Went there after long day at the office for happy hour. 60cent clams / oysters/ shrimp. They were fresh and service was good. I'll be back on my next trip."}
{"text":"I am only judging this place as a bar, never had the food.  I'd rather give it 2.5 stars.  I came here with a colleague after a long, long travel experience to get to Pittsburgh.    They had a nice collection of beers including some local ones.  The only negative side is that the bartender had almost no knowlege of what the beers were like so we had to just try our luck.  The bartender had never tried any of the beers nor did he care about them.  I would have liked to have more info in order to make smarter choices about which beers to get.  At least one of them I would have avoided if I'd know more about it.  Perhaps he was just not used to encountering a beer geek.  I did pass by the place the next day around lunch and it was full of customers.  For what ever that means."}
{"text":"I love Roland's happy hour! It's for a raw bar rather than the actual bar. 60 cent oysters, clams, cocktail shrimp, and wings. It's good and you can't beat the price. The downfall? The clams i got steamed and they were a little over done, and the oysters were left attached to the shell. But for 60 cents, I can deal with taking them Off myself. As far as service? We sat at the bar, he wasn't very friendly or rude, just meh. But the food came out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour for the seafood. Nothing spectacular; service was good, food was alright. Had the steamed oysters, clam, and shrimp which were just ok. The clam chowder was the only thing that was really good."}
{"text":"Let's see.... Rolands can be fun to go to for happy hour after work on Friday.  Heck they used to have these two bartenders that if you were a good looking girl at least one would give you a beer or two but making up the difference by overcharging or flat out giving incorrect change back to some male patrons.  Anyhow, they have a somewhat unique upstairs and in the summer they have the balcony that you can sit out on.  One summer night it began to storm and one of their umbrellas flew off the base and cracked me in the head.  I though I was going to pass out, but the bartender just came out gathered the pieces and put them back together folding the umbrella down.  Yea no reason to apologize I just could have been decapitated.  \ Now onto the food.....uh  well....my best suggestion is, if you are on a timed lunch or have limited time for dinner, PICK SOMEWHERE ELSE!  you will only get frustrated with the SLOW AS HELL service.  Suggestions, hmm not entirely sure since nothing I ate here impressed me much.  The lobster roll, I am certain wasn't \"real\" lobster and was very rubbery, and dry.  Way too much bun to lobster type meat, and overpriced for a sandwich, $15.00 I think.  Next we got the oysters.  6  were supposed to be in an order but they only delivered 5.  But good luck finding the waitress, she showed up 3x's in the hour and half that we were there for dinner.  Not because it took us an hour and half to eat but 15 minutes to get waited on.  15 more minutes for drinks, and to order.  45 minutes for food to come, and I think you get the picture... I wouldn't eat here again, there are many other places to choose from.  Lastly I ordered a draft beer it was warm, told the waiter who got me a bottle but still charged me for both... NICE..."}
{"text":"Here on business. This was a recommendation from the city bus driver as we wanted to hang out on the strip. I had the seafood stew. It was awesome. Flowing with seafood. I asked for it spicy and it was. Hubby got the stuffed shrimp. It came with a remoulade sauce that I could drink. Prices were affordable. He waitress did warn us that the food came from two different kitchens so they might not come out together. I thought that was strange and they did not come out together but not real far apart. Lots of leftovers. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in the Strip District.  Timeless classic that never goes out of style.  They had a remodeled a few years ago, which opened the front of the restaraunt and they they've created a patio of sorts that is perfect for outside dining when the sun decides to shine.  Excellent seafood options, and you'll never go wrong with the lobster rolls.  The hot lobster roll is served on buttery Mancini roll and melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"I've been here before but last night will probably be the last time I ever have any type of desire to eat their food. My boyfriend and I were meeting my parents for dinner and everywhere we tried was booked for reservation only on Pitts graduation weekend. We ended up and Roland's and were seated within 5 minutes.  Our waitress was a combination of ditzy, snobby and bored. She was awkward and uncomfortable every time she came to the table. She is not a good candidate to be in the service industry, in my opinion.   We ordered the lobster roll sliders to start. There were 4 of us and they brought out three. No big deal- mom and I will split one....but the waitress only brought three plates. I ordered the Maryland crab soup (specified first) and hot lobster Caesar salad. My salad came out shortly after the appetizer sliders. I sat for 15 minutes without touching the salad as to wait for the rest of everyone to get their food. Finally it was delivered. My dad and boyfriend had the seafood stew which they said was good and my mom had the pasta di mare (she said it was just ok. Lacking flavor) and a salad (which she was never given and didn't realize until after we left).  No soup for me apparently. I requested the waitress please bring it out. She was unapologetic.   When I finally got to dive into my hot lobster (now cold lobster) caesar, I realized it was just lettuce, a little cheese and the lobster. At this point I was so irritated with everything I didn't even care - nor was I surprised at the quality of my dish given everything leading up to it.  The lobster was good and there was a good bit of it plus the Caesar dressing which I always like. The Maryland crab soup tasted like chunky tomato marinara sauce and I gave it to my boyfriend to go home and use on his own homemade seafood pasta dish. My mom was disgusted by the clams in her dish and it was suggested that they were probably frozen.   Do yourself a favor and go down the street to luke wholeys Alaskan grill where you get much better quality seafood for the same price. After I had been there; I feel totally ripped off by Roland's. No bueno."}
{"text":"Great drinks + sports!!!!!!! The seafood is super fresh!!! Perfect for a late dinner!"}
{"text":"The prices are a little steep, but the food is good.  This combined with our wobbly table and overly peppered Bloody Mary is the reason for the 3 star review although I would have given a half extra star if I could.  We had a lobster roll and a shrimp po boy for lunch on a Saturday afternoon at the strip.  The service was very quick and our server was friendly and attentive.  Just know you'll easily drop 40-50 bucks for lunch for fairly standard fare and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Well I have had several meals over the years at Rolands, many of which were good.  Yesterday was not one of those days.  After being seated, it took nearly 10 minutes for a server to greet us and take a drink order.  I was of course rewarded with the wrong beer.  Then we order and when the food arrived, the fries were cold and the fish sandwich was rather greasy.  I wake up today only to be 'sick' from the whole ordeal.  My mother, who had the same food as I did, is feeling the same as me.  Get your act together Rolands, you are better than this."}
{"text":"Last weekend my mother and I headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods - lunch meat and cheese from Penn Mac - veggies at Stans - needed some new spices from Penzeys for a chili I was going to make that day....we were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping.  We parked in front of Roland's and see the sign: Famous for Lobster Rolls and Bloody Mary's!  Perfect.   My mother got the Lobster Roll, which she said was 'good'. The bread, from Mancini's, was of course tasty - toasted and buttery - delicious mostly because it was Mancini's bread. I had the Lobster Roll minus the carbs on a salad - and the lobster was tasty, no doubt , I mean, lobster is just - good. For the price though, not sure that I got enough bang for my buck. The salad was something I could have picked up at Get-Go in the pre-made section. I just didn't feel satisfied at the end of my meal. I couldn't even drink my Bloody Mary (this is a rare affair), way too much horseradish, and I often like horseradish in my Bloodies!  And it was cold - didn't even take my winter coat off. So, needless to say, not the best experience.  Talk about false advertisement..."}
{"text":"Got lobster roll and lobster nachos for take out. Everything taste great and we were surprised that how much lobster they put in there and it was a very satisfying meal. Not sure on all the negative reviews, but I think this place worth a try. The lobster roll taste garlicie, butterie! Everything I was expecting."}
{"text":"Usually I really like this place.  Stopped in after not eating all day, and ordered the \"famous\" lobster roll.  It took 40  minutes to receive a medium piece of lobster claw on thick Mancino toast.  THATS IT!  Oh and less than stellar fries, with a cup of cole slaw.  I waited with an empty pint glass several times as well...I guess you can't get it right every time."}
{"text":"Great. We had the lobster roll, Cajun shrimp, beer battered shrimp, and chicken club. Everything was delicious and came out promptly. The sandwiches are served on thick Texas toast type bread. The seafood was very good and fresh. I'm from MD so I'm very picky about seafood lol. The drinks were yummy and the staff was cool. Went on a Sunday afternoon. It was pretty busy but didn't have to wait very long for an outdoor table. I do recommend :)"}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburgh on a work related trip and the group I was with took us to Roland's for dinner. I was apprehensive bc of it's 2.5 star Yelp rating, but didn't get a chance to read the reviews beforehand (I've since read a few of the bad ones). That said, I was very pleasantly surprised with my meal because I wasn't expecting much. I ordered the Cajun shrimp appetizer and this is the only reason I'm giving 4 stars. The shrimp were very spicy but not flavorful. I like spicy food but not when it's just hot for no reason without flavor. The mango salsa it came with made it bearable. Now let's get down the business, my main meal was the Roland's Seafood stew which was DELICIOUS! The stew is a light cream based broth with lobster, shrimp, scallops, mussels, clams and potatoes. If licking the bowl in public were appropriate, I would've. More fun facts, the food came out relatively fast and our waiter was super friendly and quick - she was literally hustling back and forth. I'll bookmark this spot for the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Omg I felt like I was in Boston. Love this place! Best staff and killer food! Plating and presentation was great as well. Our attentive friendly cute inked up waiter was even sweet enough to give my gf that was losing her voice 2 cough drops which helped her voice so much. How sweet. I'm picky and WOW! Order accuracy was great too! Bald muscular inked up Bartender guy made a killer drink and was cute too. I swear a modeling agency has got to do their hiring. Every girl and guy there was so attractive, clean, friendly, sharply dressed, attentive, beautiful ink, all smiles, looked happy, knowledgeable...  You can tell they all really enjoy working there and have great chemistry with each other.  It's a well oiled machine.  I'll be back! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Fish was not cooked thoroughly. The middle folded over still had wet batter. ALSO their beer glasses have a heavy glass bottom and about 2 ounces less product when they serve in their glasses."}
{"text":"I experienced first hand why this place got only 2.5 stars Everything was awful, from the no crabmeat soup to the over cooked lobster(roll). Down right awful"}
{"text":"Another place that I visit once every few years thinking it couldn't be as bad as I remember it.  And the place NEVER lets me down; it's just as bad as I remember.  The seafood is breaded and fried to the point of inedible.  The staff is rude.  The prices are too high for the quality.  Just all around disappointing."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The beer choices and the casual menu was right up my alley. Unfortunately the food was not. The \"famous\" lobster roll had so much butter on it I think I am going to have a heart attack in my sleep tonight. Can't recommend the place."}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better than this for seafood and cocktails.  While here, we raided the raw bar menu having oysters on the 1/2 shell, raw clams, and their jumbo shrimp. All were fresh and delicious.  Also, they serve a little bit of horseradish on top of their cocktail sauce to add a little extra spice for those who crave it.  The bartender here was helpful, quick, and friendly. He was knowledgable and able to provide beer recommendations based on my taste. In addition, he made excellent mixed drinks."}
{"text":"Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. The waiter was incredibly slow. We were one of the first people to arrive at the restaurant at 11am and the Food took 1 hour to arrive after ordering. Many other tables received their food before us even though they ordered after us. They brought one of my daughters meals after about 20 minutes while my other daughter had to sit there and watch her eat while she was hungry. We ended up having to take the food to go after an hour given how long it took. Spoke with the manager who had minimal compassion for the experience and worst of all this occurred on Mothers Day. By far the worst experience at a restaurant that I ever have. Do yourself a favor and go ANYWHERE else."}
{"text":"I liked the bar.   The food not at all. First time here, wife and I sat at the bar and people watched over some WELL POURED drinks.   Strong point.  Then we screwed up and ordered food.   I got their infamous lobster roll.  Glad I had a drink.  Overcooked and dry, dry, dry. I thought lobster roll was generally made with a lobster salad-like mix.  This lobster was dry and chewy.  Lots of it, though  I guess that accounts for the high price.   I went down to Wholeys and got a much tastier one for 5 bucks.  And wife's nachos were just a big pile of chips with some toppings thrown on the top.  Then the other day,  we went back and I tried pizza.  Yuck.  The toppings were terrible (pepperoni, sausage.  how can youscrew that up, but they did.)  Two slices and boxed it up so as not to hurt the waitress' feelings.  But it went into the trashcan down the street.  Go for the hootch and not the food!!"}
{"text":"BEWARE Duquesne/Pitt families visiting or anyone else!   Awful food and service! Super slow, cold fries, freezer burned carrots, rubbery lobster claws. Wait, Ceasar salad was ok!  Who hunts down the server for 10 minutes to get the check! We could've just left without paying, but I believe in Karma. NO Stars!"}
{"text":"Why cant they do a fresh fish sandwich.? Looks great, but when you try to cut it all the breading slides off like a sleeve, and the fish is slimy and flavorless. Absolutely no taste and slightly underdone.  Clams and oysters not bad, but Luke Wholeys 'much better. 2 stars for cleanliness, everything else a solid 3. Could be good, but crowded enough they dont need to try harder"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time was at least two years ago and I can't remember anything in particular about it.  The second time, though, was tonight, Valentine's Day. A group  of friends and I chose this restaurant after the place we wanted to go was closed--for good. Roland's was it, then. It wasn't very crowded, so we were seated right away. The first thing that caught my attention was how the waitresses/waiters were dressed. They weren't dressed how I would have expected them to be. They were in jeans and baggy tshirts. But, our waitress was helpful, and our food came out pretty quickly. it wasn't a memorable meal or experience. I wanted a caesar salad with my dinner, but they were out of romaine lettuce (and it wasn't late in the evening--maybe 6:30pm at the latest). The bleu cheese dressing, though, tasted pretty good. I ordered a ravioli dish for my entree, but when I asked if I could get a different sauce, the waitress said it's already mixed together, meh. I'm not a fan of that. When my friends went to order their pasta dishes, they had a choice between penne and linguini, but the restaurant was out of penne, too.  Oh well, the prices aren't terrible, and the good came out pretty quickly, and hot. It's not the best restaurant, but it's not a stink hole, either."}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent! You will not be disappointed! They have excellent fish sandwiches! I got an arugula pizza which was the best I ever had. They give extremely large delicious portions. The calamari was large & perfectly prepared & equally yummy! My daughter had an excellent lobster roll  with huge pieces of lobster. It's a great atmosphere with great service. This restaurant is located in the heart of the strip district and offers outside seating. We go to this place every time we're in town. Unfortunately, I keep ordering the same things because I like them so much so I can't offer much more advice on other dishes."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great either.  I tried the lobster roll and the bloody mary which we were informed as we walked in the Roland's was \"famous\" for.  Both were good but nothing spectacular.  I was also here quite some time ago and remember them having good pizza though.  One thing to note is that they have a really large selection of beer both on draft and in bottles."}
{"text":"Delicious lobster roll!! It came with fries and coleslaw and a pickle. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because there was more bread than I would've liked and too much butter. But the lumps of meat made it a stand out. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Not great.  But not bad.   Excellent bang for your buck, especially if you're hungry - got a bowl of soup that I could have bathed in for about five bucks."}
{"text":"Lobster roll was awesome.  There was a Moosehead beer cap in our fries and the waitress' response was, \"That must be from the beer batter.  I will give them hell.\"   I wasn't looking for a free meal but an apology from someone would have been appropriate."}
{"text":"Food was not that great...and quite expensive for lunch. Pizzas take forever....and not much variety menu wise. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Decided to try it for dinner as we were walking around the strip.  Good selection of beers too.  Started with mussels and they were very good.  Sherry butter sauce w lots of garlic.  We each had the seafood stew for dinner...tried to get beyond the lobster roll which is their signature dish  Stew was full of seafood.  Lobster,  clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp.  Good size portion at reasonable price.  Sauce was excellent and had just enough of a spice to have a nice tasting after bite but did not drown out the cream, old bay and sherry.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We spent a few hours here on the day of the St. Patrick's Day parade, and had a great time.  The space is pretty large, with indoor and outdoor seating.  They have something like 500 beers; a major plus! We sat upstairs, and because the kegs are kept in the basement, they can't get beer all the way up there.  That means you have to order bottled beer from the waitress but can go downstairs and order draft beers.  That's sort of weird.  Anywho-- I had a caesar salad and french onion soup.  Both were tasty, and the other people in my party liked their food too-- pizza and burgers.  The waitress was super friendly.  I'd like to go back and enjoy their upstairs patio & a lobster roll!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for my first time. Not only was the food amazing, but John was, by far, the most incredible bartender I have ever had. Very attentive and personable. Gave great food and beer recommendations, and let us sample everything before we purchased. The bar was full and he was the only one serving, and he still managed to stop multiple times to check up on us. He made our experience so much better. I would come back for his service alone!"}
{"text":"Raw bar is not fresh, way over priced. two of us were ill after eating at the raw bar. Was shocked because Pittsburgh is a seafood hub. Would never go back...."}
{"text":"Friends warned me not to eat here. Turns out they were GOOD friends. This was just awful, start to finish. Slow (pitiful) service, nasty food ( and we each sprung for the lobster roll -- if you can call it that!) and a generally miserable experience. And this was an early lunch with very few customers around. The only thing remotely redeemable was that we sat on the balcony overlooking Penn avenue and were entertained by the people below. People watching can be a blast.   I wanted a draft beer and was told that \"we don't serve draft beer upstairs\". What??? There's a bar there!! Are you kidding me?? So water it was and that took a long time to arrive. And without straws - another wait after I had the audacity to ask for them.  The \"lobster rolls\" arrived and looked mighty meager. That's not a lobster roll!! But I pressed on. As I got it closer to my mouth there was a slight aroma. But press on. The \"lobster\" was sparse, tough, and flavorless. How often could you say that about lobster??? Exactly!! It must have been harvested years ago and waited for me to show up so it could make its way out of the freezer. At $15 each this falls clearly into the ripoff category.  And trying to get our check? Ridiculous.   I won't be back. Ever."}
{"text":"The service was haphazard and the food only slightly better. Our server was friendly but just not very competent.  Our salads arrived after the main course.  We had the surf and turf.  The lobsters were good, but the filet was a disaster.  Round 1 looked like it was run over by something and burnt.  McDonald's hamburgers were thicker.  Round 2 the steak was red and cold.  I would make reservations at one of the other establishments in the Strip."}
{"text":"If I had to chose between dining at Roland's again, or having to catch running chainsaws that were tossed at me I'd pick dining at Rolands but only by the slimmest of margins.  Why on earth did I go back to this restaurant?  Clearly, I must not love myself or something.  Want to pay too much money for fish that smells like a sewer?  Dine at Roland's.  The only reason to be at Rolands is to drink there.  they have a pretty decent beer selection."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and decent service. Not great and a bit pricey for what you get, but not too high and good food."}
{"text":"Literally disgusting. Their food is gross and I've seen nice running around in there."}
{"text":"Second time there and I have ordered food both times. Clam Chowder had lumps of flour and tasted like flour. Lobster roll was dry and salty. If anyone had asked, I would have shared these comments.  The Bloody was okay. I'll drink there again, but won't eat."}
{"text":"I travel quite a bit and always enjoy great food.  I was in town on a business trip and someone recommended Roland's Seafood Grill.  I was seated promptly and given a drink and food menu.  I noticed the beer sampler and thought I would give it a try. I asked the server if I could choose the beers and she said yes.  She went on to explain nearly most of the draft beers I selected were not available as they were having trouble with their taps.   I ordered a flight of beers that arrived after 10 minutes and began tasting them.  They were cold but did not taste fresh.  Next I ordered the famous \"Lobster Roll\" which comes with fries and slaw.  It took nearly 20 minutes for my food to arrive but looked good at first glance.  The fries were plentiful and hot but greasy.  The lobster roll was served in a large piece of bread that resembled two uncut pieces of Texas toast.  It was buttered and grilled to give it a nice appearance.  The lobster inside was a small amount, cold and tough. The slaw was reasonably good and cold.   The server came back and I ordered a pint of draft beer.  After nearly another 20 minutes she returned, apologized and explained they were having more problems with their tap system and offered me a bottle of Guinness instead of the draft I ordered.  At this point I politely explained I did not want the bottled version and asked for the check.    I would be hard pressed to ever return.  With other great restaurant choices in the area I don't understand why anyone would choose to eat at Roland's Seafood Grill."}
{"text":"Poor service. Monday evening. restaurant not busy. Took 15 minutes before someone came to take our drink order. Ordered a draft and a glass of wine and proceeded to order a lobster roll and steamed mussels. Took another 10 minutes to get the drinks. The lobster roll then showed up and we had finished and the plate was then cleared for the table. We had then been in the restaurant for an hour and we asked for the bill. The waitress then proceeded to say the mussels were ready. We canceled the order and the bill came with a quick huff and sign the top copy please request as she quickly turned away. Not worth wasting your time."}
{"text":"Wanting to try somewhere we had never been, we found ourselves here. I do not like fish & seafood, but my husband loves it. Thankfully they serve a few chicken dishes and the pizzas looked good.  I opted for the Grilled Chicken Nachos,  while my hubby got a bowl of Clam Chowder & Lobster Roll Sliders.   We decided to sit at the upstairs bar, which only had a couple of other people at it.  The bartender seemed a little odd,  but nice nonetheless. We didn't get a ton of attention,  despite the place being pretty empty,  but that's OK because I didn't really feel like being bothered. I ordered a Stoli with orange juice and hubs got a Bloody Mary.  I was pretty surprised that he wasn't asked if he wanted it spicy or not and it looked spicy, which he doesn't care much for. As a server & bartender I realize how important asking if someone wants a spicy BM is. Neither of us finished our drinks as mine was way too strong and his was too spicy.   We took most of our food home since there was so much. Lunch and 2 drinks ran us about $47 before tip.  Can't decide if I will be back or not,  but it is possible."}
{"text":"Was looking for an early lunch with my son. Stumbled on to Roland's and decided to give it a try. I had a bowl of clam chowder and a chipped salad, both were huge and only $5 each. The chowder was great and the chopped salad was a little over done with cucumbers, but overall pretty nice salad. My son had the beef tips sandwich which was excellent. I tried one of the tips and it was absolutely tender and tasty. Highly recommended sandwich! Overall decent service and a decent lunch."}
{"text":"Nice location and sitting on the patio when it is nice out can be great, BUT (and this is a big butt) the food is just terrible, and the service is not so good either.  If you are going in for a few drinks, this may be a fine spot to stop into while you are in the Strip but for anything more, my advice would be to head elsewhere as there are plenty of better options.   I have been in here on a few occasions for dining while we were meandering around the Strip (as I was giving it more than 1-2 chances) and each time my disappointment with the place grew.  I did not think it would get worse after my first trip there in years.    Some items on the menu that were terrible were the calamari, the zucchini and the artichoke and spin dip... how do you mess these up?  The Lobster ravioli was not so good either.  If you want a better experience in the Strip, go to Kaya, Little Bangkok or Eleven... do not waste your money here as you are not going to be getting what you paid for and will leave very unsatisfied."}
{"text":"While in town for WWE Raw we spent many hours looking for somewhere to eat in Pittsburgh.  We stumbled into this bar/ restaurant that stuck out like a sore thumb! I told the manager, please seat me on your patio. We started with beer battered and fried calamari, which was really good, tentacles and all, (some pieces could have been cooked a little more). We were sold on some Brick oven pizza which really hit the spot, the creamy Alfredo pie w/ roasted garlic and the BBQ chicken pie. The beer and pizza combination was worth searching restaurants on Yelp for 2 days to find it and leave a review! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"We went on a seafood frenzy here! Ordered all from appetizers. Beer steamed shrimp, raw oysters & clams, regular steamed shrimp, Maryland seafood soup...we ate until we could not eat anymore. Portions were well sized and the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"I went there on a Saturday afternoon by myself and wanted to sit out front.  The host made fun of me!  Said \"aw, that's too bad\" when I said it was just me.  No, it is perfectly fine in my book!  I got the lobster roll, plenty of lobster on a garlic bread roll.  It was just ok.    The most annoying part was the host kept coming out to talk to me.  I really just wanted to chill out by myself, not get hit on by the creepy host!"}
{"text":"It's fine.  This place is fine.    They're slow, yes.  Sometimes you can walk in and stand at the \"Please wait to be seated\" podium for...five or ten minutes before someone approaches you.  That's probably not fine.    And Thrillist might list the lobster rolls as one of the 50 things you must try when you're in Pittsburgh...but...maybe just visit some coastal venue.  It's fine.  But that's about it.    And they serve oysters.  But they don't know what mignonette sauce is.  Which is fine.  You don't HAVE to know what to serve WITH oysters in order to serve oysters.  It's fine.  It's all fine.    It's pretty clean.  Has outdoor seating.  The food is okay.  I've had better.  I've had worse.    I wouldn't recommend it.  But I also wouldn't warn anyone off it.    Three stars if they paid more attention to getting customers seated and staff didn't walk by the \"wait to be seated\" sign pretending they didn't notice a line of 10 people slowly building.  (I've had more than two experiences with this.  Okay three.  I've seen this happen three times.  Two were ridiculously long waits.  One was fine.)"}
{"text":"Another great lobster roll dinner last night!  This is a must have if you are in the strip district.  Service was just okay, but that delicious sandwich makes up for it.  Didn't know they offer happy hour every night till 6:00 - will definitely check it out next time...looked like they had some Great Raw Bar specials during happy hour too.  Easy to park down there at night....if the big weekend crowds keep you away."}
{"text":"We were in the strip district shopping and happened upon this lovely place. We were greeted with a warm welcome and were seated on the upstairs patio. Our waiter was great, very personable and friendly, attentive but not over bearing with checking in on us. We ordered crab cakes which were outstanding and a few other appetizers. Their drinks were exceptional. All around great great great! This establishment understands customer service and we can't say enough nice thinks about our server. Thank you all."}
{"text":"So after reading some of the other reviews,  I had some doubts about coming here,  however my wife insisted for her birthday,  so i agreed.    There were 10 of us and we went on Saturday at 5:30. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and were seated almost immediately!  Great start!   Our server was Matt K.,  and he was awesome!  Constantly checking on us and refilling drinks without us needing to ask.  Really impressed with the service!   We got the Oysters Rockafeller as an appetizer and they cane out sizzling and were very good!   Almost all of us got the Lobster Rolls.  Holy cow were they good!! Came out piping hot and the huge chunks of lobster was a delight to see and taste! The bread was also amazing,  nicely toasted and soft and oh so buttery and garlicy! Complimented the lobster very well!    We never felt rushed and it was very relaxing!    We called ahead of time and asked if we could bring a cake in (it was my wife's birthday)  and they said no problem!  When we were done with our meals,  Matt brought us out new plates, forks and spachela without us even needing to ask!  Again,  super impressed!   If I had any small complaint,  it was that the fries were only warm... But they were still good!    We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"A group of three of us went to Roland's on a busy Sunday afternoon.   Being pretty new to the Pittsburgh area and having never been to the Strip District we walked along the packed street until we happened along Roland's. It had a good amount of people dining and people were in and out constantly as we discussed if we should venture the unknown. With what we saw in mind, we figured it must be ok.  We waited 30 minutes at the packed bar for our table. Once seated we were greeted by our very nice server Brittney who advised us of the specials and their specialities. One person in our party inquired about the \"famous\" lobster roll. We were advised they use real lobster and that it's loaded with big pieces of lobster meat. Considering two of the people in our party we're visiting from south Florida (a seafood rich environment), the seafood knowledge is vast. We ordered a bowl of clam chowder to share, a lobster roll, margarita pizza and some other entree that escapes me. Our drinks and the bowl of soup arrived within a reasonable amount of time but the entrees didn't arrive for 30 minutes from the time our soup came. To make matters worse the lobster roll and forgotten entree came out at that 30 minute mark but the margarita pizza didn't arrive to our table for another 20 minutes. Now, the food. Not being a huge clam chowder fan, I was very pleasantly surprised and we all thoroughly enjoy the chowder. The lobster roll is not \"loaded with big pieces of lobster meat\", it is a sandwich made with langostinos (not a lobster, not a prawn more like a crayfish or per Wikipedia - a relative to the hermit crab?!?!). The margarita pizza was ordinary, average and utterly forgettable. I ate a piece and a half and took home the rest. Unfortunately no one was interested in partaking in it after the fact so it was pitched. The unknown entree must have been ok because I do recall the plate being empty but again, I don't recall what is was. Following our food, we had a difficult time getting our check and had to hunt down a server on our way to the restroom. Which speaking of, there were three stalls if I recall and two of them were stopped up with, well, you know and the third had no toilet paper. My waiting friend kept telling everyone who lined up behind us to grab paper towels so they weren't paperless once they finally got in there. Advising the hostess staff feel on deaf ears because they both seemed to care less and gave my friend and unspoken \"whatever\" face and response. I do not believe I will be giving Roland's a second chance nor recommending it to visitors."}
{"text":"We ate there a few days ago after the lunch rush. The service was good but the food left much to be desired. My husband had the fish sandwich which was all breading. My lump crab cake didnt have lumps of crab and all you could taste was the sauce they mixed the crab. It was not worth the total at the end. That was with no alcohol. We won't  be back."}
{"text":"This place just sucks plain and simple... went to dinner tonight. We ordered drinks that took 20 min. Then my wife ordered a lobster roll, my daughter got the kids past with shrimp added, and I got the shrimp po-boy, we also started with a half dozen oysters. Well our oysters came out with our daughters pasta, which u would think how hard is it to make butter noodles with shrimp, we'll it must be hard bc her plate looked like cooked noodles with just shrimp on top, no butter. Then our sandwiches came out... they just sucked plain and simple.. not good at all, and don't get me started on the service, bc there wasn't any.. they had only 2 waiters for all the tables, and they had to bus their own tables, was a complete joke.. no organization at all. You could call me and say we can eat for free again, and I would definitely decline. We will not be back no way in hell. Ohh and 2 sandwiches with fries, kids pasta, and half dozen oysters came to 78 bucks complete rip off."}
{"text":"Great steamed shrimp, wings, and beer selection. Unfortunately, the service has been very bad. 15 minutes sitting at the bar without a hello was the most recent experience. Also, the upstairs feels a bit grimy."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in this place. Came here for a paint nite they were hosting and arrived over an hour beforehand to eat. All I ordered was soup and salad in order to be quick and my friends who ordered a lobster roll and shrimp got their food within 20 minutes. 40 minutes later, and ten minutes prior to painting I still had not received mine. On top of that, there was only one bartender working the whole top floor. When we told him I'd have to cancel my order to begin the event he began cursing about the staff at the restaurant- it was incredibly awkward. When the food arrived it was mediocre at best. Will not be coming back to this place unless I'm dragged."}
{"text":"Truly excellent service--our glasses were constantly refilled before we asked and our server was attentive.  The appetizer we ordered, chicken nachos was enough for about 6 people!  Our salads were delicious!  The French onion soup was tasty, but had a little too much bread.  The beer battered shrimp was a bit greasy, but good.  We would return here the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Oh shoot me! I thought the seafood pizza was really good as were the mussels. The service was decent to boot. The only thing I hated was dessert."}
{"text":"Iconic Strip District Establishment known for their Fresh Oysters, Shrimp, Fish Sandwiches and the Best Lobster Roll in town on grilled Mancini's bread. Don't forget to try a Bloody Mary or a beer. The variety is huge and sure to please everyone. When the weather is nice nothing is better than sitting on the rooftop patio having a weekend lunch while watching the hustle and bustle of people out n about shopping in the area. Service is usually good unless it's very busy but for the most part I've never had any complaints."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and fabulous. The service was great and friendly. It is not a stuffy upscale seafood place, but you would never know it by tasting the food. The lobster rolls were great with plenty of meat. The crab cakes were full of crab and not filler. The clam chowder was exactly the way it should be with a real clam in just about every bite. We ate upstairs, which seemed to be a little more casual than the downstairs area. There is a large bar too if you prefer to eat at the bar rather than a table. We unfortunately did not have room to fit a pizza, but they looked really good as well. It will definitely be on the list for a return visit."}
{"text":"Roland's is a great place for seafood, especially if you love oysters! It can get pricey but the seafood taste fresh. The only reason I am giving it three stars is because the Bloody Mary had A TON of pepper in it and was watered down from the ice, so then we ordered a spiked Arnold Palmer and the waiter ended up coming back out and saying they were out and handed us an iced tea with Jose cuervo in it..."}
{"text":"Fun sports bar. Food was ok at best. Great shrimp cocktail but I wish I had my fish sandwich across the street. Go stillers."}
{"text":"We went there for our anniversary dinner and we didn't get our appetizer and no one brought me my food, or cared that I didn't get served. No one checked on us either, and when we complained, they honestly couldn't care less. I told our waiter to forget my order and that we were leaving because our meal was ruined, and he still made us pay. Needless to say, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Not as good as Wholeys but awesome patio and the best service. Go here for the atmosphere, the staff is the best."}
{"text":"Love this place! Nothing better than sitting on the balcony with a cold beer and some appetizers ( or the lobster roll) and enjoy a sunny day.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here and got the lobster nachos as an appetizer and we're waiting for our pizza, drinking until we got it... Oh yeah we never did.  After an hour and half...   Lobster nachos were unreal - service was absolutely horrible because if you tell a waiter something and the say \"sure thing\" there's no guarantee you sill get."}
{"text":"Roland's has a nice, outdoor, terrace-style seating area on the second floor.  (This faces north, so it would be shaded during the day.)  Roland's also has a generous beer selection of very good stuff (relatively mainstream:  think Smithwick's, Hoeegarden, etc).  What Roland's does not have is a friendly bartender.  Nor table service.  Nor any substantial patrons at 11pm on a Saturday.  Which can be a blessing and a curse, really (the last one, not the first two; the first two are definitely just a curse)."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN!!!! Horrible service and horrible food! It took 20 minutes for our waitress to even come to our table! Looking back on it, I don't know why we didn't leave... maybe because we had to wait 20 minutes to even get a table (this was during the summer). We ordered the muscles to start off which were okay but definitely not something I would recommend. My husband ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the crab cakes.... EPIC FAIL!!! The crab cakes were so disgusting my husband and I had to switch meals. The crab cakes taste like fried mayo... I couldn't even taste the crab! The fish and chips looked great but it didn't taste like anything! No seasoning at all! The waitress was so bad that when it came time to give us our check, she was no where to be found. It took 15 minutes to actually get the check (keep in mind we already finished eating)... thank God we had cash! A complete waste of $40. Yes, I remember exactly how much I spent even though it was months ago because I kept thinking how I could have spent that money in a better place! I could have got a mani & pedi... had some great sushi... the list goes on. lol"}
{"text":"Hey. This place is deeeeeeeeCENT.  (look, check it out for happy hour. 60 cent oysters? uhmfuckyea)  I dislike strip dizzle bars but you could pick worse. Actually, ok. This review is based on going to happy hour. I am down with 60 cent oysters, clams, shrimp, and wings. Average beer selection, but you can find a few gems."}
{"text":"Clean atmosphere, food was ok. We ordered and split the famous lobster sandwich. Beer was kind of flat. My wife and I prefer Bella Notte next door."}
{"text":"I love Roland's! The lobster roll is SOOOOOOOO good! I've yet to be disappointed and it just hasn't happened. The fries are tasty and the service is always friendly and efficient. Thank you Roland's for not letting me down!"}
{"text":"Rolands' LOBSTER ROLL is amazing!  I've travelled extensively and eaten at a lot of nice restaurants (recently completed Pgh's 25 best), and this continues to be the best lobster roll I've ever eaten and my favorite meal in Pittsburgh.  Be warned - the service usually mediocre, but the food will more than compensate!"}
{"text":"Service was ok to start, but they were out of Blue Moon draft?  So my wife went to the bathroom, the waiter came over, I told him to stop back in a minute when my wife returned she said the Ladies room was very dirty.  Then No waiter for ten minutes.  Finally I ordered zesty crab soup.  The soup was barely luke warm.  My wife ordered salad..just OK.  We both ordered the Famous Lobster Roll.  Very bad looking lobster with no taste.  But the best part is yet to come..just as we were beginning to eat our main course, my wife lets out a blood curdling scream that almost gave me and the other patrons a heart attack.  A MOUSE had scurried across her foot!  Yes a MOUSE.  Our server was no where to be found and after he showed up and ask how our lunch was, my wife told him that she couldn't finish her meal..and neither could I. The waiter said that sometimes when they leave the doors open, a mouse would get in.  But this was a baby mouse, who proceeded to terrorize a few other customers.  And if there is a baby mouse, where are Mama and Papa Mouse?  The mouse came from the rear of the restaurant, not the door...and you know what else is in the rear of the restaurant, don't you?  He said he would comp the lunch and send the manager over.  We waited a little while..no manager.  So we left the waiter a tip and left...still hungry...but nauseated.  The thing that upsets me most, is we could have eaten at DeLuca's.  Roland's was one of my worst dining experiences ever."}
{"text":"Spending a beautiful day in the strip a few weeks ago culminated in a (what I'd hoped) was a quick stop at Roland's. Grab a beer, lobster roll and salad, and I'd be home before traffic. I was not so lucky.  I arrived and was immediately sat by a waitress that appeared to be extremely overwhelmed by the five tables in the patio. There were a few guests at the bar, being entertained by the bartender. I should have gone and sat there, but it was so nice out, I decided to eat on the patio.  My beer order was taken quickly, but then took twelve minutes to arrive. By that time, the head was gone, and it was losing it's cool. The waitress abruptly dropped off the beer and disappeared. I already knew what I was ordering, but she flitted around from table to table awkwardly for a good ten minutes until I made creepy eye contact with her and she shuffled my way. She took my order, and pretended to care about what I was ordering, but then disappeared again.  Forty minutes later my poor lobster roll arrived. The fries were mushy, and the lobster roll took six (SIX!) napkins to sop up all the grease. I ate it, but I wasn't happy. About three bites in (and with the fastest response time of my dining experience) here comes awkward waitress again, asking if I needed anything else. I decided on another beer. She then proceeded to ask me if I minded if she smoked a cigarette before she grabbed my beer. (WHAT?!) No. Forget the beer. Bring me my check.   With no tip for awkward waitress, I left. Probably never to return.  Happy Eating, just not here."}
{"text":"Several weeks ago, my friend's birthday drinking day started at Roland's. I have had dinner and had drinks at many, many different restaurants, but the service here was some of the worst that I've experienced in my entire life. A good sized group (probably 15 or so by the time we left) was gathered upstairs near the bar. So here's what happened:  -Stood at the bar waiting for 5-10 minutes to be served as bartenders walked by, ignoring us -Received grumbling responses from bartenders when we asked for assistance  -Asked for menus and was told that \"food would take at least 30-40 minutes\" to be served -Food arrived and was left at the bar to get cold, later told that the bartender \"didn't see where we were\" - we were standing literally 6 feet away from where we had ordered -A friend's food was thrown away - uneaten - immediately after delivery because \"it looked like she was done\"  What a horrible experience. Thankfully, our later stops were much better. I never plan to return to Roland's and am disappointed that such a well-known Pittsburgh establishment would have such sub-par service."}
{"text":"Great seafood options down in the Strip. Large menu so everyone can find something they like! I got the lobster ravioli and it was very good! The sauce was amazing and I was tying to find ways to eat it all and there were nice chunks of lobster in it. The ravioli itself seemed to have lobster inside but the filling was a little dry, still very good overall. We also got the Cajun shrimp appetizer and it was good but very heavily seasoned in seafood so we had to scrape some off. Still a very good experience overall"}
{"text":"Nope...came here with my son. He ordered swordfish, I ordered the seafood stew...25 minutes between the 2 dishes."}
{"text":"I think a solid 3 stars is a good way to explain and the reason is because there were really great things and really horrible things.   First, we were starving when we pulled in here. Like so fricken hungry we ordered a ton of food lol. So we got the calamari and it was the worst calamari, maybe even the worst seafood, I have ever had. Now, being a seafood place you would think this wouldn't happen. It was sooooo over cooked that it tasted like a rubber band. Then I got a side salad and my husband got a bowl of clam chowder. Salad was great, fresh and the peppercorn dressing was extremely tasty. My husbands chowder....the best soup I have ever had! It was creamy and had a ton of clams in it. I mean it, the best clam chowder by far I have ever had! So at this point we were confused. So I got an Italian style pizza with spicy sausage which, I have to say wasn't bad. The sausage had a kick and it was a crispy crust. The sauce lacked a little, prob just tomatoes. My husband got their famous hot lobster roll and, just like everything else, was enormous and it was pretty good. Roll was buttery and the lobster was cooked well.   The service wasn't bad, just extremely slow. So I really was confused by this place so the only thing I knew what to was to give it 3 stars bc I have no idea if I would come back or not? Maybe the calamari was a mistake? I just don't know. I would come back for the soup for sure...but for a seafood place to mess up fried calamari as an appetizer...come on!"}
{"text":"The ahi tuna contained sheets of sinewy, tough tissue that made it inedible. My uneaten tuna sat on my plate in front of me (during a group event) for more than an hour before the server removed it. There weren't enough staff so she simply was not able to ask anyone how the food was. The restaurant was too busy.   The mashed potatoes were good."}
{"text":"Great mozzarella, tomatoe, basil pizza! Their French onion soup was in point!"}
{"text":"In a city with so many great choices I am not sure how this place stays in business. The service is ok, but the food is just so bad and it isn't cheap.  I've eaten here twice in the last six months and both experiences were bad. Most recently I ordered the fish sandwich or should I call it the mushy sponge.  It took me 15 minutes to flag down a different waiter as our waitress was MIA to get something different. By then everyone at my party was done eating so I skipped dinner. Good thing we got the nachos (which the chicken looked like frozen bits). I will never will eat here again."}
{"text":"The bar has a nice selection of beers. The Irish bartender who works Monday nights is extremely welcoming and friendly.    For food I tried the raw bar happy hour. The oysters were alright but nothing special. The shrimp were quite small, probably U-20 count which for Shrimp Cocktail is tiny. The wings were very disappointing. Extremely small and flavorless. And finally the steamed clams were CHEWY.   In recap, come here for the beers and the nice bartenders. The food you can do without."}
{"text":"The lobster roll is the staple. Closet thing to a Boston style roll you'll find in the city! Food comes out quickly and staff is always friendly. Beer selection is good - whether you drink Miller lite, a double IPA or a bourbon barrel aged stout, it's probably on tap. Prices are totally fair for the neighborhood, plus 75 cent wings during happy hour! Outdoor seating is perfect for people watching! (Also if you're in the service industry, well... just go there after work. Trust me)"}
{"text":"We were shopping on a cold day in the Strip District and decided to try this place for lunch because of the sign advertising the hot lobster roll. It was pretty empty; a few early drinkers at the bar and a few couples seated at tables. I ordered a bloody mary which honestly tasted weird, so I'm not sure what was going on there. For food, we ordered clam chowder, a hot lobster roll, and a fish sandwich. The clam chowder was really tasty with good consistency and was a huge serving, much larger than we expected. The hot lobster roll was rich, buttery, and warm, and the lobster was good and fresh. The fish sandwich was gigantic... two huge fillets breaded and fried with tons of french fries. It was a little greasy but pretty tasty. Overall, I was happy with lunch and with the service and I would probably go again for the lobster roll or the clam chowder."}
{"text":"Happy hour food specials are worth a trip to Roland's. The drink specials aren't really worth writing about but the clams and oysters are great for the price! The shrimp happy hour special was good but the shrimp are small so that was kind of disappointing. Ask for bread with whatever you order. The bread is so good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome...bloody mary's are fire and the prosciutto wrapped shrimp?! Get atta tahn! Lobster roll to boot get on it"}
{"text":"I have been to Rolands a few times and have not experienced any of the problems others are saying they have, however, I'm only giving 2 stars because you're in the strip-you can do better than Rolands! I was most recently at Rolands during the steeler season last year. I ordered the crab chowder which I have had every time I have been there and each time it has been excellent. On this most recent visit I ordered the raspberry maple scallop appetizer as my meal. It was a large portion;I could not finish it and my fellow diners were too stuffed to help me. One member of my group ordered the seafood pizza and crushed it-said it was so tasty. My other fellow diner order the stuffed banana pepper app and also said it was good. They have a wide draft selection and if you get there early enough you can grab a seat near the tvs. The bar is usually too crowded to grab a seat at but our service at our table was attentive and quick. On a previous visit, I split a margarita pizza and it was good too so there is a variety of entrees/apps etc to choose from to please any palate."}
{"text":"Roland's wasnt a bad place to grab a few drinks, a sandwich, and a lobster roll.  The food was pretty good and they have a huge bottled beer selection.  The upstairs patio is by far the most popular place to sit - being above the strip and people watching is nice.   This isn't a place for people who like good draft beer or premium food, it's still a dive bar.  It probably would have received four stars, but our bartender seemed pretty lazy."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a drink and a quick bite.  Our staple is a rum and coke - both of ours were very watered down. Neither of us could really tell their was rum in the drink. We finished and switch to beer after.   Tried the Cajun shrimp and were impressed at the flavor and the mango salsa they paired it with was on point! Very spicy with the fresh jalapeño in it! Watched a few plates come out and the service seemed pretty quick and the food always looked good."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. I always get the lobster roll which is excellent. Also the stuffed mushrooms which doesn't look that great but are also delicious. Cajun shrimp also was very good (spicy ) and cooked perfect. If it were a little cleaner in there ( restrooms are filthy ) I'd give it 5 stars for the lobster roll alone. I can kind of understand though because of the amount of people in and out. The place is packed on a nice weather weekend day so plan on about a 45 minute wait unless you sit at the bar."}
{"text":"We arrived around 4:30 on a Wednesday before the Jason Isbell show at the Benedum, and it seemed like they were just opening. Only a couple of other couples there and a guy at the bar. No host and the bartender asked if we were going to eat. Sure man, it's a restaurant, right? Go figure... We were told to just sit anywhere and someone would be right with us. After  about 15 minutes no one came to our table so I started to get up and go to the bar for a menu, but a server saw me getting up and came over. Asked our server for a beer menu and was told they didn't have any. Really? My girlfriend looked around and found one lying on another table. Strike two. Ordered the lobster Mac n cheese as an appetizer. DEFINITELY not enough for two people to split, even as an appetizer, which was ok with us because we both thought it was pretty bland and should have just been called \"Mac n cheese\" because Sherlock Holmes would have had a tough time finding lobster in there. For dinner I ordered the pan seared scallops with red mashed potatoes. I think it was $23 or something like that which was INSANE for what I got, which was 8 single-bite sized, overcooked and completely flavorless pieces and a small mound of cold potatoes. Extremely disappointed in this dish. The other half got the prosciutto and arugula pizza. When it came to the table, completely topped with raw arugula about an inch deep, I was skeptical and didn't even try it until we got home later that night. I was wrong about this one and the pizza was delicious and on point. After my first round I did sit beerless  for about 15 minutes before one of our two servers came by to see if I wanted another (I did), but other than that they were fairly attentive, even though they both gave us a vibe that they were somehow annoyed that we were there. Our total bill for dinner, appetizer and 4 draft beers came to just over $80, which was way too steep considering the quality of food and service. Maybe we'd go back to grab a drink at the bar, but for food there are much better choices in the strip district."}
{"text":"On a visit to Pittsburgh we came on a Saturday afternoon and sat upstairs. Arrived about 12pm and sat outside on the patio, which was pretty empty. The bartender was great, very attentive & helpful on offering suggestions for places to go. We had pizza and lobster Mac & cheese that were OK, my friend said the latter was a bit bland and needed salt & pepper but we were coming from NY so hard to compete with that. The margarita pizza was decent but could've used more cheese especially since there were about 2 pieces with a section missing cheese. Also have 2 upstairs pool tables to rent for only 3$/half hour. Definitely seems like a cool hang out spot."}
{"text":"It's OK to come here for beer and snacks, but avoid anything more complicated than a serving of mussels or the Lobster Roll.   The mussels are fresh and they really do give you a whole lot, but there's not too much broth (The best part of ordering mussels is usually sopping up the broth with bread). The lobster roll has plenty of lobster, it's fresh and tasty, but the roll itself is a bit greasy. It didn't bother me that much, but some people seem to be put off by it.    My wife ordered the \"stuffed shrimp platter,\" which I put in quotes because the \"platter\" consists of 5 medium/small overcooked rubbery shrimp and some unseasoned overcooked veggies. They charge like $23 for this, which is a complete ripoff.   The service is spotty, and sometimes people feel the need to smoke standing right next to you if you are seated outside, which is really enjoyable (bleh)."}
{"text":"The people aren't lying. This lobster roll is drenched in butter and guaranteed to be a key contributor in your untimely death. You better love it or leave it alone."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a couple years. I have to say, it was AWESOME! They really spruced up the place. Nice new Roland's glasses, food was very good. I usually get the bucket of mussels but i saw someone else get them and now they are on a plate/tray when served. No biggie, i'm certain they're still delicious. I opted for the Maryland Crab Chowder, which was incredible and the Lobster Roll. The Lobster Roll was just as i remembered, awesome. I don't think they raised their prices since the last time i was there, 2 or 3 years ago. The only reason i'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because their bathroom is filthy. Also their iron landing was closed. Food and service were supreme! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was the food but 2 of us in our party were sick after eating last night.  The only thing we ate that was different from the rest of our party was clam chowder."}
{"text":"Overall, the experience here was pretty good.  I had the lobster roll previously and wanted to go back for it a second time on a Friday during lent.  I expected it to be quite crowded during dinner time, however arriving at 6:30 there was no wait for 3.  The lobster roll was pretty good, although I do remember it being better. I wished that there was something extra on the sandwich, such as melted butter. And they raised the price a dollar.  Roland's has a huge draft beer selection. Each of us tried a different beer and they were reasonably priced, around $4.50 each.  I would definitely go back, but not any time soon."}
{"text":"The restaurant had many seafood options which I super duper love! It was my first time at the Strip District and I was craving seafood so was a great place to try. We got the calamari and the spinach, artichoke, & crab dip to start off, the calamari was good but the peppers and onions were kinda soggy and the dip was good but beware it's really cheesy, like cream cheese cheesy, and you could barely taste the crab, but the bread it came with was good! I got a lobster roll as an entree, my boyfriend got the shrimp po boy, his sister got the chicken nachos, and her boyfriend got mild wings. Everyone enjoyed their food, was good portions and super yummy. I really loved the fries my entree came with, the only thing about the sandwiches are that the bread is super thick and can be super hard to eat, other than that the fillings are yummmmmy. The nachos were HUGE and the wings were crispy and tasty. Our server was super nice and attentive. And best of all, we got to sit at the patio upstairs on a very nice day :) Would totally come back."}
{"text":"Brought my family here and everyone loved it. Anything lobster is amazing and their portions are huge. I had the fish sandwich and it could feed two it's so big. Perfectly crispy and juicy in the center. Love this place."}
{"text":"Aah, Roland's. I have only been here exactly 4 times, but have never tried the food. My boyfriend and I always just hit the bar for drinks and we've never stayed very long. A trip to Roland's was always because we were in the Strip for another reason and thought, \"Why not?\"  There is one bartender in particular there who has served us every time and is super awesome. Very friendly, chatty, cool guy. He knows how to pour a good beer and is up to date on what Roland's has or doesn't have and what he can substitute out for you.   The rooftop and outdoor seating seems really neat, but every time we've gone they've been packed, not surprisingly. Hanging out on their front patio would be a neat people watching spot."}
{"text":"We had a frustrating and disappointing experience at Roland's, a dining out experience on a recent 4-day visit to Pittsburgh.  First, all of the food was extremely overpriced. The quality was what you would find if you were ordering from a bar...but it was twice as expensive. The $16 I paid for fried cod got me two soggy cod filets, steamed bland vegetables and boring roasted potatoes. I couldn't have tried to make food this poor. It was a Sysco food operation gone wrong: runoff from Houlihan's mixed with Joe's Crab Shack.   The service was so slow that we were cancelling orders due to the delay in bringing them to the table. My dish arrived without any sort of sauce, and we even had to get up and order beer from the bar because our waitress was so behind. It was her \"second day on the job,\" but this is unacceptable. They could have at least comp'd our beers, or offered some other way to make it up (besides coming over to informing us that they had charged the beers to our bill).  Roland's had space available on a Monday night, unlike the other restaurants in the neighborhood. This was really convenient initially, but I now have an idea of why this was the case."}
{"text":"This place is less than mediocre. Visited on a Friday night and it was pretty crowded. We requested a high top near the bar and the hostess was very accommodating.   The food was \"meh\". The clam chowder was just ok. I was excited for the lobster/artichoke pizza, but it was absolutely tasteless! Like, I was shocked by how much it tasted like nothing. I ended up slathering my clam chowder all over the pizza in an attempt to kick up the flavor. The pizza crust was good -thin and chewy just like I prefer. We also ordered the lobster roll sliders and the best thing about that dish was the Mancini bread.  Not worth the bucks.   The service was slow-mo, but as I mentioned it was a crowded Friday night so it didn't bother me much.   There were a few good beer selections on draft...so that's a plus. But I definitely won't return. Life is too short for less than mediocre food."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!! Told 45 minute wait for food. Sarcastic bartender and place half empty. No one wanted to wait on us!"}
{"text":"We experienced a mixed bag here!  The environment is pub-like and casual, which suited our mood.  Some of the food was wonderful and some was serviceable.  The Maryland crab soup was truly delicious!  The Garlic Parmesan wings were good but dry and needed more of both seasonings.  A friend got the Ahi Tuna which was overlooked and dry. I got the salmon which was good. Both came with delicious mashed potatoes.  The Caesar Salad was quite delicious. And the Sicilian Pizza was good but the chorizo chunks overpowered the pizza.  Another friend got the seafood stew which he loved.  The decaf coffee was excellent, a happy surprise!  All in all the meal hit some high notes and some middle notes."}
{"text":"You don't get much for what you pay for. That being said it's pretty comfortable to Red Lobster quality wise."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that I currently work in the food service industry & understand/sympathize with how challenging this kind of job can be. However, each time I have gone to Roland's I have been extremely disappointed in the service; Hosts were focused more on talking to each other, rather than helping customers. The servers seem lost, perhaps I've just gotten new staff members each time, but I personally think they need more training. The bartenders, however, were a lot better, they knew the menu, valued cleanliness, and maintained a positive relationship with patrons. With all that said, the real shoutout needs to go to kitchen staff, despite underwhelming customer service, the food is what always brings me back!  I recommend the lobster nachos, stuffed mushrooms, or mussels! So yummy!"}
{"text":"2nd time coming here and it was once again a great experience. The food was delicious and the service was on point. Every dish hit the spot from the stuffed lobster to the fresh oysters. I will definitely be back next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends on a Friday night to watch the pens game. They have a nice atmosphere and relatively good service considering it was dinner time. A few more tvs and a few more tables would give it at least one more star. One strange thing I have to mention is that they did not have any beer specials during happy hour? Not sure if this is normal, but I thought it was weird for a sports bar type restaurant . Although $.60 oysters was nice during happy hour."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink. Place was pretty empty for being lunch time (don't judge me for drinking at noon, I was on vacation). Server had a sense of humor and was able to recommend a drink for my wife that she enjoyed. Outside seating was full, but those tables were really small."}
{"text":"I've tried and tried to give this place a chance.  It's upsets me that an establishment like this can exist among so many great places in the Strip.  I end up at Roland's because my boyfriend's co-workers always want to go there for happy hour.  They have a special on oysters and shrimp cocktail, so I ordered those.  The oysters were absolutely disgusting.  They were not fresh, or cleaned very well.  My fingers ended up getting all dirty and they had a gross, gritty taste to them.  They threw the POORLY deveined shrimp on ice, and it ended up soggy.  I had to pick the veins out myself, and after about two I lost my appetite.  As always, the service was terrible.  Next time I'm dragged to a happy hour there, I'll order water.  Never again will I spend money in this place.  YUCK!"}
{"text":"There aren't too many things better in life than a Roland's hot lobster roll on Mancini's grilled bread. My husband loves their giant fish sandwich. This place is a sure thing."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Roland's for years and usually I have a good experience.  Today, however, I was served by a bartender who apparently is the owners son.  For the first time in my life I added no tip to the bill and made a remark on it about his personality.   Hopefully this guy finds a. Ew line of work."}
{"text":"Went here on a work function dinner with a good size team, which I feel often creates a challenge. Even with our team spread over three tables the service was really exceptional. This however was the high point of the evening. The food was not my favorite. I wasn't really crazy about trying a seafood place in Pittsburgh, should have gone with my gut, I'm sure it would be thanking me now. I had the shrimp and grits. The cheese grits were dry, over cooked and fairly tasteless. The shrimp were by far the worst part in that they were so undercooked I could not eat past the first bite. Looks like a great place to have a drink with friends, but keep the crowd small as they could not seat us all together. Would not return here for food again as I saw several plates in our party with more food left than consumed."}
{"text":"I've lived in Pittsburgh for what feels like forever and in all of that time, I guess I've never been to the Strip District on a Monday. We didn't realize most of the restaurants are closed on Mondays. Tried Thin Man, closed. Luke Wholey's, closed. We read some less than appealing outdoor menus of a few spots and settled on Roland's Seafood Grill for lunch because they were open and had a sign out front raving about their signature warm Lobster Rolls for $14.99. Ok, we were game.  We've driven hours off the beaten path in Maine for amazing Lobster Rolls at Red's Eats, which sets the standard for what all lobster rolls should be. Massive amounts of fresh lobster piled on top of the bun and drawn butter to dip the excess mound of lobster in is a mouth watering delight!   That couldn't be farther from what you get served at Roland's. The bun was Mancini's, so good start. The lobster was an odd orange color that's not what fresh lobster looks like at all. Nothing was heaped over the bun at all, but honestly after tasting it that part was ok. Combination of a few fresher tasting pieces, some rubbery pieces, and some dry pieces that literally could have been any fish. I skipped the fries, which didn't look all that great on hubby's plate and there was the tiniest container of coleslaw ever as a side that was actually pretty good. Considering I skipped the fries, shouldn't the server have asked if I wanted extra coleslaw knowing it was going to be minuscule?   The upstairs patio was really nice overlooking Penn Ave. and I hear they have a decent happy hour with terrific specials on fresh oysters and beer at the bar. I may give this place another shot based on that but, never again on their lobster roll."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, great food and great service!!  Loved the beer battered shrimp,  lobster bisque was amazing!    Stuffed banana peppers were also awesome!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The service was great. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The food, however, was disappointing. The calamari was actually really nice, light and not super greasy, but the Cajun shrimp were tiny and underwhelming. With six very small pieces bathing in oil and a side of flavorless mango salsa, I would not recommend this appetizer at all. I got the shrimp scampi entree, which comes with the vegetable of the day, salad and potatoes. The potatoes and salad were good, but the corn was very small and brown. It looked like it went bad and they cooked it anyway. Then I tasted it and knew it went bad and they cooked it anyway. That, for me, ruined my whole meal. No amount of butter and salt could save that corn. My bf got the steak with battered shrimp. He enjoyed his meal but didn't want the potatoes and corn. They wouldn't substitute with anything except salad so basically it was $30 for a piece of steak and a few pieces of shrimp. For seafood, in general, the prices were not bad, but I rather pay more and have a better quality meal."}
{"text":"All 3 of us ordered the lobster roll and French fries. Good cold slaw. We loved the French fries. The bread is wonderful. Lots of butter -- very rich.  Also a messy sandwich so order extra napkins! Large area upstairs. Wait staff was excellent. Nice place for lunch on the strip. Casual."}
{"text":"I LOVE Roland's !!! Always amazing seafood and kickass servers - not sure why the hate on yelp ???,"}
{"text":"Prime time location, and they know it.  Yet another older guard restaurant that realizes it has people roped in before they know it.  The place looks nice and is possibly the best location during the summer especially in the city.  I have always steered clear of Roland's because of an assumption.  But....the wife and her friend wanted a \"lobster roll\" so I was roped into going.  I opted to just drink a draught.  They got one of their famous lobster rolls and immediately were underwhelmed.  The sandwich was dwarfed by a mountain of handcut fries (the best part).  It also came with a limp pickle speer and a small condiment cup of coleslaw?!  The roll itself was lobster, but was fishy tasting and had no sauce?!  There was maybe 3ozs of fishy lobster on the roll.....Pathetic. Service was decent and my draught and few fries got this place the extra star it deserves.  Go to Wholey!!!!"}
{"text":"My scallops were luke-warm yet overcooked.  The carrots on my salad looked like they had been sitting in the bottom of a fridge for weeks.   The first time I dined here, I was unimpressed with their lobster roll (which is simply a hollowed-out white roll filled with lobster.  bread and seafood, that's IT).  Today, I was unimpressed with everything.  Except the woman two tables over who laughed like cigar-smoking circus clown and looked like Patrick Swayze in drag.  That was pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Steeler game this evening upstairs.  Crowded and noisy.  Bar service excellent and friendly, and accurate.  Layout is great.  Lots of brew on tap and many more in bottles.   Ate downstairs early then wandered in the strip district before returning.  Food service was also excellent.  This is an easy place to like."}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere and decent prices. The food was average at best. It's a shame because the place is in a great location and has tremendous potential."}
{"text":"Dateline: Late yesterday afternoon.  Kay's friend Nadine said she wanted pho. Then she said she didn't and didn't really care where we went.   I wanted to try the new Argentinian restaurant across from Altar Bar, but we found out the hard way that they're closed on Mondays. Neither Kay nor Nadine felt like walking up Smallman Street for anything. Kay despises Primanti Brothers.   Nadine spots Roland's Seafood Grill. My heart falls into my intestines.   \"Oh, I like Roland's,\" she utters innocently. \"Let's go there.\"   \"Maybe we could go to Harp and Fiddle,\" I suggest.   Kay whispers to me through her clenched teeth, \"No. Yelp...ing to...night. And no...more...walking. You...don't need to only go to places you haven't reviewed yet.\"  So, yeah. We went back to Roland's.   And like my last experience, it wasn't half-atrocious.   The fried calamari is actually well-battered and quite plump and tasty aside from the inexplicable inclusion of lifeless sauteed onions.   And that lobster roll of theirs, the one Roland's is supposedly famed for, contains within a tough, toasted Fenway Park-styled bun some fat chunks of choice, succulent crustacean meat. The sandwich came with a small cup of middling cole slaw and a pile of limp, dark, blanched steak fries as if to remind me of where I was really having dinner, and it wasn't some oceanside shack in Maine.   Nadine's Basil and Pesto Pizza was also an unlikely winner with its luscious artichoke pieces almost thieving thunder from the blackened, wood-fired crust, dreamy cheese, and caramelized red peppers. The sauce was but an afterthought.   Our server, Ahsan (?), was competent and friendly.   If you stick with pizza or sandwiches, you should have a tolerable time at Roland's. Therefore, consider this 3 a higher 3 than before. I'd give them a 4, but to be truthful, I'm not dying to return due to the paucity of their card. There's just too much good, good food goin' on in this neighborhood.   Try not to use the bathrooms, either. The men's restroom reeked of urine and was very unkempt overall."}
{"text":"I see the mixed reviews and honestly don't get it. It's casual but good food, large portions and a friendly staff. After 3 visits I feel like a regular with the bar staff. The pool table is free and usually available if you are looking to hang out a bit. The bathrooms are pretty bad and could use a facelift. Only reason for not getting 5 stars. The lobster roll sliders are awesome. Claw meat and big chunks of it. 3 sliders are enough to share one and still have enough as a main course. My companion raves about them to her friends. My favorite item is the Mussels. Priced a few dollars more than most places but you get twice as much as any place. A heaping pot full. There a 4 or 5 variations to choose from. Bring an appetite or order them for the table.  I haven't had the oysters yet but am anxious to try them soon."}
{"text":"This is a perfect place to hang out, grab a beer and eat some seafood. They have great happy hour specials and a huge selection of beers on tap. The staff are usually pretty attentive but they do get busy in the evening, so don't take it personal. They have a great outdoor deck up top and high top seating right at the door. Their fried food is just your normal find but they do sushi, great steamed mussels and my favorite, their Caesar salad.  They add lemons with it, which I had never seen. Make sure you try it out and be sure to squeeze that lemon on your Caesar salad...it really makes the salad pop.   This place is good for all ages, food, decor and clientele. It is definitely on my To Visit list when people ask me about places in the Strip District. You cant go wrong by stopping in and enjoying all they have to offer."}
{"text":"I ended up eating here out of hunger and exhaustion during my weekend in pittsburgh last week. We mentioned to the server we were not from here and unsure what we wanted and he offered no help, just walked away but kept coming back to the table every few minutes saying, \"so, what can i get you?\". We decided on things and order. Worst service i've had in a long time, rude and he didn't really care to help us at all. We ended up getting the lobster ravioli and a wood fired pizza and both were average at best. For a $30 meal each, not great. Really the service is what did it for me. I will remember to never return while i'm in pittsburgh.   Another thing was that we were sitting in basically a sports bar spending$30 on ravioli. Horrible atmosphere for the food on the menu in parts."}
{"text":"I was only here for drinks, on a Saturday night.  It was decent - the drinks were fairly mixed and priced.  The atmosphere was a bit lacking.  There isn't much personality here, and for a Saturday, I would have expected a bit more of a crowd.  Overall, not bad if you're in the area for a drink; but not a destination."}
{"text":"Here for pre-booked party, not near enough wait staff or bartenders. Very disappointing for business that had been around a while."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh's go-to for seafood! Always fresh. Always delicious. We've been here at least a dozen times and any time someone asks where to go for seafood I say Rolands. The staff is always going above and beyond to satisfy any requests we had. I recommend the Hot Lobster Roll. It's not your traditional chilled lobster roll but it's even better than words can describe. Roland's is always a place we go to if we want seafood and there isn't a better place in the Burgh!"}
{"text":"This isn't my first time here but this is the first time we had a great waitress. She was quick, friendly and attentive. The food was great. I had the crab cake sandwich and added a side salad. My partner had a huge plate of mussels which were excellent. Only thing that would make it five stars for me is that when I order a mixed green salad I don't want iceberg lettuce in it. Other than that I'd recommend Roland's."}
{"text":"Twice I have been here with two separate, self-identified Yinsers who said that I need to experience the \"not trashy\" Yinser style restaurants in the area. Apparently for the two of them, Rolands is a good example of this. I have yet to experience \"trash\" Yinser locales, so my frame of reference is still incomplete.  Roland's is low-key and not pretentious. You can show up in cargo shorts and a sports team tshirt at any point in the day and fit in well. The food is average at best, but when you're hungry and don't want to wait in line at Gaucho for 2 hours, this place is a great option. The service staff are nice and attentive, the drinks are strong and cheap, and if you are with good company, Roland's is a lot of fun. Good ambience, nice background music, multiple TVs set to different sports channels. The interior décor is fun in a cheesy way.  It's worth checking out periodically. It's a nice reminder that not every place has to be hip, fresh, contemporary, and overpriced to be worth a visit."}
{"text":"I stopped here with my girlfriend after a Steelers game. The bartender was very rude and wouldn't serve us. I was there to see the game with my best friend whom I served in army with. Said we had already had enough. So went to Leftys and had a great time. Manager at Roland's said the bartender is a miserable human being. His parents own the place."}
{"text":"About the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars is because I really enjoyed there Hot Lobster Roll.  When I first got there about 8p I saw maybe 6-8 people.  Sign when coming in said \"please wait to be seated\". Waited about 5-10 minutes and the staff saw me and didn't even respond.  I had to initiate the communication as to if this was open seating.  After I seated myself at the bar, the bartender was tentative to me.   The fries are what has been shared through other reviews, not the best, light and airy.   Had a Tuxedo for Dessert and was rather tasty, asked they make it there and they don't. Those are outsourced."}
{"text":"Love the lobster roll.  I like to stop in here on Mondays for 0.60C raw oysters and a bloody hoe.  Makes a great after work/pre work-out snack."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant. I went with 9 others. They squeezed 10 people into 2 small tables given the restaurant was fairly empty. It was mid March (and not hot outside) and they kept the patio doors open. I repeatedly asked them to close them completely since myself and friends were cold and they would not.   The only way to describe the food is disgusting. -I split the giant beer battered fish sandwich. Given that apparently this place is a seafood place one would think their seafood should be decent... wrong. The fries were cold, and the sandwich and fries were very greasy.  - Our friends got the classic white pizza. Between two of them they finished one piece and couldn't tolerate anymore. I tried a bite of it. It tasted like you were eating a clove of garlic with a bit of dough.  - No one else enjoyed their meals either.  The waiter was terrible. He would take a couple peoples drink or food order and then walk away and repeated this throughout the night. He was not friendly and when we needed something he was no where to be found. Some of the people we were with left early. We had to ask him to clear their cups so  we could move into their space. When he was clearing the table at the end he noticed there was the majority of the pizza left. He asked our friends if they wanted it packed up. They said they didn't like it so they don't want to take it home. He said ok. Thats it- didn't ask why, didn't offer to take it off their bill, didn't apologize, nothing!  Overall the food, service, and atmosphere deserve 1 star. I would not recommend them. In fact, I would go out of my way to make sure no one I know would have to suffer through gain to Rolands."}
{"text":"It's a true \"Pittsburgh\" spot...a little rough on the ambiance and decor, but as long as you order the lobster roll you won't be disappointed.  The upstairs patio is great on a sunny Saturday or an evening happy hour, but the bar inside leaves a little to be desired."}
{"text":"we went there for st, patrick day. Two harps bottle beers and 12 oyster costs $40."}
{"text":"It was a pretty busy day at Roland's but we were still able to be seated right away. Our server was really nice and recommended great choices from the draft beer list but the service was still pretty slow, probably due to the lunch rush. We just wanted a quick bite to eat so we just ordered some hot wings and a few appetizers. We tried the Crab Spinach and Artichoke Dip which was really tasty but was severely lacking on the crab. It was thick, had great flavor, and was served with the perfect toasted French bread but the crab was just not there which was pretty disappointing. We also tried the Calamari which was lightly breaded and each piece was the size of a jumbo shrimp! The wings were good too but nothing to write home about. The food was tasty and filling but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"My friend claimed Roland's had zeeee best lobster roll, so we stopped in Roland's on a rainy day.  We were seated right away (given we had to sit outside in the cold) and split a $16 lobster roll. When it came out, I was kind of like.... \"that's it?\" Nonetheless, we split it.  There just wasn't that much lobster in it. And the lobster in it..was just ok. And then it was on some greasy garlic bread. I don't know...I just wasn't a fan. Plus, our waitress took forever to show up again...  I don't know, I wasn't too impressed with Roland's, but maybe I haven't tried what other things it may have to offer?"}
{"text":"Okay, so it's not been my favorite week.  And after contemplating a dive off the Ft. Duquesne bridge, I followed some ex friend hag's advice and decided to get out of the house to go do something!  Now, being a typical woman, she suggested retail shopping therapy.  But I'm not one to blow my budget out of the water over a broken heart/bad-man-done-me wrong deal.  No way.  So, I go to Roland's.  Now, I'm not saying that they are better then a 1-800 help-me hot line.  But, they come darn close.  I had one of their famous hot lobster rolls.  Sure, David (hot & sweet little server) suggested that I consider having the cold roll, but no, I'm a woman.  I do not listen.  Hot, hot, hot.  Amy is right.  The buttery rolls do melt in your mouth.  The strawberry margarita wasn't half bad, either.   Actually, it was totally awesome.  While it didn't entirely make all my problems go away, it made me forget about them for an hour or so.  And so, life goes on....."}
{"text":"I had not been to Roland's in a few years.  Had an out of town Marine Vet with me.  We were pleasantly greeted and promptly seated upon arrival.  Our server, Brad, came in a reasonable amount of time, took our drink orders and returned promptly with our drinks.  He asked if we needed a \"few\" minutes to look over the menu.  Twenty three minutes later and he still had not returned to take our orders.  I called a restaurant a couple of blocks away.  We left and had a very nice meal up the street. Don't know if Brad ever returned, but I won't be bringing out of town guests to Roland's again."}
{"text":"Terribly salty \"lobster roll\" on greasy bread. Undercooked fries. Beer is good though! I wouldn't come back for the food! 16.00$ for the lobster roll will inedible lobster"}
{"text":"Not sure why others didn't like this place? I had a great experience.   I had the beer steamed shrimp which was a dozen or so large shrimp steamed in beer. The shrimp were cooked thoroughly but not overcooked or rubbery and they were de-veined which is the mark of a place that knows what are doing.  I'm from FL originally so I'm picky about that.  Try the shrimp with the horseradish and cocktail sauce mixed they give you and it will definitely clear out your sinuses!  My wife had the beer battered fish sandwich, it was great and it had so much cod she gave me half of it just so she could actually fit it on the bun.  This place also has a 4 for $12 Corona special. This place is worth checking out on the strip."}
{"text":"So, four of us came in for the first time.  Diner 1 - ordered the lobster roll sandwich.  Lobster on a roll, nothing more...that's it.  Nothing special - have no idea why people would rave about this.  A bland, poor excuse of a sandwich that does a disservice to all northeasterners who know what a lobster roll is, and this ain't it.  Is this lobster?  Read on.  Diner 2 - ordered a large raw bar sampler, which was six Quahog clams, six oysters and six rubbery shrimp.  Who serves tough, chewy Quahogs on a raw bar?  This dive.  Also ordered the mussels, which were not seasoned and swimming in water.  No wine/garlic sauce as advertised on the menu - water.    Bland and awful.  Finished with the Mediterranean pizza which is spinach, feta and olives - the better part of the dinner.  Diner 3 - steamed clams.  Again who serves Quahogs for steamed clams?  These amateurs.  Also had the clam chowder - which appropriately had minced Quahogs in it.   Diner 4 - ordered the salad with the lobster roll, hold the bread.  Also asked for the lobster to be served chilled with it.  Lobster came hot and was dyed a deep red color.  Why the need to put lobster in a dye?   Because...it's not Maine lobster!  Imposter fish is dyed and artificially flavored, then frozen, then thawed, then microwaved at Roland's and called lobster.  That's my guess.  Sent the mussels back.  No offer to reduce the check or offer a comped dessert.     Rest rooms are dirty, and smell of urine.  Men's was an awful smelling pit and I was told that the ladies had one toilet drenched with urine on the seat, another blocked up and overflowing and a third that could be used.  This place is a smelly, dingy, dive bar with horrible food and poor service.  It is a trap for the unsuspecting tourist.   You have been warned...STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"There is not a more hard working and pleasant bartender then John H. And I've met too many to admit to. The 4-6pm happy hour oysters, clams and shrimp are so ridiculously underpriced - 60 cents!!! I only order the oysters as they've been top notch, shucked well. For all the peeps complaining about lobster roll - smart people order lobster roll in Maine. The seafood stew overflows with sea scallops, shrimp, clams, mussels and lobster. At 21.99, it's best value. Also filled with roasted potatoes and a roux that's the right level of spice. It's a feast!  I'm a business traveler and John is now a friend. 'Nuff said!  Update: the stuffed shrimp are also very good."}
{"text":"Rough experience today - had one drink and left. Waited 15-20 minutes for service and it is not busy. When I said something - everyone wanted to blame someone else - waitress couldn't describe beer and didnt iffer to find out or sample it - brought 12 year old son a pop in a little kids cup. Waitress did apologize for cup but it was too late - chose to leave."}
{"text":"Great place!  Expect to wait a bit, but be patient, it's worth it!  The staple there is the famous hot lobster roll on Mancini bread. Amazing!"}
{"text":"We wanted to eat there today. Waited for about 10 minutes at the entrance. No hostess coming up. Then she shows up saying that she will be back in another second. After additional 5 minutes we ask her what's going on. She did not apologize and says that it will take another 30 minutes. Really??!! Not the nice way to treat a party of 4 wanting to spend some money."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner and it was all about the lobster roll. Hands down the best place for it, in the city. One of my favorite places in the strip, quality service and the roll is tight!"}
{"text":"Ugh Roland's, I wanted to like you but unfortunately you stayed true to your two star rating.   I'm not a Pittsburg native but came to visit for a weekend. We decided to visit the Strip district and wander around to find food. The first restaurant we tried to go to (Gaucho) had too long of a wait so we ended up at Roland's.   Things started off strong... but boy, did it go downhill pretty quickly. The place looked pretty packed, which I figured was a good sign. There is outside seating both upstairs and downstairs which seemed nice. We were helped right away. In fact, while the hostess cleaned off our table, 3 other employees approached us to ask if we were being seated. Those aspects made Roland's seem promising.  After we were seated, nobody came to greet us or take our order for about ten minutes. Ummmm what? Seemed strange after the staff was so attentive just moments before. We were finally able to flag down a waitress. Strike 1.   My group ordered a couple apps including the sweet chili shrimp and Cajun shrimp. The food came out in a timely manner. We still didn't have silverware or plates by the time the food came out. Strike 2.  The food itself was just meh. The sweet chili shrimp was good, better than the Cajun shrimp in my opinion. The Cajun strip was really basic. It didn't have much flavor to it. The mango salsa it came with was just ok (and trust me, that's tough for me to say since I'm such a lover of all things mango). I ordered the lobster mac and cheese from the appetizer section as my entree. Our entrees came our super quick... like before we could even finish our appys. This is a pet peeve of mine so I'll consider this strike 2.5.  The lobster mac and cheese was edible but not that impressive. There were large chunks of lobster in it which was good. But it was just so watery.... it almost tasted soupy?! It needed to be a lot thicker in consistency. Also, the presentation really had me baffled. It was served in a bowl which was on a plate. There were pieces of arugula shoved under the bowl. The pieces were haphazardly sticking out which made the meal look quite strange tbh. My group spent a couple minutes hypothesizing why this may be... the best reason we could come up with was to keep the bowl from sliding around the plate. Very weird. Strike 3.  You know what they say... three strikes and you're out. And Roland's is definitely out after my experience here. I'm sure there are much better options in the area, so I'd recommend eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here twice and it is excellent! So many things to chose from it's hard to have just one thing. I love seafood and always want everything on the menu. The portions are HUGE! If your there with one other person there's no point in getting an appetizer because they are all huge.  The crab spinach and artichoke dip is to die for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this place is the perfect spot. They have a huge deck upstairs and huge bar downstairs. The dining area is clean and everyone that works there seems very nice. Def will be returning!"}
{"text":"Rolands is a place that I usually go to for a drink before or after dinner or after work since I work close by.  We last stopped here on New Years Eve before dinner at a nearby restaurant.  They have a full food menu at Rolands but looking at other reviews and taking to other people that have eaten here I prefer to just order drinks here.     I think this is a good place to watch a sporting event at.  It's usually always busy and a good atmosphere for a big game.  The both upstairs and downstairs bars are laid out nice and open.  The televisions are big and you can easily see them.  I like that a lot.     Good for Rolands that they are busy and the bar is always crowded.  It's just hard to get a beer most of the time.  I don't know if the bartender's are just overwhelmed or not paying attention but it has been difficult to get a drink at first every time I come in here.     They usually have a good amount of drinks on tap which is nice.  If you have a large group the can accommodate you too.  We have had some unofficial events after work here that have been nice.  I just wouldn't order any food here unless I was really hungry and needed an appetizer or something small to get by.         So if you're looking for a good place to hang out and watch some sports with some friends I recommend coming here to have some drinks but there are better places to eat close by in the Strip."}
{"text":"My meet up group wanted to eat dinner here and I was really not sure I wanted to go but changed my mind.  Our group was seated in the main dining area across from a giant screen TV. Our leader asked if we could be seated elsewhere so that we could chat with one another. It was after 5 and the hostess said we could go to another room but we had to be out of there by 6:30. Everyone agreed.  The waitress came and took drink orders first.  When she went to serve us she spilled a beverage right over the table narrowly missing me but hit someone sitting diagonal to me  I thought this was a normal mishap and the area was cleaned up properly.  I was very hesitant about what I wanted to order and decided upon a vegetable salad. Our leader normally treats us to an appetizer and in this case it was chicken nachos. I tried one but could  not taste the chicken but otherwise it tasted okay.  Later when our waitress began serving our main courses I noticed she was spilling sauces on the floor before being placed in front of the guest. I was grateful I ordered a salad. It was nothing out of the ordinary but you could get this same salad anywhere. The person next to me ordered the beer battered giant fish sandwich. He offered me a piece to try and when I bit into it all I could taste was the beer batter. No fish. Enough said.  I was done with my meal and noticed it was 6:20 so I told the group it was time to get up and go so they could have this table.  This is certainly not a place I will go to on my own. There are much better establishments in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible experience here. The food was way overpriced and tasted like overcooked slabs of meat. We ordered the mussels as an appetizer, a swordfish entree, and an ahi tuna entree. We got our appetizer, salads, and entrees at the same time and everything was cold. I don't know how you can manage to overcook food and then it's still cold, but that's what happened. The mussels were barely seasoned and were hardly edible.   I never complain at restaurants, but our meals were so bad that we had to complain to the manager. Luckily, he appologized and took one of the entrees off. I can't believe how bad the food was and that they're charging so much for it. It was awful."}
{"text":"I needed to organize a party for about 20 people. Roland's made it very easy to put the whole thing together via email. I rented a room in the back with a large couch, some tables, and its own bar. There were multiple flatscreen tvs and was nicely decorated. They did not charge for the room, only food and drink which were very reasonably priced. Surprisingly, as part of the event took place during happy hour, drinks during that time were much cheaper. They were well organized and the staff (Mike) was great: professional and made things easy."}
{"text":"Hot Lobster Roll was absolutely delicious! Went during the week around lunchtime and had no wait time to be seated.   Food was prompt and service was excellent. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Rolands for lunch of a Sunday.  Around 30 beers on draft, but mostly the usual beers; only a few micros.  The actual menus themselves need updating; they're something you'd see in a crappy diner....photocopies stuffed into clear plastic film.    We both got salads; one tuna & one salmon.  Huge pieces of fish that were of decent quality.  The upstairs has a cool balcony to hang out on in the summer.  It's a cool place in strip; I'd recommend stopping by and checking it out."}
{"text":"I had high hopes. Hotel staff said it was a good place to eat. We arrived about 30 minutes before the dinner menu was offered, and were seated immediately. Music was a bit too loud. I was excited by the prospect of a hot lobster roll and lobster bisque. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. Our server was polite and our food was ready quickly, but in the words of Randy Jackson: \"...it was just alright for me, dawg.\""}
{"text":"I've only eaten here a handful of times and that's because my ex-husband is a musician and his band played here several times (upstairs) over the years.  I really dislike giving bad reviews but the food is bad. It's disappointing because even with a span of not going for several years nothing has changed. The food tastes bland, chewy and microwaved whether it's seafood or a pizza or fries. Cafeteria food that's been sat out all day tastes better. I just don't get it. They have a primo location in the heart of the Strip. I also don't understand how they're still in business and often crowded. My only guess is tourists who like the drink specials/happy hour and get too drunk to realize they're eating terrible food. Ha, that is until the next day when they're sick from the meals ingested while drinking."}
{"text":"Awful service and food. We got there around 830. Supposedly the restaurant closed at 9, even though we called and said they were open until 11. At 830 the kitchen was already cleaned up. I heard them making rude remarks to each other, about us, because they were angry we came in and they had to mess up the kitchen again. The waiter was rushing us as well.. We ordered our food very fast. He didn't ask how we wanted our meat cooked or anything . I got Ahi Tuna. On the menu it says it comes with a salad, a vegetable, and choice of mashed potatoes or French fries. 20 minutes later our food came out, and it was a huge disappointment. The food was awful, overcooked, and lacked any sort of good flavor. My father's lobster role was shredded pieces of lobster , overdressed, and stuffed into a bun. My sisters filet mignon was cooked to death, and the worst part was mine. The tuna steak tasted like canned tuna. It was strong, and severely overcooked. There was no sign of pink anywhere through the tuna. We will not come back, and anyone thinking about going here, don't! There are much better places to eat in the city of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Yuck!  It's almost embarrassing having this place exist in the Strip with so many tourists coming here.  That has to be how they're making their money because it's certainly not on their food or service.  Well, maybe it's the booze too...  I don't even know where to begin.  Service was horrible.  The lunch took 2 hours.  On a leisurely Sunday that may be fine, but there was no leisure.  At least not with drinks not in hand until a 1/2 an hour after we sat down.  I'd say lunch was served another 1/2 to 45 minutes later.    It didn't matter though, I knew it wasn't going to be anything spectacular.  I'd heard rumors about the food.  I won't go into any details but I wouldn't trust some items on the menu.  I just played it safe and ordered a veggie salad.    The salad was in the entree section, so I assumed it would be a full size salad.  It was not.  It was a side salad with a handful of grilled veggies on top.  Nothing spectacular.  And a side salad at almost $11.  Not worth it.    If you are forced to stop in because you're dying of hunger, stick to a liquid diet:)"}
{"text":"A fun seafood Grill in the heart of Pittsburgh's strip district. Seafood is fresh and well prepared. One of the best fish sandwiches in Pittsburgh and the lobster roll is to die for. Fun busy atmosphere with friendly staff. They must stop if you're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Ugh if I could give this place -10 stars I would. What a nightmare. To start, the first time I ate here, I almost swallowed a giant shard of plastic that was in my salad. Then to my horror, the bar tending goes \"whoops.\" and tosses it on the floor!!   Fast forward a couple months, I decide to give this place a second chance. (I must have been delirious from hunger.) First off the bar tender was rude, slow as hell and terrible at making drinks. My friend and myself order our food and 20 min later out comes my friends food. After almost an hour of waiting, I still had NO pizza. When I asked the cranky pants bar tender in the NICEST possible way, where it was, he just shrugged and walked away. I asked to speak to a manager and was told he was \"busy.\" Finally someone came to talk to me and after an hour and a half I got my shitty pizza.  Thank you to the kitchen manager for doing his job and coming to talk to the customer. But, to the bar tender working earlier New Year's Eve. You DO NOT DESERVE THIS JOB AND SHOULD BE FIRED."}
{"text":"Waited to be seated for 15 minutes, no one greeted us. Asked a passing waitress if we seat ourselves. Waitress walked up the stairs and shouted out NO!  10 minutes later, same waitress passed by and again we asked if we could be seated. She walked up the stairs and ignored us. We asked totalk to the manager and she threw her arms up and said, if you can find him! Needless to say, we will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"I'm surprised Roland's has such bad reviews. I've never had anything bad here. Their lobster rolls are very good and you get a large portion of lobster in it. The clam chowder is good, their seafood pizza is awesome. I honestly have never had a complaint about their food. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is the service is usually pretty slow. Even when we go when not a lot of customers are there, the service still seems to be slow. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wow!  While on business in Pittsburg, went wandering for food.  Among all the closed places (short business days in the Strip District), we decided to try Rolands.  Nice atmosphere, ESPN on TVs, large selection of beer.  We immediately, almost before sitting down, were greeted by a waitress who made some recommendations.  As we had no idea whereto start we needed some time to evaluate, and she kept checking back, but without being pushy. The food was excellent!  Bruschetta and Seafood Pizza for me, Calamari and Seafood Stew for my colleague.  HUGE portions!  Great flavors, cooked right.  (I don't like calamari, but would have eaten more after trying this one.)"}
{"text":"Food was good, but as the waitress cleared our table, she spilled a cup of Italian dressing all over me and was getting ready to run off not even aware (at least I don't think) of what she'd done, even though it splattered all over the table as it got on me.  When I made her aware of it, she didn't apologize, but got me a dry rag and when I asked where the restroom was, she said, \"You'll have to go upstairs, the one down here is out of order\".  While I was cleaning myself in the restroom, she asked my boyfriend if she'd done that and when he said \"yes\", she gave him dirty looks the remainder of the time, but said she'd deduct 2 lemonades off the bill (big whoop).  It wasn't until it was tip-leaving time that she finally apologized.  If it weren't for the fact that the food was good, I'd give it one-star."}
{"text":"Great place to eat after the Steelers vs Patriots game.  fish & chips, shrimp po boy, oysters on a 1/2 shell and huge calamari appetizer. Waiter was nice and hospitable. Will come back when in town..  from California.."}
{"text":"This is a great summertime place.  I have been going to Rolands since I turned 21 a decade ago.   The beer selection is one of the best in Pittsburgh if not the best.  And, I agree with Jason P. in that the best sandwich in the burgh is the lobster roll.  I prefer the cold lobster roll as opposed to the hot, but they are both awesome.  It's a very generous portion of lobster on a garlic bread roll.  They have a very good raw bar with oysters, shrimp, crab and other goodies.  The outdoor seating is awesome.  Sit upstairs and look at the passerby's on the street at the strip.  Saturday's and Sunday's afternoon are the best time to visit.  The pizza is also pretty good, brick oven and thin crust.  The seafood stew is a great deal for about $15 you get a delicious broth and lots of fish and shellfish.  The bartenders are great.  It's pretty well known that John the Irish guy is the best bartender in the burgh', however I think he only works one day a week now.  Bo is very good and my buddy Jeff is also a good tender.   They have pool tables and darts, so plenty of bar games.  The only reason I don't give this place four stars is that they don't have all the top shelf liquor that my heart desires.  They have new management since my buddy Rick went to Bettis bar.  And, they are lacking in some liquor selections since.  They don't have patron or any top shelf rum.  I ordered a top shelf long island iced tea yesterday and was disappointed to taste cuervo instead of petrone.   However, overall the place is a good time and a must visit in Pittsburgh.  Get the lobster roll!"}
{"text":"Great Lobster And Cheese As Well As Filet Mignon Tips. Excellent Service. Excellent atmosphere"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Saturday night. I had to go & try the famous Giant Fish Sandwich! When it arrived, I was impressed. The fish was even bigger than I expected & the batter was perfect. Also, the beer menu is lengthy! They serve beers from almost every corner of the world! I thought about trying something new, but turns out I was homesick for a good old Pennsylvania beer... :) Roland's is definitely a cool place in my book. I'll be back! :P"}
{"text":"If 0 stars were possible I'd give em. Got back from here yesterday evening and I am physically ill.   I didn't even touch the anemic, yellow and fishy smelling muscles - not that the waiter asked why we hadn't eaten them, more on this character in a moment. My ahi tuna steak was decent, but I think the scallops are what got me and my friend is sick as well. Just saying - check your food before the waiter walks off.  Speaking of the waiter - one of the worst I've ever had the displeasure of umm being served by? That sounds awkward and vaguely jack-assy ... Hmm the mild poisoning I have is affecting my wit, but you follow me.  This guy spilled half the water out of the oysters while trying to put a plate down, and didn't notice or say anything about it when he did; he asked me how I wanted my tuna steak prepared??!   Worst of all he spoke in this low monotone while other customers and cars going by drown him out so all you can tell is he asked you something because he's standing there with this kind of 'come on!' look on his face - totally rude and completely inept. I was hard put to give 10% tip to be honest.   I'd suggest the similar bar down the road for better quality food and service. Good luck out there!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and the decor is also. I had the lobster roll salad with no roll. It didn't have much flavor but the lobster was fresh and they give you a good portion. Everything else my friends had was just so so. For the price its not where I would go again for sea food."}
{"text":"Terrible service, along with terrible food. Got the land and sea 6oz filet and stuffed lobster tail. Worst steak and lobster I've ever had! Very dry, no seasoning on anything! Plain steamed vegetables are served with plain, tough filet, and tiny lobster tail with dry crab \"stuffing\" thrown on top of the tail. I can't believe I wasted my money on this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I went tonight for dinner.  Bad mistake.  Worst meal we've ever had.  The salad actually tasted like it had a moth ball in it.  The sword fish we ordered seemed more like a piece of fatty beef that could not be cut with a knife!  The fried calamary was absolutely terrible, it was as if someone took a handfull of dough and fried it in clumbs and hid some meat in it!  The best part of it was that I got a refund on a soup that I didn't even recieve!  I don't recommend unless your drinking and don't care how your food taste.  Busy, slow and awful."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a bloody Mary with lunch.  We were a little early for lunch, 1030am, we got a bloody Mary at the bar. Big mistake!!! It was a premix tomato base that had so much pepper in it, it gave me a stomach ache.  Couldn't finish it because the bottom of the glass was nothing but pepper. When Matt the bartender, finally tore himself away from the 20 something girls at the other end of the bar, we asked if he could make another with less pepper. We were told  that he sells a buck fifty of these on a Saturday so, no he wasn't making it differently for us.  Wrong move and poor salesmanship.  Won't ever go back while he works there. I would have spent a boatload there between lunch n drinks, but another business in the strip got my business instead. ( to the tune of about $50.00)"}
{"text":"Awesome! Roland's sandwich's are the best in town. Absolutely can't be beaten. My favorite is the fish on Mancini's roll. Wow. Delicious. A true classic.   I'm also partial to the pizza. Which one might not expect from a seafood restaurant but it's is delicious. One item recently not found on the menu are the fish tacos, I'm really sad to see them gone & would love to see them return as a special more often or back to the menu permanently!"}
