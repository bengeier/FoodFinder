{"text":"I'm so glad they put a Popeye's back in Pittsburgh but way did they have to put it in Oakland?.  The parking sucks to put it mildly and no handicap parking.  Pgh new retarded parking kiosk are the worst. .25 for 8 min and you have to go to the thing remember your plate number and then go back to put the tag in your window.  This is the stupidest thing ever invented."}
{"text":"Popeyes' Oakland location is by far the greatest Popeyes I've ever had the pleasure of dining at. This restaurant has everything you would expect from a Popeyes and more. Here are some of the amenities provided:  - newly built and very clean - full menu (including spicy options) - fast service - digital drink dispenser - televisions - restrooms - lots of seating  I love going to Popeyes to grab a bite (or maybe a little more) to eat with friends. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely horrible. My green beans were slimy and obviously bad. The staff was very rude, and our order taker didn't repeat our order. When we received our meal it was incorrect and the staff was very rude correcting it.. We were over charged due to the fact that our order wasn't properly recorded. Finally after we received the correct order, our chicken was incredibly stale and dry. I'm quite certain it wasn't even cooked today. We were scared to eat it, we threw it out and took our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food was nasty, dripping in grease and the Mash potatoes and gravy smell old. It made my daughter vomit. This is my first time at Popeyes and it will be my last I stick with KFC or Bojangles."}
{"text":"Another lunch on the run choice! Glad it's Popeyes."}
{"text":"Woohoo, we finally have a Popeye's again!! Popeye's is one of the best national fast-food fried chicken purveyors around. I'm partial to the bonafide or tenders orders. Sides of choice include cajun fries, mashed potatoes w.gravy and cajun rice. I really like the cajun fries. One of things that tickles my fancy is the pop machine. It's a touch screen interface where you can choose a wide variety of coke products (including a bunch of different flavors of fanta). Mix 'n match as you see fit.  The store itself is an odd configuration. A ton of wide open space. The staff is friendly enough. But the wait can sometimes be a while, esp. right around closing time. And why are they not open late late night?  At the end of the day, it's better fast food than most others but still fast food. Make sure you have good health insurance."}
{"text":"Food was normal for me but omg the staff are retarded. 20 min in drive thru with only 3people in line including myself and no customers inside , ridiculous. No straw in drive thru and no biscuit even though in the picture of what I ordered it shows AND says biscuit. Went twice and both times they forgot straw biscuit and honey butter napkins and UTENSILS. New management? I think they just need new staff!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to brave the freezing cold and stop by for some chicken  to warm us up. We both ordered a meal to go and began our wait at 1:07, id say about ten other people came in after us and ordered and received their meals before us. Come 1:34 we finally received our meal and had to sprint to my car so I would not get a ticket. I had thought to ask if the chicken I was eating was fresh butchered since it took so long. Anywho. I dont think ill be going back to this establishment. After the long wait. Our chicken/fries didnt even taste fresh."}
{"text":"Wish i didn't have to give a star it is so bad.   Food is horrible, either over done or dripping with grease.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"If you like Popeyes do not eat at this location. The past 3 times I have gone to place a order they never have what I want in stock. There is no empathy for the issue. Save your money and go else where."}
