{"text":"For our last dinner in Toronto, my husband and I wanted something close to our hotel and Italian.  We found Mercatto on Yelp.com and were pleasantly surprised.  From the outside it looks expensive and possibly stuffy.  But the hostess and wait staff were all very friendly and helpful, and prices were reasonable.  I got the spaghetti alla carbonara, which I loved and could have ate another serving.  My husband had the gnocchi, which was very good.  And we shared the gelato, which came with a scoop of white chocolate, dark chocolate and strawberry with a biscotti on top.  I would recommend Mercatto if you're looking for a quick place downtown on a off-night with friendly service and good Italian food that is simple and delish, not overly fussy."}
{"text":"We went for a quick weekday lunch; the service was prompt and the food was delicious; The agnello with spicy housemade lamb sausage was favourful and packed a punch. The Anatra with duck confit and large chunks of mushroom was a bit mellow-er in terms of flavour, but still quite good.  The meal was topped off by the carmel carpetto (?sp), a mixture of gelato, salted carmel and homemade marshmallow. It is definitely a calorie splurge, but well worth it :)"}
{"text":"Decent Italian food at the heart of the downtown financial district. Service was a little slow but friendly enough. All of the dishes we ordered passed the tastebud test. We had Polpette and Arancini to start, followed by Parpadelle with braised duck Ragu and a Prosciutto pizza. The strawberry negroni was yummy too."}
{"text":"Great lunch scene to meet for pleasure or business.  I am a huge fan of Chef Emily!  Her inventive gourmet salad/pizza/pasta/panini confections rivals the world's top-rated five star restaurants.  Amazing creativity using farm fresh ingredients daily!  I'd follow Chef Emily wherever she goes!  Chef Emily is an absolute ROCK STAR and a keeper Mercatto at MaRS!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars, very friendly professional service, place is very clean and up to standard. Food isn't, ordered risotto and ragu duck pasta, both are very salty, feels like they have put too much salt in. The duck taste like pulled pork instead of duck, wanted to bring back the dishes but feels this is quite rude to the chef in front of his guests(open kitchen), so we just stuck with it. Would likely go back to another location, not this one."}
{"text":"Consistently great food with mainly good service  When I say good service I should mention that I have had excellent service more often than not and the occasional bout of bad service.    Mercatto is reliable and tasty with good vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Overall Excellent! Food and service was outstanding. Would definitely recommend and return. Calamari was very tasty. The halibut dish and the ravioli was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Been there twice recently,  lunch and dinner.  I had a chitarra alla carbonara which was delicious,  however it looked like most pasta servings are not very generous. Also had the prosciutto pizza, thin crust, good amount of prosciutto and arugula,  maybe a little more cheese would make it even better. The staff is very kind and efficient."}
{"text":"This location always seems to have open tables. which is a great thing if you've got no reservations! Food is not consistent though; which might explain that. ordered 2 apps to start:  seared scallops $13 - 2 stars for the temperature being less than warm; no hard sear on the outside littleneck clams $13 - this dish is stellar. yummy sauce, well seasoned  mains included seafood risotto $26 - generous portion of lobster pieces and were delicious but rice was under cooked. Not much depth to the dish. Stagionale risotto $19 - the truffle oil over powers this dish of under cooked rice rabbit garganelli $19 - pasta was cooked al dente. rabbit was tender and tasty. generous shavings of padano   The sommelier provided a good suggestion for wine pairings.  service is friendly and prompt. me gusta!"}
{"text":"Was really craving some italian food and this placed hit the spot bang on. There food is cooked to perfection and you'll have a hard time finding a bad dish. It was a busy night so the service was alittle slow but other than that i could eat at this place again forsure"}
{"text":"Unpretentious, but very good. Pastas and appetizers held up better than the pizza"}
{"text":"As everyone mentions, food here is very good. Everything has got an italian comfort food type of feel to it, and I like that.   For lunch, it's a bit expensive, but prices are on point for dinner. I was pleasantly surprised how nice it was for a dinner date! Given the area, I was worried it would be dead in the evening, but there was a nice crowd and warm ambiance. Our server was nice too, and gave us great suggestions."}
{"text":"Mercatto has been on my bookmark list for quite some time and, since I don't know how much longer I'll be in Toronto, I'm starting to cross off the places I have on my \"must eat\" list. Needless to say, I was psyched to try it. Sadly, it didn't live up to the hype.  First, let me say that the staff was excellent, providing the perfect level of attention and very accommodating overall. The d√©cor is contemporary without making you feel like you'll cut yourself if you run into a table corner.   I started with the zuppa of the day which was a very delicious White Bean and Kale. It was fantastic and chock full o'beans (not unlike some people I know. Anyway). I ordered the short ribs for dinner and had very high hopes after the delishness that was the soup. Sadly, it was a giant heap of fatty beef; pretty much two bars of soap-sized pieces of gristly meat. The potatoes (I think that's what they were), were lumpy and without flavour. At $19 for the plate, I should have had some higher grade meat and better sides, that's for sure.   My last issue was with the quantity of the beverages. I don't know what it is with Toronto restaurants, but I just don't get why they insist on serving Dixie cup-sized drinks, without free refills, and then charging $5 for them. I had a Diet Coke (natch) and it might have been half a can with no refills. It just infuriates me. I know I'm from the land of the Extra Large Big Gulp, but come on, people -- stop making me leave your restaurant with a $35 tab and a parched mouth.  Bottom line: I might try Mercatto again if someone else was paying. Any takers?! ;-)"}
{"text":"Been here twice and had a terrific Italian dinner.  Friendly, helpful staff. Relaxed spot out on the patio made for a great time."}
{"text":"Dining at Mercatto was a stellar experience. The main reason I give this place a 5 star review is the service. My friend and I ordered the Rosato Sangria ($18 for half litre) to share. It was very well made but a small insect (we were on the patio) fell into my friend's glass. We asked the server to get us a replacement glass and he immediately asked us if we wanted the Sangria remade. We declined and he brought us another glass. 5 minutes later, the hostess brought over another half litre of Sangria compliments of the house! I was extremely impressed with the attitude of the servers, and the food was exceeded expectations as well. I ordered the pasta in pesto sauce and my friend had the gnocchi - both of which were perfectly made. Loved the ambience and laid-back feel of the restaurant. Definitely on my \"repeat\" list!"}
{"text":"The food was not that great. Service was poor, and our waitress was not friendly. Not quite worth the price. I dont think we will return."}
{"text":"I've been here for birthday parties, and they definitely have the room to accommodate large groups.  This place serves good, competent Italian food--lots of pizzas and pastas.  The crust on the pizzas is very thin (toppings soak through really easily), but the toppings are generous and well balanced (had the prosciutto pizza last night, and the salty fattiness of the prosciutto was nicely complemented by the liberal heaping of arugula on top).  Desserts were a mixed bag--they've got the usual chocolate tart and tiramisu, but they also offer something called a caramel copetta (a mason jar with caramel ice cream topped with salted peanuts and marshmallow cream) that was truly incredible.  It's definitely rich, but as a once-in-a-while treat it's a wonderful indulgence."}
{"text":"Pro: good service and not too noise.    Con: substandard Italian. Veal over cooked. Pasta taste like its out of the box. Bread not worth the calories. Better Italian a few blocks away."}
{"text":"I am a regular and love this place. Good food, good ambiance, and amazing pizza. One of the best Calamaris in Toronto. Great for date night."}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5! Great service, accommodates groups, but same experience as Terroni, O&B, etc.... Nothing unique!"}
{"text":"Definitely not going back. My bf and I stayed at King Eddy and searched on Yelp for a place close by. Being a new yelper...we trusted the yelp community in their reviews. Found great ones...in 2014 and before then. So HUGE reason I'm writing this is because their rating needs an update and I wish we had gone to Carisma or someplace else and spent a more worthwhile $150.  THE START Called for resos... they said a table was available for 9:30 and the bar was open for 9 if we would like to come earlier. Great.  9:30. Greeted by manager nicely. Sat us at a table and section that was seemingly random.   SERVICE Our server, Joni, was quick to drop off menus telling us there were Valentine's day specials without any further description - all the while we were standing next to our table with our coats on. Not very welcoming at all. Great start to poor service.  That continued with poor knowledge of the wine menu when I inquired between the noir or syrah. Poured my glass to taste and also poured my glass after tasting. Basic server and wine service etiquette.    FOOD  Our mains came out. The Linguine pasta was below average. Mushroom risotto was a bit better earning an okay.  For dessert, cheesecake was flavorless and gelato was ordinary.   THE END Left wrapped peanut butter cups to take home.  THE NIGHT First impressions last and even these delicious peanut butter cups that I'm enjoying right now will not make up for my return here. Best part was my date and dim lights which I can take to some other place, so there I go!"}
{"text":"#1 rule if you're an italian joint: make good pasta!  I should preface this review by noting that this only speaks to the quality of the food.  Indeed, this is a nice little modern space staffed by friendly, knowledgeable and attentive people.  Maybe I will come back in the future and try something else.  If my opinion changes, I will update this review.  But until then, here it goes.  I came here last week with an out-of-town friend and ordered the insalata romana and pappardelle with lamb bolognese sauce.  The salad was decent.  Came with nice orange vinaigrette on it, but way too much of it.  It was also supposed to come with white anchovy, but I could barely detect it.  Sad because that was the main draw for me ordering this.  Now here comes the big FAIL - the pasta.  Both conceptually and in execution.  Let's talk concept first.  I love bolognese.  Love it.  But in their attempt to be overly creative, they put carrots and raisins in the sauce.  Carrots, okay, fine.  But raisins?  Really?  Raisins?  The sweetness totally ruined the sauce.  There were so many of them that I couldn't eat around them either.  The pasta was also super disappointing.  A restaurant holding itself out to be italian must be able to make fresh, al dente pasta.  This stuff was cooked to death.  And it was all stuck together in a giant congealed ball in the center of my dish.  So much so that I could barely break it apart to eat it.  It was so overcooked that I couldn't tell if it was made fresh in-house, or came out of a box from the grocery store.  Truly disappointing especially considering I'm on a wedding diet and I let myself indulge perhaps once every two weeks."}
{"text":"I work across the street and had always been a huge fan.  However, in the past 6-8 months something happened..  Their lunch take-out salads went from ovenroasted brussels sprouts with bacon bits, thyme and mushrooms to boiled pasta in pesto sauce.  No more pear & nut/blue cheese salads...  It's impossible to add the salmon/chicken chunk now too - which was my favorite feature.I won't be going back, and judging by the line-ups these days for lunch, I am not the only one."}
{"text":"It was a quaint location in a quieter part of town .  I had dinner here in the middle of the week while in town on a business trip.   The ambiance was warm and the bar was a good size for the space.  While it was quite slow for mid week, there were several groups of people that were eating together.    Extensive Italian Wine list but a smaller dinner menu. I ordered the Tuna.  And although was underwhelmed by the size, it was amazingly delicious!  Really a well flavored dish and I enjoyed the tuna/clams combo.   I had only wished I had seen the chalk board above the open kitchen area that listed the specials before ordering.  I probably would have ordered the Risotto special.     They had a long family size table right in the middle of the space.  I would go back to taste more of their flavorable dishes even though knowing the portions might be on the smaller side."}
{"text":"A very good Italian restaurant and they even have Paulaner beer on tap. They offer good side dishes and the pizza although not baked in a real pizza oven is quite good too."}
{"text":"Not sure why, but I've always viewed this establishment as the next option if Teroni's was too busy.  However, having tried it for the first time last week, Mercatto's is certainly a worthy first option if your looking for casual Italian food.  Service was excellent, decor was beautiful and a great selection of dishes on the menu, something for everyone.    Must try the iced cuppiccino, could be the be the best in the city."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about this place, about 6 months ago I decided to cave in and pay this place a visit. Ever since, I've been here a total of 3 times (once at the Bay St. location). While I did have a pleasant experience at the Bay St. location I prefer the Toronto St. location because of the ambiance and the professional but super down-to-earth staff.   The food is absolutely delicious, I ordered Fusilli con Pollo(chicken, spinach and mushroom pasta) and honestly it is one of the best pasta dishes I've ever tasted in my life. It rivals those I've had in Italy. The abundance of flavours you get in that dish, each bite just makes you crave more. Their antipasto misto is worth ordering - you get a choice of 6 items, the ones I liked were the prosciutto, burrata (a soft milk cheese which was just divine!) and the artichoke. On another visit I had the Orecchiette Pugliesi(Italian sausage pasta), that was good but not on the same level as the Fusilli con Pollo, but worth trying nonetheless.   Each time I went I had an pizza as an appetizer, they are good! Thin crust and the right amount of cheese and toppings. Their pizzas are comparable to Terroni's.   Their wine menu is impressive, when I couldn't decide on one, the waitress offered me a taster before I ordered it, they truly know how to make your meal a pleasant experience. Overall a good dining experience to be had here. Don't miss out on this!"}
{"text":"Although I have been to the Bay St location, I thought I knew what to expect, but this time it was with a large group, and Mercatto (Toronto St.) exceeded my expectations.  Perhaps a large group is the way to come, because you get to sample so many varieties of food. The lovely young ladies that served us were as friendly as they were lovely; any requests were provided immediately.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have already reviewed the Mercatto at the Bay Street location and stopped for lunch at this location last week.    The atmosphere and menu are identical.  The College location, however, has a very inviting patio that is covered in shade at lunchtime. It was great to enjoy the last bit of outdoor dining in the city.  Ordered pizza again, as did the co-workers with whom I was dining.  The pizzas are large, thin crust and cooked in a wood burning oven.  I enjoyed the Norma - with eggplant, ricotta cheese, mozzarella and tomatoes.  I would go back to this location and order pizza again - it is a nice lunch size and you can take some away with you if you can't finish it."}
{"text":"Friendly hostess, good food and a nice ambiance define this Italian restaurant. We enjoyed a light but tasty ravioli a mano and a escalope pasta here."}
{"text":"They have great coffee but, I think there are much better place to eat in TO...though the location can be very convenient to the research crowd."}
{"text":"Cliffs notes version: HORRIBLE service, check out TERRONI down the same block  Was greeted by the door staff well, I have no complaints with the food went for a margherita pizza, a glass of vino and some gelato after. I was in my happy place until I got so sassed by our server I am still recovering.   I wish I remembered her name but she was a brunette - shoulder length hair, about 5'4 - I feel like I am profiling a criminal but you might thank me later for the headsup. After she brought our bills - there were 3 of us and we did not look derelicte by any means nor were we greasy and ungroomed to say the least - I asked her to split our bills 3 ways to which I essentially got:  \"Ummm it would have been really nice if you had told me this before you got your bill and not now and I am sorry but that's not gonna happen\" - with the fakiest flakiest smile on her face. I honestly thought she was gonna end that with a JUST KIDDING but that JUST KIDDING never came. So I just put my credit card in and then literally 30 seconds letter she appeared with the bill split - we had not even asked her to do it and I guess she did it anyway and it took like what? no time at all? We are living in the 21st century guys, can do crazy things like splitting a bill 3 ways with computers and stuff.....  So she puts our separate bills down mothering us some more saying - well I did it this time but please remember NEXT time you gotta make sure you ask me before hand  Well frankly my dear - there won't be a next time.   Guys check out Terroni - on Adelaide instead - better food WAY BETTER service"}
{"text":"A lovely little restaurant.  Food is slightly above average.  Did not like their pizzas.  They have nice wines.  Candle light is a nice touch if you are on a dinner date.  Not great for a group of friends though."}
{"text":"Burpday dinner on a Saturday night at this fine classy restaurant.  The ambiance is quite nice and made me feel like a bum since I was sporting a tshirt, jean, and converse sneakers.    Our server was very helpful with accommodating 11 guest instead of 10 that was booked.  Made sure our glasses were always full and helped with recommending a bottle of white wine to go with my order of scallops.  I didn't have any main course so I can only make comment on the scallops; they were tasty but nothing to write home about and I felt charging $12 for 2 scallops I should be able to.  Service 5/5  Food 3/5 Decor/Ambiance 4/5  I'm giving this place 3 stars because there are better options in Toronto and the food served should earn the 4 and 5 stars."}
{"text":"Mercatto thrives in its atmosphere. The space is large and designed in such a way that you feel like you're close to fine dining, but without the snobbery. Clean, light colours and plenty of seating; upbeat music, but lingering at the perfect din to just enhance the vibrance of the room.  Service is top-notch. Our waiter Kevin was well-versed in the menu and had the perfect wine suggestion to match my meal. Fresh bread was never empty on our table, and my water glass was seemingly bottomless.  The food was tasty but this is where Terroni comes out on top, which is hard for me to say cause the service at Mercatto is so much better! My margherita pizza was nice but not amazing, and my friend's pasta was also good but not to-die-for. BUT WAIT, the tiramisu was decadent and the espresso worth two buzzed thumbs up. And dessert is most important anyway, Y/Y?"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of visiting this Mercatto location last month for my birthday. We were a party of 7 and had the beautiful table in the open wine room.   Our server was very polite and helpful with the menu and wine list. We ordered a couple charcuterie boards for the table and they were delicious! As my main I ordered the lobster pasta which had plenty lobster meat and the pasta was cooked perfectly (not too keen on the fact they put a claw on top of the plate for decoration, It was a tease since it was empty!). Another guest ordered the prosciutto pizza, great size and flavor. The mushroom ravioli was by far my favorite (I secretly wished I had ordered it), the pasta just melted in your mouth and could taste how fresh it was.  Overall Mercatto is a true restaurant that is all about fresh and seasonal ingredients with a laid back attitude and beautiful decor.   I will defiantly be returning!"}
{"text":"It has been said several times but I must say it again - the food is EXCELLENT. I'm usually a salt and pepper, please-put-more-cheese kind of girl, but at Mercatto, I didn't even notice if there were any salt and pepper shakers around! It was gooood.  We started with antipasti misti and chose artichokes + beets, prosciutto + gentile and cheese I forgot the names of. GOOOOD. Then we had oriecchette and tagliatelle. GOOOOD. We ended with chocolate lava cake; though we've had better it was GOOD nonetheless.   Price is OK considering the cuisine and the ambience. Service is nice and accommodating, too.  I would have given the 5th star if only the place was a little bit more spacious (we went to the Toronto St location). The space between tables was so tight you can't help but overhear the people beside you. So that I knew the couple on our right was celebrating their anniversary (and was already planning what to do on the next one!) and the one on our left was extremely happy about their pasta. It's entertaining at the beginning (sorry!) but can get annoying and noisy after a while.  Anyway, definitely can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I start my days here getting coffee. Its right next to a Sam James so its saying a lot that this is still my choice. They have a nice bar to sit at when having coffee or lunch, which is great. The staff is friendly and the food is consistently good. Its not a mind blowing experience, but its great for business lunches or coffees."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to celebrate my birthday with eleven of my closest girlfriends, and the restaurant we chose was Mercatto. It ended up being a perfect choice.  I chose Mercatto because it is fairly priced, has a wide range of options, including vegetarian, and an extensive wine list.   We had a table right in the front window which suited us just fine. On another birthday, we were seated in the library, which is overly charming and just off the kitchen - but this evening it had been booked.   Our server was patient, attentive and made excellent recommendations for both Cheeses and Wines. We ordered decent bottles in the $50 range. The Pizzas are fantastic and enormous, I prefer them to (gasp) Terroni.  I ordered the frito misto which was tasty, and much larger in portion size to. say, Gios. The cheese platter (you choose 3 selections) was also an interesting app selection, and we enjoyed our server's suggestions. The \"four seasons\" pizza came covered in olives, artichokes, mushrooms and Prosciutto, each representing their own quadrant. I could only finish half. Overall, all 12 diners at our table were pleased with their meal.     He also was kind enough to split the bill into 9 or so bills. Note that gratuity of 18% is included on large parties.   The bar also sent us a round of shots, and my girlfriends brought me in a cake - which the server happily brought to us without cake cutting fee.   Wonderful location, comfortable atmosphere, really noticeably and consistently excellent service plus they really made me feel special on my birthday. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"It's a great work lunch spot as many have already confirmed. Having said that, I always make a reservation so I don't need to wait for a table. It's recommended especially if it's a bigger group. They also have a takeout section so if you're in a rush that's the alternative."}
{"text":"I went there for a recent lunch and was impressed.  It's a great place to meet for lunch and though packed, less busy than the location on Bay and Queen where there always seems to be a wait a lunchtime.  Here, we were able to get a table for two at noon with no problem  The food was excellent.  We ordered the specials of the day--the boconcini heirloom tomato salad, and cucumber yogurt soup which were fantastic and perfect for a summer afternoon.  The tagliatele almond pesto with sun dried tomato was fine, although rather tasteless."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian places I've eaten.  The food was authentic and delicious.  We ordered the formaggi board and every single cheese was perfect and delicious.  The atmosphere is a great mix of modern and rustic.  If I'm ever in Toronto again, I will definitely revisit!!"}
{"text":"All Mercatto locations are fantastic, but the service at the Toronto street location is even better. They not only have great food but they are also very friendly and accommodating, something that many Toronto restaurants lack. Last Friday I went there for dinner with a few friends and noticed they had changed their dinner menu and the pizza I usually ordered was not there. Our server said no problem, we will make it for you anyway! I really appreciated that gesture.  Their wine list however could use a little improvement."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my experience at Mercatto!  I had my boyfriends birthday here and we were a party of 25 looking for a venue downtown Toronto during TIFF!  We lucked out and the manager -John was able to accommodate us just when I was about to give up! John (the manager) and his team made the evening so smooth and such a treat. My boyfriends picture even made it on our menus! It was lovely!  Also, the food was phenomenal! Everyone has a blast and so did the birthday guy!  My new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Mercatto.  Two people eat and shortly afterward get sick.  Ravioli with carrots (from lunch)?????  Really, is that the best you can do for a meatless ravioli plate?  Impossible to believe restaurant felt it all right to serve this horrid dish.  Have had trouble here before----not returning."}
{"text":"I always find the food reasonable and the atmosphere, lively.  Come by yourself and enjoy your dinner at the bar with a decent selection of by the glass wines.  Food is consistently good quality and well priced though not particularly exciting.  The dining room size is perfect for keeping the space well occupied, creating enough buzz but not feeling cramped.  Staff are usually knowledgeable and well mannered.  Avoid sitting near the kitchen as poor ventilation leads to some smokiness in the air.  Ok for groups."}
{"text":"I was really impressed by the food, atmosphere and friendly service. I first came here for a friend's birthday, and then returned the following week.  The dish that stood out most for me was the fried risotto balls with mushrooms, truffle oil and stuffed with delicious oozing cheese. Deep-fried gooey goodness! I also quite enjoyed the Affumicato pizza topped with fennel sausage, smoked scamorza, and tomato as well as one of their rabbit pasta specials."}
{"text":"Deliciously Overpriced Lunch.  The food at Mercatto is always fantastic.  But $19 is a bit much to pay for a piece of swordfish and a few veggies that were more garnish than side.  My birthday lunch with Dave \"Hamilton's FTR King\" R., Mike \"Who Da Man?\" S. and a few Non-yelper \"Not Cool Enough for Nicknames\" Friends kicked off an epic three days of celebration never before seen on Guy Fawkes Day (at least not outside of the UK and almost never on my behalf, if one must qualify such remarks).  I arrived a few minutes after everyone else, and was shown to the table for ten set aside for six of us during the busy lunch hour (this turned out to be poor strategy on their part).  Our server eventually* swung by, told us about the specials and grabbed our orders.  I went for the swordfish special, others opted for pasta.    About the same time as the food came up, our server came back to the table to ask a small favour.  Could a couple of additional diners be seated at our table?  This was a strange request but as nobody in our group wanted to be the jerk who said no, we obliged.  Next thing I know, two of my colleagues are seated at the far end of our table, at which point I realized just how much had been asked of us.**  I found the intrusion a bit unprofessional for an establishment like this.  Maybe at Taco Bell, but not here.  The swordfish was delicious.  Most were pleased with their food, although the browned-butter ravioli drew one thumbs-up and one thumbs-down, which by my calculation averages to thumbs-sideways.  My swordfish was delightful with the first bite bordering on foodgasmic (though not quite), and the few pieces of vegetable matter underneath it were equally yummy (kale, I think, though I don't know my veggies very well).  While I have no direct complaint about the food, I'm a bit dissatisfied on value - they could have given me a bit more to eat for $19.  At least a side of rice?  It also took a while to get our bill and get the hell outta there.  Again, this is lunch, folks! Maybe if you were serving your tables more effectively (hire more servers if that's what it takes) you wouldn't have to seat two parties at one table!  The company was great - thanks Dave R. for putting it together and thanks all of you for coming.  Three-star experience***, five-star friends!  * I wasn't timing, but she seemed to take a while to show up considering it was lunch and their clientele likely has places to be in the afternoon.  ** To be clear, I like both of the colleagues who were joined our table.  Still, their presence placed some limitations on the conversations I could engage in with my friends and had me minding my P's and Q's a bit more than I would have preferred while celebrating my birthday and away from the office.  *** Five-star food.  Deduct one point for really poor value, and another for service unbecoming of a mid-pricey restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim. Had to locate a place with food for my son and something nice for the adults.  This place covered all the bases.  The atmosphere is really nice and quite.   The waiter Tim was pleasant and very nice to our son who was hungry and tired.   The starters mixed salad and vegetable soup were great.  We had a great selection from the menu. I had the evenings special salmon with egg plant and onions which was great.  My mum had the lamb chops which were also amazing. The ravioli was home made and great. The cheese was very flavorful.  For the price this place was a hidden gem. Thank you Yelp for having a place to find these types of places."}
{"text":"This is an update to my rave review about the mushroom pizza with truffle oil. Simply, it's no longer on the menu. My next fave is Quattro Stagione."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Mercatto Cuisine: Italian Location: Downtown Address: 15 Toronto St Price Range: $10-15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 2 Service: 2 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 2.5  Extra information:  *couple locations within downtown *financial district lunch crowd *specialize in pasta and pizza  This was my second time visiting Mercatto and the only reason why I am doing another review on this place- is because the first time I was there, I was meeting up with a friend I haven't seen for a very long time, which distracted me from the actual food and service at this place.  To be honest I wouldn't have gone back the second time unless my mom wanted to try this place just cause it's so conveniently located around the corner from my house. They are always busy at lunch and it's mostly financial district crowd grabbing a quick bite or having a meeting over their lunch hour wine.  When I walked in, there was no specific host at the front so I had to look for a waiter to get myself seated after standing there awkwardly for a minute or two. To make matters worse after I sat down, we were served by the most awkward waitress ever! She made me feel like I did something horrible to her family, but she was forced to 'serve' me- yes, that awkward plus she had shifty eyes and constantly looked away when I was talking to her as if she was guilty of something.  Anyways, just like last time, we were served complimentary 3 pieces of bread and olive oil. Their olive oil might be excellent quality but I just found it to be very raw tasting with almost a woody after taste It would have been better if there were some salt or pepper on the table but there werent any.  Ordered: CALAMARI FRITTI 3/5 *With Basil Caper Aioli and Lemon for $11 *After we ordered this, we could smell it as they were making it in the kitchen *This is big for an appetizer dish *Comes fresh and hot, as they were just deep fried *Camalari batter is not seasoned so you def need a sauce *Basil Caper Aioli was a little bland *Couldn't really taste the caper  Ordered: SPAGHETTINI 3/5 *With Calamari, Clams, Bread Crumbs and Chili for $16.00 *Overall, small in portion *They divided the dish in half for us because we were sharing *3 clams in total *Pasta was over-cooked which is surprising cause they are suppose to be Italian restaurant *I don't know what kind of Italian restaurant would over cook their pasta. Obviously I like it more al dente *Couldn't really understand why breadcrumbs were added since they did nothing for the dish*It was a mediocre and boring pasta overall  Summary: Just like the first time, the food was mediocre but it was the service that completely turned me off from Mercatto. The waitress spoke so quietly in this mellow tone I felt like I had to be more cheery cause she was so damn depressing. I did not enjoy my lunch there and I actually left feeling dissatisfied and irritated. Overall this place isn't very cheap for lunch and if I am willing to spend the money and craving pasta/pizza, I would much rather go to Terroni."}
{"text":"First time I was here it was for a dinner. Food was great. Resturants clean and staff was friendly too."}
{"text":"Awesome service. My daughter needed a diaper change and the manager cleared off his desk on the office for me! All while keeping my entree warm in the kitchen. Beautiful atmosphere and excellent food."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday with 6 of my girlfriends. I had called a month prior to and had specifically requested the large table in front of the wine wall and they accommodated my request perfectly.   pros:  - very inexpensive entrees for the nice atmosphere - great service- our server was very knowledgable about wine and food pairings - close to downtown core  - they didn't charge a plating fee for my birthday cake...even though i believe that their official policy is that there is one   cons:  - wine was a bit pricey per glass   all in all i highly recommend this restaurant. i know that have another location on Adelaide that is smaller i believe. but i would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"We went out to Mercatto for a group dinner!  I made a group reservation for 6 and we had some late additions and they were able to expand our table to accommodate for 8.  We got a table in a corner by the bar by ourselves.  The food at Mercatto was great.  A few of my friends got pizzas and we swapped slices.  I had the prosciutto, great blend of salty and bitter.  The speck pizza was wonderful.  The diablo (sp?) was SPICY!  The last pizza was like a meat lovers, I was a fan.  I would rank Mercatto's pizzas top 5 in the city.  Their toppings win me over.  Food gets four stars!  Service wise was meh, below average.  The fact we were a group service should have been more attentive.  Our server seemed like she did not want to serve us.  The place was not super packed last night so one would think that service would be better, but no.  Service gets two stars.  Overall, Mercatto experience gets 3 stars.  I really enjoyed the intimate atmosphere.  Check out Mercatto if you are in the area.  I would recommend getting a reservation!"}
{"text":"Mercatto is one of my favourite Italian restaurants in Toronto because it satisfies very specific cravings. I have always found this location a little better in with regards to the service and the food itself. My favourite dish is the Orecciette (5 stars) and I get it approximately 90% of the time I go there (some call it an addiction, I call it satisfaction). I am not a fan of creamy/saucey pastas because when it comes to pasta, I value simplicity. The Orecciette pasta is cooked to perfection and seasoned to a simple peppery taste that offers that little kick of spice which takes the dish to the next level. The addition of the fennel sausage and chopped greens adds a nice balance to the texture/taste of the dish. The dish comes in a pretty decent size and is a pretty good value at modest cost of $15.  Mercatto also offers a nice selection of cured meats which can be coupled with fresh bread to start off your meal. I highly recommend the the spicy salami and the proschiutto which just melts in your mouth. The risotto balls (3.5 stars) are also quite tasty but is a little hearty for one person to have, especially if you're going to get the Orecciette which comes in a pretty decent portion. It's a great dish to share. The pizzas are also a great addition to the menu. The Maialina pizza (3.5 stars) is good if you like a little meat on your pizza but the Margherita pizza (4 stars) offers a simple, yet elegant alternative that has a crunch to every bite.  The atmosphere makes for a pretty decent place to go on a date during dinner time or for business meetings during lunch hours. However, the service can be pretty hit-or-miss and the other entrees are relatively mediocre for such a steep price. But if you are looking for a nice place to go for some delicious pasta or traditional Italian Pizza, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Food was not that great, over priced. They charged me 12$ for a 5oz glass of wine, when they said it was $4.00, service was not good. The kitchen had run out of ingredients and we were told that they ran out before the food came out. We ordered 2 main courses, 1 appetizer, 4 small glasses of wine for 125$, they were stingy with their food portions, and wine.  Overall it's a cozy, romantic atmosphere establishment, but other than that, save your money, lots of better places with better tasting food, with generous portions for a fraction of the price, I won't be going there again. I'm pretty sure I was over charged for the wine. So watch your receipt  and always ask how much something is before hand. Twice!"}
{"text":"I have to give this restaurant 3.5/5 stars for their great customer service, even though I must admit the food was mediocre.  I had the funghi risotto which was good but missing flavour and texture. Although we were a party of 10 and our food took a while to come out management brought the artichokes appetizers to our table which were on the house and were delicious. Our waitress was always around making sure our water was always topped up - which is something I appreciate!  I was satisfied with my dinner experience and appreciate that customer service is valued here!"}
{"text":"Great \"working lunch\" spot. By the way, Mercatto is located in the Mars building (and what a nice building to boot!).  Lunch resos DEFINITELY required as it was packed. I came here as a group of 12 (business lunch) and service was fast and efficient. Our waitress was great and initially offered wine/beer (no one took the offer) so we just stuck with waters. Around the table ordered pizza's and pasta's. We had some Ottawa peeps and they thoroughly enjoyed their meals, saying it was delish. I can agree - I opted for the artic char with cauliflower and it was just right.  Portions are great for lunch and you won't go hungry.   Highly recommend this place for business lunches. Great food. Great service."}
{"text":"This was a great find! Very comfortable atmosphere. We ordered the carciofi, which was fantastic. It was fried marinated artichokes with a pesto creme. The Arancini and grilled calamari also was a delicious start. My husband ordered the seafood risotto, the seafood was great but otherwise it lacked flavor. I ordered the orecchiette outliers which had great flavor. The rapini was done perfectly! Nice spot to relax and enjoy friends."}
{"text":"Great fresh pasta with rabbit ragu and smoked carrots and peas.   The barista prepared the perfect espresso!  The torta di chocoliatto with strawberry sauce and vanilla gelato highly recommended. Great place for business lunch"}
{"text":"The MaRS building is lovely, and with million dollar rents, it should be. The building houses geeks of all scientific sorts. You can see their pale complexions, unshaven neck hair and slightly too short pants coming a mile away. So, be forwarned, if you are looking for Bay-street types who make millions, instead of write grants for millions of funds, this is not the Mercatto for you. However, if you value brains over braun, saddle up to the bar with a glass of red and order yourself a pasta special and wait.  The wine bar is fantastic. They have the machine that spits out the perfect taste, 3 oz or 5 oz pour. It keeps the wine fresh and if you don't know your Italian wines, ask for a taste.  I've been here several times now, and the food keeps getting better, or I've learned enough to make the best choices!  The margarita pizza is bland. The bread is OK, but tastes better with a scoop of the Italian hot peppers that they can bring over for you.  The freshmade pasta specials are your best bet. Get it topped with anchovies, olives and basil and a light tomato sauce, if they've got it.  The wine list is extensive by the bottle, too.  Antipasti appetizer platter that can be shared among 4-5 people are swell.  Service has been great for a big group, and OK for a small group.  Outside patio faces North and gets the sun at the peak of the work-day, but after work, it gets cold, windy and dark."}
{"text":"Excellent food and wine.  The atmosphere on the patio was great too. Just far enough away from the street, but not too far.  I'd go back there anytime, but it's especially nice at dusk..."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Had the Margherita Pizza and Caesar salad for lunch and the food was delicious!  This olace has a great ambience and a very nice patio! Seriously can't resist coming to this place everyday during lunch hour! The lineup is pretty long during lunch but you get through it in a breeze. Can't wait to try more of their menu items"}
{"text":"I really like this loacation. We had no issues getting a table at 8pm on Saturday and got a great table on the patio. The staff was super friendly and let us linger for hours. The wine list was pretty solid and I loved my Sauvignon Blanc. I had the special - fresh salmon with fennel and polenta which was really nice. My SO had a pasta with lamb ragou and friends had Gnocchi and ravioli - tasted everything and the gnocchi was outstanding. Their dark chocolate sorbet is to die for. Definitely going back - soon."}
{"text":"I was slightly skeptical reading the A-OK reviews but I was pleasantly surprised! I had my birthday dinner here which the staff organized really well. They were able to accommodate an a la carte menu for 20 people and separate bills!  Our server was attentive and kind and the food was delicious. I had the lamb carpaccio and the seafood risotto which was pretty delicious - so good that one of my friend ordered one after finishing his meal!  The decor is lovely as well. I'd definitely revisit."}
{"text":"Nice pastas, salads and atmosphere. Good wine by the glass options. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch as part of a workplace holiday event. I ordered the lunch special; A fish dish. The food itself was good, but the plate consisted of 4 tablespoons of food max. Since it was a work event, I felt awkward ordering additional food and instead left the restaurant hungry and stopped at Tim Hortons on my way back to the office to fill up a bit. This plate was a huge miss, although the other plates (Pizza) seemed more filling. The Pasta was also a bit on the scarce side.."}
{"text":"Had an event in the area and decided to pop in for a light meal and i must say i was very impressed with the quality of the food.  Authentic Italian with a slight twist is how I would describe the food.  Service was fantastic and espresso was also great!  Will be back for a full meal!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with former lab. We sat on the patio. This place is attached to the MarS building which houses many research labs from U of T. My friend and I shared arancini (rice cheese balls) and prosciutto pizza. I liked the rice ball you could see the cheese separate from the rice. It came with tomatoes in tomato sauce. The pizza was alright. It's a little bit bigger than normal personalized pizza and it has a thin crust. It was difficult to cut so we ended up eating it with our hands. The prosciutto on top of pizza was also hard to cut so I ended up eating it in one piece. The pizza got cold quickly so need to eat fast. It was okay I'm not a pizza person. Our waiter was attentive. It was a bit chilly to sit on the patio today but it was a nice day out and noisy inside. It's a bit pricey for students but maybe ok for people who work."}
{"text":"This is basically Terroni: basically same concept, basically same menu, basically same ambiance.   I really loved the flavours in my soup of the day (sweet pepper and chicken), but the temperature was inconsistent.  I thought my duck confit pizza was really good, but somehow the portion seemed small for a pizza?  Especially a $20 pizza.  The highlight of the meal was the caramel dessert with marshmallow and salted caramel topping, served in a mason jar -- I don't usually order desserts in restaurants, but this was outstanding and a \"not to miss\" for sure.  Service was friendly but amateurish, especially for the price point.  Great wine list."}
{"text":"Mercatto has a nice ambiance and that's the biggest selling point. Good to bring a date or business associate here. Despite being a late Friday night where most of the patrons have finished their meal our order took quite a bit of time. And it took a while before the waitress came to take our order.  After a while we finally got our food. It wasn't bad but it wasn't exceptional. I had the recommended Linguine. It was good, it's been a while since I had pasta due to the carbs. My friend had the Margherita pizza. Despite being really hungry due to the long wait, it still wasn't that good.   Overall I would give it a 2 star for the food and service and 4 star for the ambiance."}
{"text":"I've been to Mercatto a number of times and, while I am usually a big fan of their beautiful homemade pasta, their food fell a bit flat for me tonight.    To make the most of Mercatto, I suggest staying basic.  They have wonderful local meats and cheeses that you can pair up with fresh bread, a salad or two, and a glass of wine, and make a night of it.  Their pasta is wonderful, especially their fennel sausage orecchiette (\"little ears\") with rapini and a little spice.  Or go for a simple, but delicious, margherita pizza.     The place where Mercatto falls a little short is with the more \"interesting\" dishes that require more finesse.  Tonight I had a veggie pasta with zucchini, peas, fava beans and baby tomatoes.  It should have been fresh and beautiful, but it was disappointing.  The peas did not taste fresh and yet they were undercooked.  The fava beans were overcooked and mealy.  The tomatoes were hot, but didn't have the caramelized concentration that roasting them first would have provided.  (Note to self: stop watching so many food shows that make it seem okay to used terms like \"caramelized concentration\"!)  Then, again, the chef at Mercatto is currently on Top Chef Canada, so let's all give ourselves full reign to pretend we're Mark McEwan.  Vegetarian Score: 6/10.  There are some nice veggie options, you'll have no problem finding something, but the menu unapologetically favours meat."}
{"text":"While there are no actual Italians to be found on the premises nor anyone who speaks a word of Italian (usually a bad sign), the important thing is that the menu and wine list here have been assembled by someone who understands Italian food and wine, and pretty nicely at that.  This is a crowded, noisy (because of the windows and wood floors) environment, so if you're looking for intimate and romantic, try someplace else.  There's a good-sized wine list and several nice, unusual selections available by the glass.  Because it's a busy place, don't expect attentive service, but a team service approach is used, so you don't feel abandoned. Lots of traditional dishes rendered with a bit if a twist, and enjoyable enough to repeat."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with amazing menu, which changes seasonally I believe. I have been there multiple times for birthday events and for casual dinner and every time they deliver! Food is extremely well prepared and authentic! All the pastas are freshly prepared and the atmosphere is very rustic and chic! A bit on a pricey side, but that's Toronto for ya! Will definitely go again! :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday.. had the eggplant parmigiani.. server did not mention it being a sandwich when asked about this dish.. it was under the main dishes so I assumed it would be a main dish.. turned out to be a sandwich with unseasoned fried eggplant some bland sauce and a piece of mozzarella on it.. not worth the 18 dollars I paid for it.. my party the lamb sausage ravioli.. the sauce was watery had no consistency and it was also bland.. I do not recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"A couple of local friends led us to Mercatto. Staff was way friendly, ambiance was nice and up beat, good looking crowd (other than me of course). Not too loud! Sat at a big, rustic table in the middle of the room. Service was attentive all night.   The apps were really good! Grilled lamb ribs with a little potato salad, perfect scallops some excellent salumi and cheese were tops for me, especially the ribs ... and the scallops ... and the, well you get it.  Pasta entrees were the big hit - rabbit ragout especially. We also had a couple of bronzini, a super pork chop and two orders of the halibut. Both the halibut were bone unfortunately dry , which made me suspect they were precooked and held or rewarmed.  Overall, if I was hungry and nearby, I would definitely stop in for small plates and a negroni, or maybe a pizza or pasta. It would not be a destination for me."}
{"text":"Mercatto is simply delicious! I picked this place to meet up with a friend visiting from California, and was upfront about my choice and told her, \"hey, i never tried this place, but the website is cute, so hopefully it will be good.\" And was it ever good! The menu is a one pager with the perfect amount of choices. I would say the dishes does not appear to be out of ordinary, but what makes Mercatto special is that the food taste just simply delicious and unique.   We ordered Crostone - mozzarella di bufalo on top of calabrian bread with olive oil. The mozzarella was soo fresh it was out of this world! Definitely recommend this dish. For the main course, it was Spaghettini - standard spaghetti with assorted seafood and Funghi pizza - mushroom pizza.  The taste and  texture of the spaghetti, pizza crust, and the fresh ingredient were just amazing! My only thing was ...our server never told us about the special of the day - sardine and other dishes. It wasn't until after we ordered and took the time to look around, we saw the board listed with specials. Other than that, the service was excellent, I like how the servers are all dressed very chic, chilled, Italian cafe street way. Mmmmm... Mozzarella..."}
{"text":"Man do I love this place.  When I am at Mars I am usually there about 3 times a day.  Morning coffee and croissant, lunch, and then late afternoon coffee.  Service is great, food is awesome.  It gets slammed at lunch time so be ready for that."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was SO pleasantly surprised.  I've been here before and didn't have a good experience but they have totally redeemed themselves.  Shared a pizza (proscuitto - arugula, fior di latte, san marzano) and pasta (Garganelli -beef short rib, honey mushrooms, green onion, lemon panna fresca ) and the waiter asked if we wanted to have the portions split for us.  Um yes thank you!    The pasta was really delicious.  A very light lemony sauce and the beef was super tender.  The pizza was so good! I normally don't like prosucitto but it was perfect on the pizza with the arugula.  Though I have to say I wasn't impressed with the crust.  Ample toppings and great portion sizes all around. I could have used a bit more cheese on everything, but who doesn't haha."}
{"text":"DISCRIMINATORY MANAGING/SERVICE WARNING-OPEN LETTER  I came here for lunch on Wed., December 16th with no reservation.  The restaurant was very busy and it took approximately 15 minutes to get the host's attention to put us on the list.  The host told us it would be \"at least a 10 minute wait\" and I said that was fine.  Our party of three proceeded to wait while several other parties came in, also without reservations, who were also placed on the list.  It took much longer than 20 minutes to seat us.  There were at least four other parties, also without reservation, that were seated before mine.  In fact, my party was the LAST party to be seated.  When we were finally seated at the bench table at the front (in between two other parties that came after us but were seated before us) they proceeded to apologize profusely to the OTHER two parties and THEN serve them complimentary champagne. Absolutely no effort was made to apologize to my party even though we were seated last.  How dare restaurant staff make such blatant discrimination towards customers.  I don't know if it was one or a combination of classism, age-ism and/or racism but clearly I am upset by the way I was treated.  This is absolutely inexcusable service.  It is a shame because the food is rather good.  But such discrimination was incredibly insulting and I will let others know of my experience here.  ____  In comparison to Terroni and Libretto: Terroni has the best food Libretto has the best service/food combination Mercatto has the nicest modern/lunchtime decor, food less good than Terroni but slightly better than Libretto.  But Mercatto?  Blacklisted."}
{"text":"I like the bourbon sour :) It was my highlight. I had PROSCIUTTO pizza which was good tasting. Atmosphere was as in many Italian restaurants a bit classy and upscale."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for a small family gathering of 6. We ordered appetizers, artic char, margherita & lamb pizzas, a seafood risotto, and a duck pasta to share. Food was pretty good - it had great presentation, flavour, and textures. Service was also friendly and courteous. The loss of stars comes from the portion sizes and pricing, which was a little too expensive for what it was worth. I did not feel too full or satisfied after the meal."}
{"text":"Another shining star in my hood.  Excellent and genuine service plus delicious food.  I was hesitant to go because I have been to other Mercatto establishments and it was run like a chain.  But this place was oozing casual chic with great food.  Wine list was extensive for Italian wines but they have all good price points.  The one we had was perfect for a light meal and the server wholeheartedly agreed as he helped with that suggestion.  For starters we had fried artichokes and calamari.  What a triumph!! The artichokes were lightly battered and seasoned wonderfully with lemon zest and cloud like shavings of Parmesan and a pool of pesto cream.  As for the calamari, they were textbook perfection.  Tender.  Juicy.  Zesty.  Smoky with lots of seasonal sides, roasted tomatoes, olives and fingerling potatoes.   Afterwards,  the mains came promptly and without further ado.  My carbonara pasta was delicious and textbook good and my SO's fish special was gorgeous.  Tender flaky pieces resting on Fava beAns, asparagus and fingerling potatoes. Gorgeous and good.    Finally when dessert came I had to get the caramel coppeta.  It was inventive unctuous goodness in a small mason jar with marshmallow fluff, caramel and nuts!  Oh yeah!  Food DONE, SCARFED DOWN, finito!  But it does not end there.  Our server as we were leaving realized by visual inspection he overcharged us by $5 so without fuss he voided our cheques and started all over again.  That is genuine service.  I made a mistake but you do not worry, I got it.  A great place to get bang on food and service.  Will be back here again!!"}
{"text":"Good food, no complaints. Main fish was overcooked and dry though.  Cons: Outside seating has atrocious lighting at night (very cold blue lightning, maybe the hospital crowd is a fan...), otherwise the ambience is great, as is the setting for indoors and outdoors."}
{"text":"Don't support this restaurant!  I arrive with my mother, who is in a wheelchair, and this hipster waiter takes one look at us and asks if we wouldn't be more comfortable going somewhere else. The restaurant was half full at most!  We wait almost 20 minutes to place a drink order, and the waitress arrives smelling of marijuana and liquor.  Not surprisingly, she got our orders wrong and didn't make any effort to apologize at all.   We couldn't wait to pay our bill and leave... WE DID WAIT and when the bill came it had both the wrong orders and the corrected orders on it. I asked for the manager, and some other young waitress (not a manager) came over and scolded us, saying that our waitress had complained that we were rude and that the waiters could not get around my mother's wheelchair!  I said I would boycott the restaurant, to which she laughed and said they're \"doing fine without people like you.\"  Please don't support this establishment, and I hope this review conveys my disgust with the experience!"}
{"text":"Lovely spot for a business lunch.  Service is prompt and they get your food fast.  The food offerings are fresh and well made but they have not completely blown me over except for the delicious olive oil they serve with the bread.  Wicked good that I always walk away with a bottle.  So glad that they sell the bottles."}
{"text":"I quite liked this place. Really great setup. Good atmosphere, and cool that they write down some menu stuff (specials etc) on a gigantic piece of paper that when they are done with, can just roll up and recycle and roll down a new one.  Pizza was really great/ basic. Others in my party that got more complex pastas didn't seem to be overwhelmingly thrilled.  Price is reasonable at $16-$18 for most pasta/pizzas and service was average-good I thought. Nothing too notable either way there.  Would definitely go back! Just need to find a date to bring with me ;)"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I attended a birthday dinner here in January with 6 friends and was very impressed. The decor is very tasteful and the atmosphere ambient. We had a gorgeous rustic wooden table surrounded by wine shelves with a very unique chandelier formed out of tree branches. The staff was attentive and very helpful in recommending dishes for the special dietary needs of one guest in our party. I ordered the gnocchi and it was delicious.   I recommend Mercatto for a romantic evening for two or a nice night out with friends and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I dropped in here for a meeting and had one glass of wine. I believe it was an 8 or 9 oz portion. With tax and tip it came to just shy of $20. That's insane. $20 for a glass of 8oz wine is bonkers. No, just no. The wine itself was good, but not the best thing I've ever had. And no, it was not a reserve wine. It was a standard white wine that they served by the glass. And I know this is a somewhat fancy Italian restaurant in the MaRS building, but I still think it's way overpriced. Go somewhere else unless you had oodles of cash to blow.   Their patio is nice though so I gave it an extra star for that."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere at Mercatto's.  The open concept kitchen decorated with etch-a-sketch doodles everywhere had a playful and friendly feel.  Big chalkboards displaying the daily specials, along with a well laid out simple menu gave a pretentious free feel, which in my opinion goes a long way.  It seemed like this was the place many older folks came to after work to unwind and relax with friends.  Many tables had people just kicking back and sipping wine and shooting the shit.   Our waitress was a doll.  Very friendly and taking her time to explain the dishes, while genuinely trying to engage with us as we pondered our choices.  We allowed her to select our wines for us based on the food we were ordering and unlike other places I've been to, she didn't just pick from the top tier priced wines and surprise us with the bill.  She even brought over the bottle for us and took the extra step of writing down the info so we could purchase it at the lcbo.  Definitely didn't feel like she was just doing it to milk the tip.  Ordered the Antipasti misti for a munchies selection.  Not exactly an expert on this so all I can say is it did what an antipasti is suppose to do while tasting pretty good.  Nice selection of cheeses and the mushrooms were well seasoned and the sausages had an excellent salty, spicy kick.  For entree, we split the Diavolo pizza.  Fantastic dough, a nice consistency, texture and chew to it.  The sauce was spicy and the cheese gooey.  A sage leaf was the finishing touch to a very simple, well executed pizza.    $66 for antipasti, 3 glasses of wine, and a pizza.  Not too bad.  This is the type of place I would love to have in my neighborhood to drink some wine, eat some bread and see old friends."}
{"text":"Went to Toronto for a long weekend and stumbled upon Mercatto on the way to another restaurant! Good thing we stopped in as it was a great foodie find. Very attentive staff and cool vibe atmosphere. Had about a 15 minute wait which allowed us time to sit at the bar and enjoy some wine poured from what looked like a Euro Cave wine preservation system. Bartender was great as he let us sample until we found what we were looking for! Dinner was a treat as we started with Prosciutto with figs, and Barbabietole Arrostiti (roasted beets, oranges, red onions,and a balsamic dressing), Arugula insalate, and finished with a Homemade Gnudi (naked ravioli) and Pappardelle pasta with wild mushrooms, parmigano & truffle. Did not try a desert as we were pressed for time. The service here was great! All in all it was an enjoyable experience and we will go back if in Toronto again!"}
{"text":"Very good standard Italian... I was starving and they delivered - good beer on tap.  The place was empty on Canada day long weekend saturday night, but there was a group of ridiculously loud people (thankfully they left) - being empty the though service could have been a little snappier.  The scallops were delicious and the appetizer was well rounded out with some potatoes.  I think it's more of a lunch time hot spot."}
{"text":"It seems a trend with all the Mercatto locations, the food is awesome, the service could be better.   The place has a great trendy but non-pretentious atmosphere in the downtown core, with an average ($15-19) price point.  We came in, and the candle on the table had dripped it's wax all over the table in a big pile. I was surprised it was allowed to be there.   We got out menus, which we found out later doubled as placemats. A little strange for dinner.  But it took at least 10 mins before the waitress came to ask us for our drinks.   I found it strange that all the servers were dress in their regular clothes, and you have to second guess whether they are working there or not.  If they at least wore an apron, it would have been helpful.   The food here is always quite good.  The orrichette is my favourite, a good combo of meats and veggies.  I also had a very good carbonara, although it was a bit salty, the pasta slightly undercooked, and it got cold pretty quickly.    We had the Almond Torte for dessert, and it was very good.   I was disappointed that a restaurant of this calibre also did not serve gluten free pasta. You'd think they would have at least one type on the menu.  Food 4stars Service 3 could be better."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday.  Terrible wine selection, no sangrias and glasses are not chilled.  We had a very arrogant male waiter .  He was going and fair complexion definitely in the wrong profession.  I paid for drinks and went somewhere else for lunch."}
{"text":"Good dishes   The tuna is delicious. The tastiest main course is the braised lamb.   Fall off the bone tender. Soo good I had to suck the marrow out the bone.  The char was descent. A little burnt.  Portions are medium. The food is heavy. Lots of oil."}
{"text":"Took my mother her on Friday night to celebrate her birthday. Upon arriving the staff welcomed me and told me I could pretty much choose wherever I wanted to sit in the restaurant. They asked if I was here for a special occasion and I mentioned it was my Mum's birthday. When she arrived they greeted her and all wished her a happy birthday, which she was delighted by.  The place was surprisingly relaxed for a Friday night, but it meant that there wasn't too much noise to converse, and the staff wasn't overly busy dealing with multiple tables.  The food was absolutely incredible. Simple meals, made with fresh ingredients, perfectly cooked.  The price is also very reasonable considering the area.  All in all an excellent meal, with excellent service. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"It's not bad, not spectacular either. At the same time, you're out of luck to find anything other than a food court in the area.   I was able to make a last minute same day reservation for lunch. Recommended, as it was quite busy.   Menu is mainly pastas and pizzas, Be prepared to spend $20 for your lunch.   I usually get the Orrecheti with Rapini and Pancetta. I opted for their 'Carbonara' (which I am not sure why it's in quote. Creamy and cheesy, comes with Pancetta (but disappointed it was mostly fat, not the meat), with Brussel Sprouts.   You get bread with olive oil (no vinegar) prior to the meal, but the guy only brought it to us minutes before the meal was served.   We sat on the back couches, and not a fan that my couch made me taller than my partner sitting on the chair. It was a weird angle.   I'd come back, but sparingly. They also have panini's available for take out only."}
{"text":"Mercatto turned out better than I thought. It's a great place for a business meeting. It's all about the hustle and bustle, which I love. It's like an open kitchen with a nice long bar that stretches across it.   I went in at 12:00Noon and it was packed. I was able to get a table for two however, quite quickly. The tables were set close together but I didn't mind. It felt like cafeteria style seating, but in a fine dining way. I'm not sure how else to describe it.  The server was ultra friendly, polite and filled my water glass at least 4 times while I had my lunch. They have daily specials, soup and entree. Their regular menu had pastas, pizzas and entrees of fish, chicken and beef. I tried the prosciutto pizza and it was really good, decent for $15. My friend had the ginger and carrot soup with the sausage pizza. I liked both but mine was crunchier, his was cheesier.   Overall, I really like the atmosphere. Business meetings are great here. The windows are large and take advantage of the natural light. The place is busy so moments of awkwardness are minimal and there is always something to comment on.  This 3 star restaurant got it's fourth star for the service."}
{"text":"Hmmm.... it's mehhhh, just another restaurant in downtown. I ordered their linguine and just nothing too special. I wish that it has a stronger flavour it in. With the $ that I paid, I would rather go to Terrnoi instead.   My company did a catering (we ordered their sandwiches & salad) and their customer service was HORRIBLE. Instead of delivering the food to our floor, they delivered the food to another floor in our building (not even our company). The guy who worked on the other floor had to come up to our floor and told us about it. Then I have to go all the way down to the lobby and saw the delivery girl sitting there with our food.... I was just super confused."}
{"text":"was there for lunch today and the thing that impressed me the most was the coffee LOL  I had a cappuccino and it was sooo smooth and so good.   I remember thinking that when Starbucks first arrived in Canada...but it's not as good now. Anyways the rest was good too.  Linguine with seafood, fennel/apple/celeriac soup, pasta with sausage, rapini and something else I can't remember.  It was lovely.  A bit noisy and you're sitting very close together.   I like that the water you get is already filtered. ...This is the second place I've been to and I am liking this trend!!!    Nice to go back for a treat. Not usually the price I range I venture to too often. Bill was $67 for the 2 of us.  I gotta make more money so I can do this more often! LOL"}
{"text":"Consistently great food, extensive wine selection, changing menu, nice ambience at reasonable prices. I've tried two of their locations downtown multiple times for both dinners and corporate events and both have been superb!"}
{"text":"What a lovely little restaurant !  My pal and I were downtown so we decided to have dinner before going back to my place in Midtown. As it was early (5:00), we were able to get a table without a reservation. There were a lot of children here so this was a sign that menu offerings would suit all taste buds.   The wine menu here is extensive. I was actually overwhelmed as there was so much to choose from. Service was excellent; our server knew the menu well and gave us a lot of suggestions on wines to go with our dinner choices. Price wise, it's not a cheap eat, but it's also not ridiculously expensive. This is a great place for dinner - I see a lot of my friends liking it for a girls dinner. Can't wait to return.  Good for: groups, Italian, dinner"}
{"text":"the mercatto chain is always consistant!!! good food for a reasoable price... much prefer it over terroni... less attitude and more willingness to please... had the magheritta pizza, scallops, clams and fritto misto.... all in for less than $70!!!"}
{"text":"My least favorite location so far.   The waitress was friendly enough, but there was no bread, no drink service, no checking up on us, and the pastas we ordered were very bland. The mushroom risotto couldn't be saved even with a unhealthy helping of parmesan.  Pappardalle was small plated and only so so.   Shame."}
{"text":"Came here for a large group lunch before and tonight for a more intimate dinner. It is located within the MaRS building with an entrance on the inside, so it's super convenient for researchers to come by for a more formal/business meeting kind of meal. They have the same menu options and prices as the Mercatto on Toronto St. The salads at both sites tend to be small (appetizer size), but you could ask them to double the size. The pizzas are fairly large and impressive looking, so would recommend! The vegetarian risotto is also very creamy, flavorful, and yummy - would also recommend! If you're vegan you can ask them to remove the cheese from almost any of the salad options. Soft, fresh complimentary bread + EVOO/BV comes with the meal. They also have a pretty decent dessert menu (try the tiramisu - comes in a small mason jar and the mascarpone actually tastes like mascarpone).  The venue is spacious; though I've never had to eat here when it's super packed, aka peak lunchtime hours. Make sure to make a reservation if you are coming with a big group during lunchtime. There is also outdoors seating in the summer. Service is friendly, but can be too slow. Had to remind the servers multiple times to take our orders, fill our water glasses, please bring the bread, etc.   A large drink selection and bar are also available."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here. The service was very good and the price was very reasonable. I had a starter and a pasta, both of which I enjoyed.  The starter soup (Tuscan bean & ham) was a delicious bean puree soup I would have again.  The linguine pasta was a pleasantly light seafood, tomato, fennel and basil dish.  I believe my food came in at less than $30 which would be impossible to get in Vancouver at that price.  I walked away quite satisfied. I will definitely be back to explore the menu a little more. This place has casual, weeknight date written all over it."}
{"text":"This modern Italian resto is a true gem. Its decor is elegant and minimalistic, making the room feel spacious yet warm and cozy. There is an abundance of natural wood and stone, chalkboard with daily specials, part open concept kitchen - all adding to the authenticity of experience that builds, of course most importantly, on fantastic menu. The dishes I've tried here are delicious and elegantly made with freshest ingredients. They have a touch of innovation while using the best of tradition resulting in unique, genuinely good meal. All servers I encountered in my many visits here are laid back, knowledgeable and helpful. Bonus for a hard liqueur connoisseur - they have large selection of fine grappa.   I introduced many people to this place most of whom were very impressed, and it continues to be one of my favorites. Really surprised no one has reviewed it until now. The only thing I would ask of the owners is to bring back the pine seed cake they used to have and stopped making for whatever reason."}
{"text":"My brother and I stopped in here for a Monday night when we were visiting Toronto a few weeks back. It was a very nice atmosphere (although quite drafty by the windows). They had a great selection of wines although I didn't try any. I got the gonococci in a lamb red sauce which was fantastic. Seriously, the gonococci were cooked perfectly and the lamb sauce had great flavours.  One downside was the waitress seemed pretty curt and didn't come by often. Price is a little up there but given the quality of the food, not a bad deal."}
{"text":"Sometimes I wish this was a 10-star scoring system and not 5-star.  I've been contemplating this review for a couple of days.  Is it a 3?  is it a 4?  Tough call.    I met my friend here for dinner on a Wednesday evening.  First, the restaurant is seriously beautiful.  The wood, the marble, the small decor details.  I want my dining room at home to look like this.  Enter my first complaint: why are the tables so close together?  I really dislike that.  I like my own space, and don't want to stick my rear in someone's face as I'm getting in and out of my spot.   Second complaint (and probably the reason I chose 3 stars and not 4) - wine list consists of 3oz or 5oz pours.  What?  What is that?  And how are you going to charge $18 (for example) for a 5oz pour?  Not happy.  Annoying wine lists are the worst.  On to the food.  For apps, we split the beet and burrata salad and veal cheek risotto (feature).  The salad was very tasty, even though I'm not a huge beet fan.  The risotto was lovely and I enjoyed the crushed nuts on top.    For mains, my friend ordered the pancetta pizza.  I have pizza fatigue.  This city is full of the same, boring thin crust pizzas.  She enjoyed it, fwiw.  I ordered the carbonara pasta, which is hard to say no to when I see it on a menu.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was delicious.  The pancetta?  Practically raw.  I didn't send it back b/c well, I was hungry.  Instead, I am complaining about it here. I just don't understand how a restaurant, with experience in the kitchen, turning our great food, can overlook this most important detail.  So, for that (and the stupid wine list), I think this place is about a 3.  The food is solid (for the most part) and the room is gorgeous, so I don't think it's a bad place to end up.  But with so many restaurants in this city, I probably wouldn't race back to Mercatto."}
{"text":"I'm always rolling by here and never really had a chance to walk in.   Lunch today was pretty superb. No wait which was a bonus. The crowd was mostly geek researchers looking for a great reason to expense a meal that they can tack onto the grant budget. (Dude, I know how that \"research\" game works).   The decor is beautiful, high ceilings, open kitchen, spacious table arrangements. The menu is a slightly pricey, everything is made well and with decent portions. The orecchiette with rapini and sausage was slightly dry but hearty. The pappardelle was al dente with a good balance of mushrooms but a little heavy on the truffle oil.  Overall, just a great \"space\" to catch a quick bite. The patio in the summer months would likely be even better. They have a steady business just being adjacent to the research complex and hospitals which might explain the \"complex\" issues in other posts.   Overall, the food is almost as good as terroni's, a nice mid-range Italian resto with the dressings to match."}
{"text":"For those who have been to the Mercatto on Bay St, this one has a considerably different feel.  I've been to both at lunch, and while the Bay location seems rushed, cramped, and noisy, this location on Toronto street is a bit more open, airy, and relaxed.  Despite the more relaxed feel, it's still very possible to be in and out in well under an hour during the week.  The menus is similar (or the same?) between the two locations - a solid selection of largely pasta and paninis.  The food has always been quite good here despite the relatively low price point.  I'll usually end up with the daily panini special if I'm there for lunch, and have never been disappointed.  Service was good, but not outstanding.  Servers exude a slight hipster vibe, but not nearly as much as the nearby Terroni servers who might as well be in an American Apparel ad.  Overall quite good - will definitely be a mainstay."}
{"text":"Awesome! Sat out on the patio on a hot evening, under the trees - no bugs, perfect skies, A+ service & delicious food! My 1 & only suggestion would be to increase the portion of the cheese board & if there are 5 people ordering, just throw in a fifth crostini (a matter of cents) - or tell us it's just for 4 to share. Anyway - not a big deal but I'm a cheese lover so...... I got prosciutto pizza which was spot on - sidekick got the duck pappardelle, omg awesome & everyone else was happy too.  Mostly it's top points for atmosphere & service - food gets a solid 8.  Will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"Think of Mercatto as a place where you can take a HALF time break from all the retail therapy  you're experiencing at the Eaton Center.  The rustic Italian restaurant is known for its pizza, presentation, and service.  Though there's another location just south of here at Bay and Richmond this venue is a lot larger, with two floors.   My friend and I decided to order two pizzas, their Margherita, and Proscuitto.  Both dishes came out without delays, and presentation was quite magnificent.  The thin crust/ gourmet pizzas were both a delight. Our server was very helpful and provided us some recommendations however next time I may consider them since the table beside us ordered them lol... and it looked delish!  I'd definitely be back to try their pastas and take it from there ;)"}
{"text":"Mercatto was on my go to restaurant list when I first moved back to Toronto but it quickly slipped off my radar with lots of.inconsistent reviews and lots of new restaurants popping up left right and centre.  I finally decided to give it a try w. A girlfriend on a Thrusday evening. We have similar tastes and both fancied the mushroom risotto and pappardelle...and so we decided to share.  To my surprise, I liked the noodles better than the rice.... One major factor was food temperature. The risotto must've finished first that by the time it made it to our table, the dish was only warm and that was the first dish we dug into. I felt it was oversalted and while it was still tasty, I was drawn to the pasta... And meat which I usually pass up on.  Service was courteous and patient... Although there was no cocktail list, which I found odd, the custom made bourbon sour was made just the way I liked it.  Right in the heart of TO, this is a convenient place to bring people together and have a tasty meal."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good service and great place to take a client. We got the eggplant parmegiano which tasted great.   Only drawback: The tables are a little close so probably not a good idea to discuss anything confidential."}
{"text":"Working downtown in the MaRS district, this was my go to place for lunch. They have a sidebar which is fast, good, and affordable. I've sat down before at the restaurant too for a team lunch, and their service was preety good. I wouls recommend their sidebar tho!"}
{"text":"Very busy but patrons are happy to accommodate.  Their pasta dishes and pizzas are all delicious. Great value and quality.  A go to place for an authentic Italian pizza."}
{"text":"The 2 stars are really just for the service.  Came here for a GNO but we all disliked the food that we've ordered. We heard good things about Mercatto's pastas. Maybe the hype was too high? We were all very disappointed in the quality of food that we've had.  I ordered the: CHITARRA ALLA CARBONARA  (pancetta, black pepper, egg, pecorino)  The display was cute! But it was very very salty :("}
{"text":"Both times I've been here it was for a birthday dinner so the table was about a dozen people deep, which makes the evening a lot more fun. And the restaurant is so spacious (with very high ceilings) that they can comfortably accommodate large parties.  Anyway, the best thing about this place is the food. It's downright incredible. The last time I went they had an antipasti special where you get two verdure, two meats and two cheeses for 15 bucks! Definitely an awesome deal to split with a friend. First time I came here I ordered the ravioli and it was fantastic. This time around I ordered the tagliatelle (almond pesto) and it was delicious. My friend let me taste some of her lamb, which melted in my mouth.  Atmosphere is nice. Both times I've been there it was at night in the winter so I can only imagine who chaotic this place is on a summer afternoon. Staff was great (girl even took my coat at the door) but with it being a large group they might have been laying the service on extra thick. Great place for a romantic date!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. Great food and service but one of the features I like most is the \"free\" sparkling water :-)"}
{"text":"Great spot for affordable and quick lunch. We had the pear and arugula salad with pine nuts and parmesan cheese along with the pancetta pizza. Both were delicious and affordable at lunch time."}
{"text":"Server was snooty and the food was average. We were a large group (16) so the 18% gratuity is automatic which might explain the attitude -- why work for it if you don't have to right. Not impressed at all. If you are going to make your customers ask for bread and have an attitude the food better be pretty damn good and it wasn't. The salad was VERY vinegary according to everyone who ordered it, the portions, on the small side; the minuscule portion of perch I was served, was dry and the entire dish was salty, one of my dining companions ordered the ravioli and was hunting for the stuffed ones. A few of us were so turned off that we didn't order dessert and who doesn't love dessert. Not once did the server come by to ask if we needed anything like parmesan for pasta or salt or pepper for the vinegary salad. Is your food ok? Oh wait... couldn't give a rat's ass so I won't ask. Horrible service. The cherry on the cake --  all the bills were mixed-up at the end of the night. Good thing it was all friends and family and we didn't mind paying for each others food. Get your act together man!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for the portion size and quality, not bad but not amazing, nice ambiance, good location but could be better. 4 stars If appropriately priced 5 if the food was better"}
{"text":"Cosy and Nice place to have dinner in a warm atmosphere. Enjoyed the place and good food as well. Good service. We liked it"}
{"text":"A very tasty and pleasant dinner with friends.  Excellent, attentive service. There were five of us and we shared plates, as usual with dinner companions for me.  We started with the beet salad, rice balls, and octopus salad.  All flavourful and well composed.   Entrees were the beef short rib pappardelle (rich and tasty) and the special of the night, fettuccine with halibut cheek, olives, capers, anchovies, and tomato sauce. Basically a delightful twist on your typical puttanesca. It was fantastic.  Strong and well combined flavours. A good Sardinian red accompanied the meal.   We finished with a selection of three gelato, the chocolate banana pudding ( unbelievable) and salted caramel sundae.  It was a relaxing meal, well served, and artfully prepared.  We have previously dined at the other location and we're pleased that this one was a good match.   Please note that the restaurant is in the MaRS building and there is no external signage."}
{"text":"Very happy every time I visit.  It's a great place for a note formal setting in the area which can suffice for business meetings, work lunches etc.  My usual is the pappardelle but I have now taken a looking to the thin crust pizzas. Very generous portions for the pizza without a doubt. Coffee is also quite spectacular. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to meet for lunch. Mercator specializes in pizzas, pastas and salads. On a recent visit I had a delicious margherita pizza that had the yummiest crust. Prior to the pizza I had a broccoli soup that managed to be both light (no cream) and delicious (it didn't taste watery!!)  At lunch they have an area where you can pick up to-go items if you want to grab something to take back to work or to an outside patio.  Reservations are advisable at lunch. Tables do turn rather quickly, yet you may wait a while without a reservation."}
{"text":"Initially, I tried the Mercatto at the MaRS building located at College. The service was superb. My friend ordered the papadelle and I ordered the cavatelli. We weren't very impressed by the pasta. However, the dessert was to die for. if you have the chance to try their ricotta cheesecake with raspberry coulis -- it's a must have!  Today, I went to the Mercatto located at King St. The ambiance was much nicer as it wasn't filled with people rushing for lunch. My friend had the tagliatelle and I had the orecchiette. The orecchiette was very different from my usual tomato/white sauce pastas, but it was delicious. My friend's almond pesto sauce was absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"i'm giving a one star because that's the lowest you can give on yelp. Wow this experience, not only were my friend and I ignored but we were forced to leave and given our food to \"take out\" because the store was busy and we were denied to sit down at 11am when there were only two other tables taken, we hadn't been welcomed by ANYONE and both were approached when alone that we had to leave, and not only that but I received a VERY small FROZEN pizza and was charged $10.16. Me and my friend will be telling all of our co-workers and friends to NEVER come to this location again, horrible horrible experience"}
{"text":"Mercatto has always been my go-to place when it comes to pasta craving. Nice ambiance, great service and lovely affordable tasty food. I have been to this specific location (Toronto street) probably over 15 times and have recommended it to many people, brought friends there, hosted staff party there and they all loved it. They change their menu often. I wish they have kept their pan seared trout dish and their simple tomato sauce pasta FOREVER on their menu. Their arincini is also a must! Love the place, but have been disappointed taste-wise a few time since their manager, Jonathan have left. Mercatto is one of my favourite restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Great spot - always busy so good to reserve in advance. Wanted to try it out so decided to go there for a business lunch. Today I ordered the Seafood linguini in red sauce. Portions are good and the pasta was done right. I asked them to sub more scallops for mussels and they happily did that. My colleague ordered the special of the day - salmon with veggies and she liked it too. We ended with their famous tiramisu, which we shared, and loved that! Only downside is it's a bit on the expensive side - we paid ~75 without any drinks. And they charge for water!! Like what? :| Reserve for special occasions."}
{"text":"We came in here late one night during the week. I think we ended up here because I had a craving for arancini, and I really couldn't get it out of my head (weird...I know). So we went here. So we shared arancini and a margherita pizza. Foodwise, I think it's OK, but nothing super memorable. Price wise it could be a little cheaper, but I guess it's reasonable given what other places charge."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! The food is absolutely delicious, full of flavour and definitely the best ravioli I've tried to date. Our group shared the appetizer with cheese and cured meats. I ordered ravioli, so delicious!! I couldn't stop talking about it for days. The portions are on the smaller side, compared to other Italian restaurants, yet even still, I was left with a feeling of satisfaction and a desire to order other dishes ( appetizer, and dessert).   Service was excellent , even during a busy  Friday night.   Definitely will come here again and bring my friends to try it!"}
{"text":"This place is very yum! If you go here try the fried risotto balls (there are three) and they are amazing! We shared the fried calamari as well but I have had better. My choice of dinner was the fungi pizza. It was meh... I found it to be a little heavy; it seemed to have too much weight to pick up and too thin and slimy to cut. The service was amazing though and the wine was fabulous."}
{"text":"I was here for a birthday dinner and was pleasantly surprised. The service was great and our server was very friendly. They handled our group of 20 very well,  everyone got their food on time and even managed separate cheques. The food was excellent and everyone seemed to like it. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"We walked about 30 minutes to find this restaurant even though we were 15 minutes away from the restaurant.  It is tucked away on a small side street.  Walking up to the outside of Mercatto, you would think this is a super expensive restaurant because it has the look of an upscale restaurant.  Walk in, and it still has this look, but the ambiance is warm and welcoming.  Immediately, you are greeted by the hostess who offers to hang your coat. (even though my husband was wearing a hoodie).  This place is popular and they asked if we had a reservation.  Being from out of town, we did not have one so instead of waiting an hour and half, the four of us sat at the bar.    All I could do was stare at the wonderful decorations, black framed chalk boards with writing all over, the outline of italy, a bar that has small wine fridges that you push the button and wine automatically comes out!!  Also, a stainless steel coffee machine that is spotless, the chefs in the back making the food; tables with menus and candles...  Onto the food, we all ordered something different.  What caught my husband's eye was gnocchi with RABBIT!  I was a little creeped out about trying this, but it was the best dish that we ordered!  The gnocchi melted in your mouth and the rabbit was a creamy compliment to the pasta.  I got prosciutto, mozzarella, arugula pizza, the best bang for your buck...It tasted so fresh and delicious!  Other dishes ordered were pesto pasta and sausage, pepperoni pasta.  The bread was fresh and soft!  The staff was extremely friendly.  The bartender chatted with us and it was revealed that we were from San Francisco.  The manager came up to us and introduced himeself, shook each of our hands and invited us back to the restaurant.  My husband joked, \"Next time, the meal is free, right?\"  John (the manager) joked, \"We will see what we can do.\"   In sum, this is a must-eat!"}
{"text":"Love their chocolate pudding. I have tried their pastas twice now and they do a really good job. I got a fettuccini with basil cream, asparagus and beans and it was delicious. I like the ambience of this place as well. Went there on a Friday and  surprisingly there weren't a lot of people there. Would still love to go back and this time try their pizzas"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch. Prior to this lunch visit I had only been here for really good breakfast time cappuccinos. Anyway, we walked in and were seated. Everyone was really nice.  What we wanted was a quick inexpensive lunch. After looking at the board ( takeout board) we felt it would fit our needs. But when we sat down the menu was much more expensive and we felt it was a little much for us.   The waitress, when we told her, that we just want to get the takeout menu was very nice and said no trouble at all.   We had a delicious chicken sandwich and a really great mushroom broth soup.   Will come back again.   For those dropping by, the place is a little more formal work casual and the take out counter can get a little crowded but it is worth it. The takeout chef was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Cheers! Welcome to my review of Mercatto. You must first appreciate that this crowd, on average, is young. I would say between 18-25 years old. Its also a casual scene often consisting of young families and their children.  The restaurant tries hard, but never delivered up to its potential. Then again, at these very reasonable price points, perhaps one's expectations should be quite low.  My dinner consisted of:  Drink - Ferragamo. This $14 gin martini had infused basil. They tried hard to make something different, but it wasn't well mixed and almost swampy. They said it was new for the night and I got that sense as well from how little they knew about the nuances of the drink.  Appy - Gamberi Diavolo - This spicy shrimp, tomato and avocado dish completely failed. There was just no taste, it was mushy and had no seasoning. It read well, but please do not order this.  Main - Funghi Pizza - A pizza consisting of oyster mushrooms, taleggio, mozzarella and white truffle oil was presented warm on a thin crust. It was a nice size and seemed fresh. It just lacked the zip and tastiness that is required to generate rave reviews. The blend of ingredients was bland and the white truffle oil was not well represented. I would  hesitate in ordering this again.  In any event, yes it is a reasonably priced dinner although these three items totaled more than $40 before tip. I would hesitate in recommending this place for you. I am sorry.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wow-- went here for a business lunch-- not only was the service quick, efficient, and friendly, but the food was great-- had the fish special, which was cooked perfectly throughout, with crispy skin.  Best piece of fish I can remember eating in recent memory!"}
{"text":"An actual conversation that took place inside Mercatto:  Boyfriend: Do you want to try the mushroom papperadelle? Me: Sure, let's switch plates. [Eating quietly] It tastes ... familiar. I can't quite place it. Boyfriend: What? What does it taste like? Me: [Silence. Deep in thought.] Holy shit! It takes like, like ... [Whispering] Hamburger Helper! Boyfriend: What? Let me try that. [Munching quietly, a pause] Huh, it does. Wait, let me try it again. [Takes another bite] Waitress: [Suddenly approaches] How's everything tonight? Boyfriend: [Awkwardly] Fantastic! Me: [Fake smile] Oh yeah, great!  Note: This version of papperadelle is no longer available!"}
{"text":"Good price, good food, great service. Slightly expensive wines 5 star service 4 star food- Good taste. OK portions 3 star price of food 2 star price of booze 4 star quality of booze"}
{"text":"Mercatto is a favourite of mine. I originally found this restaurant when a friend made a reservation here for a birthday dinner. Since then, I have come back several times, and I've been to all their locations in Toronto. The food has been consistently good, and service is always prompt.   Mercatto is the type of restaurant that makes everything taste delicious while keeping their dishes fairly simple. There are no overpowering tastes and the herbs and spices really stand out to compliment the dish. My go-to dish, for example is the orecchiette, where the rapini and sausage just go SO WELL with it!  The only downside of this restaurant is portion and price. Everytime I come here, the portions are not filling enough for any of the guests. Now this is a good thing if you want to try appetizers (which are amazing), but not so great if you're on a budget as the entrees themselves aren't exactly cheap.  AS well, I once made a reservation for my boyfriend's birthday here and they were very accommodating by letting me bring my own cake that I customized ahead of time. However, please note that they do charge a plating fee per person. But doing it this way, they will cut the cake and provide utensils, etc.   Overall, Mercatto is a GREAT, classy restaurant for Italian food. But I am still on the hunt for an Italian restaurant whose food I really feel is worth the price and whose entrees alone would be filling."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious meats and cheeses. In fact, they are so good...you end up wishing there was more :( Definitely pricey for what you get, but so good."}
{"text":"Mercatto has pretty much plummeted in my eyes.  I considered a 2 star, but it's not quite that bad.  I've had a couple of dinners there since my previous reviews and my usual feeling leaving is one of disappointment.  The most recent visit was for a friend's birthday.  I had the half Cornish hen which was served with cauliflower and spinach.  It basically tasted like chicken in gravy with a measly portion of veg.  I was still hungry after it and it was not in any way special.   The friend across from me got butternut squash pizza which was tasty but cold.  The still lovely staff presented the birthday girl with a chocolate mousse thing as a cake substitute at the end which was OK.  The desserts in general were underwhelming.  In general people I talked to afterwards were not impressed and thought it was overpriced with mediocre food.  I don't know if some of this relates to Rob Rossi's departure as executive chef, but I think it will be reserved for wine and cheese nights for me from now on."}
{"text":"Quite enjoyed the food, ambience, music, & service. I went on a Saturday evening & was surprised by how few people were there; however, there was a snowstorm that may have affected attendance.  I began with a plate of 3 salumi meats. They were freshly shaved and yummy. Came with aniseed pretzels.  Then, for mains, I had pasta with chunks of unsmoked bacon, with a gorgeous tomato-based sauce. Pasta was delightfully al dente.   Bread was served, with delish olive oil for dipping. An order of olives came toasty-warm and melt-in-your-mouth.   I didn't bother with dessert or drinks.  Total bill, $36  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch and it was packed! Shared the pancetta pizza and the duck ragu with my friend and both were yummy. It made for a great meal but was not breathtakingly good. I would eat the ragu again, even if it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. My friend and I agreed it was a very nice, light pasta witch was a refreshing change. The pizza was nothing special IMO. Still, I could see myself coming back here for lunch another time, even if I'll try somewhere else for an Italian dinner."}
{"text":"Went there during business lunch hours. Proper Italian food, proper wines, and proper coffee. Those guys know how to run a restaurant. The vibe both inside and on the patio is pretty relaxed too.  And honestly pretty fair price for Toronto for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided we would enjoy dinner at a nice restaurant before we went to a show at Massey Hall. We looked around at a few restaurants but ultimately decided on Mercatto as it had decent reviews and seemed to have the atmosphere we were looking for.  Right away we both noticed the music, nice relaxing deep house tunes that we know and love which is great. I'd say we picked the perfect restaurant for a date night.   I ordered the cheese board and we both really loved it. It comes with some crusty bread, some cinnamon clusters, and honey. When you mix them all together with the cheese, it is wonderful.  I ordered the ravioli and my boyfriend got the duck breast special. He said it was the best meal he has ever had at a restaurant. My ravioli was good but I would probably order something else next time.   We shared some gelato for desert. The flavours were caramel, chocolate hazelnut, and pomegranate. They were wonderful and the biscotti on top was great too.  We had a very nice time here and we will gladly recommend it to anyone looking for a laid back, yet romantic date while in downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"Very, very good coffee. Great pasta. A little pricy, but worth it."}
{"text":"Location wise, this is a great business spot for lunch.  Food wise, it's not amazing.  Ambience wise, this is better than the other Mercatto's."}
{"text":"Out of all the Mercatto's, this is the one that you want to bring a larger group to.  It's nice as being part of the Mars building, but other than that, the food is just ok."}
{"text":"So I went to visit my cousin at work in the hospital that this restaurant is attached to. It was during her lunch break, and I have to say this place was super cute. I truly enjoy the atmosphere for a restaurant in a hospital.  I live for cute moments like the one I had with my cousins. I loved that the menu wasn't overwhelming with options, I mean it is Italian and of course so many choices of pasta but not much other choice other than pasta and pizza and that was great, it made it easy for me to choose what I wanted.  The decorations and the ambiance truly set a mood, it brought me back to Italy 2013, When I ate Patio side at the cute restaurant by the bus station. Such a nostalgic feeling.   I ordered the rigatoni with the pork belly, and I was so glad to have chosen that entree, so satisfying, the acidity from the tomato sauce played so well with the sweet and salty taste of the pork belly. truly a great dish.  My biggest concern however was the lack of service. our waitress was adorable and she was so nice, but it took us about 25 minutes before she came to take our orders. I mean this was a lunch break during work hours, so we were a bit tense, but I think if we had more time it would have been fine and we probably wouldn't have even noticed that she took 25 minutes before checking if we were ready. For the last ten minutes of waiting we literally put all the menus to the side to hopefully catch her attention to show we were done and ready to order, didn't work to well, she walked by us like three times and we even tried waving her down.  It was definitely a busy a day, so I can't be to upset, but just a fair warning, do not go here if your on a time crunch."}
{"text":"friendly service. good selection of inexpensive, well-made italian food. i mean what more could anybody ask for?"}
{"text":"My coworker and I came to Mercatto for dinner one evening; I hadn't eaten at any of the Mercatto chains besides the one in the Eaton Centre, so I was eager to try this location out.  We arrived quite early for dinner, probably around 5PM and the place was very very quiet. We perused the menu and I was a bit surprised by how small the menu was and how heavy a lot of the dishes seemed. I don't go to places like this for pizza or steak, so it took me a while to decide.  We both started off with cocktails and sadly, all of the cocktails I tried were disappointing. I had hoped for more variety in their cocktail menu, but they seemed to have just a handful of mixed drinks to choose from, many having components that weren't to my taste. I had some kind of lemon beverage, which was okay, but neither of us were enthralled with the cocktails here.  We ended up splitting the barbabietole arrostiti (beets, burrata cheese, arugula, almonds and balsamic) and the arancini to start. Both were absolutely excellent, the beets and burrata were a fantastically creamy sweet combo set off by the balsamic and the peppery arugula. The arancini here were delicious as well, we cleaned both plates without any issue.  For my main, I ended up going for the ravioli that were lemon ricotta filled, with lamb sausage and beets in brown butter. Unfortunately, this dish just didn't do it for me. These were homemade ravioli but there was far too much excess pasta outside of the stuffed portion. There was no cut, it was as if they used plain pasta sheets and just stuck them together, leaving all the excess pasta sheets to just hang on to the small ravioli bundle. I didn't like the pasta they chose to use, maybe it was slightly overcooked, but the texture and shape of them just didn't appeal. I felt like there wasn't enough filling given the size of the ravioli and the lamb sausage felt like an afterthought.  I didn't get the concept behind the flavors coming together in this dish, it felt disjointed. My coworker had the mushroom ravioli and I got to try a bit and it was delicious.  Overall, an okay meal but there's lots of room for improvement. As someone with an Italian background, I expect a lot from pasta dishes from places like this and my main just fell short. Despite the apps being great, the drinks were meh and my main wasn't very good. I may try it again in the future, but I'd definitely go for something else."}
{"text":"The situation: a casual dinner before a show at EnWave.  I am a picky eater, and I want beer, not wine.  I also don't want to go anywhere elbow-to-elbow busy and at 6pm on a Friday this place let me have my pick of seating and I definitely didn't need that reservation.  The good: - Good selection of salami for the create-your-own antipasti board. - Roasted winter squash was a winner even with the 'I hate vegetables' me. - Really liked the laid back ambiance.  It's a nice place, but it's not too nice.   - Huge Italian wine list. - Really reasonably priced. - Good staff.  The bad: - Only 3 beers on draught. - I don't really like thin crust pizza.  This thin crust pizza was good for thin crust pizza, but again, I don't like thin crust pizza.  The verdict: I would definitely come here again.  It's close to downtown.  It's not busy on weekend nights.  I bet it's rammed for lunch M-F and I wouldn't go near it during those times."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a few friends. Not a good experience. I had the pizza, but the crust was burnt. In the end, I saw that they had included an 18% tip in the check. When I asked for the reason, the waitress told me it is because we were a \"party\" and we have to pay 18% in tip. I don't understand how it is related. Funny thing is, they also had an option for extra tip. Are you kidding me!!!"}
{"text":"The food is average. The pizza had a crust that was super thin and soggy. The toppings were scarce. The flavour was there but barely since they appeared to skimp on the unevenly distributed toppings.   I asked the server to recommend a wine and he picked one out. I said i would get that. It was a $10 glass. It turns out they charged me for a $17 glass of wine and unfortunately I only realized this on the drive home. I looked it up on their menu online and indeed the wine is on their (outdated but comparable) wine list online and it's $10.   The feeling of being ripped off after consuming soggy mediocre pizza left a bad impression. Maybe if the wine and pizza were amazing I wouldn't feel so gypped.   It's too bad because this is a nice-looking restaurant. If only they didn't make costly errors like that. It left a bad impression. I can't say I am in any hurry to return. I will definitely be more careful to review the itemized receipts at restaurants from now on..."}
{"text":"This restaurant has everything going for me.   I came here a few hours early for a meeting and ended up working on my laptop while sipping on their lattes. I really like the layout of the restaurant. It certainly isn't as glam as their sister store Taverna Mercatto on York Street, but it is still really cozy and comfortable, especially during dinner time. The vibe you get here is really different from Bay or York St as well. Most patrons work at the MaRS building or U of T, so many have notebooks or laptops out for meetings.  I personally find that this Mercatto is a lot more laid back than its counterparts.   Unfortunately, for some odd reason the couches seemed kind of worn out, with the fabric flaying on the ends. It was kind of uncomfortable to look at.   I became way too hungry viewing other people's dishes, so ended up ordering their seafood linguini, which I am happy to say is extremely delicious. This is the first time I've had spicey pescatore linguini. Despite having a low tolerance for spice, I thoroughly enjoyed the dish. It was so appetizing. I also tried their frutti di mare dish, which was very fresh and seasoned perfectly.  After this dining experience, I vote Mercatto on college as the best of the sister stores. Bay St is way too sassy, the crowd is annoying and the layout is not as nice. York St is great if you live downtown but it's always packed with obnoxious tourists from the games. College St has an amazing atmosphere, laid back crowd, extremely friendly manager (shout out to Jordan, if you are reading this) and excellent food."}
{"text":"Decor: 4 Service:3.5 Food:3.5  We made reservation for 12pm the day of and managed to get a table.  The restaurant was clean with a very high ceiling.  We sat down and quickly ordered the grilled calamari as a starter while we decided on our main.  Ordering took only 2 secs but the food didn't arrive till 20 mins later.  The portions were small but quite tasty.  There were only 3 small pieces of calamari with tons of olives.  I would have enjoyed it more if we had enough to split between the 4 of us.    The waiter was busy serving the other 6 tables which made it hard to catch his attention, but overall this restaurant is worth another try."}
{"text":"Was kind of nervous when (on a Saturday night) it looked like the only people in here were staff, but had a great time.  Service throughout the night was great, and it was a large enough place that you felt like you were the only people in there.  Could use touching up here and there (some of the seat cushions were taped together), but overall was very clean and classy atmosphere.  The food was where this place shined though! Our salad appetizer and pizza were delicious.  Dessert was especially amazing, I had the tiramisu and was thoroughly impressed (if you like the taste of coffee/espresso, you'll definitely love it).  Also was pleasantly surprised at the bill too, very reasonable.   Beautiful looking patio seating/area, but unfortunately it was raining when we went."}
{"text":"Nice looking restaurant but the experience was simply....meh. It was Valentines Day so I understand they were busy but the tried to sit us at a table for two that looked like it had been added to the floor for the extra traffic. Finally they moved us to another table and the manager brought us some Champagne which was a nice gesture. The starters were by far the best part of the night. The carpaccio and grilled calamari were perfect. Unfortunately my seafood risotto was lacking in seafood and heavily salted. My girlfriends carbonara was super salty which overpowered the dish. Disappointing for sure. Our server was nice but not overly chatty. I question why I leave tips sometimes. People should actually have to work for them. Instead we feel obligated to give them. I digress.... Desert was tasty! I had the Chocolatto and my girlfriend had the cannoli. Not a horrible experience by any means but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"i only and always take the handmade ravioli, stuffed with ricotta... and will never try anything else! ravioli are so good, sauce is so good! staff is ok, asking a lot of time if everything is fine, although not always filling for water  the place is really functional and full of workers, researchers, admins from the mars building. not the ideal place for fun or intimacy, but still, a pretty decent place"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but they really shine when they make an Americano. So good!  Plus the morning staff are always a pleasure to talk to."}
{"text":"Really like this place.  They have terrific thin crust pizza at a reasonable price and a decent portion size.  There is very limited seating in this place, which makes the wait for your order to be taken a bit longer than some of the finer restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I've visited this Mercatto about five or six times; while my experiences with the food have ranged marginally in quality, the service, ambience, and general quality of the experience have been reliably good.     The meat and cheese boards are mix-and-match, feature lots of Canadian selections, and have never disappointed.  The fresh pasta dishes are the standout for me --goat-cheese ravioli, spicy tagliatelle, etc.  Their specials can be worth the gamble--a fried sardine appetizer was a memorable addition to a meal a few months ago.  I've never had even questionable service at this location.  A complaint about a too-charred pizza yielded a comped entree, and free desserts with wine--pretty generous for a non-dire complaint.  It's also got a significant dining room, so getting a table has rarely been a dinnertime issue.    Overall, Mercatto is far from being a runaway mouth adventure, but it's consistently good.  I think it's wise to value the \"nice dependable guys\" of the restaurant world lest we find ourselves stuck at home whining about why all those exciting rebel restaurants never take our reservations anymore."}
{"text":"I ordered the linguine and found it a bit spicy and I was not too fond of the tomato lumps in the sauce. HowI did really like the layout and design of the restaurant and I would probably go back to try out a different"}
{"text":"This place is a joke what italian restaurant doesn't have chicken to replace/add to your dish ???  Prices are also on the expensive side and my experience was horrible . I wanted spaghetti but wanted to replace the meatballs with a chicken breast their answer was we can't do that we don't have chicken if u want chicken u have to get a different dish to which I said so u do have chicken you just don't want to replace it for me she didn't know what to say ."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food! Most dishes are authentic. Prices on par with Terroni's, i.e. a bit pricey ($15 - $30 / person) but worth it.  I've been to Mercatto a few times now, on my own for lunch and with large groups for dinner. The flavour never disappoints. Some of the dishes are hard to find elsewhere and a delight to try. Roasted fennel appetizer anyone? Pasta with guanciale ragu? Oh yes. Orecchiette with fennel sausage, peperoncini, and rapini? Wa what? Mmmm little ears of yumminess.  Great selection of wines too.   Don't let that lunch crowd waiting in the queue fool you; take a seat, enjoy some wine, and order from the regularly changing menu.  If you have to choose between Terroni's and Mercatto, pick Mercatto, it's better.  Service is usually excellent, but time between seating and receiving food can be long. Again, relax, enjoy the wait with some wine.  When you're short on garlic and butter at home, or just crave that beautifully crisp Neapolitan pizza at nearly 700F that you'll never match with your own oven, head over to Mercatto on Toronto St. That sounds like an advert. It's not. Mercatto is good. Eat it."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner on the patio. As usual, everything was pretty good, though the meals skewed toward the saline side. I ordered the arancini to start (deep fried risotto balls), and salsiccia (sausage and potatoes). I REALLY dug the sausage and the sauce was key. The escarole on the side was a nice touch, but the potatoes didn't do anything for me.  Still not quite \"I'm a fan\" status for me. I wouldn't mind a few more beer options."}
{"text":"Lovely place - I came in just for takeout, and was fairly underdressed for the restaurant as I'd run out in a sweatshirt and running shorts. Neither the ma√Ætre d' nor the bartender (who took my order) made me feel out of place, though, and both were helpful as I placed my order and took a seat at the bar to wait for the food.  I had the margherita pizza, which came out in probably less than 10 minutes and was delicious. I used to think that pizza was all about the cheese, but now I believe that it actually owes more to the tomato sauce - and this pizza had wonderful sauce that was light and full of complex flavor (as opposed to a one-note sauce that just tastes like tomato).  My only gripe is that it's a bit expensive, but I'm sure it's worth it on a special occasion or a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Wow, first let me some context, as a weekly cooker of Carbonara (including cutting my own pancetta), I must say, This is fantastic!!! I speak about other dishes, except the arancini which was amazing, but the carbonara is fantastic. Nice decor and very friendly, sweet service."}
{"text":"Mercatto: now with more birthdays! Mercatto was bustling with birthday celebrations last night, including Jen S's 25th. I ordered the Margherita Pizza this time around, which naturally was ENORMOUS and nearly impossible to finish (split it between two people for best results). I've already gushed about Mercatto in my original review and my thoughts still stand.   Some more things to love about Mercatto: * they take reservations, unlike some of the other modern Italian restaurants in the city, and can easily accommodate large groups (in addition to our group of 15-20 I saw three other huge groups that were in no hurry to leave) * the atmosphere is warm and welcoming and the music is soft and unobtrusive  * pleasant service, and our waiter Kevin went to the trouble of providing separate bills (pretty amazing considering this is Toronto we're talking about, where asking to split the bill even two times can be a huge hassle) for everyone in our party without being asked. He also tidily wrapped up our leftovers without a second thought."}
{"text":"3.5 actually. Very friendly and helpful. Booked last minute and they were able to accomodate us. My friend was particularly picky this night about the red wine, so went through a few tastings before she decided on one. Even when they poured the one she origionally chose then changed her mind before it arrived, they were still accomodating and patient. 5 star for that! Cheese and meat board was great. My wine was a perfect match to what I was looking for from the suggestion of the waitress.  Why the 1.5  stars knocked off? My parpadelle was just ok. I lurve parpadelle, but this was kinda plain. Didnt hit the spot for my pasta craving. A bit too al'dente and kinda dryish.  I love italian food so ....  The gelato was ok. Obviously Im being too picky as Im comparing it to gelato straight up from Italy.  So overall - the mains didnt satisfy enough for the cost.  Great ambiance though. Would be good for apps and drink night."}
{"text":"there are multiple locations to Mercatto in Toronto. I have been 3 out of 4 in the downtown. All of them have similar menus and the menu also changes with seasons. the dining ambiance is nice and casual although the location i frequent has been playing louder music than i like.   i do like the food there. their pizzas are very good. there was once they had this duck confit pizza and it was the best pizza i have ever had. sadly it went away after a few months.  there is a Mercatto really close to where i live. i end up doing more take out than dine in. get a pizza and a salad and that's really enough for 2.   when dining in, i like that they have the biggest selection of Italian wine. they also serve pasta as well as fish and meat dishes for main. when they have it the panacotta is great. they also have gelato for dessert.    the place can be packed on Thursdays. i guess Thursday is the new Friday :)"}
{"text":"Been there a few times now, as it has become my go-to place for good pasta in the area. Portion sizes look small but the dishes are filling, and taste very good. So far my favourite has been the ravioli, followed by the pappardelle. Good appetizers as well."}
