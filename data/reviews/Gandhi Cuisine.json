{"text":"Great roti, albeit not the Caribbean kind; if that's what you're looking for go to Pat's.  Their day-old rotis are awesome value at 6.99 and weigh as much as a baby.  Service is always great and friendly.  Beware the spiciness of this place - people who cannot take spice should specify milder than mild and not get the day-olds as they are chaos spicy.  Thankfully, I like chaos."}
{"text":"Not just the best roti but also the best saag paneer I have ever had.    They may be expensive, but one roti there is a LOT of food.  I don't think I've ever finished one by myself.  The perfect setup is two rotis, three people.  Just enough food and a really decent price per person.      Make sure you get a side of mango chutney.  The combination of the sweet chutney with the savory/spicy rotis is heaven."}
{"text":"Best Roti in the city... hands down.  Cash only, so come prepared."}
{"text":"I'm not sure that there is anything I can say that hasn't already been said about this place in previous reviews.   I've always been reasonably ambivalent about roti's in general and would only ever get them if I was out with a friend but after eating Gandhi's I have been converted. Not necessarily on roti's in general but on Gandhi's roti. I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"I usually get the mild butter chicken roti and attempt to save half for another day. Not always easy to do that. :) On a very un-hungry day I got one of the small chicken tikka rolls. Great portion size but for this mild spice eater it was a little on the hot side but until the spice got to be too much it was really tasty."}
{"text":"If you are on a budget and have a huge appetite after a whole day of shopping on Queen or writing 2 midterms in a row, grab a friend  and share one of their huge rotis. The place is packed during peak hours, so don't count on sitting at one of their 2 tables to devour your butter chicken."}
{"text":"Roti's are delicious I too love the butter chicken and am looking forward to trying a vegetarian roti next time.  They are very one-note but I suppose that's to be expected. I only mention it because it is a very large portion and by the end I find myself feeling very full and a bit tired of having one taste sensation. I'll accept your rage towards that comment if you must.  Definitely spicy as others have mentioned, I go medium and it's what others may consider hot hot.   Very tasty, certainly over priced, but sometimes when the time comes I gotta have some Gandhi."}
{"text":"Underwhelms. The flavors are off and far from authentic. We ordered a chicken vindaloo roti (extra spicy) - the spice level was just right for me but the curry was too sweet. The extra spicy level cut through the sweetness a little. We actually used the curry as a dipping sauce for the samosas because they were out of tamarind chutney! Also ordered the Malai kofta roti and there wasn't a hint of paneer (which is supposed to be the main ingredient) in the kofta. It was potato based. And the curry wasn't as rich as it's supposed to be. Pretty average meal. Much better options for this kind of food elsewhere in the city."}
{"text":"There is only one gripe I have when it comes to Gandhi - it is closed on weekends.  The rotis are soft & delicious & the fillings are insanely good. Go eat!"}
{"text":"Ghandi has been one of my regular dinner spots in Toronto since the first time I ate there. The butter chicken roti is fabulous. Its a modest restaurant in a storefront so small it could easily be missed if not for the bright yellow signs.   Don't come expecting to eat inside for dinner, Ghandi seats at max 10 people and has been full every time I've gone. Grab it to go or wait for a table, the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"I used to go out of my way for these rotis... It's always between the butter chicken and saag paneer. So delicious! So filling.   However, they have a second location (very similar, not called Ghandi) in parkdale called Mother India. It's right up the street from my house (at Queen and Landsdowne) and now I feel totally spoiled that I don't have to trek all the way to bathurst to enjoy these great rotis."}
{"text":"Gandhi's butter chicken roti is my favourite take out meal in the entire city."}
{"text":"Honestly, I didn't know food could be this good. The butter chicken roti actually made me lose IQ points. Get it hot, and save half for later."}
{"text":"The storefront seems unassuming from the outside. The store itself has a fairly basic decor. Got a samosa and chicken roti. The portions are large, definitely good to share. The roti was thin and the curry was very good. There were a few potato fillers, which was a nice change from all the chicken. Overall, a spicy flavourful meal that I would definitely return for."}
{"text":"I used to have a very limited palette that consisted of hot dogs and alpha ghetti.  Thankfully, over the years, I've been influenced by people who were in touch with their tastebuds, and have since had the variety of food I eat expand.   All you have to do is say the word Ghandi and my mouth starts to water, not just for peace on earth, but for a piece of that roti.  oh yeah, i just said that. that's how good this roti is, it's worth one of my lame puns.   seriously though. it will be the best decision you ever make.  After the first time you go, you'll want to call ahead so you don't have to wait, but I encourage your first visit to be a sit down experience.  Let the smell captivate your senses, increasing your eagerness to get your food with each passing second.   The portion is perfect for two meals, but you won't be able to stop eating it, so don't be ashamed.  My mouth is watering right now.  I started with the Chicken Tikka Masala Roti, but have switched over to the Butter Chicken, medium spicy.   Go get one."}
{"text":"This is by far the best East Indian roti joint in the city. I have tasted nearly all of their flavour offerings and every single one is delicious. Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"These are the BEST Rotis in the city. This tiny spot on queen street it makes great indian food. I love the butter chicken which is massive and cheap one order is more than good for two people. The fresh samosas are great and they have plenty of veggie options. There isn't much seating so try and call ahead you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went for the first time a couple of weeks ago.  I have only tasted roti once (the west indian style), and that was a while ago.  I was just out for a stroll with my friend, when I saw a huge line up for this place.  We were wondering what all the buzz was about... we're not very tall, so we were tip toeing to see past the line up crowd.    Then suddenly this guy came up behind us, and asked us \"Hey, how long is the line up?\"  We told him no idea, since we never ate here before.  We asked him if it was any good.. and his response was a shock on his face, that we even dared to ask.  Okay.  So we decided to split a roti... ordered up a mixed vegi... ooooh wow.  Talk about flavour!!  Everything about it was great.  Spices, heat (ordered medium), texture... it was a perfect dish for sure.  Portion was super large.  There is no way a person can finish this alone.  I also appreciated the fact that it was not greasy at all.  Our plate (or foil) had no grease left behind.  Next time I would like to try the butter chicken :)"}
{"text":"Firstly, the food they serve is not Indian ( I mean East Indian, from Indian subcontinent). The food served here is a BIG JOKE. Please avoid this place if you are looking for some good Indian food. I fell prey to so many reviews and stars on this Yelp page and got the taste of reality yesterday.   The roti served here is the primary cuisine of Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago in particular. So instead of fooling around with dishes sounding like typical Indian curry like Chicken Tikka or Butter Chicken, they should serve something authentic from Caribbean.  Avoid this place, there are a lot better establishment serving Indian food."}
{"text":"I shan't waste anyone's time by properly reviewing this place, but I will say this: if you haven't yet been to Gandhi, there is no question that you should go and that it should be soon. I would definitely drive or fly many hours for Gandhi's butter chicken roti. But I'm like that."}
{"text":"So I finally went to Gandhi's to check out what all the hype was about.  The place is a small hole in the wall, harder to find right now because of the construction nearby, but if you know where to look you'll find it. I got there on a Monday evening, a lot of people were getting takeout, but my friend and I decided to share a Chicken Korma Roti and sat down. There were 4 tables, somewhat greasy, but generally clean. From my experience i would definitely go for takeout next time to avoid smelling like curry afterwards. Our order was ready in 5 minutes and brought to our table.   I expected the roti to somewhat be an individually portioned wrap for some reason. But its a HUGE 'romali' roti (as it is called in India) with about 2-3 servings of curry in the middle, folded into a rectangular shape, almost like an envelope for the curry. I found this method of serving a bit ridiculous. It's really hard to eat with a fork and a knife because the proportion of curry to roti isn't quite right, and for the 1st 10 bites, there is WAY too much curry, making it quite salty, but by the time you are halfway into your meal, you discover hidden layers of roti underneath all that curry, and it somewhat evens out.   The food overall was delicious! (a liiitllee bit salty for my taste but that might be because of the excess curry). I'll be returning here to try some other options, however always with a friend because of the portion sizes.The $13  is pricey for an individual meal that isn't good for leftovers (soggy roti? no thanks). Maybe next time I'll ask if i can have the roti and curry separately, or get the curry with rice, which would fix the problem that makes me take off a star."}
{"text":"Tried this place 2 times and I'm writing this review as I'm currently eating the Chicken Tikka Masala Roti.  PROS - Large Portions - Lady Cashier is always helpful and really friendly - Quick Service - Filling  CONS - Very spicy   I've visited this place two times and each time it was really fast service. The first time I dropped by in person and ordered on the spot and they told me it would take about 8 mins but I received my order within 3 mins tops. This order was for the butter chicken roti and the 1 day old chicken roti, I eat a lot of spicy foods but the medium level was a lot spicier than I expected so for those who are sensitive to spicy beware and get the mild level. The butter chicken roti was amazing and the chicken roti was good. On my second visit I called in ahead of time and got an order of the tikka masala roti this time and also the butter chicken again. I was told it'll be 30 mins but it only took 10 mins ! I've never had tikka masala before but this roti I didn't really enjoy it as much and it doesn't seem like authentic tikka masala as it is more of like a ketchupy sauce which I did a research online and it's suppose to be a creamy sauce, the flavour of this roti wasn't anything mind blowing to me. I'm choosing to give this review a 4 star, everything else was great."}
{"text":"The work lunch crowd often orders from Gandhi's and we love it. Lamb is my usual order. The massive rotis are served in a tin dish and keep me stuffed through supper. I'm very wary of ordering above mild. The one time I tried medium I was sweating buckets and in pain. But I am a bit of a weakling in that department.  Update: Moved to a new office across downtown, but we still find our way back. Gandhi's is awesome."}
{"text":"I had the saag paneer roti (medium) here.  My girlfriend got the butter chicken.  They were both delicious and warm -- even after a 15 minute walk outside in the cold before eating it.  I had wanted to eat inside, but a table didn't open up (I'm talking about you, guy by yourself who refused to give up the table even though your food was finished and you were just reading NOW magazine)... and my girlfriend had to get back to work.  It was my fault... as I didn't call ahead knowing full well that 12:30 PM is perhaps one of the busiest times of the day to just pop in to Gandhi Cuisine.  Would I go back?  You betcha!  This roti shop is seriously good, albeit pricey.  Next time I want to go at a more off-hour time (or try Mother India)."}
{"text":"You don't need a Google mash-up to tell you there's a West Indian roti joint on nearly every corner in downtown Toronto, but for flatbread and filling with a South Asian flare, there's only one place on the map, and that's Gandhi.   A legend among roti connoisseurs, this Queen West institution turns out parcels of chapati and slow-simmered fillings sure to make a die-hard fan (or bona fide addict) out of anyone that samples their plump and savoury perfection. The butter chicken roti is the undisputed star menu item, and a legend in its own right, stuffed with tender white meat and potatoes stewed in a rich sauce of cream and Indian spices. Chicken also gets dressed up jalfrizi, tika masala, and korma styles to make other delicious roti middles, with shrimp and lamb options rounding out the non-vegetarian offerings.   In keeping with the Gandhi theme perhaps, the list of vegetarian roti selections is more extensive, including potato, channa, spinach, cauliflower, eggplant, saag (spinach) and mutter (pea) paneer, and malai and saag kofta varieties. All middles are bundled in perfectly chewy, unleavened Indian-style griddle-baked bread which, unlike West Indian roti wrappers, contains no salt or oil, keeping its flavour neutral and letting the taste of the fillings shine through. A little tamarind sauce on the side (be sure to ask) and you're on your way to roti heaven. A note on spice: many people would agree the Gandhi medium has a fair amount of kick. Ask for hotter and prepare to be taken seriously.  Gandhi's roti range from 6.95 to 12.95 - a step up from typical roti prices, but worth every penny. And portions are correspondingly generous; a roti makes for a hearty feed for one, or a decent meal for two lighter eaters. For a snack-sized sampling of Gandhi's specialties, try one of their smaller wraps - at 2.95, and available pre-made from the glass case near the cash, the butter chicken and saag paneer roll-ups are both cheap and convenient. As for regular orders, take-out is best, as seating is limited to five small tables. Call ahead if you want to avoid a wait, otherwise bank on at least 20 minutes under the watchful gaze of Mahatma G. (a bust of the former Indian leader adorns a shelf adjacent the menu board) as homestyle magic happens in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Huge roti! Bit too much sauce but still plenty of meat, and for the price you can't complain. Be careful though, I got cocky and it ended up being alot spicier than I thought it would be."}
{"text":"Never had a roti I didn't like at this place. My  only wish for this place is that it were open on Sundays. Otherwise man there rotis are filling!"}
{"text":"Spicy here is REALLY spicy, not western-style spicy. I usually order mild, and I am no wuss! Keep in mind that Indian roti like this is rich and filling and a totally different creature from west indies roti.  Both are awesome - just different"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious. I'm more familiar with Mother India, their sister restaurant, but this was very delicious as well. I would say that I liked Mother India slightly better, but I can't say why exactly as they are very similar.  More for takeout, than sit down, though they do have a few tables."}
{"text":"Honestly, best Roti in Toronto. Being going for 10+ years."}
{"text":"I tried the lamb roti and chicken roti in mild.  I think what they meant by mild was no spice at all.  I didn't taste any ounce of spice.    It is a little hole in the wall which I don't mind if the roti was really good.  I'm giving it 2 stars because I have had way better.  Each roti cost 8.95 before taxes.    If I was in the area and wanted roti I would go here out of convenience but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for an \"meh\" roti.  The roti was fairly large but it wasn't jam packed on the inside or anything.   Service was good the order didn't take too long and they seemed pretty efficient"}
{"text":"Tried this place based on the glowing Yelp reviews.  Didn't like it.  Not at all.  From best to worst (relatively) we had the following: chicken korma roti, lamb roti, butter chicken roti, shrimp roti.  Could be I'm used to a better quality of indian food.  Could be I'm used to a better quality of roti.  Could be I just expected good food.  Period.  The shrimp & butter chicken roti taste the same.  Bland and too sweet.  The chicken korma was much better with the lamb a close second.  Gotta say, the lamb roti had lots of lamb in the filling and it was spiced much better than the chicken.  Didn't dig the dry roti either.  Located at Bathurst & Queen St. West.  Not a lot of room to sit - just 3 or 4 small tables.  More of a take-out dive, than anything.  Since it's a holiday, didn't have to wait at all for our food.   What a waste of money.  Won't ever go back.  Not worth the money (avg $11.95+ per roti) nor the time to drive to this place.  Cash only.  Grungy spot."}
{"text":"Gandhi is really a neighbourhood gem for amazing roti! It's not the fanciest or cleaniest for a Queen West eatery but they sure know what they are doing in this small little establishment!   We had an order of the butter chicken roti and lamb roti for 3 ppl to share (2 men and 1 petite lady). The portions were large, we had more than enough to hold our stomachs. The roti was thin and crispy, but it was strong enough to hold the filling. The meat filling in both were perfect - tender, juicy and just enough sauce! We asked for mild spicy and they assured us it was \"Canadian spicy\". LOL! We also ordered the mango lassi, which was not too sweet - just the way I like it.   I would definitely go back to Gandhi again for quality roti and good ol'fashion indian comfort food! The lady who served us was also super sweet and friendly, so that made our visit worthwhile."}
{"text":"Which came first?  The Butter Chicken or the Roti?  It doesn't matter - because Gandhi's has mastered the mix!  Varied to your individual spice tolerance (spice options have narrowed in recent months - but I will not hold it against them!), Gandhi's offers you a fusion of fresh, chewy, aromatic rotis filled with a full and flavourful stuffing of your choice.  My choice?  The Butter Chicken Roti hands down!  Anytime I'm feeling sad or lonely... Gandhi's has definitely become my without-a-doubt comfort food.  It's unfortunate that they aren't open on Saturdays, but I will not hold that against them either.    ***Caution - As other yelpers have mentioned, err to the low side of the spice scale if you are unsure as 'Hot' is pretty crazy HOT."}
{"text":"Tried the Spicy chicken curry rice tonight.  If you like SPICY, this is it. It kept me warm the entire walk back to the hotel in the arctic weather.  Carry out is your best best to enjoy with a cold beer."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place. Working a two minute walk away makes it a lunch option but I've gotten rotis where the edge of the bread felt stale here... it's also like $14 for a regular ass saag paneer roti. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad but mostly and all the time it's EFFING EXPENSIVE for what it is. No vegetarian roti should cost double digits. Ever."}
{"text":"Call in advance for your order and be prepared for leftovers.  As good as the food is, the portions are HUGE."}
{"text":"One of my favourite hole in the wall east Indian spots in Toronto's west end. This place is easy to miss, but if you're lucky enough to find it, get ready to chow down on some of the best  roti in Toronto.  The menu is fairly simple: meat or veggie-based rotis. Once that age-old question has been answered, pick a spice level (the guy behind the counter can usually help you figure out what spice you can handle). Wait 5-10. Enjoy.   The roti itself is packed like a brick and served in authentic hole in the wall flatware (aluminium containers). But once you cut into one of these bad boys, your face will be blasted with the aroma of delicious spices and meat (or veggies). Most rotis also come with potatoes inside.   The serving is massive. Don't be discouraged if you can't finish in one sitting. The roti tastes just as good (perhaps better) the next day. Just like the day-old pizza that you rejoice in with a fist pump after a night out on the town.   The only downside to this place is that seating is extremely limited (maybe 10 seats). It's meant to be a grab and go given the tight quarters. Also, since the place is really small, you also end up taking the scent of the restaurant with you as you walk out the door. So make sure you're not planning any close encounters after visiting here unless you want people wanting to eat your sweater because it smells like roti goodness."}
{"text":"I have a certain contrary nature that makes me disagree with you just cuz. 4 out of 5 dentists recommend chewing Trident? I'd be that one dissenting dentist just to screw with the figures.  Yes. I'm THAT person.  I think that's why it took me so long to try the roti here. To date, Gandhi Cuisine has been hogging the #1 spot in the Best of Yelp restaurant section ever since my arrival in June '09. Everybody loves it on Toronto Yelp.  Oh yeah? Well that just makes me NOT want to love it.  But I did try it and sigh. I think I love it.  Butter Chicken: too salty but still love Malai Kofta: love Saag Paneer: really love  So why only 4 stars? $37 for three TAKE-OUT roti. That's why.   It's a tiny, hole in the wall joint so you'd think the money they save on low rent and not having to pay for waitstaff, dishwashers, tableware, etc. could be passed on to the customers.   Or maybe they could throw in some free chutney and pickles.  Or maybe -- OK, OK...It's good stuff and the contrarian in me should just shut up now."}
{"text":"I like the taste and quality of the food here. I usually get the Potato Roti, which is always freshly made and hot when I get there. For optimal service, call in order in advance. They usually take 10-15mins depending on your order. They always have had it ready for me when I went to pick it up.  The spice level is interesting. Medium is quite hot, but the food is still very  good for a tiny little whole in the wall in downtown area."}
{"text":"I always get the butter chicken roti.  I will always get the butter chicken roti.  Its pretty tasty.  It's a good size, I usually eat half and save the other half for later or tomorrows lunch.  Its a take away place so there really isn't much else to it.  So I guess I am rating the butter chicken roti!  LOL!"}
{"text":"Gandhi cuisine is a small little hole in the wall mom-and-pop style restaurant the offers up some fantastic flavours.   This little restaurant boasts a decently varied menu,  with a wide arrange of rotis and other main dishes. They also have a lot of sides you can buy, along with some delicious home made sauces and marinades to take home.   I've had the butter chicken roti here and it's fantastic. Full of flavour and served up nice and warm with the requested level of spice. Their mango lassi is also very good.  Overall, if you're looking for a quick bite with home made feel, this is a place to consider. With great flavours and quick service, Gandhi cuisine should be on your radar!"}
{"text":"For the love of Vishnu open up a roti joint in Chicago! The one in Parkdale (Mother India) is a good first step west. Keep it going. They don't know of roti here and I needs my mutter paneer, medium."}
{"text":"Great, and pretty cheap roti to be found here.  Try the butter chicken.  Amazing"}
{"text":"I've walked past this place countless times, and because of the good Yelp reviews I finally had to try it. I'm normally not a big fan of butter chicken, but their butter chicken roti really is delicious. Their chicken tikka masala roti is also really good. Everything tasted fresh and inside the place it looked really clean. Definitely a repeat."}
{"text":"Not getting a 5 star because I have had rotis that were ordered by others and not picked up, I was always disappointed with them. However, ordering my own roti has always been perfect.  I started going to Ghandi's when they first opened up and I have been going ever since.  Huge portions, enough for two but if I am really hungry, I can eat the whole thing.  I usually get the saag with potatoes bc I try to aviod dairy and they always comply.  Everything is so good there."}
{"text":"I stop here every time I'm in Toronto. My wife found this place one time when she was visiting me at school and while it literally looks like a hole in the wall the roti is out of this world amazing. So fresh and flavourful. Word of caution - the mild has some spice to it and the medium will make your nose run, but it's worth every bite."}
{"text":"*NOTE* It's spelled Gandhi's, not Ghandi's. I'm an idiot.  Do we really need another 5-start review for Gandhi's? Sure, why not?  I can't possibly read all of the other reviews, but I'll try to throw out a few lessor-known tidbits and personal stories for your enjoyment.  - If you've never been to Gandhi's, beware of the spicy scale. Here's a comparison to usual spicy levels at Toronto restaurants:  Gandhi's Mild = Regular Mild Gandhi's Med/Mild = Regular Medium Gandhi's Med = Regular Hot Gandhi's Med/Hot = Regular Suicide Gandhi's Hot = Regular Kamikaze Gandhi's Extra Hot = I have no clue because you'd have to be insane to order it.  - Gandhi's is NOT open on the weekend, unfortunately  - However, the owners also run a restaurant called Mother India where you can go if you're going to break down without some of that mind-blowing Gandhi's flavour on the weekend  - All of the roti is made fresh in-house on their old-school roller  - If you and a friend show up to bring back an order of 16 roti for the office they may give you each a can of Arizona for your troubles  - They only take cash, so be prepared (even if your bill is over $200 like our usual office run)  - It's basically a take-out joint since there is only seating for about 10.  - I like the saag paneer, but I keep coming back to the butter chicken. It's unbelievable.  STOP READING AND GO GET ROTI."}
{"text":"Wonderful flavours, as many have already mentioned in their reviews before mine.  Just phone in your order at least 15 minutes prior to arriving and also, spice level will vary depending on who is cooking that day/night (so be forewarned)."}
{"text":"Me and my friend wanted to try Indian food for the first time so went for this place because of the raving reviews on Yelp (plus the roti looks good in the pictues). So we ordered mild chicken roti that's $8.95 plus tax which totals to $10.15.  Let me just say that if you are prone to stomach aches or not acquired to Indian food, I would not recommend this since I got very nauseous after eating it. The mild chicken roti was good, but I feel like it's missing that wow factor and I think it looks and smells better than it actually tastes.   We took it to-go and shared it since half a portion each was filling enough (I thought the box would be bigger, but I would not be able to finish all of it so the portion is big enough). They were stingy on napkins (one), and only gave us one fork and a knife (I even ask them for forks, plural, but they said it's already in the bag. Because I'm sure me and my friend are going to share one fork and a knife).   Overall the chicken roti was okay, but what it has been doing to me makes me give them a 2/5 stars. For those who are acquired to Indian food, this would deserve a higher rating but if a newbie, prepare for intestinal problems."}
{"text":"New mgmt? Terrible. All sauce and no meat and potatoes. The sauce was this beet red tomatoe pastey glop. Dreadful."}
{"text":"This restaurant goes under the list of \"yelp made me do it\"...and the reviews are true - THIS RESTAURANT IS AMAZING! Even my grandparents, who usually hates trying new food, LOVES the roti I brought home.  I went yesterday and got Samosas and a  Butter Chicken Roti. I was so lucky to get there right when a FRESHHHH batch of samosas was made - mines was still hot and they were spicy (full of spices). I didn't try any of the butter chicken, but my family seemed to enjoy it and ate the whole thing!  I went again the next day. Of course, I got more samosas (which was disappointing since they were cold) and a potato roti. My friend got a spinach/potato roti. IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST THING I EVER TASTED!  The pricing is fairly cheap for such tasty food and the wait was most 10 mins even with so many people coming in and out.  UPDATE: I deleted my update review about saturday hours, because they are no longer open on the weekends...once again. I will now proceed to cry in the corner, because I can't have Gandhi's on Saturday night."}
{"text":"Best Roti in the city - hands down. The selection is broad, the prices are reasonable and the spice is amazing. Delicious. I always call ahead. Whether lunch or dinner. I wish this spot was open more often, that's always been my only complaint."}
{"text":"A Toronto icon, I'm always happy with what I get here, except for the one time a few years ago when the 'day old' chicken roti I bought had mould on it. Nevertheless I always try to stop here (or Mother India) when I make it back to Toronto."}
{"text":"Pretty decent. Large portions, so if you only want a snack (or you're petite), it'll be too much food/money for ya.  I usually split the Chicken Tiki Roti and it's enough for me and my friend - we're hobbits though.  Check out the pictures other's have posted to get a idea of the size - it's larger than a west indian roti (ie. Island Foods)."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best roti place in Toronto. The lamb roti is definitely my favourite, though many of my friends prefer the butter chicken one (personally I find it very salty). The portions are HUGE, and sometimes I struggle to finish the entire thing. One tip: call ahead as it can take a decent amount of time for them to prepare your meal. The actual restaurant is tiny and very warm in the summer so it is not enjoyable to actually eat there - much better for take out! Alternatively, if you don't call ahead, walk west down the street to the wine rack and pick up a bottle of the inniskillin cab franc - i have found it pairs (in an odd way, but really well) with the lamb roti. A great take out dinner! Also, I really enjoy spicy food, but be warned that their definition of spicy is really... spicy. I order spicy, but on occasion I have found it so spicy it is not enjoyable to eat.... as in that the next day you stomach will punish you for being too cocky and thinking you can handle gandhi's spicy."}
{"text":"Love the concept! Had the chicken tikka masala roti while my friend had the malai kofta ... Both solid options. Lady at the register was friendly & served w a smile. Amidst check out!"}
{"text":"This is the best roti in Toronto and thank goodness it's a 15 minute walk from work, otherwise I would be in big trouble and eating here at least 3x week.  Very, very small interior seating only about 16 or so and if you don't call in your order ahead, you will be waiting at least 20-30 minutes.  Especially during the Monday-Friday lunchtime period.  Other times it may be less busy, but my experience is seeing the weekday lunchtime crowd.  My usual: Chicken roti, medium."}
{"text":"So after seeing all the amazing reviews on yelp and my unconditional love for rotis I needed to try this place out. We ordered 3 butter chicken rotis and 1 tikki massala (hot). The spice level is intense. After deciding we couldn't wait to get home.. we parked the car and 4 hungry guys started digging in to their delicious rotis. Hoping that no one we knew saw us/smelt us...I must say it was incredible and I have been back many times since. The location is not in the best spot you may have to dodge 1-2 homeless vagabonds but definitely worth it for the roti."}
{"text":"Yes baby!. Spicy hot food! Just what I wanted. I cannot remember what I ordered but it tasted real good. They free ice cold tap water on a very hot day. The staff is friendly. I would go back without a doubt!! Love the food.  I did think the price was a wee bit high. If it was cheaper, five stars.  Visit this place."}
{"text":"I have been eating Roti at Gandhi for years, except tonight, it seems as if they have made a change.  There is a new sign on the bartop that says something like \"You can now order in MILD - MEDIUM - MEDIUM HOT - HOT - HOT TO VERY - VERY HOT\"  which I didn't see until pickup as I called to order in advance.  I was expecting the Gandhiness of yesteryear, and was terribly disappointed when I returned home to find my \"medium\" roti to be mild at best.  I ordered a \"Hot\" Chana in 2005 and was surprised to find my taste buds ever recovered. Now I think \"Hot\" may be a necessity.  Gandhi has changed a bit in the last few years. They added another table, lost the booths, got more drinks, a price increase, A New Bronze Ganesh on the wall to replace the aging Toronto Star articles,  a variety wider of chutneys - but for the most part the wonderfulness has stayed the same.    The meat Rotis are not as good as the veg. The Mixed Vegetable Korma is fantastic day 1 and less so next day. The Saag Paneer is epic at any time, even cold, and the Chana is heavily laced with tomato/cumin and delicious. The Chana needs to be spicy.    The trick with Gandhi is call ahead and pick up. It gets crowded and hot in there and your outfit will smell like curry for the remainder of the ay if you stay inside for even a few minutes.   Its true though, best roti ever. Well, Mother India is pretty much the same - but just too far west for me."}
{"text":"I love Indian food and I've gone to a lot of places around Toronto. But I have to say, Gandhi has THE BEST rotis and rice dishes I've ever had. Hot or mild, with roti or without, you can't go wrong with Gandhi. If you're ordering for more than 3 people, make sure to call ahead! You will not be disappointed. Note that it is CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"I love this place. Its a unwelcoming looking hole in the wall that has the best rotti in town.  Bring cash :)"}
{"text":"Most delicious roti I've ever had!  It's a hole in the wall restaurant, with very little sitting room. But for $12, they serve the best chicken tikka masala roti I've ever tasted. Spice level is just right and the naan is so fresh.   I suggest calling ahead for your pick-up order (they quote about 20 minutes) and you will be on your way to the best roti experience of your life.  And oh, they are not open on weekends. Been there, tried that and it's no fun to be disappointed. So plan your Gandhi adventure for a weekday :)"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan....I had the vegetable roti and didn't find it very flavourful. I am not writing it off....I'll definitely try another flavour.  Oh, the mango lassi was pretty good though"}
{"text":"Ghandi has delicious roti! Korma vegetable roti is amazing!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places for Indian food in the city. Really well flavoured and spicy curry wrapped in a soft roti. My go to spot whenever I'm in town. Portions are large so be prepared!"}
{"text":"I went to Gandhi's for the first time this week for lunch and got the lamb roti! The pakoras in the display case look sooo good but since I've been warned about the large portions I decided to pass on the pakora...this time.  The lamb roti was so flavourful, medium spicy was VERY spicy but so good. I could barely eat half of the food so for less than $10 it's great value if you're like me and can get 2 or more lunches out of it!  I'd go back for the quick take out service."}
{"text":"Best Roti spot in town.   Rich flavours, good price.   Other places pale in comparison.   It is a small yet mighty shop that will make your Indian food dreams come true."}
{"text":"When you overcharge your Biryani about 20% higher than any other Indian place you should at least include Raita with it and not make your customers have to pay for it separately. Secondly the Biryani that I received was more like Muttar Pulao and  hardly had any chicken in it.. Not going to lie, it did taste good but when I ask for Biryani, I expect Biryani. It's too bad this is the only Indian takeout option near by, cause i'll never be coming back."}
{"text":"This was one the best things I ate while I was visiting Toronto. The Rotis here are to die for...It took me back to my time in India! A word of caution...when they say hot, they mean HOT! I am Indian and I ordered the chicken tikka masala roti as very spicy and I was on fire! the saag aalo roti was medium spicy and that was perfect for me.  Also, the portions are huge and I ate mine for 2 meals...:-) Overall, I loved the Rotis and crave it in Los Angeles now!"}
{"text":"High calories, high sodium, high deliciousness, high value"}
{"text":"The food at Gandhi is incredible.  They have the best Malai Kofta I've ever had, plus their Saag Paneer roti is amazing.  For meat eaters, definitely start with the Butter Chicken but, quite frankly, all of their rotis are amazing.  If you can't handle spice, though, be careful as they make things quite spicy.  Be sure to tell them to make it mild for you!"}
{"text":"GENERAL NOTES This place is special because of its roti so don't bother getting anything else. You'll hear differing opinions on what roti is best here, my suggestion is once you've found a favourite don't go back trying others. Just stick with the one you fall in love with (and you will fall in love with one of them). Fucking lamb. Also, word of the wise, medium is spicy and spicy is apparently reeeeally spicy.  MENU RECOMMENDATIONS Chicken Jalfrezi Roti- so good. Lots of veggies, tender chicken and everything else that makes this roti the best in Toronto. Butter Chicken Roti - Sure, it's the most expensive thing on the menu but it's definitely worth it. \"It's the sauce\". Mixed Veggie Korma - I'm not a veggie myself (obviously) but I've had this and it's great.   LOCATION NOTES Just East of Bathurst on Queen. Street parking. If you can't find a spot there go one street North of Queen and take the first right. Park on the same side of the street as everyone else otherwise you WILL get a ticket, otherwise, you only might get one.  SERVICE NOTES It can be a 20 minute wait or longer during the busy periods so put the number in your phone and call ahead. Trust me, it's a number you'll be calling again. Tiny sitting area that's made way more crowded by the people waiting for pick up orders. Also, when you phone your order in make sure you remember the number they give you. Also, they love dogs, just not in the store, even guide dogs in training.   HUMOUROUS STORY This is the only \"ethnic\" food Chicken Parm Phil will eat. Actually, that's a sad sorry."}
{"text":"I think same guy owns Maurya's as this place due to the similarities.   I am sucker for good Indian food. Can't say this place is authentic but it offers really good roti. My personal favourite is butter chicken roti. Biryani is also pretty decent.   There are few short comings though - there is no consistency for the different level of hot offered. Sometime medium is hot and other times hot is not hot enough.   Another issue I have is that they put in potatoes along with meat and I hate that. I specially ask them for no potatoes each time. May be it is to save cost of something but they need to check with customers whether they want potatoes or not."}
{"text":"It was second time that I had ordered from gandhi roti. few months back had ordered chicken vindaloo roti, and that time I felt it was more aloo (potato) instead of vindaloo. But then I had ordered today chicken tikka masala roti and result was same. All I would say is this is pretty disappointing, that you order chicken and then you get more of potato. Please dont say that I can order it without potato as it doesn't make sense to me, that I have to order a chicekn tikka masala gandhi roti without potato. I can definitely say there more better restaurants in toronto. So paying $13.95 for a potato chicken masala roti???? definitely would prefer to have a buffet in an average restaurant rather than shelling out my money here."}
{"text":"For some reason, I order the same thing every time - Vegetable Roti.  Every time, it's been consistently very good!  I also recommend some of their homemade chutney - the mint one is amazing.  Being a vegan,  there are still a decent amount of options if you want to change it up.  For $7.95 the portions are big and satisfying.  I have a high spice tolerance, but I haven't dared go higher than medium.  Don't make the mistake of judging this place from the outside or decor."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say about this place. It is as if a roti and a burrito made love. That love made Gandhi's roti and that roti is to die for!!!! 2 People can share one and still be full. I am thinking of coming to the T.O. just for the street meat and Roti at Gandhi."}
{"text":"Gandhi is a to-go spot in the Queen West area for take-out indian roti.  Do not be taken back from how small this location.  They have great vegeterian choices and meat options too!  Yummy rotis for under $10.  They also have vegetable pakoras & samosa for $1.50.  Service is quick if you are getting items to-go.  There is limited seating if you are staying in.  I will definitely be back for future quick lunches and dinners!"}
{"text":"Gandhi is not as good as Mother India, even though they claim it's exactly the same. Make the trek out to Mother India instead if you can.  Oh, and for some reason (even though I used to eat leftover roti on the regular), the sign they always have in their window for discounted \"day-old roti\" always makes me cringe."}
{"text":"As a long time customer, I was disappointed tonight as our butter chicken roti's portion size has shrunk considerably and the potato content has swelled. That it all still tastes fine is a consolation, however I am now open to trying out new roti places downtown...something I never thought I'd have to say about Gandhi's."}
{"text":"PRO'S: 1. Large portion for cheap! enough for lunch and dinner.  2. Delcious 3. vegan roti option 4. good if you like spicy food  CON: 1. Even the mild is too spicy for me. 2. beware!!! it's SOOOOO SPICY. If you normally get hot, get medium.  3. Stay close to a toilet a few hours after eating. spice 'cleans you out'. sorry if that's gross!"}
{"text":"After walking around the neighborhood, I just wanted a place for a snack.  I stopped into Gandhi Cuisine and saw the display items in the deli-case.   Contemplating between a roti which look huge or some small options I decided for trying out some of the smaller options.   I got the Pakoras, potato somosa and the butter chicken roll.   After ordering the lady microwaved my food, i'm thinking this isn't so good.   Well I thought right, the butter chicken roll barely had chicken it was pretty much a puree of mostly potato and spices, barely any chicken.   The pakoras were absolutely unedible, they tasted uncooked, dry and just flavorless.   The best part of the three items were the potato somosas which were delicious.  Not the best I've had but by far much better than all the others I had.    I will definitely have to come back to try the rotis since they tend to have better reviews but stay away from the stuff in the deli-case."}
{"text":"My favourite roti place in the city.  The rotis are huge and would easily be enough for two meals if you could ever manage to stop eating (which I never manage to do because it is too delicious). They are made fresh and fast.  There are only a few small tables but these have almost always been filled when I have been through to pick up an order (calling in advance can save you waiting).  For those who love spicy food - this is one of those rare places where \"spicy\" is REALLY hot.  There are tons of veggie and non-veggie options here.  The Mutter Panneer is fantastic (can't go wrong with cheese and peas) and the Saag Panneer is also great.  The Lamb Roti are a favourite with my non-veggie girlfriend."}
{"text":"Still the best butter chicken roti in the city. I absolutely love this place, although it's not much to look at from the outside (or inside, for that matter). Although a roti is around $13, the portions are HUGE so it could easily be shared between two hungry people.  While the food can take a while to prepare, it's definitely worth the wait. I wouldn't bother trying to find seating inside as it's very limited, and not exactly fancy. Better get it to go and eat at Trinity Bellwoods Park. I still haven't tried anything other than the butter chicken roti (mostly because it's SO DAMN GOOD) which has just the right amount of heat and a decent potato to chicken ratio."}
{"text":"This place you can smell right as you walk by the entrance! The smell is AMAZING and that alone will make you want to go in and have a bite!   We got the chicken korma roti with medium spice and it was delicious! They make the roti fresh and the flavors are so aromatic. The medium spice is pretty spicy so if you can't handle spice I would go for mild and if you can handle spice and love it spicy go hot! I can handle spice but even medium was a little too spicy for me, but nonetheless amazing! Cannot wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"What is there to say about Gandhi Roti that hasn't been said before? I used to work at an office around the corner and every Wednesday was Gandhi Wednesday. We would spend all morning talking about what we were going to order. Always, always, always chose EXTRA spicy butter chicken, but it's not like you can go wrong with any of the other options. At noon we would place the order and usually wait about 20-30 minutes before sending someone down to pick up. In fact, our boss is in the BlogTO picture of Gandhi waiting for one of those very pickups. The wait at rush time can be gnarly, so ordering ahead is key.  And then we would feast. And oh, how we would feast. Finishing a whole Gandhi roti is a spiritual experience which leaves you in a kind of half-dream state wondering whether what just happened *actually* happened or whether it was all just a wonderful spicy dream. The rest of the afternoon would be spent talking about whether we had conquered the roti or whether the roti had conquered us. Usually it was the latter.  Despite the butter chicken coma, it was always worth it. An absolute must."}
{"text":"The best Rotis in town at incredible prices: Veggie or Meat at about $8.  Fills tummy to the brims.  Popular with everyone, made on the spot within fifteen minutes, half-hour if very busy.  Best to call in form outside if inside is busy (that's top secret, I might take this out eventually).  For some reason, popular with folks from the motion picture industry.  Addictable, but only at a rate of one every week it seems."}
{"text":"alright..   I went to this spot today for lunch and got a Chickpea/potato Roti with mild-med spice.. its amazing. and I'm pregnant so I mean it.  the only thing is a fresh one came out to $10 ish but its listed for like $8 .. taxes? anyways its still good though and very filling so I guess its worth the price. I've had only a quarter of it and I'm good, likely be snacking on this all day.  Make sure you check the 1 day old roti's in the counter where you order, they'd come out to $8 probably with tax. that's my next go-to.  Def coming back here. Baby and I approve."}
{"text":"The place is tiny but perfect for take out. I always got two meals out of a roti. Love the mutter paneer roti. I always try to stop in when I'm in town. Spicy will burn your face off, which is how I like it!"}
{"text":"It's very rare that I hand out 5 stars, but this place deserves it.  I have been coming here for years and all of the reviews are accurate. The food here is as good as it gets. It's \"mind-blasting\"! (Yes, that's right! Say it like Russell Peters!)  Things to note: Order ahead, this place is not known for its rapidity of service. Hot means HOT. Also, \"medium\" tends to be more flavourful."}
{"text":"I was craving Indian food and I yelped this place and it has great reviews so I decided to try it out. Located on Queen Street west just east of Bathurst, Gandhi Cuisine is a great place to eat roti.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala roti and with a can of pop cost around $15. Nice thing about this place is that you can set your spice level which is mild, medium and hot. Of course, I cannot handle spicy so I ordered the mild spice level.  It took a while for them to make it. Means that it is made fresh. There is limited sitting in the restaurant as there are only 12 chairs and 4 tables. My chicken tikka masala came out piping hot and it tasted great. I am a huge fan of roti and it came out like a pizza pocket style. There was a lot of chicken in my roti which was surprising since I thought they would stuff it more with potato. Mild was just perfect for a non-spicy eater.  It is pretty hot in the restaurant as there was no air condition when I went on a hot summer day. Overall, its a great Indian place if you are craving roti."}
{"text":"This is mainly a take-out place with very limited seating.  But it offers huge portions for about $10, tasty food, homemade roti bread, and one dish provides enough food for two.  Beware:  it's closed on weekends."}
{"text":"NEGATIVE STARS. abolutely disgusting place. Who keeps a pigeon in the kitchen??? Food is tasteless. For an indian, the food is absolutely not tempting. Only tomato ketchup in chicken tikka . Very unappetizing. Also the experience couldnt be any worse. While me and my husband were having dinner , a crazy huge homeless man came in. He kept staring at us and blabbering in front of us / himself. And all the staff could do was talk within themselves.  Later when we confronted the owner about doing something about it, he said his boundary is till the counter and anything after that is public space and he dsnt have control over what happens in there. He told us not to use our brains but use technology to send the crazy homeless guy's picture to police. Apparently this guy has been coming in there regularly.  Well what can I say, atleast they have one regular customer!!!"}
{"text":"Great little roti place on Queen St West. Limited seating & no facilities on the premise. Good selection of rotis and rice dishes to sample and they also sell day old rotis for $8 but I'm not sure how good that would be.   I fancied a lamb roti medium spice today, placed my order at the counter & plopped down at a table. I didn't wait long and it was served on a metal tray in a takeout box. The outside looks plain but what's inside is the main event. The steam literally came wafting out as I cut into the roti. The masala spices just hits your nose and your mouth starts watering. Careful it's hot so blow on it before taking that first bite. Delicious doesn't even describe how good it was. There was an explosion of different flavours like having a bangara party in your mouth.  For $15 it was a satisfying meal. This may seem pricey but remember it is on Queen Street."}
{"text":"If you like Indian food and you haven't been here, I don't know what you're waiting for.    I never order butter chicken at any other Indian restaurant (I wouldn't call Gandhi a real restaurant, its a hole in the wall) because this is the only place to get it..  Everyone else should just pull it from their menu.  Personally, I love eating this cold the next day.  I'll actually pick it up and bring it home with no intention of eating it til the next day when the sauce is congealed and you can easily pick it up by hand.  Sooo goood.  If you like it spicy, start with medium because its pretty damn spicy.  Move up from there."}
{"text":"- bumping to 4.75 stars as they have seem to re-introduced a roti that takes up the entirety of the container again... consistently - that missing 0.25 stars is still for not being open on the weekend."}
{"text":"its been a while that i have not been to Gandhi's but when ever i think of queen st W, I always think of Ghandi;s, this one of those places no frills, barely any room to dine in but for take out this place is awesome, my favorite dishes, Spinach and lamb curry on rice or wrapped in a Roti, Vindaloo Roti, you ask them to make it spicy, super spicy or mild, its perfect place for those cold nights to grab a take out from  Note: their spicy is super spicy so be careful  try it out of you in are Downtown TORONTO  Thanks for reading"}
{"text":"SO disappointing to write this review. Before I begin I would like to mention that I have been eating at Mother India for the past few months, and it's an easy 5/5.  Years ago I would eat at Gandhi once a week or at the least once every couple weeks, I then took a long hiatus from the venue and today was the first time I ate there in over a year. Brutal experience.  I called my order in approximately 20 minutes before I knew I would be there. I was there in 15 and it was ready as I walked in, great! I ordered the Butter Chicken (medium) which is actually quite hot, even if you enjoy your heat. My gf ordered the Chicken Tikka mMasala (mild) she does not enjoy the heat. So I walked out of GR with arguably their two most popular rotis, and as I began to drive home neither of us could wait, we had to dig in.   Brutal.  My BC sauce was ok at best, the voluptuously creamy, rich and sweet sauce I was accustomed too was nowhere to be found. Worst of all the chicken was extremely dry and chewy, I was utterly shocked. Even the roti was hard and stale, I thought how can this be happening to me! I looked over at my gf's roti and I could see the vibrant red colour of the CTM and figured it was bang on as it has been in the past. She told me it was bland and as I tried a bite I could barely taste anything, I thought I was dreaming. If indian food is anything it is certainly not bland, with the wide array of unique and bold spices correctly executed the flavours are almost always blinding. The CTM was completely under seasoned and all I could taste was an after note of cumin, so disappointing.   Gandhi can no longer hold a candle to its sister restaurant Mother India. Every time I've eaten at MI it's always been nothing shy of incredible. Maybe it's the high volume of customers at Ghandi that is affecting the quality of the food.   I will never go back, especially while Mother India is around.   So disappointing."}
{"text":"find comfort in roti, and Ghandi's is the best in Toronto. It's a bold statement, but I stick to it.   I should say, however, that I almost never eat in the restaurant - one because it only fits a handful of people, and two, because I don't think curry will be bringing anybody to my yard anytime soon.  Ha.  Seriously, there are some foods that can really stink up your clothes - Korean barbecue and Indian food are the worst -and this East Indian roti shop is no exception. Take-out is your friend.    The menu has a wide range of varieties from saag paneer (spinach) to butter chicken, all of which taste amazing. How do I know that? I've tried every single one. Cross my heart.    A word to the wise: while my spice tolerance is off the charts, Ghandi's will bring me to my knees. For some reason I can't take it. So I settle for a mild-medium roti ride to bliss.   There is bad news: It's not open on weekends."}
{"text":"I finally had my first roti from here. I had some nice co-workers who braved the lunch hour rush and picked up our orders. I've had Mother India a couple times before and even though they may be owned by the same people, I think I'd have to say I prefer Mother India. It's not a massive difference but I've tried the Saag Paneer roti from both places now so let me compare: Mother India is slightly less saltier. After eating Ghandi's, we were all gulping back water even though there was little room left in our bellies for water. Ghandi's Saag Paneer roti contained potato and I'm not so much a fan of potato in my roti. I feel it adds too much starchiness. I loved the rich savoury taste of mother india's saag paneer. dribbling now at the thought even though i'm still full from lunch which was 6 hours ago. Don't get me wrong, if my co-workers go for another Ghandi's run, I'll definitely partake but maybe I'll suggest they drive further down queen and try Mother India instead."}
{"text":"The food is good as  always. But they've really got to do something about the hair in the food ! This is the second time we've come across one!! :/ can you imagine how many pieces went un noticed."}
{"text":"I'm done with this place.    First the positive:  Friendly people.  Good roti (the bread that is).  And the flavour of the very rich sauce isn't bad.  The negative: - Portions smaller than they used to be. - Too much potato.  I bought 3 roti last night:  Chicken, Butter Chicken, Mixed Veg.  All were 80% potato, and for the mixed veg I'd say 90%, with a few peas and microscopic amounts of cauliflower.   This is not the way to make money, and frankly it's not a healthy way to eat. - My kids can't take the spice.  The nice people behind the counter admitted that \"Mild\" means mild to someone raised in India.  So be prepared. - all the fillings taste the same  $40 for potatoes potatoes potatoes? no thanks.    I know this place has long been the darling of Queen Street but it's worse by far than it ever was, the hours are often bizarre, and the food choices there very limited.  Sorry white folks, this is neither good Indian food nor is it good roti,     The place to go for Roti downtown is still and always was Vena on Bloor near Lansdowne.  I dare you to buy a mixed veggie roti from both places and think that you'd ever be back to Gandhi.  Potatoes potatoes potatoes plus a handful of peas and cauliflower VS generous amounts of YOUR CHOICE OF squash, spinach (fresh, lightly cooked and still green!), eggplant, green beans, mushrooms, I could go on)."}
{"text":"Your crazy if you give this place anything but a five. This is the best Indian takeout I've had while in toronto thus far. Pricing is more than fair for the huge portion you get. You can see the kitchen from the seats and is open kitchen concept which makes the space feel bigger. It is very limited seating and they are only open and they are only open mon to fri  which is there only downfall."}
{"text":"The same as Mother India but not. Every meal I've taken out of Mother India has been flawless and this one is less consistent. Definitely only for take-out. Not open as much. Still some of the best roti in town."}
{"text":"Excellent, I crave these to this day. via Mike Nowland and the toronto creepers."}
{"text":"So far the best Roti I've ever had. Love the wrap they use, very fresh and the potatoes and chicken inside is perfect every time. Can't get enough!"}
{"text":"I realllllly love Gandhi.  The vegetable roti is fantastic. Service is very fast so make sure you are close by before you call and order (about 10 mins). I like mine medium but if you are adverse to spice make sure you tell them.  Their roti is a very fulsome meal. Sometimes only eat half and bring the rest for lunch the next day.    I have only (and would only) do take out here."}
{"text":"One of the colleagues who is into her 60s heard us talking about rotis and she was like you must try Gandhi on Queen.  5 mins walk from work and the restaurant was full of people. Long queue to order the food. Ritual is the way to go.   Coming to the good: Had Saag (Spinach) Paneer roti. Taste was okay but roti - the outer layer, could have been better. It was difficult to cut it using the knife."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the mutter paneer roti and it tasted just like it did in India! Authentic! The staff was very friendly and the food was reasonably priced. It broke my heart to throw some away because I couldn't finish it all. Will come again next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Very big portion size, but so so good. The staff was extremely helpful and polite. You get to choose your spice level too."}
{"text":"No no no. They've got bad over time. Went there the other day to get 2 rotis. He gave me a special - it was 1/2 the size of a normal one portion and cost the same! Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"i'm still keeping the 4 star rating..but bad news- i seriously think the quality of gandhi roti has gone down.  go try a place in little india.  either this queen west spot ain't what it used to be or i'm gettin better at knowing good quality food."}
{"text":"What can you say about the fresh rotipress machine creating fresh rotis for both Ghandi and Mother India. This has been a staple in my best of Toronto for a long time. Best bets are the saag paneer and the butter chicken. Call first to avoid the wait and smelling like curry. Still slightly better in portions and taste then it's sister Mother India. Glad they're opened again on the weekend even if it's only Saturday."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that I can't agree with all the other Yelp-ers and give this place a 5-star review :(  I ordered the Butter Chicken Roti and when I got my order, it was just....okay. Maybe it was because I ordered the \"Mild\" version, but I thought the sauce wasn't fragrant enough and the chicken was dry. The roti was hard to cut through (as if the dough was overworked) though it has a nice flavour. I didn't expect for it to be rolled so thinly though, I think I actually prefer a thicker roti shell. The amount of chicken you get in the filling is what you'd expect from a roti filling - although people have complained that there isn't enough, it's a $11.95 for cripes sake! What do you expect? The size of the actual roti itself is ginormous - enough for 2 meals.  The girl that was taking my order at the counter was really pleasant too. if anything, I would rate the service at a 5 - service with a smile :) I also really like the feeling that it's a little mom and pop joint.  EDIT: I finished the other half of my Butter Chicken 2 days after ordering it and it seemed a lot more fragrant (upped from 3 to 4 stars)! The roti itself softened up though. If I were to order it again (probably not in the near future though, just because I want to try other places) I would probably order it one spice level up."}
{"text":"I went with my bf around dinner time, we shared 1 roti together. The middle aged man behind the cash was really friendly, chatty & welcoming. My bf & him hit if off with stories of India. It's a very small place & can be a little tricky to spot midst all the other stores. The atmosphere is super casual, nothing fancy but simple. We sat & dined. We noticed a lot of the customers did take out, which made sense as seating options for dining in are very limited. We ordered our food at the cash & were told to sit, our food would be brought to us at the table.   The roti was delicious. We tend to usually order spicy at restaurants & we didn't expect the roti to be spicy even for us. It also came piping temperature hot - be warned for those of you who burn your tongue easily like me! There were 2 fellow Desi young men also dining beside us, who enjoyed the food, but also found it spicy. The roti was well balanced with gravy to masala/spices & chicken portions.  We debated getting samosas after but found them a little pricier compared to other places.  It's great for something warm, heavy but quick & is definitely good comfort food. We'll visit again when we're downtown."}
{"text":"mmmm the fooooood (and by food I mean rotis) is DELICIOUS!!!  lots and lots and lots of stuffing variations for roties.. I don't remember now what did I order but I do remember it was gooooood.    the guys who work there are super friendly and do ask you a second time if you're sure in the spiciness level that you're choosing=) I think my friend and me went for medium plus or something of this kind. next time going for spicier just to check how far can we go because the food there is actually spicy=)  the portions are HUGE! so one roti is a pretty good meal for two people.  I'm only giving it 4 starts because the place was not good in terms of seating. almost no space inside. but 2 people definitely fit."}
{"text":"This is an amazing take-out place for superb roti.  Plentiful, delicious, brimming with flavour and spice and tender morsels and tender layers of roti.  I came on a very hot day prepared to be disappointed because the place is so shabby.  But I only heard good things.  I ordered the eggplant and potato roti.  OMG.  Nuclear hot and steaming as I brought it with me to a nearby park.  I could not get enough.  It is so big that I had to stop several times to take bites then walk because I felt if I stopped to long I will demolish the whole thing and never get up.  This a lot of roti but full of quality.  Next time I will order the shrimp roti and I will be prepared to bring it home and cuddle with it before devouring it.  Sigh."}
{"text":"Had the potato roti and the chicken roti one other time.  You could tell that the chicken in the chicken roti was not cooked with the filling because it was really dry. I also didn't like the fact that the chicken were cut into small diced pieces. Made it seem like there was no chicken at all. The potatoes in the potato roti were way over cooked and couldn't taste if there were potatoes in there or not.  The hot spice really carried the dishes because it takes away from the actual taste of the so called \"roti\". Really be careful with your selection of spice level because it is really spicy. The roti, which is not really roti but a thin layer of naan, did not go well with the filling. Which by the way they should not call roti but naan. Portion wise it was a little too much that you get sick of half way though. If you want a crispy spicy mush, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I love their food here.   I ordered for pick-up. Although they did mess up my order but they so apologetic about it and even offered to make a new meal for me.   But I was in a hurry, I couldn't wait. When I tried the food that evening, it was actually it is hands down the best Indian food I've tasted. And trust me I've tried a wide variety.   My only problem with them is that, I feel they close way too early. Like they close at 7pm which is not the most convenient time for customers, I think.   Also, I hope they start offering delivery soon cause it's a bit far from my location but the food is worth it all."}
{"text":"This place has amazing roti's.  Huge portions.  It takes a while to make the roti though, and there can be a line.  Best to call ahead and pick up.  Also watch the spice, hot is really hot."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here, the smell of someone else's Gandhi would trigger my own urge to get my own butter chicken roti.  One time I was in the area and yes I was feeling cheap, and didn't want to wait so I got the day old roti.  It was the longest ttc ride home ever! But as i cut it open at home, I knew it was a big mistake, there was barely any chicken, and it tasted super bland. It was also much, much smaller.   Perhaps the regular priced roti is still top notch, but I don't dare go back. Guys, the day old was still like 8 bucks or something - but it really fell flat."}
{"text":"i took the advice from my friend H who said this place is a toronto must try, as well as the advice of other yelpers on the menu and ate the mutter paneer medium heat....and i wasn't disappointed.    this was good indian food served in an innovative way and was enough for two meals...and after the exchange rate from the u.s....a really great bargain!  next time i'm in toronto i'll definitely be back...and i heard about new york subway down the street as well.  another eclectic food spot i wanna try."}
{"text":"Always delicious.  Maybe not the healthiest but I'm addicted.  (Pick up only, no table service)."}
{"text":"Dee-lish.  What a great little hole in the wall.  Always popular, my goodness, the line ups around diner time, they have clearly built a strong returning clientele.    Note to everyone.  It's very spicy.  I ordered medium, I can take spicy but holy spices galore, I thought my brain cells were on fire.  Not my usual style but I am going mild next time...  Recommended ones: BUTTER CHICKEN ROTI, SAAG PANEER ROTI, or the ALOO GOBI ROTI.  It is all sizable portions, I can eat and bring some for lunch!  In a word, YUM!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Gandhi Roti, so while close to Queen & Bathurst on a chilly Friday, my stomach told me it wanted to try Gandhi Roti.  I'm not going to lie.  After pulling up in front of the store-front, I thought \"This is it?\" It is definitely a hole-in-the wall deli.  But I've had enough experiences at hole-in-the-walls that I knew I shouldn't judge so quickly.  I was happy that at the high-hunger state I was in, there was no line-up when I walked in, around 3pm.  I wouldn't have had the patience to wait!  Not knowing which to choose, I asked the kind lady behind the counter which she would recommend as a vegetarian option, and she suggested the Saag Panner.  After about 10 minutes, I was presented with my Saag Paneer Roti  - wow, I really didn't expect it to be that large!  But my eyes were delighted at the size.  I was very satisfied with the melt-in-the-mouth spinach, I loved the smooth, medium-soft paneer, and even though I asked for no spice, the hint of spice actually added a nice flavour.  The plus about the take-out box is you can seal it again and devour the rest later, and it keeps it clean if you're eating in your car.  4/5 for the food experience only, not for the ambiance.    I will come back here again, but will make my way to try Mother India as I'm influenced by the recommendation from other Yelp members.  p.s. I may not be the best judge of food when I'm hungry..."}
{"text":"Damn, that's some good roti, probably the best I've ever had. Fresh, spicy and made to order. They do some proper work in that kitchen."}
{"text":"love love love their Roti's! Yes, you can wait a while when you're wanting a roti during the lunch rush, but it is well worth the wait. It's a good idea to call in your order.   I have tried several different roti's and I've had plates with rice, but I always find myself at the mercy of the curry chicken roti.   Be careful not to order hot your first time you go there. If you typically love hot food, try out the medium because it's sooo hot. I looked at a guy like he was crazy once when he ordered hot, I can only assume it will actually tear you apart later...you know what I mean."}
{"text":"It looks like Gandhi is on its way to earning a place in the hearts of me and my co-workers as a \"favoured\" lunch spot. Yea, it's a bit of trek as we gotta ride the streetcar way out west but hey when we're hungry we are looking for something delicious and satisfactory. And Gandhi fits the bill with its amazing creations. The word on the street is right about this place, they do serve up beautiful indian style rotis.   Saag Paneer has become one of my favourites, the creamy base of chopped spiced spinach (notes of ginger) is studded with blocks of cheese all over. Chicken tikka masala has rich flavours while the butter chicken while wonderfully creamy is a tad oversalted and lacks the complex spicing of the chicken tikka or butter chickens past at other establishments. Both feature tasty pieces of white meat though. My favourite part of the meal is the roti pastry, it's thin, light and a little sweet. The perfect shell to the bundle of goodness inside. Portions are huge here, we usually try to get 2 rotis to amongst 3 and it's more than enough even for the guys in the group. Heck if you have a real hungry man in your life one of these babies eaten in a single sitting would keep em happy. Oh and they're usually pretty on the mark with their spicy/hot scale here, don't be an hero and order hot because it's uberly tear inducing, breathtakingly hot!  I wish that this place was bigger, the lineups at lunch hour and peak dinner can be overwhelming so again-call ahead especially if you have a big order. (expect a half hour to 45 minute wait during peak lunch if you have more than one order) The atmosphere is non existent and with the meat rotis past the $10 price range you'd think they they could bone up on the extras such as extras such as side sauces, extra seating or tableware as Susan pointed out below. But maybe they're perfectly fine with the status quo as the folk keep comin' and enjoyin'."}
{"text":"The roti was too expensive at $11.99 considering the amount of chicken included.  That said, the flavor of my butter chicken roti was Unique and authentic. Too bad the roti had too much potato and not enough chicken:("}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food but be prepared to wait! I went after work to grab a Butter Chicken Roti and Samosas. It took a while to get my food as they make all food to order, including the roti! I ordered my Butter Chicken spicy and it sure was really hot, but still really tasty and flavourful. I will definitely come back and try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"If Mahatma Gandhi Yelped, he'd give this place five stars. Go."}
{"text":"I'm a bit remiss that I had not discovered this place long ago. I can't thank the friend who introduced me to Gandhi Cuisine enough.   Admittedly, late to the game of extolling it's virtues, i can only say that there is Outstanding roti here! Gandhi Cuisine is a simple clean shop with not more than a couple of bare tables and a bronze bust of Mahatma himself staring down at you as you order.  The roti is made fresh as you order and within its lightly crisp n chewy blanket is the most wonderful filling ever.  I had the chicken 'something'  roti (apologies - its the second chicken one on the menu) roti and it was delicious.    Plenty of veggie choices are available, and you bet I will make many return trips to try them all!"}
{"text":"Our go-to place for roti. No other description needed! Absolutely delicious comfort food.  Our favourites are the spicy butter chicken roti and medium spicy lamb roti.  Food was 5 stars for sure, but gave an overall 4 star rating as it was a bit overpriced and the restaurant itself could be a little bit cleaner."}
{"text":"The last time I was in Toronto my friends were discussing putting together a roti tasting. I've had roti before so I really didn't pay much attention to this talk, much less think I'd have a life-altering experience if I ate some.  And then along came Gandhi and its medium-spicy butter chicken roti. First off, the thing's enormous - easily two meals worth of tender chicken enrobed in creamy curry and all wrapped up in awe-inspiring roti.  San Francisco has the Mission-style burrito (something I dearly love and miss.) And as I sat on the floor of my hotel room tucking into my butter chicken I realized that Toronto has an equivalent.  Toronto has Gandhi's roti."}
{"text":"I really wish I could remember exactly when I first came to Ghandi Cuisine, or go back in time and slap myself for not discovering it sooner.  Now, I can't imagine life without it.  Where to start?  The best thing on the menu, hands-down is the Butter Chicken on Rice (with a huge Veggie Samosa - best deal in the city at $1.50 each!!!).  I know a lot of people like the roti's here, and while they're not bad, the roti itself isn't all that special (Bacchus actually has better roti skins - with a more textured channa layer).  Still, they are made fresh right in front of your eyes - those poor people in the kitchen must fire hundreds of piles of dough through that cool auto-roller every day.  Also great, imho, are the Lamb Curry (again, on rice - you can get Lamb Vindaloo, even though it's not on the menu, but it really is super-hot, and sometimes I just can't finish it), and the Saag Paneer.  You have to indicate the desired spice level for each dish (unless it's the Vindaloo, which only comes in HOT) - they briefly moved from 3 to 5 levels (mild, mild-medium, medium, medium-hot, hot), but have since dropped back down to the three basics (mild, medium, and hot).  Unless you're completely unable to tolerate heat, the lowest you should go is medium (on top of heat, you lose quite a bit of actual flavour going down to mild).  Also, the most important thing is CALL YOUR ORDER IN AHEAD OF TIME!!!  The wait in this little place if you don't can be torturous (it's usually not more than 20 minutes, but unless you're literally around the corner, it'll take you about that long to walk there from home/work/hotel/shopping/etc.), so put the number in speed dial (416-504-8155), call your order in, make a mental note of your Order Number, and laugh maniacally at all the people milling about the counter wondering why you're so cool, you can literally walk up, pay and have your awesome food handed over immediately.  And if you think there might be even a teensy-weensy possibility of having a craving over the weekend, be aware they're closed Saturday and Sunday (they dabbled with opening on the weekends, but they've gone back to being closed for whatever reason), so order on Friday, and reheat it in the oven to get your fix (reheats really well - just do it in the original foil container sans lid).  Also, don't be a jerk!  I've seen some pretty atrocious behaviour in there when it gets super-busy, with some pretty racist comments about language skills thrown around.  These folks make some mean food, with probably very little compensation (aside from the actual owners), so be aware that there's a tip jar at the front."}
{"text":"The best indian roti in Toronto - they've truly perfected it. Made fresh to order, my favorite filling is Muttar Paneer.  Though lacking in feng shui, it's a pleasant place to sit while you wait to take your food home and the service is friendly.  They mean it when they say \"hot\". It's taken me years to work up to medium-hot."}
{"text":"Order: Butter Chicken Roti  My friend and I were researching places to eat during my stay in Toronto, and having nothing but raving reviews on Yelp, we made sure to pencil in this destination.  And in short, this place is well deserving of the compliments it receives.  And although this place really doesn't need another 5-Star review, I would walk away feeling like a bad person if I didn't give it to them otherwise.   This place is a hole in the wall to the max.  There's a total seating for like 12 people.  And yet this place constantly has a queue for it's delicious rotis.  If you've had roti before, you should check this place out.  It may just change your life.  Portions are perfect, but you can be adventurous and split orders with friends for the best experience.  A friend had  banana lassi and said it was really good too.  Don't let the looks of the place or the long lines dissuade you.  A little goes a long way, and that definitely holds true for this treasure on Queens.  [Pros] - a-mazing, authentic, flavorful roti - cheap cheap cheap  [Cons] - hole-in-the-wall: so not the best place for a relaxing sit-down dinner - cash only"}
{"text":"delicious chicken tikka masala...   a little salty for my liking but no doubt one of the best tikka masala ever!"}
{"text":"This place is SMALL. About as big as a freight elevator. They have a fish cut out above their door for some reason.  Great affordable roti. They tend to have a line up so place your order ahead of time via a phone call. To simplify things put their number in your cellphone as you never know when you'll be walking towards Gandhi's and say... \"Mmmmm, I could go for some Gandhi's\". If you don't call, then make sure you don't walk past the place because the smell of delicious roti will make you WANT Gandhi's. Then you'll have to wait for being indecisive.   When they sell you a hot it is very hot. When they sell you a medium it is also kind of hot. If your not used to hot foods then you will be able to feel the hot spice as it travels throughout  your digestive track... all the way to the end (if you catch my drift). Order a Mild.  Everything I've tried here is very tasty.   Footnote regarding the previous comment about them being closed on weekends. That is only for the summer. I can't say when they consider the summer over though."}
{"text":"Some people have an addiction to coffee, others to alcohol and/or illegal substances, maybe even all the above.. Me? No... Hi my name is Lynda, I am addicted to Gandhi.   I'm not saying that my addiction is any better, but one taste of Gandhi's mouth watering rotis and you'll understand.  One roti is enough for two people to comfortably share, or if you have a boyfriend like mine, uncomfortably stuffs one person (wear those elastic waisted pants if you plan on finishing one el-solo).  Most rotis, maybe even all of them are less $10 (don't quote me on that one. For sure less everything is than $15), you can't get any better.    Gandhi has both vegetarian and meaty/seafood options. You can specific your level of spiciness, from mild to hot. Personally I love my food spicy.  But unless you like sweating profusely or enjoy having your makeup running down your face as you cry from the pain, medium is a good option for those who like a little heat, but not firecrotch.   A great gem is the Mutter Paneer roti.  Mutter are sweet peas (the Green giant variety) and Paneer meaning indian cheese.  A little language lesson for you, your welcome very much. The end result is a sweet pea mixture with delectable blocks of indian cheese (think a light tasting mozarella having a child with the texture of firm tofu) in a creamy red sauce, very similar to the butter chicken sauce, wrapped in a thin roti. My mouth is watering from the thought, stupid Pavlov.   This place is fairly popular in the area, so I recommend to pre-order about 20 minutes in advance. Don't be fooled from the small store front, or the no frills look inside, it's a rough gem.  Why mess with perfection?  Sometimes rough gems are better left untouched."}
{"text":"Pretty much a hole in the wall. The place is tiny (seats a dozen?), run-down, and no-frills ... I wasn't really expecting anything more and was ready to sit down, but they propped the door open tonight and it was too cold to sit in.   Order ready promptly -- one butter chicken, one chicken, both mild. Prices reasonable. Nice, no-nonsense service.  It was fine ... not great. I liked my chicken, but found the one bite of the butter chicken oddly off. Too creamy? Not enough curry or spice flavour? It was just weird. I didn't like it, but my boyfriend thought it was good.  I found it a little weird and a little awesome that they sold day-old roti for cheaper. Hey, if you can save the couple of dollars, that's cool.  We took ours home, but we've taken other roti home before on similar trips that were better. The edges of the roti wrap were a bit too stiff and dry.    Not sure why it's so highly rated. I  wouldn't come back unless I lived nearby.   Roti Cuisine of India still our favourite, hands-down."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum.  Some of the tastiest butter chicken, MAYBE in the world.  I get the dish with rice, not the roti, but i'm sure it's delicious too.   I don't know what else there is to say besides: -   Get your food to go, it's not a glamorous dine-in experience.   -  One order makes about two meals.  -  You will not regret your dining decision."}
{"text":"No exaggeration... this is one of my top 5 places to eat OF ALL TIME. I used to live in Toronto and would go here quite a bit. I was vegetarian at the time so I never had the opportunity to try anything with meat but the Chana masala roti spicy is bananas. If anyone is interested in overnighting me a Roti from Gandhi's I will pay. Not even kidding. Lol"}
{"text":"Always can count on Ghandi for a great huge roti. Call ahead if you don't want to wait there. Take your order to go and walk north up Bathurst to the park if it's sunny out."}
{"text":"Everybody is right: the food is great, cheap, and HUGE! Come with friends and share, two people per meal!"}
{"text":"Been trying to return here but their hours make it tricky. Tend to close early on weekdays and not open on weekends. So after way too long, found a Friday afternoon to enjoy Ghandi Roti. It's just as good as I remember. Warm, well flavored chicken roti with tomato base. Prices are the same. Decor has been slightly improved! I notice the new tables and chairs and it looks cleaner inside.  This is good food. There was a lineup and took 10 min to receive our order. No wait to get a table  Will return of course, just have to work with their hours. No bathroom btw, this is more of a takeout resto"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Indian curry. I love Malaysian curry which is pretty much the only one I eat, plus I can't take spicy foods. I wasn't planning on eating anything at this restaurant especially since I eat with my eyes, not eyes on the food, eyes on my surroundings. This place was a humongous dump in the ground. I felt diseases creeping through my pants while I sat on the chairs and the table felt like grime had moved in permanently.   I tried some of my boyfriend's butter chicken roti and I was pleasantly  surprised. I loved it! It was very good but spicy, since I can't take any and it was medium spicy. My mouth was now on fire! I then followed up with a bottle of water and an extra roti ($2) for dipping in the extra sauce.   The butter chicken was one of the most expensive on the menu but well worth it. It was humongous and very filling, there's no way I would've been able to finish one on my own.   They aren't open on weekends anymore so try to make your way there during your lunch break or for a nice little dinner treat but remember to call ahead because you may be waiting a while."}
{"text":"My experience at Gandhi Cuisine is somewhat difficult to quantify on the 5 star system.  On the one hand, the roti was delicious, on the other, however, we have the pakora... which I didn't finish, and not because I was too full.  So here's the thing in a nutshell:  I decided to get the day-old lamb roti, just as an experiment, then, as an afterthought, added a pakora for snacking on until I got home.  I assumed the pakora was made fresh (or at least recently).  No way.  It was dry and spongy, the sort of thing that happens to deep fried dough after it's been sitting a long time.  I can only guess that it was at least \"day old\", which just isn't cool.  The roti, as said, was delicious, and you would have fooled me had you told me it was fresh made.  Tender, massive, tasty... with melt in your mouth chunks of lamb.  It was at least 4 star worthy.  Odd how the day old tasted fresh, and the fresh tasted day old.  Messin' with my mind, man!  As the restaurant should be graded on more than just its specialty, I've gotta dock it a mark for that nasty pakora.  Sorry, Gandhi...  We also just tried Mother India, though only had the roti (delicious, as expected).  I'll wait on reviewing this sister (mother) restaurant until I've had a couple other menu options.  I'll avoid the pakora, however, as it looked exactly the same as the sponges at Gandhi Cuisine."}
{"text":"A small dingy restaurant for food to go. There are 4 tables so most likely there won't be room to eat there. If you do eat there, beware you will smell like food. I shared a tikka masala chicken roti for 11.95 (med heat). It was quite spicy and was satisfied with just half of it. I think there was definitely more sauce than veg or meat. Somehow it disappears at a good rate as you eat the roti.  I also tried the vegetarian samosa for $1.50. The sauce it comes with tastes different compared to other samosa places. The crust was not very crisp and thick. It was warmed up via microwave. Filling included mostly potato and rice. Not as herby as other places."}
{"text":"BEST INDIAN TAKE-OUT OF ALL TIME. A must try. Butter chicken Roti will change your life. Its sister location Mother India is just up the street (closer to Lansdowne)  and is equally as good (same menu)."}
{"text":"okay, so i was craving Saag Paneer, made the trip to Gandhi's. I ordered my Saag paneer roti and also asked if i could get some saag paneer on it own to go(sans roti as it goes well with rice). Was told that i had to pay full price for just saag paneer with no roti, so i opted to just get the saag roti(seems like a rip off to me). got home to enjoy satisfying my craving.....disappointed. the roti was dry and tough, i ask for extra spicy, it bordered on mild to neutral, 5 pieces of paneer in that whole roti. Not impressed, seems that they have lowered their standards and spice level to more western tastes. Not worth the money or the wait time."}
{"text":"Pretty good lamb roti, though I think Ghandi Cuisine is subscribing to the quantity over quality method. Though I'm a fan of spicy food, I thought the \"medium\" a touch overwhelming, making the roti less flavourful. I would have been happy with a smaller portion, accompanied with rice, maybe, and though the price is good for the portion you get, once you add a mediocre mango lassi to the equation, your wallet doesn't really feel the savings. I'm told the butter chicken is really good, though."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala Roti and it was delicious! They let you choose a spice level and I chose medium. If you're sensitive to spiciness then I recommend that you go for mild. The medium spice level was perfect for me, it has a good kick and spice burn. The chicken tasted fantastic!"}
{"text":"Almost a five....just couldn't quite get there. Really tasty and just the right level of hot.  Butter chicken, saag paneer, and chicken tiki masala....all very tasty. Medium is just the right kick for me and the roti is soft and warm. I did the takeout because it seems as though you're really better off headed way west to Mother India for the sit down.  Given the mutiple fans, I can agree why this place is popular. Call ahead and enjoy the goodness."}
{"text":"This place serves delicious East Indian roti, as well as other East Indian cuisine.  The man who own/runs the restaurant (I've never been sure if his name was actually Gandhi or not) is a spice master from India, and that level of quality really comes through in the food.  For anywhere from 7-12 dollars, you can get a variety of roti flavours, including goat, chicken masala and channa, amongst many others.  They're all delicious, but make sure you choose your level of spice correctly.  Even their mild has a bite to it, and if you enjoy spicy food, go for the medium.  I'd only recommend trying the hot if you're a hero.  Or crazy.  The roti's are very large in size, and depending on your appetite can easily be turned into two meals.  I'll often eat one at my desk while working, slowly picking away at it for an hour or however long it takes to finish.  If I could stop myself from eating the whole thing at once, I'd do the two meal thing... but it's just that good.  One downside that people should be aware of is the lunch time wait.  If you want this roti for lunch, make sure you phone ahead.  Often the wait is an optimistic 30-60 minutes, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Best Indian take out in Toronto hands down. This has been a staple of mine for almost 10 years and I always tell my friends/co-workers about Ghandi :) There are 5 levels and 3 is that perfect heat (and I usually make my food extra-spicy in other restaurants). I recommend never getting the 5 because you will burn from inside out, for real."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Lunch, take-out Specialty: Roti Menu items: Lamb Roti, Butter Chicken Roti  Let's be honest. I am not an Indian food expert, nor have I had the chance to try many places in the city that specialize in this cuisine. However, what I do know about is a good meal when I taste it, coupled with praise from fellow co-workers, bloggers and review sites. And Gandhi is just one of those places.  Known in the city as the \"best roti\" in town, Gandhi serves enormous amount of roti orders to the Queen west crowds. With a pre-order time of approximately 30 mins and a pick-up wait time of about 10, my colleagues and I enjoy our $8.00 Rotis like its nobody's business. Most of us finish the whole take-out tray in one seating, hoping not to pass out at work afterwards; others opt to share it, while others save some to take home for dinner.  So what is it about their Roti that makes us all come back for more and crave on our Friday lunch runs? Well, a few things... First, the fantastic freshness and texture of the roti shell, which is made fresh everyday at the premises. Second, the succulent and delicious mixture of meat, curry, peas, herbs and some more that enrich the flavour and make it unique; and third, the fact that these pockets of flavour are packed with chunks of meat, not just little pieces of it. I'd be curious as to what their secret ingredient is and what makes it so yummy.  My favourite yet is the Lamb Roti. I like it the best for its unique flavour, spice mix and the fact, as I mentioned, the lamb is present throughout the dish and found in chunks, not hidden in the sauce or additional ingredients. And more importantly, that it pleases my gluttonous self as this lunch portion is just the perfect size for my kind of meal.  Gandhi also offers many vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, like the Butter Chicken Roti, Eggplant with Potato Roti and Channa roti, amongst others. With affordable prices, incredible taste and an excellent location, Gandhi is one of those joints that will live in our working hearts for many years to come.  Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in the entire city. Hands down. And looking at my belly, that should tell you something.  This place is magical. I'd give up my first born to be able to make this shit at home. I'd be 400lbs, unable to move, and the happiest prick on the planet.  The only problem with the place is that they are no longer open on weekends   *ahem*  seriously though Gandhi's is a Toronto treasure and gives me a reason to live."}
{"text":"Roit doesn't get any better than this and I've looked high and low for a place closer to me but I still go all the way down to this place for a great bit of takeout.  You will NOT be able to go back to west Indian roti after this.  They have tables but they are really a formality and the roti is the perfect takeout food staying hot for a very long time so even if you are just passing by grab a roti to go.  The only bad thing about this place is that they are not closer to where I live, parking can be tricky but its the area.  One word of warning, this place respects its customers and doesn't give the \"white guy special\" like some places do when they are afraid to give folks real spicy food so scale back what you think you can take.  If you like Medium get mild, if you like hot get medium and so on."}
{"text":"Why am I still surprised that I'm consistantly dissapointed when I go to spots that are so hyped? Nothing can live up to it's legend. Was hoping for a 5 star.  On Monday at 9pm the service was friendly, and quick. Only took ten minutes. Prices are good for the quality of the food and the massive portions.  I went with a friend and we split:  CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA ROTI - $10.95 - We asked for it super spicy. It wasn't at all (I have an extremely high spice tolerance). Maybe because we're both really white and they didn't think we could take it lol? The roti seemed to be baked, so it wasn't chewy, which was dissapointing. Lots of chicken, great. Sauce was tasty,  although nothing special. OK, but not a fan.   The following we ate with chili sauce and (free) tamarind sauce at the server's recomendation, thanks!  SAMOSA - $1.50 - Good samosa. Not cheap though.   PAKORA - $1.50 - I've never had one before. It was pretty good but mostly tasted like oil, and was kind of hard and chewy.   I should say that I have only had Carribean roti before, and I don't love tikka masala (friend's choice) so perhaps I just need to return with altered expecations, and Vindaloo on the brain. But they better make it SPICY!"}
{"text":"The BEST Indian style roti I've had in Toronto, best Carribean style is still ROTI HUT (unfortunately in Scarborough, ewwww; Scarborough, not The Roti Hut.   The butter chicken roti at Gandhi is SPECTACULAR.  Great flavor, taste; prepared fresh.  A bit pricey but soo good it's worth it."}
{"text":"This place is really great. I haven't found a better place downtown. I'm still looking though. I have had better but there's nothing wrong with Gandhi."}
{"text":"My god this place is good! Even though it's a good 25 minute walk from where I work, we make a point of going there once a month to pick up rotis because they're crazy-flavourful. I always get the lamb roti (very rich and savoury) but I've also tried the chicken, chicken vindaloo, and saag paneer rotis and they're all excellent as well.  I would recommend going one step in spicyness less than you would usually order (eg I usually order food medium, here I order mild-medium) so that you can fully taste the wonderful curry filling without being overwhelmed by the heat.  The meals are cheap and large enough for two lunches... people eat here but I'd recommend calling ahead and doing takeout, as the ambiance isn't exactly existent."}
{"text":"I had passed by Gandhi several times but never thought to visit. Then I saw a segment on YouTube that featured this spot (Dining on a Dime with Lucas Peterson from Eater). After watching the segment, I just had to come for a visit.  I came on a weekday around 11:30am and surprisingly the place was empty. I ordered the butter chicken roti - hot. I love my spicy food and 99% of the time, hot isn't really hot. However, this was actually reasonably spicy!   I could see my roti and chicken being prepared fresh. They packed it into a neat little box and away I went. I was surprised that the roti did not get soggy or leak (in the way that burritos do) - and the filling stayed piping hot despite my long walk home. I was very excited to dig in.  Guys, it was delicious. I had read mixed things about shrinking portions, lack of chicken, etc.... but for me the portion was quite generous. I was stuffed at the end and actually didn't even end up eating much dinner. Yes, there are some potatoes but I had a reasonable about of chicken cubes as well. The sauce was spicy, creamy and was bursting with flavour.   Would I consider this \"dining on a dime\"? For $11.95+tax, it's not the thriftiest lunch I've had - a burrito of comparable size might be a few dollars cheaper - but it was well worth it and I would definitely return on a hungry day."}
{"text":"gandhi is the kind of place where the food is so good that once youve managed to devour half of your roti you really have to wrestle with yourself not to keep shoving the rest down your throat.  you look at your food and feel that youve been cheated. or more like you were born with an inadequate size stomach; like maybe if you try harder, you could stuff the other half in your lungs and digest it there.  (dammit.  i knew this was going to happen.  i would sit here, basking in the glory and description of gandhi, and sure enough the cravings would start again.  gonna need to put on another patch.)  its fair enough to say that probably anything you get there will be awesome.  my favorite is the saag paneer roti, which is spinach and cheese (not like you might envision it unless you know what saag is.)  i also get the mateer panner which has the same cheese, peas, and potatoes.  And of course, if you want something even more rich get the butter chicken.  each roti runs about 10 bucks and if you like you can snack on a samosa while you wait, which you will, for about 20 minutes.  Put the phone number in your phone and speed dial baby.  (Besides, its funny to have a contact named Gandhi.)"}
{"text":"I finally made the trek to Ghandi Cuisine. This little shit hole has the best roti in the city. I got the butter chicken medium-spicy and it was delicious. If you are sensitive to spice play around the mild end. The serving is absolutely huge. It felt like 3lbs of food was handed to me. Under the recommendation of others on this site, I called ahead. Man, am I glad that I did as you could get stuck to waiting a very long time for your food. CALL! You'll thank me later.   The decor isn't really much. It really is a shit hole. Walking in there is nothing fancy, a few tables and chairs, usually filled with people waiting for their meals, a display case with samosas and some other fried stuff, and not much else. The staff is very nice and helpful.  Overall, it is an absolute dive with great roti. Get stuffed with great food for $12. Totally worth it. I recommend calling ahead, picking up, and eating outside somewhere. You should have left overs with the amount of food but you may find yourself finishing it as it is delicious."}
{"text":"Roti was so tasty and flavorful!! Very authentic Indian cuisine~  I ordered the saag paneer roti ( spinach and indian cheese) to go. It was packaged in an aluminium box which helps it keep hot for a long time! Indian cheese tasted like the combination of tofu and quebec cheese curd. Very good~ Every roti was cooked after ordering so changing to other dish would be charged for $5. That's reasonable. One-day old roti was only 7.95+tax, and I think I will go back to buy some home because I find that it was still delicious if I reheated it the day after.  Friendly staff would tell me about the ingredients when I cannot understand the menu.  Good experience."}
{"text":"I used to go to Gandhi all the time because I worked 1 block away from it.  Since I changed my job, I am distant away for my favour roti place for 1.5 years.  Finally, I decided to go back to get my fix tonight and it was a total disappointment.  The favour is not the same any more.  It's not as rich flavor as it used to be.  On top of that, my whole roti has only 2 small pieces of lamb meat inside.  All I tasted was the sauce, potato and the wrap.  Overall, I am very disappointed with my meal.  It will be hard for me to go back again anymore.  I really hope they will go back to their original style of cooking for sake of other customer."}
{"text":"Not bad!  First of all, you can see the roti being freshly rolled out, and your filling being freshly cooked (not coming out from some bucket). Portion was the perfect size for what you are paying for. I had the butter chicken roti. Was good, a little more salt and it would have been perfect. The roti itself was very good.  I should warn you guys, if any of you get \"hot\" on the spicy scale, remember it has to come out eventually! I definitely felt cleansed after eating a medium.   Will def be coming back here to try out the other rotis."}
{"text":"Well, I am not from Indian decent, so I am not sure if I really know what I am talking about....but i'll give you my opinion anyway. I just LOVED it! I thought the spice was right on, the medium was excellent; not too spicy but a good amount of kick. The raita is a little weird with those seeds in it, I  have only been served it with vegetables at other establishments. The mint chutney wasn't fabulous, but I mixed it with the raita and it really complimented my Butter Chicken Roti. I wasn't too pleased with the fact that they told us it would be ready in 8 min and it turned into 20+, but hey...I am late a lot as well. We will def be returning, and I suggest that you should too! So why the five stars...because it's freaking good!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Heaven in your mouth? Yes ... yes it is ....  I've watched it grow in popularity over the past few years, and with that, the prices have really increased.  While it's still amazing to eat, it's freakin' expensive now.  Seating is very limited, and it's always crammed packed, so call ahead & order to save yourself 30 minutes of waiting.  Oh, and it's not open on the weekend, which sucks.   My fav: saag paneer."}
{"text":"After being told that I must try Roti while I am in Toronto, my friend and I ended up looking up the best place for Roti in Toronto and we ended up here. Gandhi is not a large restaurant and only has a few tables. Plus the AC was not working that day, so we ended up taking our food to Trinity Bellwoods park, which is just a 10 minute walk west of the restaurant. I suggest grabbing your food and heading there as it is beautiful! Hopefully the air will be working when you go as the owners and staff were friendly and great to talk to--the heat was just distracting.   My friend and I both ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala Roti with a medium spice and it was amazing (they ask you if you want the masala mild, medium, or hot). The medium had just enough herbs and spices; but not so little that it was bland or too hot that your nose and eyes were running. The chicken and vegetables were covered with an amazing red sauce and the roti was thick--to the point where a few times I ate it like a sandwich. I did not mind at all because it was delicious!   We also ordered a vegetarian samosa, which came with a  sweet sauce that brought the flavors of the rice and peas inside the samosa. I ate my samosa after it cooled off, so the crust was not as crispy, but it was still really good!  Ghandi's menu is huge--from vegetarian dishes to chicken dishes and appetizers, they have a great selection. It was difficult to decide what type of roti that we wanted. So, glad I chose the chicken tikka masala, but I feel that any dish I selection would have been great. I would recommend coming here for Roti."}
{"text":"A Toronto treasure, absolutely. Outstanding South Asian roti, flavour and toothsomeness second to none."}
{"text":"A wonderful hole-in-a-wall local spot that cranks out delicious roti. The price is good, the food is authentic and the owner (who usually is at the register) is funny. There are only three tables in the small space, so if the weather cooperates, I would recommend grabbing take out and make a brisk walk down the street to Trinity-Bellwoods Park for an impromptu picnic.  I had the lamb roti on mild spice level and it was wonderful. The roti was piping hot even after a 10 minute walk and each bite was full of flavor. Admittedly, it's a heavy starch-based meal so I could only finish half of the roti and then promptly wanted to take a nap. The flavors are even better the next day, even though the roti got a little too soft.   Come check this place out!"}
{"text":"The other day a group of co-workers decided to order take-out from Ganhdi cuisine for consumption in our office kitchenette area.  One gracious fellow ordered our meals well in advance, picked them up at noon and brought it back to our office.  Thanks Alan!  This time I decided to give the butter chicken roti a try on the medium spicy setting as on the last outing the medium spicy was enjoyable but paired with the volcanic roti temperature was almost too much for me to handle. Perhaps I'm a sucker for punishment.    The roti arrived in the same tin container with the same plastic cutlery and I tore into it with the same ravenous zeal.  This time however I was even more underwhelmed.  The butter chicken was just okay.  Although the chicken was sufficiently moist the butter sauce was not very buttery.  As well there was a large quantity of potato in the mix.  From my experience butter chicken usually consists of chicken cubes and butter sauce.  That's what I've grown accustom to and like.  This recipe is clearly a cost-cutting measure and really detracts from the butter chicken appeal.  The roti itself did not fair well during it's trip from the store to the table.  The top was fine but the bottom absorbed a lot of moisture and got quite soggy.  It was a bit off-putting but overall the roti still tasted quite nice.  Another unanticipated side effect of the 30 minute journey was that the temperature reduced considerably so it didn't burn my mouth this time.  However, the medium spicy was not of the same level as last by a significant margin.  Perhaps curry is more spicy than butter chicken but I would have expected it to be at least in the same ballpark.    So the search continues for the perfect roti.  Next stop, based on Kat F.'s review, is Mother India."}
{"text":"Had my first Gandhi roti experience today at lunch.   I placed an order for pick up over the phone but when I arrived at the restaurant, I ended up having to wait another 20 minutes. This did not bother me too much as I still had plenty of time before my lunch break was over - but I thought it should be made aware for those looking to grab and go.  I got the butter chicken roti ($11.95), which was split amongst my friend and myself. We found the portion to be just perfect for lunch. The roti was soft and easy to cut into, while the butter chicken was tender, creamy and flavourful - but not too overwhelming. Leftovers (if there were any) would have been great to reheat for dinner!  I can see why this place has so many fans and I'll definitely be back to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"Delicious roti sold in rectangular aluminum containers.  It was almost like eating a lasagna with a roti bread texture instead.  This place has a small dining area and location as the store is easy to miss on Queen Street West.  If you do happen to eat inside there, be prepared to have their food odours stay with you after you leave, as the odours are absorbed on to your clothes, due to their open kitchen space and lack of air exhaust crammed up at this tiny location.  So in other words, just wear clothes that you don't like nor do you normally wear out in public if you eat inside here (e.g. a TAP OUT t-shirt, a 98 Degrees concert t-shirt) or take the food and have it to go."}
{"text":"I had the mix vegetable roti. But for $9 (inc tax) I expected more. The roti itself was excellent. But the vegetables were just peas, cauliflower and potato - ie. It got a bit boring. I would suggest Vena's roti instead to be honest."}
{"text":"I'm not going to go at length as to how great Gandhi Cuisine is. The forty-five reviews before me can attest to this little spot's solid reputation as an excellent roti place.   But I will say one thing about Gandhi: if you say that you want your meal to be MEDIUM spicy, fully understand that it actually means HOT. If you like spicy but don't want to your taste buds to be set on fire, get MILD. Don't worry, you won't be considered a wimp if you do."}
{"text":"I have had the curry roti a few times.  I would say 80% of the time, it is awesome.  20% of the time it seems like they are having a bit of a off day, but it is still OK.  I do find the level of spiciness varies quite a bit each time.  Sometimes the medium burns a hole through my pants and sometimes I am left wishing that it had."}
{"text":"I ate here after it was highly recommended by a few friends of mine. I went with the Butter Chicken Roti as that seemed to be the most popular item.  The price was somewhat steep at around $15 and the wait was quite long (which I don't mind if the food is amazing).  I found the butter chicken itself was just ok (I have had much better). I asked for it to be medium after reading all sorts of reviews that medium here was like a hot or extra hot in other places but didn't taste any spice to it whatsoever. The roti itself was probably the best part and was full of flavour. The only other complaint I had was that I felt they were somewhat cheap with the amount of chicken in it and thought they used more potato as a cheap filler not really living up to the $15 price tag.  The portion is massive though and is way too much for 1 person, but overall it was tasty. I won't be rushing back but I would definitely give something else on their menu a try next time."}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten here before you should. I have driven into the city for no other reason than to just get a roti here.   I am glad this is no where near my workplace as I would eat one every day for lunch and would be super fat. I adore the Mutter Paneer.   Now I want a roti."}
{"text":"I've purchased only the Roti shells to go, from this place before and made my own curry at home. That was delicious and a brilliant idea. This was the first time I ordered a whole meal from them. So horrible. Not a good place to go if you're a vegetarian or vegan. Hands down the butter chicken roti is WAAAY better then any of the veggie options. Don't tell, but I tasted my boyfriends butter chicken roti, which he got mild, and it was so much better. Because the real problem was I ordered medium spice and it was so spicy I couldn't taste anything and it totally ruined the meal. I like spice, but the mild butter chicken wasn't even spicy and mine at medium was ridiculous. It was a gross spice too, there was no other flavour in my mouth except burning. All I did was pick off pieces of the roti shell and ate that. I also don't like that the roti shell is wrapped all around the curry, as it gets everything sauced up and soggy. This might be the way its traditionally eaten, I don't know, but I would prefer to have the curry and the wrap separate, which is how I did it when I made it myself. It's also just too much. Too much curry, which ruins the roti shell and its too expensive for what it is. I am so depressed from eating at Gandhi."}
{"text":"Holy Mother of God ...  this place is the be all and end all of my filthiest food fantasies.  I guess i can pretty much sum up my affinity for the Gandhi Butter Chicken Roti with this semi-shameful anecdote:  I once had a friend fly two of them in his suitcase on a plane from Toronto to San Francisco for me.  They arrived still slightly warm, intact and weighing in at about 5 pounds.  Yes, i ate both of them.  No, i didnt die.  And yes i'm a total fucking lardass.   I think i might have seen an apparition of God after eating it which could have been the botulism talking....however, it was still totally worth it."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time when I worked in the area from 2008-2012 but portions are becoming smaller (I ordered a roti today and it didn't fill the container). Also roti is not as good anymore, the folded ends are dry and hard, not chewy and soft like rest of it. Maybe it's because of the machine they are using to roll it? The woman owner is always nice though, the man (I think her husband) not so much."}
{"text":"OMG. Absolutely delicious. Seriously. Do yourself a favour and try their Mattar paneer roti. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, I don't know much about what makes for good food, but I know what I like.. and I like Gandhi Cuisine's Roti a lot.  The portions are huge, the food is tasty, and the prices are reasonable.  I'm with the others that recommend the butter chicken, but there are definitely good vegetarian alternatives.    My only complaint is that it is closed on weekends.  What's up with that?  Any way, as other's have mentioned, Ghandi's is an establishment and institution in Toronto.  So, next you're in the neighborhood, do yourself a favour and give it a shot."}
{"text":"Kind of pricy at around $13 for a meat roti. But the thing is pretty big. they pack it in a small aluminum party tray. There are some serious layers of thick roti on top and as other reviewers say the plastic cutlery makes for difficult incision work.  I've had quite a bit of authentic indian food at a friend's house growing up and this place definitely gets points for authenticity. if you ask for spicy, you get real spicy. none of that pretend spicy because they think you can't take it. Also, you need to call ahead at least 30 minutes before you go to pick up, (it's only takeout) as they get pretty busy at around lunch."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best roti I have ever had in my life we had the butter chciken roti big enough for 2 for 11 bucks and it filled me up. You can choose the level of spiciness and they also have the same dishes with rive as well. Very tasty looking forward to trying their other roti. They make all the roti from scratch very small place but the dishes come out very quickly amazing"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in so long... they're a short block away from the bike workshop where I volunteer in the summer, and sometimes I'll treat myself to a roti on the way home. One roti is three lunches for me, I am not kidding. Saag paneer is my favourite. (They also have an amazing bhel puri, if you want more than a roti.)  I've ordered mild and gotten very very mild so that I could not detect the spice; but I've also ordered medium and gotten something that strips the paint off my tongue. Crazy white girl who thinks she's a pepperhead...  I may have to take a trip out there this winter sometime, even though I'm hardly ever over there outside of bike season."}
{"text":"Like the other reviewers, my last meal on earth would be the butter-chicken roti.  Be warned, the spice levels are NOT dumbed-down to Toronto levels.  The HOT while delicious left me struggling to continue eating because my lips/tongue/mouth were zinging.  Even the medium can be pretty punishing depending on the mood of the kitchen that day.  Mild or medium-mild are my recommendation for the un-initiated.  Warning: if you like shiny, new, clean looking places, you won't like the looks of this place.  It's well used, perhaps to the extent of being \"beaten-up\" looking.  That aside, the fantastic roti make up for any sense of evil you might get from the lack of decor.  What's bad about this place?  They don't have to be open 11am to 3am because they do enough business from 11am to 6pm and they are CLOSED on weekends!!!  Also since it's a take-away place you will only find 2 tables with limited chairs.  Ghandi's is absolutely freakin' fantastic."}
{"text":"Had this place recommended by a friend and read the reviews so we thought we'd give it a try for lunch. Ordered the palaak paneer roti and split it for lunch. We had it medium, which was pretty mild for me but my partner felt it was plenty spicy.   Overall a pretty decent cheap meal. Total came to slightly less than $12 after tax and it was a light lunch for two people. It would have been huge for one of us. It is hard to call it a really great deal though because there were tons of signs for lunch specials at round the same price point on the walk down Queen. I thought that paneer was nicely done but the roti itself just wasn't really my thing. I've never seen these in the us before (at least not that aren't Caribbean) so maybe this is what a rot is supposed to be like. Anyway, rather than being soft and delicious like Indian bread tends to be, this was much more like a tortilla shell, crisp and fried on the grill. It mostly just diffused the flavors and added more calories.  They had a good number of chutneys and lassis and the like. These sides were all rather expensive and would have significantly increased the price of the meal. They seemed like relatively bad value.  Overall, a good and  interesting experience and somewhere I'd eat at a bit if I worked near it, but not a destination for me."}
{"text":"I ordered the saag paneer roti and it was absolutely delicious. The spinach was super creamy and the spice level (mild-medium) was perfect for me. My only complaint is that there there could have been more paneer in it, but there were lots of potatoes and I was still insanely full after finishing about half of the thing (like others have said, they're massive!!)."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say that Gandhi has the best curry or the best roti, but the portion you get for the price is really good. I came here in the mid-afternoon and it was still hard to find a seat."}
{"text":"I called them to place an order for take out.  They had no specials so I ordered Butter Chicken Roti. They said it was going to take 10 minutes to be ready, and it indeed was ready in 10 minutes.  The order ended up being $13.56.  I got charged 5c for a bag, which I did not request.  They also do not accept credit cards, only debit.    The roti was smaller than it used it be, it used to be up to the rip of the container, not it looked deflated.     Summary: Pros: - great taste  Cons: - no Credit Cards - charge for bag  - pretty expensive for what you are getting"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourites in all of Toronto. When I first came to Toronto, a co-worker recommended the place to me and I never went. Years later I did, and I regretted not going sooner. The place is only open on weekdays, but that's because they only need to be open that often... seriously delicious. I love the mutter paneer roti. If you have not been here, and love Indian food, and flavour, go! Sure the place might not look like much, but it comes through on everything that counts."}
{"text":"For me, Gandhi's roti is the ultimate in comfort food. For only about 8 bucks, you get this couple pound tin of chana (my favorite) goodness!   I used to try and eat the whole thing in one sitting, but I quickly learned that it's best to cut it in half before I even begin to eat so that not only do I not feel way too full afterwards, but I also get to enjoy the roti again the next day for lunch.   The last couple times I've been to Gandhi's, it's been unbelievably packed. My advice to you would be to call ahead to place your order so it's ready when you arrive. Oh, and it's cash only."}
{"text":"If I had the option, I'd give it a 4 1/2. I can't quite figure out the kooky algorithm that decided this was Toronto's #1 restaurant, but nevertheless it's pretty fantastic. Toronto's #1 hole-in-the-wall, eat-til-you-can't-walk establishment, perhaps.  Anyway, I've been loving Island Foods' roti since I moved to the city, and I thought I'd branch out today to sample Gandhi's Indian curry-filled roti. My friend and I went after the gym so that we could each eat a whole one of their massive rotis without feeling too awful. The rotis here are about twice the size of your average roti, and about twice the price, so in most cases sharing would be a good idea. I had the chicken vindaloo roti (for some reason not on the menu above the counter, but it is on the takeout menu) and my friend had the butter chicken.  I ordered the vindaloo roti hot, even though I've heard stories about their heat-scale. To my taste it was fantastic... just the right side of unbearably hot, so your sinuses are clear and you feel a bit woozy after eating half your roti. Flavour-wise it's some of the best vindaloo I've had. 5 stars on that. I sampled the butter chicken too, and even though everyone raves about it, I thought it was so-so. Of course having butter chicken in a roti is great, but it's far from the best butter chicken sauce I've had.  It does seem to take a mysteriously long time for your roti to appear, even when it's not busy. (I was there around 3:30, and we were the only ones eating in... from what I hear, you want to avoid mid-day and 5-6pm.) I think the apparent slowness is because they heat portions of curry individually as they're ordered, rather than leaving them all in a steam table as most roti places do. Also people are always calling in for take-out, so even when it seems like there is nobody there, they are probably working on a few other orders.  In any case, definitely worth trying for your roti fix. Other places are just as delicious, with more reasonably-sized and -priced portions, but where else are you going to get a massive flatbread jammed full of perfect vindaloo?"}
{"text":"I was craving for hot Indian food since weather has started to turn bleak already. I went to Gandhi cuisine for dinner with a friend. It is a medium sized restaurant but was pretty busy around 7.30 in the evening. I ordered medium spicy butter chicken and vegetarian samosa. My experience was mixed. First of all, the samosas were absolutely great so was my roti. But the chicken in the butter chicken was little bit hard to chew which gave me the impression that it was slightly undercooked, I could use some more chicken in a 12 something dish as well. I have to admit, the smell and the gravy was amazing. Perhaps, it was my bad luck to have a bad portion. My friend had lamb and roti and he thought it was delicious. Overall, I will be going back perhaps but my first experience did not match my expectation."}
{"text":"So, this is another restaurant Yelp led us to while in Toronto.    We wanted to try as many different types of food as we can.  While dining here, we shared the Chicken Tikka Masala Roti.  They have different levels of spiciness you can get and my boyfriend ended up getting something in the middle cause he wanted to play it safe.    I kind of wish we got the spicier one instead!!!  It was pretty good the way we had it but I'm sure I would have loved it more if it was spicy.  I wish yelp had .5 ratings cause if they did, I'd actually give Ghandi a 3.5."}
{"text":"To me, Gandhi roti is a very confused establishment that at best is at par with what decent Pakistani/Indian food should taste like.    Mohandas Gandhi was a very compassionate man who taught mutual tolerence between individuals of different creeds.  Being raised under Jain traditions, he was in fact a vegetarian and thus it boggles my mind that a shop called Ghandi roti prides themselves on their butter chicken wrap.    Lets forget about that and talk about the actual establishment.  Coming from a Pakistani household, i can vauge for the authenticity of the roti (chapati) and confirm that the roti made here to make the wraps is a delight to eat!  I enjoyed the fact that you can watch the kitchen staff make the roti's right in front of your eyes...this makes for 5 minutes of heavy duty excitement in between doodling your thumbs and playing on your iPhone as you wait a half hour before finally getting a roti-wrap from this restaurant.    I had what they call a premium roti as well as a mango lassi...which together cost about $16!  After having tried the butter chicken and the lamb korma wraps, all i could wonder was now what?!?!  Was there a hidden buffet hiding in my roti that i failed to discover?!?!    The butter chicken was alright, but not great.  I thought the lamb korma was better...but again, nothing to be raving about like most of the reviews below.  I understand the lack of good Indian restaurants in Toronto, but Lahore Tikka House on Gerrard street certainly knows how to fill a craving for Pak-indian cuisine.  Outside of Mississauga (Cafe du Khan or the Kebab), I save all my praise relating to Pakistani and Indian cuisine for the almighty Lahore Tikka House.    I dont like putting a price on GOOD food...but $16 for a roti stuffed with Indian food and a lassi is not good bang for the buck to me.  I dont wanna hate on this establishment, the food was good and worthy of a try however personally, I wasnt at all impressed and i thought that this place did not at all live up to the hype that has resinated on Yelp and throughout the online community.  I'm not saying that Ghandi's Roti is bad Indian food, im just saying if you think this is good, then you should be excited because real Indo-Pakistani food will absolutely blow your mind!     CHAKDAI INDIA! Salaams n namaste folks!"}
{"text":"OMG....I love this place. How I miss it in LA now.  Word of caution: they aren't kidding when they say HOT. I was on fire when I tasted my hubby's spicy chicken tikka masala roti. It was really good but super spicy for me. I told them to make my medium spicy and that was just perfect (spicy enough but at least edible!). Unless you want to look like a dragon breathing fire, avoid telling them to make your order spicy...you have been warned! Also, keep in mind, the serving size is huge, so 2 people can easily share one dish.  It's a small place and the rotis come out warm and all ready to be devoured. We tried the chicken tikka masala and Spinach potato rotis and they were perfect in every way. Delicious! They also have a lot more veggie options (potato and cauliflower, chickpeas, eggplant etc....I wish I had 2 stomachs, so I could try some more!).   It's cheap, tasty and cash only. Best rotis I've had outside of India. I wish they would open a location in LA....I would be a regular!"}
{"text":"Great roti with decent vegetarian section. While there is a few tables on site this is definitely a take out place. Orders are filled pretty quickly (within 5 mins). I usually get the chicken Tikka roti but their butter chicken  is probably what they are known best for. Prices are fair since the meals are large and very filling."}
{"text":"My Roti was prepared in under 5mintues. The channa roti was a bit heavy on the potato, which I found disappointing. I also found the filling to be a bit greasy for me. Value for price was just ok and they are standard size rotis from my experience. I easily ate mine so I don't know why people are saying they are huge.   If I am in the hood I would eat here, but this is not my favourite roti place in the City. Its ok, not great."}
{"text":"good portion, fair quality, good price. just the type of food I want for my lunch and maybe even to save for a little bit for a later snack. Just be cautious, mild is pretty spicy so if you are not a big fan of spicy food, mild is hot enough."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious West Indian-style rotis. Probably best in the city. The butter chicken and saag paneer have both proven fairly addictive.   Large portions. It's not a bad idea to split a roti with someone - which, at $13.00, is a cheap meal for two.  Nice takeout to enjoy in a nearby park."}
{"text":"VIBE  I avoided the ramshackle yellow sign reminiscent of the 70s for years. Big mistake. Inside there are these chairs covered in some grey corduroy fabric (also from the 70s I assume) and the lighting is off. But who cares about the vibe? Let's talk food.   I EAT I only get one thing here and it's the butter chicken roti. I feel like I get a good amount of chicken; at the same time the buttery, creamy sauce makes me forget about everything, so I can't really estimate. But it's a tad pricey at $13 to $15 (with a pop). That said, I'm always satisfied after I have my roti and have learned never to judge a book by its cover.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK I love the food here. I won't do a Bollywood dance to celebrate my love of their roti but I think it would be quite entertaining.   PS  Call ahead 20 minutes to order, so you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"You often hear that some of the best places to get food, are those non-descript \"hole-in-the-wall's\".  Well this has never been more true than with Gandhi Cuisine.  They make their own roti shells in-house.  Ingredients, spices, etc, are always fresh, and you get a LOT of food for what you pay for (You can easily split a roti into two meals, unless you're a serious eater!).  Only flaw with this great place, and why I deducted a star, is that there is no consistency when it comes to spicy heat.  I used to always order \"Medium\", which is normally just fine... however sometimes the medium will be WAY too hot.  I'm talking nose running, eye watering HOT.  In which case I usually add yogurt to the roti to cool things down. I've resorted to always ordering the mild and adding my own heat.  Not really an issue as they're still delicious!  For lovers of heat...or those who like a challenge, go right on ahead and order the HOT.  Which roti you decide on is entirely up to you...there are no wrong choices here!"}
{"text":"great flavors! more packed with flavor than other indian food i've had (in Philadelphia.)  Spicy isn't notably hotter than medium though.  While roti was novel for Indian food, I did like the lamb biryani, the only item we got that wasn't roti because it had better flavors."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Ghandi's for almost fifteen years. It is one of my favourite restaurants, if not my favourite. Two or three years ago the chef changed, and the food suffered a little. But I had a chicken roti tonight, and it's back to the perfect combination of sweet/tangy/saucy/thick that makes their rotis so good.  Here, the perfect meal for me is a chicken roti, a side of mango chutney washed down with a mango carrot juice. My ultimate comfort food.   Thank-you Ghandi Cuisine! Now accepting Interac!"}
{"text":"the roti is fresh and there's good depth of flavor in the curries. their deliciousness will help you to ignore the décor."}
{"text":"Perfect.  Mixed veg rotis are stuffed with delicious veg curry and priced reasonably. I would eat this everyday if I could. Great for take out when you don't feel like eating in the tiny table area or a quick meal on lunch hours from work or take out when you just don't want to cook.  go with the medium if you want any kind of heat.  Friends of mine have said it's THE best place to get rotis downtown and so far I have to agree with them.  Bring cash, no debit. Samosas and pakoras are great as well."}
{"text":"Meh. I don't know what the cult following is about. The curry I had was pretty ordinary, a lot of potato bulking it out (it was a lamb curry) and a small serving for the price. They wouldn't swap out the rice for naan instead. Not hugely impressed, but I'm sure they are not going out of business anytime soon - they're always busy."}
{"text":"Yeah...this place wasn't at all what I was thinking it would be. I guess I'm accustomed to Indian restaurants where you sit down and enjoy a full menu. This place on the other hand had about 6 different \"rotis\" to choose from. The take home copy of the menu consists of a half sheet of paper, one sided.  I ordered the mild spice, chana roti. Chana being a traditional chick pea dish found in Northern India. The meal was not bad offering a large portion but at a slightly higher price than I think it should cost ($9). It was something I would eat again when I'm in need of something fast and healthy but it's not something I would get excited about. Perhaps this place is more a of hit for meat eaters.  I had higher expectations with this resto. since it has been on the Yelp.ca top restaurant list for months now, not to mention the individual reviews of \"best roti place\"."}
{"text":"Not much (or anything) for presentation, as it's served in a foil loaf pan with plastic cutlery and plastic bagged, but it's delicious!! Go for the matar paneer or the saag paneer. The butter chicken is pretty decent but I go there for the matar paneer, which is basically paneer with peas and potatoes. So yummy! They raised their prices recently, which makes me not so happy, since their \"restaurant\" is still a hole in the wall on Queen West, and their food still looks like barf (but still tastes delicious)."}
{"text":"Temple of Indian Roti goodness. Pretty sure curry served in a pizza pocket like Roti wrap isn't authentic to most, but it sure does make up for it in taste! Got recommended to me years ago and I still dream of it on late night outs. I've had most of the varieties by now but the Malai Kofta is by far my fav. If I'm extra hungry, I'll add lamb for good measure.  Ghandi Pro Tip#242: Ease into the spice if its your first time and work your way up.   Mild=Medium Medium = Extra Hot Hot = Ain't no Tabasco Extra Hot= Human Jet Fuel x2 days Extra Extra Hot= Irreversible Damage"}
{"text":"The butter chicken roti is amazing!!! It gets really busy at lunch, so probably good to call ahead to place your order. Also really enjoy the mango lassi. I wish there were more lunches in the day to try more things."}
{"text":"I've been haunting these digs for the past 8 or so years, and I have to say I'm definitely a fan. This place visually-speaking is nothing on the inside: a few scattered tables, and you literally walk in to their entire kitchen area. One person making and pressing fresh roti through a machine, one chopping onions, one stirring the pot, and a no-nonsense feel on the interior, with a basic menu at the front. I actually like being able to see what goes on in that magical kitchen..   It's a really delicious twist to traditional roti in that it's east indian curries that fill the inside of these delectable delights. The roti/bread itself is also perfect - it's not greasy or too thick, but a perfect texture to house wonderful concoctions on the inside..   This place is a complete Queen West landmark, and I would reco if ordering out, to call ahead so you won't have to wait for them to make your fresh roti which can take 10-15 mins a pop... My personal fave has always been the chicken roti (I am a total creature of habit when I love something) and tend to order it medium-spicy. Also adding eggplant to the mix can be quite delicious.. but you'll be spending about $2-$3 more per roti on that note..   Over the years, I have found the rotis to definitely get smaller (I am a girl who can EAT!), and spicier.. I've cut down from hot to medium, and I do find that the rotis don't fill the takeout pans as much as they used to, but all in all, still damn delicious. You also know a place is damn good when it's can sustain itself by only being open Mondays-Fridays only. Booyah. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Good food, good portions, so tasty.  This is a simple looking place that you could walk by a hundres times without stopping in, it really does not look like much but the food is so good. The butter chicken roti is big enough for 2 sittings but tasty enough to eat in one."}
{"text":"It's okay. I found there wasn't enough butter chicken and too much rice. The naan bread was oily on the outside and dry on the inside. Not really my go to place for indian food. Especially on queen street west."}
{"text":"There really isn't much to say about this as I'm sure by now you've read a million great reviews about it already. So I'll tell you now. Believe the hype. I've been here many times, and thought I should finally write a review ha.  Portions are meant for two.  Price is reasonable.  They don't hold back when it comes to roti stuffing.  Very limited seating.  Personally, I love beef/goat in roti. I just think it absorbs the seasonings and whatnot a lot better and the way the meat breaks down is just perfect. I preferred the goat roti over chicken. But both were really good. Mild-medium was just right for me.  My ONLY concern was when I came back another time and the roti had shrunk and was oversalted. But that was on a bad day and I forgive them."}
{"text":"It's alright here. The Chicken Tikka is NOT authentic, it's slathered in ketchupy sauce. The butter chicken has potatoes in it...what? I actually googled this and found a forum with users asking this same question and wondering what's going on here. If anyone from Ghandi's is reading this GET RID OF IT. Price for what you get is okay, not really cheap but not overly expensive either.  The rotis are alright, service was fast as we called our order ahead and portions are pretty big but manageable. I felt a little sick after I ate it, so I think eat half of the butter chicken roti if you have a sensitivity to creamy things.  Just don't get the chicken tikka one. Ghandi's please use original recipes and it'd be the best!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to  go here for a while but it's closed on Sundays.   Finally, i got there and what a disappointment!    Some Indian pancake surrounding a few pieces of chicken, a couple of potato chunks in a gross sauce is definitely not what i would call Toronto's best roti.  It lacked some other filling and for $12 I definitely prefer to go to a restaurant such as Lahore House, where all sauces are much better.  Lassi is too sugary and missed as well.  The raita similarly lacks the small cucumbers pieces.  Typing this review one hr later I'm already hungry."}
{"text":"Butter chicken was delish!  And, so was the mixed vegetable. I would recommend ordering it mild to medium spicy.  Anymore, it's just spicy curry and you'll probably get a stomach ulcer.  Make sure you have milk with you.  My boyfriend and his brother can usually handle the heat but they were humbled after coming here.  We shared the two portions with 4 people and thought it was adequate.  Although, we did have a nice dessert afterwards.  The portions are pretty large and I'm glad we were able to portion control it since we had 4 ppl.  It tastes good but if you keep eating you probably won't feel too good after.  It's probably packed with tons of calories. I would go back but I would like to try the other roti places as well."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food from the butter chicken to the vindaloo.  The rotisserie also great as it is done in a more traditional manner."}
{"text":"Tasty, filling, and relatively inexpensive rotis ($10-12). Large samosas.   I usually do the Chicken Jalfrezi, but I've had all of their chicken offerings plus the goat curry roti and they're all delicious.  They could stand to put more meat and less potatoes in their rotis; I don't think I've been anywhere else that puts potatoes in their butter chicken. Meatier rotis would make this review a 5."}
{"text":"If I was in Toronto for takeout, or had to suggest a place for someone at a low price range, it would be Gandi's without a doubt.  The super sucky part is that Gandi and Mother India were my first experiences with Indian style roti. They set the bar super high, meaning I was just facing disappointment after disappointment for the next couple of places I had roti. Those jerks.  Of course beware the spice level if you are a novice, but definitely beware missing this amazing place if you're ever in the area and want takeout."}
{"text":"I have been going to Gandhi Roti for quite some time now and I have never been disappointed. I have tried their butter chicken roti,Spinach roti and mixed veg roti and all of them are great.The roti is soft and the filling tastes amazing too. However,they do not joke around with their spice level.If you ask them to make it spicy,they will actually make it too spicy to handle.  The seating arrangement is not good and most of the people order take-out.The place doesn't seem very clean as well.The price is also very high but the quantity is a lot so if I buy it for lunch,I end up saving it and eating for dinner as well."}
{"text":"I remember coming here, it was night out and really late and I was craving for Indian good.  I got the butter chicken roti, but was kind of thrown off from the 1 day old roti sign.. I asked them if they could make my roti fresh, and they said yes, so I got one (medium spicy).. Not bad at all, although I had better, it was delicious."}
{"text":"A Toronto staple! Do not fail to try Gandhi's rotis!  Where West Indian meets East Indian= WOOOF!!! Large portions (two sittings if you can pry yourself away from it)... savory sauces nestled in warm and crispy roti wraps. I have nothing but praise for Gandhi's culinary treats.  Be prepared for a slight wait in rush hour, as in my experience there's always a line up at this Queen street west treasure. Day old rotis are half price and warm up just fine.  Also consider it more of a pickup spot; it's not very roomy and in need of serious renovations. But despite its modest accueil, Gandhi does not wane in popularity. So if you live in the area, buy roomier pants. If you don't, google map directions and make a trip happen.   I (highly) RECOMMEND: the butter chicken roti mild or medium."}
{"text":"This is in my top 3 favorite spots of all time. I can't tell you how much I love their Rotis. I didn't think it was possible to love food that much. Can someone send one to California? Extra spicey please!"}
{"text":"Samosa and butter chicke. Roti I love you.. I am heading back there next week and so so cant wait to chomp on one of them..Just thinking about eating one is making my belly want to do a little dance of happyness..."}
{"text":"There is a reason you don't see any photos of my lamb roti (spiced between mild and medium)! I got it to go and I ate it. I pigged out on one delicious roti. Fresh made roti to order and stuffed with sticky sweet spicy savoury tangy goodness with tender lamb pieces. The person at the desk was even nice enough to throw in a sampling of mango garlic chutney. The roti here is thin and plain and compliments the filling so well.  I am SO going back.  Service was excellent - polite and welcoming.  Food was great!"}
{"text":"This small shop on Queen west serves delicious roti. The restaurant itself isn't much to look at: it's sweltering inside, and there is only a handful of seating. It also smells like the inside of an Indian spice cabinet; an aroma which may follow you for hours after your visit. The service is perfunctory, but that's not important. Their rotis are just that good.  The portion sizes are indeed enormous and the prices most reasonable. While you *could* consume a whole roti in a sitting, it's completely reasonable (and advisable) to share. No matter how many bites you take the roti will seemingly not decrease in size. And somehow it stays piping hot forever. Forget geothermal, I think the solution to our world's energy woes are contained deep within these savoury beasts.  I've tried the butter chicken, the saag paneer and the channa varieties here and they're flawless. The hot is hot, so tamer tongues ought to stick with medium spice. They also serve obscenely large pakoras and samosas (seriously huge), lassi, gulab jamun, chutneys, and rice dishes. While I may try those other things, I will for sure return for a roti. And soon.  Obligatory Title Pun: Here today, GANDHI tomorrow.  Menu Readability: For the love of all that is holy: Gee. Eh. Enn. Dee. Aich. Eye. Memorize this.   Need to mention: A day old roti is $5 off. Tempting, right?  What this place teaches me about myself: Call me a stickler, but the man emancipated an entire country from colonial rule. Can't y'all spell his name right?"}
{"text":"The paneer tikka Masala was ok not that good Gravy was not fresh and had Color added.  I didn't like the paneer tikka Masala.  The cost was 12.95+tax expensive for the quality."}
{"text":"At the corner of Queen St W and Bathust is a hole-in-the-wall Indian eatery that serves casserole-sized Indian dishes wrapped in roti. Almost like an Indian burrito, if you will, but much larger. I ordered the butter chicken roti ($12). This thing is massive. There's enough food for two meals, so pace yourself or you will regret it. There are 3 spice levels, mild, medium, and hot. The medium is pretty spicy.  The food is decent. Though I would prefer half the food at a lowered cost.  Cash only."}
{"text":"Love the rotis here! Some of my favourite food in this area, and some of my favourite Indian food.  Good veg selection, with eggplant, spinach, chickpeas, and more."}
{"text":"The Saag Paneer roti (ordered 'very hot') is one of my favorite things to eat in Toronto.  Unfortunately the Toronto Star recently sent one of these to a lab for analysis, and found that it contains 1500 calories, 75 grams of fat, and more salt than Wendy's 'triple baconator'.  (Search the Star's website for the word 'outrageously' and read all about it.)  I wouldn't have expected it to be a health food, but this is beyond the pale.  I've more or less cut Gandhi's out of my routine.  I don't know whether all of their rotis are this outrageously unhealthy, but plainly nutrition isn't a consideration in preparation.  Strangely, I once overheard the owner explaining to a patron that they use minimal oil in food preparation.  I gather he was bullsh*tting.    There should be better regulations in place so that diners could have access to nutritional information when ordering; it should be part of the cost of doing business as a restauranteur in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love their butter chicken roti! There's not a whole lot of space to eat, so consider this place a takeout restaurant. Food comas are common."}
{"text":"*sigh*  I just never go to Gandhi anymore now that I know about its hotter younger sister, Mother India. Even though I've moved to Queen East, I stay on the streetcar well past Bathurst for an extra 10 minutes and go to Mother India instead (same owners/food without the lineups, open on weekends, and hey, actual seating!).   At Mother India I pay the same overpriced amount, but I get to sit down at a table, have unlimited water refills, and I don't have to ask for real cutlery to fight through through layers of roti.    The last few times I went to Gandhi I couldn't help but think they were being really cheap. A half-full carafe of water on the counter seemed to only be there for health reasons, you had to ask for proper cutlery (they only keep the used and dirty cutlery on display) and no napkins are provided. Cost cutting to the point of stinginess."}
{"text":"There are very few places that you keep going back despite subpar service and ambience, and Gandhi Cuisine is one of those places.  You can expect a line up, you can expect to be turned away if you don't have cash and you can expect to not have a seat when your food is ready.  But you will be back because this little place has the best roti and butter chicken in the city, hands down.  Served in aluminum trays, its perfect for take out or for dining in and taking the rest home because its too much food, or too spicy.  Be warned, go with the mild first as the spicy is ulcer-causing, \"I can't taste my food anymore\" kind of spicy.      Not a whole lot of competition in the area, but skip the all you can eat Indian lunches scattered throughout the city and head down here.  They have increased their prices recently, but it's still worth every penny."}
{"text":"As indicated by just about everyone else here - large, delicious roti. The perfect cure for plugged sinuses as well as hunger.  The place itself is quite small - a smattering of tables, and not really meant for eating in. You're best to phone ahead with your order, as there will be a wait, and if you're taking more than a couple of people, don't count on sitting. If it's sit-down you're interested in, head out to Queen and Lansdowne for Mother India - same food, same people, sit down. I know certain others (*cough* Kat *cough*) strongly prefer the full service there, but as Dude Visiting from the Suburbs, I prefer to stay close to the downtown core for reasons of \"catching my damned train\".  As others have noted on the flavour: they bring the noise. Medium is damned hot, and I can't see myself ordering a Hot anytime soon. Even then, the flavour can, and does, vary from night to night - on my most recent trip, I swear they were trying to get rid of some spices before they expired or something - not far above and beyond what I'm used to here, but certainly noticeable. Also, as an avowed meat eater, I think it's fairly strong praise to say I would eat - and have eaten - their non-meat meals. Even the potato roti, the flavour is all there.  If you're in there, watch for the discounted day-old roti, from what I can only assume is the orders of people who got fed up with the wait. I managed to save a couple of bucks on an immensely satisfying, if coma-inducing, lunch for the next day on my last trip.  Closed weekends, so head down to Mother India if you get a hankerin' on a day starting with S."}
{"text":"Rotis are good, allow some time for your order to be ready (15-20 min).  Prices are fair.  About $7 to $13 each roti, plus taxes.  Comes in mild-medium-hot.  I was cautioned that the hot is *really* hot.  I ordered the potato roti and managed to eat half of it for lunch.  Felt full at that point.  Partner ordered the chicken roti, medium, and felt full after finishing off the whole roti... though had digestion-related issues the next day.  This was one of my fave roti places a few years back.  I've tried other places since.  I'm happy others are still really liking Gandhi's, though.  I'd happily go there again.  Once in a long while, Gandhi is still a place worth ordering take out food from."}
{"text":"I'm late to the party, but I've finally jumped on the \"Indian-roti\" wagon. So good. Soo good. Finger-licking 'licious good!   We ordered the mild butter chicken and medium chicken tikka masala roti for pickup, and 15 mins and $28 later, we were relishing on these rotis.  What I liked: 1) Packed with flavor 2) Stick to spiciness level; a mild is a true, no-spice affair; and a medium kicks up the spice level a few notches 3) Sufficient for the very-hungry 4) Quick and affordable   So what's not to like?"}
{"text":"The BEST roti I've ever had. The butter chicken was delicious, and everyone there was super friendly."}
