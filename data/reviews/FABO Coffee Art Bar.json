{"text":"Lackluster coffee, stale, bland pastries and desserts. I ordered a muffin that wasn't even worth finishing. It's a fairly small space, and the seating wasn't particularly comfortable. For your money, there are much better choices nearby."}
{"text":"Lovely little shop, great treats, coffee and nice art.Will definitely go back.I had the hot chocolate and cheesecake browine. The groupon was awesome."}
{"text":"Neat little coffee house with plenty of art to stare at. It's usually quiet since most people probably overlook this spot to go to Starbucks instead. The teas are tasty and the seating is comfy. Great place to study on a nice day."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get coffee from!!! Employees and owner are very down to Earth. Super yummy!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this coffee shop on a whim a ordered the dark chocolate fabo-chino. The flavor of the drink was pretty good but I barely tasted any coffee in it so it mostly tasted like a chocolate icee. There was plenty of seating and they even had board games in case you wanted to say a while with friends. However, for the price of the weak drink I expected a bit more. I'm not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in Charlotte.  The decor is warm and inviting.  A very friendly and attentive staff.  In addition to coffee and tea, cheese and pastries they sell wine, beer and art.  Many of the beers are from local breweries.  The art is paintings, jewelry and pottery by local Charlotte area artist. They also have outside seating in a nice setting.  An awesome place!"}
{"text":"I was looking for high-quality coffee. The coffee was fine, but not great. It had a sharp edge to it. It was too acidic to be balanced well with the milk (I had a latte). There are limited baked goods on hand, which were fairly good. Staff was friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere was good. Not amazing, but fair all around."}
{"text":"Latte and muffins were good; latte could have been stronger. The service was friendly and the space was very cozy. But it wasn't so good that I need to run back, or chose this coffee house over one with a drive thru."}
{"text":"I'm so glad to have such a fun place to get coffee and a treat at Quail Corners shopping center.  I've been here twice; once with a friend and once to an open house the Charity League held here, two fun and different experiences.   With my friend we drank tea (they have some unique and delicious flavors as well as more typical ones), shared banana bread (very flavorful) and enjoyed looking at the art work hanging all over the walls.    At the open house the place was packed with women talking, drinking coffee and wine, and sharing information.  I mention it because I was impressed that FABO is so supportive of local groups.    I highly recommend visiting."}
{"text":"Hidden little coffee, wine, beer bar on park rd that has local art on display. (Think a mini Central Perk from Friends without the sofas for my 90s peeps).  The snacks vary depending on the week--muffins, desserts, healthy bars. I've had wine/beer here mostly from local breweries. I love the almond milk coffee drinks and chai lattes."}
{"text":"I discovered FABO on a recent trip while looking for a mellow environment to drink tea and get  some work done.  FABO provided me with exactly these things.  Located in a corner spot in a strip mall, the space is beautifully decorated with the work of local artists and furnished with comfortable chairs and tables.  Power outlets are easily available and the musical selection runs toward the innovative side of early 90s alt-rock.  The tea selection is pleasant, and the owner let me know that they're switching to loose-leaf in the near future which I will be excited to try on my next visit.  Snacks are mostly gluten-heavy, but there are some gluten-free options and they're easy to identify."}
{"text":"this place is really fun , I been there twice for the trivia they have and it is awesome . I will be going back for trivia and other events they have . I also like the art work they have  , that you can buy."}
{"text":"Very nice coffee bar ...with the option to buy alcohol. Atmosphere is totally inviting.  The saddest part is though that this place has the worst hours of operation.  It's quite unfortunate."}
{"text":"I love this little place. Super cozy, friendly people running the shop, coffee & local brew! What more could you want?!?!   There is art all over the walls and its all for sale. The artists are all local and its reasonably priced too! Cricket is the best, warm and welcoming, and she remembered my name! Winning! I will totally keep this place on my radar for the local coffee bar to get some work done. They have live music and various events too, although I haven't hit these up yet.   I will definitely be back here, to pick up a coffee and do some work - and scoop up a Christmas gift or two!"}
{"text":"Super friendly and cool place! Just bought two cups of coffee and the coffee was pretty good, definitely not like French press/ pour over fancy, but still good drip coffee! The art was neat too!"}
{"text":"A girlfriend of mine and I stopped in for drinks after work. We had been to the previous location in Myers Park, and we were excited to check out the new digs.  We got there around 5:45 on a Wednesday, and the woman behind the bar was really helpful in pointing us toward a good bottle of wine (for only $28). Since it was a nice night, she grabbed the bottle and glasses and set us up outside on a cute table by the door.    When we left, we took the bottle and glasses back inside and really got a chance to check out the art, which lines the walls. I loved the art they had, and I love how the tried to replicate the feel of the Myers Park location, but I wish it had a little more funkiness and comfy feeling; I missed the bookshelves and locally-made jewelry hanging around and gifts and whatnot. Hopefully they'll start to integrate some of that after they're there a little longer and start to get in a groove."}
{"text":"Coffee. Art. Bar!! Nice people, and vibes. Hallluh! I ordered the chai latte, it was good but the only downside is that it wasn't very hot or warm. It wasn't cold but it wasn't like warmed either if you know what I mean. On another note I love how they display local art all over the shops for sale! Very nice shop, I support it!(:"}
{"text":"Great vibe and great coffee.  If you are looking for a great spot to work or study and drink the best coffee, this the place.  I haven't tried their beer or wine but I will be back."}
{"text":"Quaint place. Friendly staff. Cozy. Good coffee & treats. Hard to find. Tucked in corner of It's shopping strip. Keep looking it's worth it."}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting FABO and I loved it!  The atmosphere was nice, it wasn't too busy when I went and enjoyed looking at the art in the walls.  It's a cozy place!  I had a chai tea latte and it was delicious!  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It seems like everyone loves this place but when I walked in and stayed for almost an hour the entire time it was incredibly loud and distracting. There were only a few of us there so I suppose she felt that was a great opportunity to clean dishes and make an incredible amount of noise on top of the music that was a bit too loud. And sure, some caf√©s are not the best places to study; however, she could tell that the patrons were trying to work so I'm not sure why she continued. However she was friendly and I felt perhaps I was being a bit fussy when I left so I wasn't going to write a review...until I realized my glass of house Pinot Grigio was almost $9. I'm sorry, that is overpriced for what it was which added to my frustration.   So if you're looking for a lively place to have a cup of coffee maybe this is your spot. If you're looking for a moderately quiet place to study, read, or work with a glass of wine I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"It is a cute place and I wanted a coffee shop pretty badly in this shopping center.  I visited in the middle of the day and ordered a regular coffee and a chocolate croissant.   The coffee had been sitting out for a long time and the pastry was pretty stale.  The service was fine and I will try the place again."}
{"text":"I was excited when this place opened at Quail Corners, so I stopped in one morning. Overall, I was pretty disappointed. Service was slow even though the place was empty, and pastries were stale. A bagel I got was actually moldy. Coffee was just so-so. The fact that they are selling local art is cool, but they could be doing more with it. More emphasis on local coffee and pastries could play into the local art theme as well. As I said, just disappointing. I likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Loved this cute little coffee shop. It's adorable, and all the art around is beautiful and amazing. Plus, Jeremy, Mel, and Anne, are super awesome. Delicious coffee and very well priced."}
{"text":"This is a cute place with local art work on display! I ordered an Iced Caramel Macchiato and it came out perfect! While I was waiting, I looked at the pastries. I say looked because I wanted to buy all of the pastries! They also have local brews and wines to taste!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4, maybe even 4.5 stars.  FABO is located in a shopping center, tucked away near the back. I was the only person inside today around 5 PM and it was delightful.   The atmosphere was chill and relaxing. I ordered a caramel macchiato. They ran out of whipped cream which was a bummer, but it was still delicious- a little bit too sweet though! I loved the pieces of artwork. There was a good variety of pieces.   My favorite part though was the community coloring book. If you're stressed like me, you can just chill and color. There are plenty of pages of random things for you to color, and there's a box of colored pencils. They need to be sharpened though! Overall, loved my experience here. I will definitely be back to try more drinks or color whenever I need a breather."}
{"text":"When other places fill up with people on laptops, this place has plenty of seating all day long. With strong wifi, strong coffee, and sweet treats, you can't go wrong! Plus, they have a separate room for meetings - bring the boardroom for your next conference call!"}
{"text":"I had passed by FABO a few times here and there, and always enjoyed myself, but kind of viewed it as a pitstop, or just a place to stop in. Nothing special.   In some days-off that I had before I started a new job, I had some personal work that I had to accomplish, and lord knows I couldn't do it at home (TV, Xbox, musical instruments, neighbors... so many distractions). So I went to the closest coffee bar type place I could find, and assumed they had WiFi. I walked into FABO, and there were several people on their computers, and the people behind the bar talking about Primal Astrology signs. They immediately invited me up to the bar, striked up a conversation, and the rest is history.   Cricket welcomed me by name the next day, remembered my drink order, and was the most incredible host all the days that I came. She opened my eyes up to the fact that they have events (live music, paint and pour, etc.) and got me on their newsletter.   Their coffee is really great, they have a decent beer selection, but most of all, dear people of Charlotte, their customer service and dedication is what will keep you coming back. I know I will!"}
{"text":"Neat spot with a few nibbles and a coffee/espresso machine. I was particularly pleased with the beer taps, where a Wooden Robot on tap caught my eye. I sat here for a good hour, nursing that beer and watching the traffic drain. Cool spot with tables inside and out. Very easy to get some work done in a very pleasant environment."}
{"text":"I like this place! I was finally able to stop by yesterday. I brought a groupon months ago and wasn't able to use it before it expired. I was in the area before work and decided a latte was calling my name. The barista allowed me to use my groupon for the amount I paid for it. Perfect for a latte and muffin. I grabbed a large coffee and morning glory muffin from Nova bakery. It was the perfect mid-morning pick me up.   This place is really cute, cozy and a perfect spot to hang out. They have local art on the walls, some handmade jewelry and a monthly event calendar of activities happening at the coffee shop. Well done Fabo, well done.  I will be paying you another visit soon"}
{"text":"This is a cozy semi-hipster coffee shop. They feature local art for sale that cover most of their walls. They also sell hand-made jewelry and wine and beer. I've always loved coming here. The dirty chai is so tasty but my go to is their brewed hazelnut coffee, they will steam your half and half is you ask that makes it even more delicious"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem of a little coffee shop. I think because it's in quail corners it gets overlooked. Great baristas that know what they are doing. The baked goods are made by a local baker fresh every day and are excellent. I highly recommend the blueberry muffin. The art is nice and they have live music some nights. Overall Fabo has a great vibe."}
