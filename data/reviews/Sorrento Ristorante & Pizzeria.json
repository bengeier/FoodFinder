{"text":"Went for dinner and ordered the chicken breast w side salad & vegetables.  Chicken breadt was seasoned but it was tough (,like they pressed it on the head) it was not grilled..  vegetable was broccoli that tasted like it was microwaved.  Also side of angle hair pasta, this was the best part & the hot dinner rolls.  Side salad had 1 slice of a tomato and two slices of cucumber w white lettuce.... I would go back.but not order chicken."}
{"text":"Place was full, but we got in without much of a wait.  Ordered the calamari to start--it was honestly incredible, especially for the price. Salads were okay--the house dressing made it. Bread was good.  We went with the basics for entrees--veal parmigiana and chicken marsala. Fantastic, both of them.  I'm picky about the way my pasta is cooked, and they did it perfectly. Too full for dessert, so can't comment.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Went to new location behind cracker barrel last night. Really hopping this space will work as it is close and a cool building.   Sorrentos moved from a small location by the college and the wait staff is NOT ready. Highly unorganized and not attentive.   Sat at bar to get good service but did not receive. They forgot to put in appitizer, were not knowlegable about wine selections and 3 bartenders walked by our empty glasses for 10 minutes. There were only two other groups at the bar!!  Knowing my wine I found a nice bottle of of Italian wine from Piedmont region. Wish I could remember the name as it was good. I had to order a bottle since after two glasses we couldnt get someone to pour us another.   Ordered calamari app. Which the waitress forgot to put in. nice work. I did like it as the calamari was tender but the batter was a bit oversalted. The marinara was good.   I had the veal marsala and my partner had the special halibut with a lemon caper sauce.  Both were very tastee and it is worth mentioning the zuchini side with the fish was above average. they were not grilled but also not mushy and finished in a red sauce that was modified from the marinara.  The canolis were average at best as the filling was little more than sugar and ricotta and was a bit thin on consistency.   We love this location so we will give them another chance probably with the kids in tow. Hopefully they step up the service."}
{"text":"I have gone to the smaller restaurant for years and have enjoyed the food and camaraderie with the waitresses.  My first, and so far only, visit to the new location was on a weekday evening.  I ordered an eggplant parmesan, and was quite happy with it.  My only complaint, foodwise, was the salad, which was mostly iceberg lettuce with a few green leaves thrown in.  Very disappointed in the salad!  The waitresses were still as friendly as in the old place, but were much busier.  The restaurant itself was quite beautiful.  I was not happy with the noise level as it was very difficult to talk with others at the table."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent food and service.  Best restaurant in this area.  Menu has consistent Italian favorites and some variation that is welcome.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is the second time me and my wife ate here and it was amazing. We got there at 11 when they opened for lunch. Rolls were crispy on the outside soft on the inside.  My wife had chicken florentine and a Friday special seafood chowder. I had a chicken parm. Sandwich with fries I enjoyed the entire meal. Plus we didn't spend an arm & a leg."}
{"text":"Pizza was salty, garlic bread tasted like it had celery salt on it.  Real pizza like in NYC can't be found in this area.  Italian entrees are OK."}
{"text":"Less than impressed w food! Kitchen doesn't know how to salt or use seasonings. No fresh parmesan for an Italian restaurant! Our veal & shrimp were very tough. Bruschetta made w stewed tomatoes & was NOT made the same a when we went here for lunch a couple of weeks earlier, it also didn't have any artichokes. Server didn't know to pair the correct wine w out dinner.  The ambiance of the facility is very nice at their new location."}
{"text":"Sorrento has moved to a wonderful location- what a major upgrade to the inside! My husband and I have our date night here every couple of weeks- we are ALWAYS impressed! It's wonderful to see a small-time business owner progress like this.   As far as the food- from the bread, to the italian wedding soup, to the various entrees we had, I'd have to say we have zero complaints. In the past, I've noticed the bartenders/servers to be slightly unprepared after moving to the new place. Maybe not knowing exactly what was in a certain dish OR what wines are available, but it is a transition that they are improving upon.   Overall, GREAT PLACE!"}
{"text":"Above average. We didn't have pizza, we had chicken Marsala and grilled shrimp and scallops. Both dishes tasty and well prepared.   Four stars mostly for value."}
{"text":"We enjoy going to Sorrento's.  The marinara sauce is delicious.  We enjoy their pasta and is it very authentic.  Service is always great.   The also carry Italian drinks that you usually can't find anywhere else such as Campari and Fernet.  Their limoncello is very good.  I recommend going for a nice authentic Italian dinner.  Try the tiramisu."}
{"text":"All time favorite spot in Elyria. New location is gorgeous, the atmosphere is inviting. Phenomenal homemade Italian!"}
{"text":"Our first visit here.  What a treat!  Nice venue, comfortable for casual or fancy dining.  Many menu choices in all price ranges. Warmly welcomed when we arrived.  Our server Theresa was great!  She knew her stuff and was attentive but not annoying. The salad was fresh and crisp lettuce blend with a few delicious veggies tossed in. Tried the house dressing which was mild enough that you could still enjoy the flavors of the veggies. I thoroughly enjoyed the Penne ala Puttanesca.  The ingredients were perfectly blended to provided wonderful bursts of flavor with no one item overwhelming the palate.  The pasta was a just right al dente.  My wife had the eggplant Parmesan which she enjoyed. I tasted it and would definitely recommend it.  My mother had lasagna which she said was very good.  The portions were large enough that we all took a serving home. We are not big eaters though so those of you who routinely pack away a pound of pasta will find the size about right.  The wine list was good. I tasted a recommended Merlot and a Cab Sauv.  Both were delicious.  I wasn't impressed with the beer selection but then I'm a beer snob.  I had a draft Peroni which was fresh and refreshing.  We will be back.  We are looking forward to dining on their patio."}
{"text":"Decent food. Side of meatballs, lasagna, stuffed mushrooms and pizza all served lukewarm. Waitress pleasant but wasn't terribly on the ball."}
{"text":"Never EVER coming here again.  It was the first and last time dining here today. We came in between lunch and dinner today, when it was next to dead. I was happy by how nice it looked inside and thought we would enjoy a nice lunch. Our server approached and didn't tell us the specials or soup of the day which wasn't a huge deal but it would have been nice to know. she was short with us but I thought she must be the only server here and there were a couple other tables so she must be busy.  Then when we ordered, I asked what sauce came on the farfalle and she told me any sauce listed under pasta which was a little confusing because only one side under spaghetti said that but I complied and told her tomato sauce.  When the food came back it was in olive oil sauce. I waited for her to say something but she did not, so I asked if this was with the tomato sauce and she said \"Oh I checked with the chef and he said it doesn't come with it.\" No apology. I wish I had known before she brought it to me, because I didn't want oil on my pasta. I told her this was why I asked in the beginning and with no word she walked away and later brought a side sauce of tomato.  I put it on but the olive oil left it heavy and oily, so I decided to decline to eat it at all.  When the manager approached she was very nice and told me they would cook another with the regular tomato sauce but I got it to go since my friends finished their meals already.   My friends gnocchi was so overcooked it had the consistency of mashed potatoes and left the mouth feeling just disgusting.  I went home, happy with my replacement until I went to heat it up and realized it was not a different one at all. It was the same one they had first served me, it was evident because it only had a spoonful of tomato which I tried to put on myself, and still olive oil.  I am furious and wish I could get my money back because between the rude, negligent server and a lying manager this is a poor excuse of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Dined on a Sunday afternoon. There were a respectable about of people there on a Sunday at 1pm when there was a Browns game. The place looks great. Nice decor and I like the layout. Great service: attentive but not annoying. Some inexpensive wine options which was refreshing to see.   We had the calamari and I loved it. I rarely order calamari at restaurants because it's usually a bland breaded affair in which you can't even tell it's seafood. The dish we ordered was a nice portion and tasty. Nice light breading/coating.   Nondescript salads and rolls.   One of us had the lasagna which was okay. Seemed like a small portion for the dinner size entree. I had the veal francese. I expected the veal to be a tad crisp and brown from being fried but the coating was a gummy paste, which was a bummer. The flavors were decent. The pieces of veal were not all cooked the same. Some well done and others pink/more rare.   We both ordered bread pudding for dessert and it was REALLY good. Highly recommended.   I'd go back to try some of the other entrees.   Not perfect but we left happy (partly due to ending on such a good note with the delicious desserts)."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night, which is always risky. The place was packed, though I'm not sure if it was because people liked the food or because it is a new location. I heard several people asking others if the food was any good.  The hostess said there was a 30 minute wait, or we could eat at the bar. Seemed ok to me and I don't expect the service to be as good as the bar so I allowed for that. But I wasn't expecting it to be as bad as it was. There was only one bartender initially and just after we got there the hostess filled the bar so she got real busy real quick. Took a while to get our orders in and when they were in the food came out haphazardly.   We ordered garlic cheese bread for an appetizer. My girlfriend ordered a caprese salad and french onion soup. I got chicken parmesan, which came with a house salad. It took quite a while for the garlic bread to come out and it was regular garlic bread, not the garlic cheese bread. It was ok, but the frozen Orlando garlic bread has more flavor.  After a fair wait, the caprese salad and french onion soup came out. My salad did not. My girlfriend had nearly finished her food and asked the bartended to check on my order, which she soon brought out. I asked what happened to my salad and she had completely forgotten about it. The salad was uninspired... torn iceberg lettcuce with a few shavings of carot, two rings of red onion, a tomato wedge and two slices of cucumber. I like cheese and croutons on mine but ok.  The entree was ok but nothing exciting. The chicken parmesan was fine but I've had better from both Olive Garden and Applebees. The spaghetti was fairly bland with a chunky marinara that I didn't care much for. I like to twirl spaghetti on to the fork with each bite of chicken but ran out of pasta about halfway through, a sin considering how cheap pasta is. My girlfriend reported her food wasn't anything special, either.   I do intend to give them another chance to see if their pizza or calzones are any good, but I was fairly unimpressed with the place considering the price. I don't blame the bartender for the slow service or mistakes since she wasn't a waitress, but if she can't handle the load they shouldn't send diners to the bar."}
{"text":"Definitely won't be going back. Food was worse than Olive Garden is now and that's nothing to right home about."}
{"text":"New to area so decided to try it. Very disappointed in the pasta as the burnt chicken parmigiana. Told the waiter who said he would tell the kitchen but did offer free dessert for the burnt parmigiana. Won't be back ."}
{"text":"I came for the scallops marsala but the shrimp caprese sounded yummy. My server Theresa recommended caprese with scallops.  It was delicious! Great dinner, great service!"}
{"text":"I recommended this restaurant to our Florida friends. Huge mistake! Our server, Jade, was downright surly. Had an attitude from the get go. Never smiled. Acted aggravated at any questions regarding the menu. Two of us ordered pasta with marinara sauce and a side of steamed broccoli. Broccoli came dripping in oil and was obviously grilled not steamed. One of us got the Penne Caprese with shrimp. Dish came with NO shrimp! Our bills were mixed up. Our drinks were on other couples bill. There drinks were on ours. We had to ask for coffee after our meal. Then she came by and said can I have your tabs so I can go home! Seriously? Jade needs to find a job she likes! Food was mediocre at best. I was so embarrassed that I recommended this place."}
{"text":"Great Italian food, service is awesome!  Great atmosphere, servers are knowledgeable on the food and wine menu! Pizza, fettuccine Alfredo, and soups are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Service was good and waitress kept the drinks filled, and the ambiance was nice.  But that's where it fell short.  I was looking for a nice pasta restaurant nearby, but their cream sauce was overly buttery (even more so than typical restaurants).  Their clam pasta was overly salty because they use canned clam rather than fresh, and they must have dumped the juice from the can in there too."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sorrento since I was a little girl. If anything, the food and the atmosphere has gotten even more sophisticated and classy (if that's at all possible!) with the new location! The appetizers were melt in your mouth, the drinks were luscious, and the entrees delectable! I didn't have a whole dessert because I was so stuffed but the one bite of the limoncello mascarpone pie was creamy, smooth, and downright heavenly! We had a big party (10 people) and the bill was more than reasonable and will NOT break the bank! I definitely recommend this place, hands down as wonderful, family friendly, and absolutely delicious! Do yourself a favor and check it out!"}
{"text":"Ask for Michele!! She was so kind and accommodating. Our meal was fantastic from appetizer to dessert! The \"Happy Birthday Cannoli\"was a special surprise!!  We had a terrific dining experience!"}
{"text":"Portions are very huge! Calzone was amazing stuffed mushrooms amazing as well as the garlic bread. Must dine here"}
{"text":"The alleged chef from Vegas needs a one way ticket home.    Specifically requested a dinner portion for my two take outs. Got lunch portions and paid extra for iceberg lettuce salads ($2.25 each).  Asked for extra marinara sauce in advance. Good thing because there was hardly any on the pasta. The bad news?  Got my extra sauce in one if those little dressing-type containers.   My eggplant parm consisted of two greezy pieces of eggplant re-heated in oil, I'm sure.  No pasta with that. I guess I was suppose to steal some from the spaghetti order.  The bread was almost stale. I think it was from the Orlando bread roll bag x's two days. WiFi?  I guess they have it. When I couldn't log in, I got this:  \"It's working on my computer. We've been having problems, so I don't know\".    They'll probably last as long as the restaurant previously occupying that same space."}
{"text":"Went out to lunch with friends and the food was tasty.  The bread was warm and fresh.  The pasta cooked just right and the salad crisp.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza this side of NYC! I really enjoy Sorrentos! The restaurant (behind Cracker Barrel) is decorated nicely and is very spacious. Good customer service.  THE PIZZA IS DELICIOUS! I come from about 20 miles away just for that! Best pizza this side of New York, and great Chicken Parm also!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for a late Valentines Day dinner.  We went around 4 PM and the place was about 1/3 full.  Our server was very energetic and attentive to our needs.  The atmosphere and decor were both better than I expected.  We decided to have my son's 4th birthday party here.  Food was good and prices were moderate.  I'll be going back."}
{"text":"First of all I am not a fan of Italian food but my wife and kids are so I suffer. No big deal, so I have gone into a lot of Italian restaurants before, not by choice, and I love to eat so I know what's good. The food was OK, ordered Pizza, Spaghetti with mushrooms, Spaghetti with Shrimp,  and a couple other things. Of course for me and the family.  Food was ok good. The portions need to increase and so does the flavor.  The service needs to step up with Smiling and at least act like you want a good tip.  Atmosphere in the restaurant was good.  Just a tip to all waiters/waitresses if you hear someone slurping ice that means that  the customer needs a refill. It does not mean ignore them until they are all done eating."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent this place for lunch and I am usually never disappointed. The new spot is beautiful! Much better than the old spot. The menu is extensive and I always try something different every time I come. The food is delicious!! My two favorites include the chicken Alfredo with rigatoni noodles and the pepperoni roll (which is not on their new menu, but they can still make it for us, which we greatly appreciate!). Sometimes the ingredients don't always taste fresh (for example, I swear, the spinach tastes canned or frozen) but I think the food is good for the price. The wine list is decent with wines that feature all kinds of price points. The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of 5 stars is because the service is always a little slow and lacking..  They don't time the food properly and appetizers and entrees usually always come out at the same time. The servers don't know proper wine knowledge or how to open and pour a wine bottle properly. Plus those white wine glasses that double as red wine glasses stink! Get proper red wine glasses so it can open the wine better! All in all. Nice place and worth checking out. Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"I had the bolognese and a salad as takeout. The house Italian dressing was amazing! They should bottle it. Food was really good and the portion was massive. I got two meals out of one entree. I will definitely go back.  This is a family owned place, much better than the chain restaurants that dominate the burbs."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night and the place was packed. We only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. While we waited they brought out some bruschetta pizza to gnosh on - it was delicious! The interior of the building is spacious, modern and clean. Our waitress was very friendly and bubbly and answered our questions very well. We had some food allergies to contend with and she made sure to go to the kitchen and make sure they could accommodate our requests, and they did. The rolls were fresh and warm and the salads also made with fresh ingredients. The food was prepared well and tasty. All in all a very good dining experience and we will be back again!"}
{"text":"Very nice decor, made me feel like I was in Italy. Older crowd, prices were reasonable. Food was decent, nothing that blew me away. Overall, enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Sorrento's moved from a cramped, old 1970s hole in the wall to a new spot and it looks great.  However, they seem to have left their best meals in their old kitchen.  The meal was mostly a misfire from start to finish.  Just a few highlights:  -Servers seemed thoroughly ill-prepared, albeit friendly. Our server kept referring to my wife as \"The Miss.\" (???)  \"Is The Miss finished?\" -Salad dressings were of the Sysco variety, or something comparable. -Bread is blah. -All pastas were completely overcooked.  Rigatoni fell apart when you tried to pick it up with the fork.  This is \"authentic Italian?!\" -Pasta dishes were very watery at the bottoms of the bowls. -The only drink we ordered came about 4/5 through the meal, after asking for it more than 4 times. -Waitress took my water away while we were still sitting at the table.  When I told her I was still drinking, she put it back down after putting her fingers in the glass.  I hope they improve, but we aren't rushing to go back."}
{"text":"We went to Sorrento's in Sheffield for Father's Day. The food was amazing! Everything was extremely delicious and flavorful. Service was quite good as well. We'll definitely be back and often!"}
{"text":"Sorrento has very decent Italian food. I lived in Italy for over a year and I'm very particular, so I can't say it's the best I've ever had. They have well-priced bottles of wine for all budgets. We had the Chianti and it was pretty good. We started with the stuffed mushrooms and got the alfredo sauce on the side which was a great choice because it was extremely salty. The mushrooms themselves, however, were very good. For my main dish, I had the farfalle with sundried tomatoes, spinach and garlic. You can't go wrong with this particular dish and I appreciated it for its simplicity. It was a bit garlicky, but it added good flavor."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food! My wife and I finally had a baby sitter (yay Nana!). We have seen the sign for this place from Route 2 so many times and finally decided to stop. I am so glad we did!   We started with the stuffed mushrooms which were covered in a parmesan cheese sauce and stuff with spinach. So good!  I had the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and mushrooms. I occasionally make this from scratch with ingredients from the Westside Market and this dish was even much better than mine!   My wife had the stuffed shells and was raving about it!  Desert.... Raspberry Cheesecake.... Words can not describe the heavenly taste!  If you are looking for great food at an even better price (entire meal was $52)  Our server, Marqray was top notch. He was attentive but not overly. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Gnocchi with Alfredo sauce is very good. Deep fried zucchini was good and the chicken frenchese is very good, get the capers and angel hair pasta with it. Service is most often great.  Ceaser salad is just ok."}
{"text":"I worked at this fine place for 3 years. Some of the best..one of the best places in Lorain Co. To get authentic Italian food.  The white Clam and sauce over Cap...WOW!!"}
{"text":"Eggplant parmesan and the italian wedding soup are great! The fresh baked bread and side salad are also yummy. Good selection, love coming in here for a delicious carb induced sleep afterward. Portions are large so you'll get two meals at least!"}
{"text":"They used to have decent Italian food. Not any more. We visited Sorrento in September 2012 just after they opened.  The new place is very nice compared to the old location which was dated and tacky. We grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered water and a glass of Chianti. We got the water but the wine was another story. The bottle at the bar was empty so they asked someone to grab another. That was 15 minutes. Our calamari was almost gone before we got wine. The calamari was excellent. Fresh, lightly breaded, great marinara sauce with small chinks of tomato. Off to a decent start food-wise, but that's the best it got.  My salad was fairly fresh but the tomato was one of those plastic, dull red/orange wedges devoid of any flavor whatsoever. Shame on them. Around here, in September, local gardens are overflowing with delicious, ripe, usually organic tomatoes that will knock your socks off. I ordered their vinaigrette dressing. I got plain vinegar and oil. Zero herbs in the dressing. Strike...4? I go to wipe my mouth, and notice my napkin has old tomato sauce caked all around one of the corners. Nasty!  Meanwhile, behind the small bar, 3 people are bumping into each other trying to either serve drinks or stock the bar. We'd been there 20-25 minutes and already we'd heard glass breaking twice. The 2nd time, the bartender broke glass right into the ice and STILL SERVED DRINKS WITH IT!!! Although she did check to see if there was glass in the bin when she broke the wine glass, she didn't catch it. Another bartender did a few minutes later after some glasses of water had gone out to the dining room.  Time for the entrees. I ordered sausage, peppers, and onions with rigatoni. My date got the linguini and white clam sauce. I could immediately tell I wasn't going to love my entree.  The pasta was all broken up (a sign of cheap and/or overcooked pasta. In this case I think it was cheap pasta), the sausage looked like it had been boiled with no brown skin at all, and there was very little sauce. My date's dish had almost no flavor at all. No garlic, no wine, no lemon, not even salt. Looked like all it had was canned clams in juice, a little dried basil/oregano, and some dried parsley. Fresh garlic, basil, and parsley are an absolute MUST for a good white clam sauce. You can get by without the wine or by adding cheaper bottled lemon juice, but you have to have the fresh herbs.  We didn't get bread with our entrees which isn't unusual but so many Italian restaurants pride themselves on their bread these days. If you want to stand out, make your own bread.  The staff, from what I could tell, were friendly and attentive, but with any new restaurant, some seemed like they were still trying to find their groove in new surroundings. Prices were on par with the old location and with similar restaurants, and possibly even lower. Cheaper than Olive Garden, but when it comes to quality, I'll go to Olive Garden next time. Sorry Sorrento's, you struck out several times on a single visit. No chance I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what else the Elyria area has to offer, but I'd make the trip to Danny Boys or Frankie's, hell even Buccis if I wanted my Italian food to blow me away. I just felt like Sorrentos was just another place with nice, food.   Believe me, I wanted to be Wowed by this family restaurant, but again it just was A-OK :/ I had the cheese ravs, which were smothered in sauce, not my particular favorite, also quite messy. But they were huge ravs if I do say so. and for $10-11 it was sufficient for the amount of food portions that both my date and I received.   Also, you do get a soup or salad with dinner, which is also, just .... nice. I enjoyed the Italian dressing on my salad, tasted homemade.   My biggest problem with Sorrentos is the common sense issue. Around 7/8PM on a Saturday, no one else in the restaurant except a large group of about 12 old folks looking like that just had their 50th high school reunion, which is totally fine, but don't seat us right.next.to.them. I mean come on people, I saw your other room, I'm not blind. It's not me and my brother having dinner, cmon now.   With that being said, the atmosphere of the old folks was overwhelming yet entertaining. I think their company made the experience, whether it be positive or negative. They made for great conversation."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!  They have been in business since I was a kid and have done nothing but improve a as years pass.  The owner is wonderfully nice and happy to see you!"}
{"text":"Will defintely go back! Entrees were delicious and prices reasonable...great atmosphere. Only complaint is slightly slow service and boring house salads....but we look forward to going back and trying different things..the alfredo sauce was amazing!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try after the grand opening. Alas, it did not last long.  Both dishes we ordered were inedible. I ordered the spaghetti bolognese.  When it arrived it looked like ground cat food on top of noodles.  It was a greasy, flavorless uninspired pile of garbage. My husband ordered the chicken marsala..if possible it was worse. That ended up in the napkin and quickly turned our stomachs.   We politely told the waitress of our displeasure. In return we received 20 % of our bill. Never again."}
{"text":"Beautiful location with warm decor. Service was slow and inattentive. Ordered appetizers.. bruschetta was French Bread Pizza!? Not good..calamari was just OK. Caprese salad was decent. Stuffed mushrooms were all grease. Would not recommend based on apps and service."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.   This place never disappoints and the owner,  Felice,  is the nicest guy you could meet.   Egg Plant Parmesan and Chicken Paprikash this evening was memorable. Thanks for the extra helping!"}
{"text":"Nice Italian restaurant! Great atmosphere, perfect for a special occasion. My family had the pizza and they loved the crust and the perfect amount of sauce. I had the pesto tortellini and the pesto sauce was just right and tortellini cooked perfectly. I wish we could try the dessert but we had to get back on the road. Our waitress was exceptional, friendly and fast. If I lived in the area, this restaurant would be our regular night out."}
{"text":"This is probably my new favorite Italian place! Really enjoyed the food tonight.   The waitress was amazing and they were not super busy because it was a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great date restaurant. It's doesn't get the crowds it deserves (possibly because they are relatively new at this location). They have cheaper drinks than the local bar up the street with 8 taps to choose from (right now two of which are Great Lakes). Food is very good, but is a bit pricier now that they have a new restaurant lease to pay for. I love the quality, the laid back atmosphere and the outdoor patio. Sinatra playing in the background adds a bit of ambiance.  I can't recommend the BLT fold over enough. Their Italian Wedding soup is a bit bland, but most restaurants think it should be this way.  Take advantage of the open seats while they last."}
{"text":"Wonderful tasting pasta and food. I like having olive oil on the table for the bread, and cheese and peppers already available, nice touch. Would have been 5 stars if adding shrimp wasn't $6, could be reduced down a dollar or two. Other than that, pesto fettuccine is fantastic"}
{"text":"Sorrento was truly an amazing Italian experience!! The staff was exceptionally friendly, the wine list was extensive, and the food was unbelievably good. The owners were amazing and personally checked on us to make sure everything was up to their standards. We had a large group, everyone ordered different dishes, and no one found one they did not love. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great dining experience, and if I could rate it more than 5 stars I definitely would. (The managers also have a very sweet, attractive son who helps with the restaurant)."}
{"text":"I'm torn about this place. It's a nice little place in Elyria, great selection and the pasta was tasty but this little Italian place messed up on calamari! My calamari looked like onion rings battered in a cornmeal batter. It was just the wrong type of batter in my opinion and was definitely not the \"Fried Calamari\" I had expected."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time. Great atmosphere. Huge dining area. Can't wait until it's warm enough again to enjoy the outdoor patio seating. Had the stuffed shells (one meat and one cheese) and added a side of meatballs. The meatballs were the star of the show. The sauce was very good too. Unfortunately, I was so hungry and it looked so good I forgot to take any pictures :(  service was good, food was good, company I was with was great...all in all an awesome night and I'll definitely be back to try more items. This is for sure the best Italian food you can find in this area."}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian food. My server Kate was wonderful and very attentive. We came for lunch and I highly recommend the seafood stuffed mushroom. The penne caprese pasta was perfect for lunch and the smaller kids had the blt fold over and chicken tenders. I love being able to get the food I want and the menu having kid friendly items. They also have their own olive oil made in Italy and shipped in! I have bought several bottles and love it! And the lemincello is made in house also! This is a great spot for family dinners and also for date nights. I highly recommend Sorrento, and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"5 stars for the service for sure!!  Food was really good,  but not sure I'd rate 5 stars,  4 stars solid,  though."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sorrento's with my family since I was a youngin'. Their food isn't mind-blowing, but it is good for the price and definitely home-made. I enjoy the atmosphere at Sorrento's; it is very welcoming and unassuming. They have delicious salads and truly tasty gnocchi. I am also a big fan of their their pizzas.   This will continue to be a family destination that I will enjoy for years to come!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in many years. The new location is very nice and right off the highway. The food is still excellent.  Great desserts and wine too. Both kids ate their meals too. I'll definitely be back on my next trip to NE OH."}
{"text":"I've been to Sorrento a few times for lunch with coworkers.  Each time has been a good, tasty experience.  They serve good, simple Italian food and the restaurant is really clean, with a classy decor.  I'm not sure if this is a chain or a local restaurant, but I'll look into it.  The Chicken Parm and Eggplant Parm are really good and filling.  The portion sizes at lunch are just about right. The entrees come with a side of spaghetti and the sauce is pretty good...not so much sweet, but with a good acidic bite from the tomatoes.  The pasta isn't homemade though.  Each of those dishes is $7.95.  They went up from $6.95 a year or so ago, but still very reasonable.  They have a really pretty bar with plenty of seating and maybe 5 beers or so on tap.  The wine list looks pretty extensive too.  There's plenty of outdoor patio seating, but I've never seen anyone sitting out there during lunch.  I'm sure dinner time is a different story though.  Service has been great, but today it was a bit busier at lunch that usual and it took almost 30 minutes for our food to come out.  Not a big deal though...my boss was with us, so we could've taken a 3 hour lunch without a problem! :-P  I'll have to stop in for dinner sometime and try out the pizza and the rest of the menu to see how it is.  The pics that other Yelpers have posted look fantastic though!"}
