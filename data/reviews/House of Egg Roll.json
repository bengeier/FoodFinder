{"text":"Hate to post a negative review but can't help but to. For starter, the waitress were rude and hel*.  Noodle was mediocre and over rated, over priced. All dishes we ordered were average quality and salty. We all have different taste and I do appreciate that. But this place scored the lowest point for customer service - both ladies working there seem to have attitude problem. The only positive side is the cold dishes - your choice of 3 for 9.99."}
{"text":"I'm from Phoenix and new to the east valley,this place is the closest I found to replacing my beloved Happy Foods.I enjoyed there fried rice and beef & broccoli.They were also friendly, quick, and reasonable priced."}
{"text":"I must say this is The Best Chinese restaraunt I ever had in Phoenix area. Have been living in Tempe, Chandler and Gilbert for 4years, I am pretty confident to say house of egg roll had the best noodles and traditional northwestern Chinese food in the area. The owner is very friendly and honest to customers, with his humorous personality, it is always great experience to have meals there. Good for party from 1-20,better to make reservation if you have party more than 8 cuz it usually gets quite busy during peak time.  Compared to what I had tried out in LA, it is no second to any noodle restaraunt in LA, too.   Great recommendations!!"}
{"text":"Our go to delivery take out. We have ordered here many times, and yet to have a bad experience! Great food, quick and friendly service, very affordable. Thank you!"}
{"text":"No deliver no lunch special and the guy hung up on me tried calling back and busy signal"}
{"text":"The food was ok. The service was terrible and the food was not served in the order you would expect.,Had to ask for silverware, water,  and rice Do you enjoy eating from dishes that are chipped-not just one but most of them.  How unsanitary!! Asked for unchipped dishes and were told they didn't have any. The food might be good but not that much better so will not go there again. Terribly disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Taste far far poorer than before. The big plate chicken way too dry like cooked overnight. The fried noodle flooded with oil. Sour plum juice not good as before. Overall, very disappointed."}
{"text":"So I'm sitting at the table waiting for service ... Young girl on phone (personal phone) other help just standing there. Five minutes pass and after both of the looking I still can't get waited on. So I walk up to counter ... 5!feet away and ask do I order here or you come to table.. She said oh how many?  You got to be kidding she saw me walk in and sit down...  If I hand thumbs for fingers I'd give it a 8 THUMBS DOWN!  Heading over for sushi down the street food might be good but service sucks"}
{"text":"If you like bland, salty, greasy Chinese food...this place is for you. I'll just head across the street to Chow's Kitchen."}
{"text":"On the positive side the delivery was quick... The egg rolls were burnt, tasted like they had been refried. The vegetable soup good portion for sure...  The cabbage in the soup had black spots all over!!!  I will pay a few extra bucks for anything else next time..  The last time I will eat there.."}
{"text":"This place is ok, not bad. We recently came here and the parking was frustrating. Very busy.  Food wasn't  bad it just wasn't amazing."}
{"text":"New ownership since 7/1/15. Ignore all previous photos, reviews and anyone trying to get egg rolls for takeout.  This is legit Northern Chinese food so do some research before coming otherwise it can be overwhelming. Check out my photos for ideas.  Food is not overly spicy, very well balanced, with great use of acid, expertly executed, big portions for an extremely fair price. Some servers speak limited English so do your research before going.  It can get packed during peak hours so try going off hours but not during their 2:30-4:30 break. BBQ is only served after 4:30. There are a few noodle dishes under Restaurant Dishes that use gluten free bean thread (42, 58, 60). Vegetarians can request most of the noodle dishes to be made without meat or choose from the following: 6-10, 12, 14, 15, 26, 38, 40, 41, 51, 52, 55, 56, 62, 63. Please double check with server to make sure there's no meat."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????very nice little cute restaurant. I have never been here before, when it was just called egg roll house. Because there's no such thing as a grow in Chinese cuisine. But, two months ago, I heard from my Chinese friends, they have changed the restaurant to authentic Chinese food from ShanXi. And now the place is packed every day, and you cannot find parking space on the weekends. Of course  the famous local region food for them is the \"???\" which looks like A folded flat bread with meat inside. The most authentic meet is lamb meat for this type of food. And the famous Biang Biang Noodle.  The waiter also recommend a dish call????which is a huge plate with their special noodles at the bottom and top with vegetable and chicken on top. My kids love this dish, because it has potato in it and has some type of curry taste, and we finish them all. The restaurant it's also right across from the greater Phoenix Chinese Christian church. So, many people come here for lunch or dinner after church service on Sunday."}
{"text":"It took over an hour and a half to get our first main dish. That's  ridiculous. I wanted to give zero stars but I couldn't."}
{"text":"Got this as a take out dinner. Worst Chinese food I have ever had. Chicken wings were chewy. The Sesame chicken was all batter. The fried rice tasted like it was weeks old. Will never go back."}
{"text":"????????biang biang?????????? The pork sandwich is super good! The portion is huge! Shaanxi food is one of my favorites back in China, so this restaurant is a good place for Shaanxi food if you don' want to cook at home!"}
{"text":"Pros : I can honestly say that's the best noodle I've ever had.  Food was dynamite and on par with the bet Chinese food I've ever had.  We tried literally half the menu between our party of 10.  Nothing bad came out of the kitchen.  Cons : They were ill equipped to serve a party of 10 and seemed very disorganized.  We had to flag people down for everything.  Lunch took nearly 2 hours.  Some peoples food came out almost immediately and some didn't get theirs until everyone was completely done.  Service was not atrocious, but it was real close...  I will come back on my own to eat there again, but I certainly wouldn't take a group there."}
{"text":"??????????????????? ??? ???? ??? ?????????????????  ???? ?????????????nice ???????\"???????????\"???????"}
{"text":"I heard this place had changed ownership and went to check it out.  I had the lamb noodle soup which was really good.  The service was definitely not the greatest, but  I can live with that when the food was this good.  I look forward to exploring  more of the menu."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We came for dine in and the lady that greeted us cleared off a table and sat us before clearing off another table. Then another person came and very rudely told us \"well you need to wait.\" We ended up leaving because of the way we were treated. We were never asked to be out on a waiting list for a table before being sat. They were sold out of everything anyway. Despite their recent so called nationwide \"fame\" , we will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food from this place is \"holy crap this is awesome!\". Authentic and legit Chinese food you can get in Phoenix. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I had eaten here many times, years before, and it was good. I thought to give it a go again. I went in one day around 2:45 not realizing they close at 2:30 for a couple of hours, re opening after. The young man behind the counter was polite and informed me they were closed for a couple of hours. I could only say, \" oh, really? Ok. \" in surprise and disappointment, darn it! No biggie, I thought, I'll come back another day.  I return, all the more wiser, knowing they close at 2:30. I arrive at 2:15 wanting to get a to go order. As I arrived to the front door, young customers exited and stated they were closed. I was quite surprised. I asked them what time it was and they looked at their I-phones and seemed surprised as they informed me it was 2:17. Right then a towering male employee opened the door in front of me, just steps away, stating gruffly, \"we closed\". I responded, \"ah, what time is it? Don't you close at 2:30?\" And the employee now has a more glowering look, certainly giving me the impression he is mad at something (me?huh?) and crosses his hands/ arms in an \"x\" fashion in front of him and me, responding, more emphatically/sternly, \"we closed!\" And I think he said \"everything frozen.\" I'm not too sure here, because it didn't make sense to me.  I turned away and left. (To a different Chinese restaurant, and that was delicious with courteous employees, for extra measure! Yay!)  Now, they have been there awhile, do a good business it appears, and I am disappointed that I will never try it again. I know they have polite employees as I experienced with the first gentleman. But hopefully the second person works out of sight there of the customers?  I've never written yelp review before, but this experience I felt to be simply rude, unpleasant, and a bit alarming.  May you receive a more pleasant experience there.    Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"Ok so they get this review for poor customer service. I work 50 feet away from the restaurant and have ordered countless  times from them. I cannot leave my store and someone always makes the 20 second trip to bring me my order. Today I called to place my Sunday order and to my surprise all of a sudden they can't bring it to me. I tip every time and have always been a good customer. So, don't tell me you don't do something when it is the only way I have ever seen it done.  For this I will not be giving any of my business to them any more and will be telling all the people I have directed to this restaurant to go somewhere else. Red Dragon and Chou's kitchen are two places less than a mile from them I would suggest trying for equally good but different Chinese cuisine. This is not a rant from a spoiled customer, but a valid complaint from a person who has worked in the food service industry for over a decade, as an executive chef, server, bartender, host, and event coordinator."}
{"text":"The portions are FAMILY STYLE!  made this mistake? and had tons of leftovers.  Very good approach to typically recognized dishes.  The orange chicken was excellent and actually tasted \"orangey\" due to cut up orange slices in the sauce.  Sweet and sour pork was fresh and served  hot.  Egg drop soup was average.  Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"It take long time I didn't eat the Mian-Pi after I leave China to here, how happy I am find this restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I ordered chicken and broccoli and it taste just like fish. Found some hair in my rice."}
{"text":"We went to house of egg roll because one of the local radio stations said they had the best hot and sour soup around. When we got there it took us maybe 15 min to get a parking spot. We had to wait for a table maybe 10 min. And at the table we had to sit with another couple. The service was very bad. And the forgot to bring the soup. The hot and sour soup was not hot and did not have any hint of being sour. I will say that the chicken fried rice that I had was good. But not good enough for me to go back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurant in town if you are craving for some authentic Chinese food. A friend recommended the place, and I had Braised Chicken with pepper and potato. This dish was more on the spicy side, but definitely very flavorful. The Chinese noodle used in the dish was amazing. Soaked with the chicken broth, the noodle was best when eaten with bell peppers.  The service was decent, and there are many food choices. I would recommend this place to anyone who is interested in trying true Chinese taste at AZ."}
{"text":"If you like spicy Chinese food. This is the place. Featuring northern provincial Chinese cuisine. New ownership brings authentic dishes to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Not sure why the rating is so low on this place. I stopped in for lunch the other day and it was delicious. Definitely not your typical American-Chinese restaurant. I shared three dishes with a colleague - Hot & Sour Soup, Handmade Shaanxi Noodles, and Shaanxi Noodles with Pork and Vegetables.   The soup was very good. I expected it to be spicier, but it was definitely a mild soup. Not the typical dark brownish Hot & Sour. The Handmade Noodles were excellent! Thick and tasty. Lots of spice in this dish.   Overall, I had a very enjoyable meal. Service was good, prices were reasonable, and food was tasty. Yea, the parking is less than optimal.   N*joy..."}
{"text":"Great authentic Shaanxi food!  We ordered the luang pi crispy noodle appetizer which was awesome!  And the boiled fish soup, and the beef and lamb pao-mou - both were extremely good. Even though we enjoyed the food we did feel that it was a little too salty.  Arriving just before 5pm on a Saturday, we got a great table and didn't need to wait. Servers were very friendly but not proactive.  Nevertheless because it's so difficult to find authentic Chinese food in the Phoenix area we are giving it 5 stars rather than 4."}
{"text":"Okay, the positives: friendly smiles, love the family and food is okay. I give this restaurant a extra star because it has been our fast food joint for years. We mainly order their beef dishes and they're generous with the spices and vegetables. Juicy as my husband says.  The negatives: egg rolls are just awful. They seem to have lost their touch on the flavor.  Sweet and sour chicken was also awful. Ordered it for the first time and just plain soggy and not crunchy like it should be."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday, service wasn't impressive during lunch and they were out of quite a few things. I was expecting a more impressive egg roll given the name of the restaurant. Would not eat here again. Especially after seeing this place was listed on the Dirty Dining report for 4 health code violations the SAME day I consumed their food. Horrifying!! I ordered the Mongolian beef, wasn't any different than any other place I've ordered it from."}
{"text":"One of the rare authetic Chinese restaurants in the valley. Tasted exactly like the food I had in Shanxi, China a couple years ago. The place is always packed but the food is worth the wait! So far I haven't found any dish on the menu that I dislike. #17 Braised Chicken with Potato & Pepper has been my favorate. the portion of this dish was so big that I felt like it would feed a family of four!"}
{"text":"Seriously fabulous food, but if you're craving American Chinese food, this isn't the place for you. We started with the lamb kebabs (spicy!), and followed with the cumin lamb sandwiches. So glad we tried them because they were a treat. A spicy mix of lamb, peppers, and cumin on a small round bun. We had to wait quite a while for the rest is the meal, but it was worth the wait. We had noodles in a spicy broth, followed by double-cooked pork (a pork slices stir fired with deep fried bread bites, peppers, and onions in a black bean sauce. Our last dish was the hot and spicy fish. Wow. We loved every dish. They had a great balance of flavors. This is the first time we've had this style of Chinese cuisine and we are looking forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Found this place listed on the Best of Phoenix in New Times.  Clearly the explorer, I drove to Chandler to see what this was about.  It is a simple place, nothing fancy. But I'm not into fancy I'm into good food.   I noticed that we were to be the only non-asians here (for quite a while) .  I thought that was a good sign of things to come.    Their menu has very authentic items such as intestines and tripe, but have hope you fans of americanized chinese food.  They have items such as fried rice, mongolian beef, etc.  The menu has several lamb options which is unusual for a chinese restaurant.   We ordered the cumin lamb which came as an extremely generous portion, the cold sesame noodles, and mongolian beef.  They gave us complimentary edamame which seemed to have been cooked in five spice powder (at least that's what my taste buds said.)  The cold sesame noodles came with sliced cucumber slices and sesame sauce.  It is also known as tahini sauce which is not the usual for this dish at least in an Americanized chinese restaurant (that one is made with peanut butter).  We thought this dish was just ok.  Nothing exciting. Nothing special.    My mongolian beef came with a lot of onions in relation to the beef.  Totally opposite of the lamb with cumin which was a meaty, generous portion.  I literally had to push the onions to the side to find the beef.  ( I have a theory that chinese restaurants give females smaller amounts of food.  There was no comparison between the portion that my husband got and what I received. It was like night and day---but it's just a theory).    So I picked through the onions to look for the beef.  It was also very greasy at the bottom of the dish---too greasy.   The white rice which came with the dishes was fluffy and whole grained not mushy as in some chinese restaurants.    No one refilled the water glasses.  I found that annoying.  Little attention once your meal came to your table.  Maybe it's an asian thing.   From the lamb with cumin I can see why people would really like this restaurant.  But I would never order the mongolian beef.  At $12.95 for this dish, I should have had more than a few scraps of beef.   Right now I can't really decide whether this is the Best of Phoenix as indicated in New Times.  There are many, many good chinese places in the valley that could give this place a run for it's money."}
{"text":"Ick. I rarely ever just throw away my food, but most of my meal from House of Egg roll is now sitting in my trash can.  I ordered sesame tofu, which sounded great. What I got was some hard triangles of tofu coated in about 10 sesame seeds and then dyed bright, glow-in-the-dark orange (which suspiciously looked, and tasted, exactly like the sweet-and-sour sauce that came with our egg rolls). ,  That was it. Nothing else, other than several florets of broccoli they put under the tofu. No, it wasn't cooked with the tofu and sauce, it was just plopped, raw, underneath everything. And there wasn't even really any gravy or sauce at all, so everything was dry.  I want to give H.O.E.G. points for trying to be a bit more creative on the veggie options (Sesame tofu, orange tofu, etc) but if the food sucks, it doesn't really matter how good the menu appears.  My husband's order wasn't much better.  The egg rolls were pretty good, I'll admit.  I should have stuck with Sun Chinese Dining. Sorry, Sun, I won't stray again..."}
{"text":"They're under new ownership and the menu has completely changed. It's a small place and there isn't a lot of seating for parties of two. We had to share the table with another party which wasn't a big deal. The service isn't amazing but I don't go to Chinese restaurants expecting that. The Shanxi style handmade noodles are TRULY AMAZING. I can't stress how good they are. There is no noodle in all of Arizona as good as this dish. Also it's a bit spicy so beware. Definitely will be back! Also the only place in AZ that has ???."}
{"text":"I just finished my take out and here I am. I have dined there once before a year ago. I remember sitting there with my boyfriend. There were a bunch of young adults horsing around. The service was horrible and very distracting. One of the employees was sitting in the middle of the room (it's not very big in there) with her laptop stacking poker pieces. Another staff member knocked them over while bumping into the table. They argued over who was going to pick them up. So tonight we did take out. The food is great. We placed the order and it was ready in 15 minutes. Upon arrival I am greeted by a young lady who is on her laptop who does not bother to  look at me. Then an older female looked at me. I told her I was in to pick up an order. She asked what I ordered. As I list of my items: curry shrimp, beef and broccoli, and house fried rice, she rings up my bill and hands me my food. Overall, the food was good. The vegetables could be cooked a little longer. Service needs improvement. The room has some tables but people rarely dine there. There is a table in the front with healthcare items and supplements. That really threw me off. For a second I thought I walked into my gym."}
{"text":"CUSTOMERS BEWARE!    This  place added a tip on our take out credit card slip without our authorization!   I contacted our credit card company and they put our charge \"in suspension\" while  they looked into this issue.  Two days late, I received  a phone call from House of Egg Roll saying they were sorry and admitted to charging a different amount than what we had signed for.  I wonder how many other customers they have been skimming off of?  After this third visit, we will NOT be returning!!!"}
{"text":"I just ordered the braised chicken with potato and pepper and I still can't believe how wonderful it was. Just like my grandmothers spaghetti with chicken,(bone in) except a new twist.  Dish is family style and rewardingly intoxicating. Picky lovers of Americanized Asian cuisine should not be allowed to review this establishment.  This is the real deal."}
{"text":"Ranked one of the best Chinese restaurants according to timeout magazine! Definitely worth checking out under the new ownership. Authentic Chinese food especially for Arizona. Not the crap that you taste in the regular fast food joints. Tried the chilli oil tilapia and their hand made noodles. So flavorful! Be prepared for authentic spicy dishes!  Also great price for the portions. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Here is a totally and honest review. My family and I went here for dinner a couple of days ago. The place was a major fail. We came here because we had a Restaraunt.com coupon worth $10.00 off of 20.00 or more. We sat down and it took them more than 15 minutes to bring water to our table and that was after asking 3 people for water. We then picked our meals off the choices that were on the menu only to be denied these items due to them being only lunch items(no where on the menu did it say that they were for lunch only). We ordered the orange chicken and the pork chow mein. -FAILED on both items.  They brought out the chow mein first after about a half hour in the place which by the way had no AC in it. Their excuse for that was they were getting it repaired soon!  Remember this was pork chow mein but my dish had hardly any meat in it, roughly about 6 tiny julien slices of pork about 1 inch long. secondly the noodles looked like over sized worms and covered with lots of onions and maybe bamboo shutes. It had ZERO flavor PERIOD.  Next our orange chicken came out about ten minutes later and it was disgusting. Zero flavor,no aroma and nothing but a few pieces of meat that I don't know if they were even chicken. Most of the pieces were very mushy and fatty like most of it being the deep fried chicken fat and skin. Down right nasty.  Now here comes the third strike. When it came time to pay I gave them a credit card and my $10.00 coupon and they would not accept it. (Reason they gave us was that they were under new management as of today the day we came in to eat and the new management was going to cancel these coupons. They offered to take 3.00 off and I told them to charge me whatever they wanted to charge me as I knew I would never be coming back to this place. FOLKS, be WARNED THAT THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE! Look at the past reviews, I know now that I should have believed the reviews I had read before going there, Like a big dummy I wanted to try it for myself !!!!!!!!! what a mistake!  GO at your own risk. It's to bad that Yelp does not offer a minus 1 star."}
{"text":"im not kidding when i say this......I called to place an order to go.......i ordered orange chicken or something and the dude on the other end said.....and I quote, \"we dont have rice\"......that's like me saying, \"I dont want to drink anywhere ever\".......just no......no."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worse Chinese Restaurant in Chandler.  In other words \"An Absolute Dive\"!  Arrived 15 minutes after opening for lunch, the temperature in the place was at best, 60 degrees.  Wait staff doesn't understand or speak English...Food is horrible...Management is rude.  Most noteworthy, the place is filthy and should be inspected and closed down!"}
{"text":"Whether you call it Shannxi Biang Biang or House of Egg Roll, the idea of new regional Chinese food is exciting. China is a huge country and as a Millennial I'm all about trying new places and things. I've read Fuchsia Dunlop. Of course, none of that goes very far towards helping me understand what I've eaten from a cultural perspective: the Shaanxi sandwich tasted great and it's hard to go wrong with the Shananxi-style handmade noodles. I liked how the dish veered more towards vinegar. It's something I wish I knew more about, but in the meantime I like the idea of this very specific Chinese restaurant offering something that's difficult to find anywhere else."}
{"text":"Quite good shaanxi food! I was debating when I noticed the rating on yelp was not high. Well, worthy trying out."}
{"text":"Most delicious authentic Chinese food! I have to say this restaurant is the best one in Phoenix area. They make northern Chinese food exactly like what we have in China. And the ingredients are quite authentic and I have no idea where did they get it...imported from China?:D  In a word, AWESOME, AWESOME and AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I like the food here. They are not American Chinese food and really delicious. However, the service is not good. I ask for less spicy several times and the waiter always promise but the food is the same as before. Another issue is that it is always full of people and you might end up sitting with strangers together. Since the business is so good, I think they don't really care about customers. For example, if you ask for some drinks before the meal, they always forgot and you need to push them several times. I hope they could increase the number of tables or rent another bigger place, so I don't need to wait every time. Hire more waiters. Work on customer service."}
{"text":"As someone who has been living in China for over 20 years. I'm usually very picky about Chinese restaurants. I'm been to most of the Chinese restaurants in town and none of them are even close to this restaurant.  I really like the food there. It's very unique. Truly authentic Shan'xi food. The noodles are one of the best in town. The service is also pretty decent. I would definitely recommend this to all of my friends."}
{"text":"This place kicks butt (and I'm not referring to the inevitable reaction you get the next day after eating the spicy dishes)"}
{"text":"Went to place to get dinner for family using   restaurant.com deal. I got there and the man didn't speak any English. I had to show him the cert after ordering my meal and he said does not work here.  Should be known ahead of time that they won't honor coupons. Same name but I guess different ownership now?"}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese food joint. Their sesame chicken is so incredible and also the crab puffs are amazing. They always seem to really appreciate my business when I come in. I will definitely visit again in the future."}
{"text":"The food was disgusting. Ordered shrimp fried rice and about 1/4 of the rice was not cooked and was hard, basically inedible. Actually had to spit out uncooked pieces of rice. We ate the very salty shrimp and left most of the so called \"food\" on the plate. The waitress tried the hard sell of the overpriced cold cart items, so I didn't appreciate that either. The egg rolls were frozen and microwaved and served with red sauce out of a bottle- really bad. There are simply too many other good Chinese restaurants in the Chandler/Mesa/Gilbert area to waste time and money on this place."}
{"text":"The House of Egg Roll is your perfect cheap Chinese food restaurant. Their service is very fast, delivery or pick-up.   The only thing I have not enjoyed from this restaurant thus far is the Almond Chicken. The Orange Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, fried rice, egg rolls, and Mongolian Beef are all great."}
{"text":"Amazing food, best real Chinese in AZ. Order the house made noodles or the beef with scallions both are my favorites."}
{"text":"So was driving to this place to check out new menu since they said in the phone they changed there menu and website was not working. Keep in mind i ALWAYS get delivery so i had no idea where this place was.  I called them cuz i was having trouble locating them. After being passed to 3 different people because they did not understand me the last one finally told me the address, which I already knew, without allowing me to speak. He then after giving me the address, proceeded to tell me he could not understand me and did not have time for me. He then told me have a good day and hung up the phone. I guess it didn't have time for my money either, which by looking at other Reviews would have been a waste."}
{"text":"Honestly it used to be so much better !!! Who has people eating in front of the cash register ?!!! I couldn't properly order !!! And there was no egg rolls or crab puffs !!! Not coming back anytime soon"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times with my friends from China and Malaysia and they all have come away saying that this was the closest to authentic Xian food. I lived in Chengdu for a couple of years and some of their fishes reminded me of being back. I recommend the hu pi qingjiao (tiger pepper) poorly translated to pork chili. I like their lamb dumpling soup. I am not big on their big noodles but the vegetables are fresh. Be adventurous!"}
{"text":"5th time in a row I've tried to go and they're sold out of chicken! Obviously poor planning that doesn't change."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a number of times years ago, not sure when they changed ownership or if some younger family members took over, that said, the food has gone down.  This last order, we threw most of it away.  We had ywp orders of Orange Chicken, DRY, NO taste, No Kick appeared make last week.  I'm not sure what the fourth item was, I thought I had ordered Chop Suey with chicken, what I got was a hard, Tasteless unrecognizable something.  The only good thing we received was Chicken LoMein it was good.  I'm not sure what they use to cook with MSG, not sure, but I had a sneezing fit and had to go to the bathroom.  I would call down to complain, but there is a young guy who thinks he's funny, NOT, and the rest don't care, I'm also afraid of them spitting in or doing something to my food.  I do not Recommend this restaurant ."}
{"text":"Worst service of my life! I've been to almost every Chinese restaurant in the valley and wow! I ordered the Bing Bing and it came out Luke warm/cold. I asked the server if they would warm it and was told they could not. I asked if they could put it in a mircrowave and was told nope. I asked If they could sauté it in a frying pan to warm it and they said no. I attempted to return the item the server said they don't take returns. The braised beef was extremely chewy. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is very authentic! We ordered five different kinds of noodles, beef, lamb, two cold dishes, and two vegetables and four drinks. The food tastes so good! We only spend 120 with tips. If you like spicy and authentic Xian food, here is the right choice."}
{"text":"The quality since they stopped serving hot vegetable dishes has gone down. This is more of a 3.9 stars review because I like the fact that the menu is condensed and more straightforward. The noodles still tasted good but seems a bit haphazardly assembled and wasn't as steamy as hot noodles should be."}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast so I am use to greasy Chinese food. The shrimp Lo-Mein wasn't bad at all. I was give it a 6 out of 10. But I asked for it as spicy as they can make it... I wasn't impressed with the heat. I also ordered Hot and Sour Soup and it had all the normal ingredients... But as odd as it sounds the broth tasted like it was gravy based. Yeah that's right I said it, gravy based. Like turkey gravy. I ended up throwing it out. My wife ordered General Taos. It was of course good. Any Chinese food restaurant that can't make General Taos shouldn't be in business. O and finally... The egg rolls. They tasted like classic east coast egg rolls."}
{"text":"This place is legit. I read an article about it having authentic food from the shaanxi (?) province, and I wanted authentic food. I asked about recommendations that are authentic and specific to the province. The lady recommended the biang biang noodles, which are handmade noodles, long and wide, with pork in a little broth. Oh yum! This dish is delicious and so flavorful. The other thing I tried was the pita bread lamb soup. Who knew lamb was a regular dish in Chinese cuisine? Not me. So, since this it is an authentic dish, I tried it. Very flavorful and almost rich in flavor. It was very good and also a bit interesting. The biang biang noodles were my favorite. Next time I will return with friends so we can sample more."}
{"text":"Let me just get the most important part out of the way.  The Food  I ordered a tofu vegetable dish that came with an egg roll, 2 lobster cream cheese thingys and \"fried rice\".  The main dish was soggy and SALTY. I can make it better myself at home (which I should have done but was too lazy...boo me). The fried rice was not fried rice. It was just white rice with soy sauce splashed on it. The egg roll was super greasy and bland and I didn't even eat the lobster cream cheese things.  You can stop reading here becuase the rest will be a short rant about how long I had to wait for delivery (unless you are interested):  I ordered my food waited 30 minutes, waited 40 minutes and finally at 50 minutes, I called and they said sorry and that it would be there in 10 minutes. I waited 10 minutes, then 20 and finally, after nearly 1 hour and 10 minutes, my food was there. Not acceptable if you have the same standards I have."}
{"text":"Been to this place a number of times since the ownership change and everything everyone else is saying about it is true.  Parking is a nightmare.  Service is a nightmare.  Staffing is a nightmare. But the food is great ... After 4 visits, I'm now at the point where House of Egg Roll is my go to take out joint.  If you can get them to answer the phone, which isn't all the time.  If they answer, your order will be ready in about 15 minutes and you can park in one of the many 15 min spots for pickup. The Braised Chicken (#19) is $20 and feeds a family of 4 with leftovers ... and it's awesome. Unfortunately, keeping with the tenor of the rest of the place, their website is useless.  Click on the menu or the order online button and you are sent to a food delivery site that doesn't even list House of Eggroll. Use the Yelp pics of the menu and the reviews here to figure out what you want, and order it to go."}
{"text":"Your adopted \"House of Egg Roll\" name isn't doing your restaurant any justice. Please change it, because the current English name can attract the wrong kind of customers especially ones looking for \"American Chinese\" food. You are clearly not one of those restaurant.  (FYI for some of you Orange Chicken isn't Chinese food, anything stir fried with broccolis, baby corns or Water Chestnut isn't Chinese food and even fortunate cookies aren't Chinese...)  Perhaps you should change your name to \"Shaanxi Home's\"  (????), because that is what you are.  An excellent restaurant that serves authentic Shaanxi Style Chinese Cuisine.  This is a pretty new restaurant.  Apparently new ownership took over this location in late 2015 and started to serve authentic Shaanxi Cuisine.  Now they serve tasty real Chinese dishes with great handmade noodles.  Do you research before coming in.  Familiar yourself with what food are like in this region.  But all the dishes we tried on our first visited were beyond our expectations.  Overall great restaurant, good busy vibe, very clean and we really need more place like this in the Phoenix metro area.  Very happy to have found you!"}
{"text":"This is a very unassuming looking restaurant in a tiny strip mall. Don't miss it!  There is seating for about 25-30, so it can be busy at normal lunch and dinner times.   I was reminded about this place by a post on Mouth by Southwest. My wife and I visited on a Saturday, just after lunch time (they close in the middle of the afternoon, before dinner).   We shared the Mongolian Beef and the Spicy Stir-fried Chicken. Be prepared for very flavorful meals. The beef was tender, in a dark sauce with onions, garlic and scallions. It was the best I have yet tasted. The chicken was a surprise. It was very flavorful, maybe because the chicken was cooked and served on the bone. Large slices of tender potato, loads of peppers and garlic are in the stir fry. The dish is topped with sliced scallions. It was delicious.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"I think the hype of this place is overrated however, you can definitely tell this place is more authentic than most. Some of the servers didnt even speak English. Hubby and I came for dinner on a weeknight and we barely got a table to sit and eat, we had the table in the back corner (the smallest table there). Service was pretty non-existent because there were so many people there so we ordered drinks and food at the same time. For a place that's called house of egg roll, you would expect egg rolls. They had 1 option on the menu and were then told they were out of egg rolls! We got egg drop soup, Mongolian beef, general tso's chicken and house biang biang noodles. Everything was super bland. The house biang biang noodles were gross, just my opinion. The Mongolian beef was the best thing we ate. Food did come out quickly, which was nice. We didn't get approached for a refill on drinks or to see how everything was. We had to wave down someone just to get the check. I think this place would be great for takeout but definitely not a nice dine in experience."}
{"text":"The English name of this restaurant is an old one. Now, they serve different kinds of noodles, not egg roll. It is specialized in Northwest Chinese flavor. It's not a place people want to have sour n' sweet chicken or such typical American Chinese food. But if you love noodle, don't miss this place! They are not bizarre food, but if you've never tried such food, be prepared.   ????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????biangbiang????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????"}
{"text":"Drove from the west valley after a national review. House of Egg roll only had one kind of spring roll. Dishes.we sampled were very good.   Not worth the 45 minute trip."}
{"text":"Food is fine but the service is not even reach average. We were recommended and encouraged that what we ordered is not enough for us so we ordered more based on the given suggestion. But we barely finshed half we ordered. But this part is still acceptable. However, before we are completely done with our food, the waitress started to walk around us, take plates off and even wiped the table to clean it.... All these are just becasue there are some people waiting to be seated...This is really not professional or even polite.If they really want to make more money with being able to holding more guests, I would suggest to increase the speed in the kitchen instead of trying to get rid of guests that already paid for their food."}
{"text":"Firstly, my \"Review Rules:\"   GOOD REVIEW - After at least two visits   NOT SO GOOD REVIEW - After one visit. Why would I go back?  I am NOT often led astray by New Time \"Best Of\" so I keep a record of the ones I want to visit and this little Restaurant, having received \"Best Chinese\" was one of those on my list. The recommended (by New Times) dishes were the Hot and Sour Soup with Lamb Dumplings and the Braised Chicken and Potatoes.  A friend and I ordered the Hot and Sour Soup with Lamb Dumplings' and fortunately, we decided to wait before ordering anything else.   The Soup - greasy might be an apt description and it was almost like spooning pure Balsamic Vinegar. Nothing much in the soup except a few green onions and the dumplings.   The Dumplings - texture was unusual, almost slimy, while the filling, when eaten separately from the dumpling skins was flavorful.  Candidly, it was hard to get through this course and we decided to try a significantly better Chinese Restaurant (Chou's Kitchen - never disappoints) right across Alma School, that should have won the award by far!  Also important to note was the price. $10.95 for a large bowl, $6.95 without Dumplings, OVERPRICED to say the least!  All in all, an unfulfilling visit. What the hell was New Times thinking?"}
{"text":"We only go here if absolutely, positively...necessary. My partner ordered the Mongolian beef last night and he said there was a lot of gristle in it. I don't know about you but that kind of turns my stomach. The spring rolls are fine and the lo-mein is passable. Just plan on taking your order out as the kids they have working the front are none too friendly. I went to the restroom and the bathroom had several small live and dead roaches in it. I had to make sure I got out of there as quickly as possible before one of them crawled on me! I don't know about you, but if a restaurant has a nasty bathroom, it says volumes about the kitchen. I do not want to come back here. Shame, considering they kind of make up their own hours and stay open sometimes until 2:30am."}
{"text":"Food was delicous! We got the chicken chow mein (noodles) & the Mongolian beef. Liked the beef better but both were terrific! You have to wait a little but worth it. There was a party of about 20 so that probably caused a little delay."}
{"text":"Note: My experience is with the new owners.  I've been there three times.  The first time the food was excellent.  The garlic noodles were out of this world and very unique.  It wasn't what one would expect at most Chinese restaurants i.e. Szechuan or Cantonese, but was excellent if you had an open mind about it.  On the 2nd visit, my wife and I were served luke warm food.  Many of the items on the menu were not available. The garlic noodles were a completely different flavor and everything was too salty and greasy.  There were far too few vegetables.    We also felt like odd-man-out foreigners.  It was as though they didn't know how to deal with us when we asked for suggestions since the items we wanted weren't available.  We felt kind of ignored/tolerated. We arrived around 8:30 so we called it up to them wanting to go home.  We made a note to arrive earlier than 8pm.   We arrived around 7pm for our 3rd visit. To our disappointment it felt like the 2nd visit, not the first visit.  About this odd-man-out foreigner  feeling... I'm Chinese American, and my wife is Mexican American.  We get along anywhere and everywhere.  This was just different.  It didn't feel racist,  just more like \"we clearly don't need your business to survive, so sink or swim.\"  It's? too bad.  I love experiencing how diverse cultures flavor life in America.  Good ethnic restaurants are one way to get that experience while having a good meal also.    I really wanted this place to become my favorite restaurant at least for a while.  Unfortunately they ended up on my do not go list."}
{"text":"We got a flyer for this place decided to try delivery. I called and placed an order. They informed me it would be extra for delivery because of where we were located. This made our total $37.00 for two dinner entrees, an appetizer, and a soup.    A moment after I hung up the phone they called to inform me that they were out of snow peas (referring to our shrimp with snow peas order). We elected to go with Shrimp in lobster sauce.   I checked my phone and had 6 mixed phone calls from the restaurant. I called back and they informed me that the shrimp in lobster sauce includes snow peas and wondered if we still wanted it. I said yes because it was nearing 40 minutes since the initial order. I feel like this should have been caught during the first phone call or they could have suggested replacing with another green vegetable.   We got the delivery and it was not impressive - honestly, it was one of the worst chinese food experiences i've ever had. They forgot the egg rolls with the dinner entrees, they forgot the white rice that was requested in one of the entrees, the potstickers were fried, soggy, and cold, the wontons in soup were like mush (although the soup had a good taste), the meat in the sesame (no signs of sesame) beef was chewy, dry, and cardboard like.    So for $42.00 (with tip) I would say - Gross!"}
{"text":"The waiters are very energetic. This place is best for 5+ persons as their potion is really huge. Huge potion is one of the features of Northern Chinese restaurants so do not be surprised. The parking lot is really small so you might need to park at the plaza across Alma school. It is so popular among Chinese students in ASU so you need to wait for 30+ minutes before you can be seated.  For Chinese/Asians: as a Chinese from Northern China, I can promise you that this restaurant can give you the taste of home. Just go there, order something, you will know what I am talking about. For Americans: FORGET orange chicken!!!! This restaurant can provide fabulous Northern Chinese style noodles (Shanxi style, exactly) burgers (Rou Jia Mo). If you cannot make decisions, waiter's suggestions are no brainers."}
{"text":"I should of known better to cut my losses when the first thing we heard from the House of Egg Roll staff was \"we're out of egg rolls\".  The service was terrible and when my food finally arrived, the waitress set it down on the other end of the table.  I realize there may be some cultural differences and language barriers but the staff at this place is inattentive and rude.  The food was bland and cold.  In the middle of the lunch rush, a huge delivery of the food came right through the front door.  Why the owners of this place would let his happen during their lunch rush is baffling.  They staff was overwhelmed and inexperienced.  Don't worry about them not charging for something!  I'm surprised they didn't bill me for my ice water!"}
{"text":"really everyone has said it before me. horrible service.  i walked in and just order a to go box of shrimp fried rice, my favorite staple of chinese food. and some places make a habit of cooking their rice in a pound of dead dog grease and tossing tiny, tough shrimp in it, but house of egg roll really delivered.   plump, juicy pieces of shrimp and tender rice with no over-greasy feeling to it. a little overpriced yes, $7 for a large container of this stuff, but i made two meals out of it. i'd definitely come back and get it again."}
{"text":"Pros: authentic and different tasting food. It was a nice change from the usual panda express orange chicken.  Our food was delicious and we ate all the leftovers. The number 3 and number 14 were delicious and me and my partner were able to share both of our dishes.  The wait staff was nice and asked how our food was and if we needed anything. From the outside it seems like a fast food restaurant but it's a sit down place instead.  Cons: The toilet was pretty nasty. I think because it is a low pressure toilet. Also you had the put your paper in a trash bin because of the low pressure flush.  I had a hard time using the chopsticks and ended up making a mess on the table from some of our dishes because the chopsticks were a little slippery. I ordered a herbal tea and it came in a can without a glass and I was sharing a glass of water with my boyfriend and they didn't fill it up that much.  Even though the bathroom was the worst part I would come back and get it to-go because it was honestly really good still."}
{"text":"Like the previous review stated, it was a little overwhelming, and gets busy for lunch so you should probably research before you get here. Excellent food... I got the spicy lamb with cumin and it was juicy, good quality meat. I heard another customer talking about the quality of meat in his chicken"}
{"text":"Many of my Chinese recommended me this place, but I didn't like it. They use too much MSG, and spices are too strong. It's ok to use spices if food tastes good, but all of our food were horrible. My Chinese friend who went to this place with me also didn't like this restaurant. We won't be coming back this place."}
{"text":"This place is great! They specialize in authentic Shaanxi Northwestern Chinese cuisine, which means hand-pulled noodles and hearty entrees. The food here is packed with flavor and macronutrients. Give this place a try if you love different types of noodles and Chinese cuisine!"}
{"text":"Strangely rude. Seems I did not know what I wanted  before I arrived and that must have upset them.. We were the only ones there at 1pm on a Saturday.   Funny that the house of Egg Roll only had one spring roll option.  Interior was tacky, run-down and just plain sad."}
{"text":"I will say that the food was great.  Everything was cooked well and seasoned throughout.  I started off with the Lamb skewers, it was well seasoned and cooked properly and topped off with the even more flavor.  For dinner, I had Shaanxi Noodles w/Pork, jalapenos & onions.  The noodles appeared to be hand made which is a plus.  Also, I ordered the Fish Filet in Chili oil w/vegetables.  It has some bok choy and tons of bean sprouts and appeared to be seaweed.  That was soooo good, perfect heat index and flavorful.  Now, the place is small but can see several people...they are picnic type tables, but with regular chairs.  The food comes up rather quick; however, the customer service is basic...nothing to write home about.  This would be the cause of my lower rating.  I was never offered rice with my food and my water was never refilled or they never even checked on me.  It was just me and one other table for the most part.  As I was finishing up they did get two more tables.  So I'm not sure if they just didn't care or what.  The food is worth the visit, just don't expect good customer service.  I wouldn't voluntarily return on my own...because of the poor service."}
{"text":"HUGE portions (EASILY feeds 2)! The food is pretty good, it's as ethnic as you can get in the area.  The menus at the front of the store are Chinese, but they have an English menu too.  Really pleasant and fast service."}
{"text":"Delivery was quick but the crab puffs horrible,  nothing inside. The rice bland , egg roll tasted funny and was burnt. Only good thing was sesame chicken.  Never ordering again."}
{"text":"Real, legit, Shaanxi food.    I am convinced the lackluster reviews are from people expecting American-Chinese.  I've been to Xi-an, and House of Egg Roll is pretty spot on.  Rivals Xi'an Famous Foods.  After my first visit, I went back a week later."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Sticky interior.  Incorrect order.  Orange chicken that tasted like they used a ketchup glaze.  Kung pao chicken was all the right ingredients just no flavor or spice.  I didn't finish my egg roll.  Crab puffs were the best part of the meal.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Important to note this restaurant has changed ownership a few months ago. Unfortunately they did not change the name, so old reviews might haunt it. Not much to do with egg rolls anymore. This place is now a shaanxi (western province in china)chinese restaurant.   The food is seriously good, maybe the best  chinese food in phoenix. It's the perfect spice levels. Loved the pork sandwich, stir fry lamb with cilantro, and the qishan noodles were incredible. This is my new chinese staple."}
{"text":"It's been many years since I went to the House of Eggroll and lo and behold, when I called to place a takeout order, it was no longer House of Eggroll.  Was disappointed and as the person answering the phone tried to explain what they had, i just couldn't understand what she was talking about.  I speak Cantonese and very little Mandarin.  For customer service, they tried to be really friendly to us.  I've never had Shan'xi food before, so I'm at a loss for how things should taste.  The portions are really healthy portions and they certainly do a much better job than other Chinese take out places do in their take out containers.  It's still the plastic thing, but lining it with aluminum foil helps keep the sauces in better than without it.  None of the food spilled.  Since I couldn't understand what the dishes were, I had to wait until I got to the restaurant to order.  After placing the order, she said a 15 minute wait.  It was really more like 25 minutes.  It was about 1 pm at the time and most of the restaurant was filled and mainly with Chinese people who spoke Mandarin.  There were a couple white people, but they were with Chinese people.  To see if a place is authentic Chinese or not, just see who is eating there.  If it's mainly Chinese, then it caters to the taste of the more discriminant Chinese.  I had high hopes for the food at this point and was very hungry.  Oh, if you pay cash instead of credit card or debit card, you will receive 10% off your bill, so bring cash.  I was expecting something like $8-10 average a la carte, but it really was closer to $11-15 a la carte average, so more.  We ordered:  - Stir Fried Spicy Chicken - $17 - Mongolian Beef - $13 - Eggrolls (2 per order) - $2.75  - Pork Fried Rice - $9.25 - Beef Chow Mein - $10  The stir fried spicy chicken was REALLY SPICY.  They did NOT skimp on the dried whole red peppers they put in there.  I wished I had taken a picture of this, but the whole dish was really covered it in.  I think they had more of that than the chicken.  I spent a few minutes picking all the peppers out for my family who likes up to medium spicy.  This was like ultra extra spicy.  Flavorful dish, but really spicy and none of us could eat much of it.  Mongolian beef was a bit different than when I've had it other times.  Can't say why, but this was decent.  Eggrolls are like half the size of a lumpia (Filipino eggroll).  I think overpriced at $2.75 for 2.  Two is really like the size of 1 eggroll at a normal restaurant that carries these.  These eggrolls are made with rice paper, like the way I like it rather than the thicker wrappers like for wontons.  The pork fried rice tasted more Chinese and less American.  Nothing to write home about, but okay.  The Beef Chow Mein, well, I ordered Beef Chow Fun and I thought this would be the flat noodles.  The young Chinese woman taking my order probably misunderstood me or I just wasn't making myself clear.  Duh, Chow Fun is a Cantonese dish and this was NOT Cantonese food.  This is more like the Chow Mein you might get at Panda Express (that style of noodles), so i was disappointed here.  Would I come back?  Maybe with my mom and siblings, but not again with my husband and children.  This is not really food that they would enjoy and the other other things on the menu were too weird for them.  I would eat some of the weirder things, but I know my Colombian husband and Blasian kids wouldn't.  They would eat a lot of stuff, but not lamb or gizzards or things like that.  If you want authentic Shan'xi food, this is the place.  If you're looking more for food like Panda Express, not the place for you.  Don't forget, bring cash to save money."}
{"text":"Summary:  Unique, complex, and very flavorful Chinese food, in a clean restaurant, small plaza.  Background: I read about how the owners took over House of Egg Roll but did not change the English name, also was ranked in Time Out magazine's top 17 Chinese restaurants in America. It was sort of funny that so many reviewers write that it is \"authentic\" and \"legit\" - have all of you been to Shaanxi? I actually spent 2 days in Xi'an, the capital of the province, but I didn't get to eat any food like this. I don't doubt its authenticity, I just can't verify it myself. All I can say is that after eating Chinese food all over Asia and America all my life, I've never heard of half these dishes.  More funny were the 1-star reviews lamenting that they didn't have any of their \"chicken dishes\" (specifically Orange, General Tso's, and Sweet & Sour). I lol'd many times reading those while looking at the profile photos of the reviewers. I enjoy a good Panda Express OC just as much as the rest of them, but if you know how to use Yelp, you know that's not what this place is about. I would advise not going here if that's what you're looking for, but it appears they've already fixed that problem - the menu has been revised and no longer has any of the Chinese-American chicken products. This is worth noting also for the foodies, as the revision means the new menus now have different numbers for the food than the old menus did.  Ancillary: A bunch of other reviews criticized the deficient parking. I almost omitted my review so that this place wouldn't get so popular and perhaps just coast along with its 3-stars on Yelp, but after seeing the effort they've gone to at the restaurant to cast a special spotlight on an unsung hero of regional Chinese cuisine, I felt I should offer a dissenting opinion to the parking haters. I got there at 1:30 pm on a Friday afternoon after calling in my pickup order, and the restaurant was almost empty, with several open parking spots. I can definitely understand how crazy it could get inside the limited space and crowded plaza, not to mention their somewhat limited hours, but what can I say? That's the price of a good product. It took us 3 months to get a reservation at Alinea (Chicago), and somehow they're still crushing a 4.5 star rating.  Food:  I ordered the cumin lamb sandwich, the shaanxi handmade noodle, and the noodle nuggets. The cumin lamb was tasty with a nice balance of spices (not spicy spices) to the lamb; it would be a great lunch-on-the-run in its own right for the price, but ultimately was eclipsed by the other two entrees.   The shaanxi handmade noodle is a huge single piece of noodle (made fresh daily according to other publications) that is folded around spicy spices and vegetables. The first bite was quite surprising to me, soft & chewy texture with a moderate spiciness that actually enhances the dish, a feature that I have very very rarely experienced. It's not super different from a cantonese chow fun dish, but I definitely enjoyed the novelty of this continuous sheet of noodle with flavors that don't usually accompany chow fun.   The noodle nuggets were also a nice variation on popularized Chinese dishes; the nuggets are like small gnocchi, though softer. The tomato base with egg called to mind the tomato-egg-rice or tomato-egg-beef that is seen throughout much of the Chinese/Taiwan/HK land mass. The cilantro was the icing on the cake, just enough to remind you that this isn't just a mashup of a some familiar textures & flavors, but a collage with enough complexity to merit greatness."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite, hole in the wall Chinese take out places, then I kind of forgot about them. But they recently stuck a menu in my door so decided to try them out again. Still very tasty, and what a great deal! Lunch special is only $5.75!"}
{"text":"For some reasons, this restaurant made it in Time Out magazine as \"Best Chinese restaurant in America\", so we tried.  This restaurant is not a typical America-Chinese restaurant like Panda Express, etc. So there is no egg roll, sweet and sour Chicken from there.  Ordered some random dishes to try, they are okay but not really my cup of tea. You might like them tho. To me, they are all okay, nothing too excited about.  They should be a 4 stars, but their parking situation is really bad, so either go there early or just forget about it."}
{"text":"I came to this place more than 10 years ago until I heard there is a new owner and new menu recently. I decided to give them a shot.   FOODs are so so and the service is horrible. Staff are friendly, but it took 34 minutes to get a bowl of noodle. Really? Be prepare to wait for a LONG time.   Their excuse was to make sure every table get at least one item, so everyone is happy. It then takes turn to server other items. Some people came 25 minutes behind us was getting their foods before our noodle. That's just ridiculous. It means everyone is waiting for their second item or so. I guess people order more than one items wont' be happy.   Will I come back? Maybe just for take out."}
{"text":"Great option for the real deal...I am not super knowledgable about the history or nuances of shaanxi cooking ( I will  be studying up on them after this ) but I know good food and it is certainly here. Cant wait to come back to try more and have the bbq meats. Highlights:  Celery and tofu skin - light and delicate, very different from other dishes we had and a nice break from the norm. Light numbing pepper, faint cumin, crunchy, nice gelatinous seaweed bites ( vegetarian )  Shaanxi house noodles were a textural challenge for one of us, but I loved it and the flavors of veg and spices were great ( vegetarian )  Pork dumpling, hot sour soup was exceptional ( certainly not vegetarian )"}
{"text":"new ownership! do not look at the reviews from the past. very impressive authentic northern Chinese food! must try! eating now, ill update later."}
{"text":"Shaanxi cuisine, huh? I'd never really heard of it before, but thanks to a recommendation from a helpful Yelper, I've now had the pleasure of dining at House of Egg Roll.  First off- don't be fooled by the name. This isn't an AmeriCanto NY-style Chinese Food Place (yes I stole AmeriCanto, deal with it). This place serves authentic Shaanxi cuisine, which as far as I can ascertain involved crazy huge noodles, pepper and vinegar, and everything is marinated in awesomesauce. They do have more American options on the menu, and I'm sure that one day I'll try them, but that wasn't what this first visit was about. No sirreee Bob. This first visit was to get a nibble of the goods, and boy were they good.  We ordered the House Special Biang Biang noodles, Beef/Lamb something, Cold Tendon and Tripe, and of course... eggrolls.  The eggrolls came first, and they were damned tasty! Light, crispy, small enough to be a perfect appetizer, with a nice sweet and sour sauce. As far as eggrolls go (or I guess, spring rolls?) they were absolutely wonderful. Then the Beef/Lamb came (I forgot exactly which dish it was- it was a House Special). Tender chunks of meat floating in a gravy surrounded by little dots of... bread? Dough? Our server said it was pieces of bread, but I tell ya what it was... IT WAS THE KITTY'S TITTIES. It absorbed the gravy-sauce just perfectly, and was lightly flavored with a thick stew-like texture. The Tendon-Tripe (Fu Qi Fei Pan) came next, and it was actually outstanding. I've started judging places based on this dish, and the presentation at House of Egg Roll did *NOT* disappoint! It was really nice to have a bit of scallion tossed in- the beautiful deep green cilantro contrasted with the fiery red meats oh-so-delightfully, and the flavor was one to savor. Finally, the Biang Biang arrived (I think it's something which they're specially known for) and I knew instantly that this was going to be a five-star review. Enormous thick and wide noodles are supporting a pile of delicious meat, bean sprouts, and green beans. Throw a dollop of their homemade chili sauce on top, mix it up, and you might as well just call you grandmomma to come pick you up off the floor.   Some really nice touches- the menus are all in English and Chinese, and there are pictures on the wall of some of their more popular dishes, so that'll make ordering really easy for you, guailo. One thing that *REALLY* knocked me out was that they never once gave us the side-eye for ordering \"spicy\" foods, or for using chopsticks. If you've read my other reviews, you know that this is a point of annoyance, but not once here was it an issue. Our server was extremely friendly and informative- I asked about the history of the place and he told me all about the new owner and how the restaurant had changed.   You have to ask for their chili sauce, and YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY DO THIS. I'm not sure, but I *THINK* it might be available for purchase. I should check into that- but it's absolutely fantastic. All in all, this was an instant five-star experience. There's nothing that I would have changed about our experience today. Nothing. Not a thing."}
{"text":"I can't review the food as we never had any. We waited 35 mins for a table - which was totally ok! Expected even on a Saturday. When we were sat, no one helped us. Tables were seated after us, given beverages AND ordered and still no one helped us. We decided to walk out after 20 mins of no help."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! I come from Boston, and let's be honest, it is really hard to find good Asian food in Phoenix (except pho - there's a lot of that). DON\"T BE FOOLED BY THE NAME! House of Eggroll is no chow mein joint - they have amazing, flavorful, unique dishes, representative of the Shangxi cuisine of north-central China. Delicious stuff."}
{"text":"I would seriously give zero if there's \"zero star\" this option. The reason I put one start is obviously the worst attitude I ever got in any restaurant in the nation. When we walked in, we were asked to share a table with some other strangers. We refused to share a table but we don't mind waiting. After like 40 minutes we finally got a table. We had been sitting like 10 minutes, and this man came and told us that we HAVE TO move to a smaller table, just because we are a small party? Excuse me? Apparently, he doesn't feel sorry for inconvenience. Well customers shouldn't be told and ordered in this way. I strongly suggest this man to take some management classes at ASU for getting some basic knowledge about how to treat your customers."}
{"text":"House of Trash. Nasty is the best way to describe. Plain and simple. JUST came from there not even 10 minutes ago. General chicken LOOKED like it would be good but uhhhh, no. Chewy and tasteless \"chicken\". Will not be going back. What a waste of $8.63. And it came with white rice instead of fried. Which is my fault. Guess I should've asked."}
{"text":"Great authentic chinese food. Best mongolian beef I have ever had. I have been here 6-7 times and it has always been good. Best Chinese in the Valley"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. We ordered delivery and it got to the house very quickly (we live 5 minutes away) but everything was cold! Was the food just sitting out before they brought it over? The meat was really chewy and the vegetables were mushy. Everything was way too salty. The egg drop soup literally just tasted like salt water. Out of the 10 people at the house nobody could eat the food. We ended up throwing it out and ordering pizza."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service.   Our server, a young woman named Peppin (spelling?) was superb. Friendly, knowledgeable, and in love with the food. It was like she had us for guests in her home and was proud of the food her parents made.   The hot and sour soup was excellent. Piping hot in temperature. Just the right spice. A little sweet. Yum.   We also had a lamb dish with cumin that was awesome. I'd have it again in a second. Chopped lamb. A little spicy. Worth the visit on its own.   The House Biang Biang Noodles were fat, soft, flavorful, and almost melt in your mouth. Mmmm.   The star of the show, however, was the dish recommended by our server. The Double Cooked Pork Slice With Fry Bread was incredible. Never had anything like it. Think bite sized pieces of French toast sticks with bits of tender pork mixed in. Savory, sweet, a little salty from the pork as it should be. An absolute must order."}
{"text":"Authentic food in a super casual atmosphere.     We had the garlic pork - great, the house shaangxi noodles - also great.     Chinese greens and lamb cumin.  Both very good though not spectacular.     If you're tired of the usual Cantonese style then you have to try this place."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place - reviews on Yelp were mixed but some of the dishes sounded good.  The place was packed but we were seated in about 15 minutes.  I ordered a noodle dish since reviews I read raved about them.  My husband ordered a vegetable stir fry.  I ordered tea - had no flavor.  The noodle dish had some vegetables and pork.  The pork tasted salty and looked like it came from a can.  The dish had no flavor.  My husbands vegetables stir fry was just some stir fried bok choy.  It was good  but not great.  We will not return.  Service was terrible - wait staff could not speak English so they were no help in deciding what to order.  Very slow service."}
{"text":"This place is ahhhhmazing! First off, if you walk into an Asian restaurant and it's filled with Asian people ( an Asian invasion) then it is clearly good food! We ordered the biang biang noodles, the spicy shrimp, green beans, vegetable fried rice, and the scallion beef. The portions are huge, the food came out fast and it fed all 6 of us and left us with an entire meal for 6 for leftovers the next day! All the food tastes amazing and authentic. Far from Americanized Asian food. The service was great also! Everyone was so friendly and helpful! I've seen a lot of reviews complaining about their lack of egg rolls and \"typical\" Asian dishes. If you're expecting fried egg rolls and orange chicken, you should probably hit up a Panda Express. We will be coming up frequently! So stoked on this place!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious (except for the really disgusting tap water).  I only had two dishes:  - Hot 'n Sour Soup:   I was waiting for a family member to join me and decided to order this soup while I was waiting.  I figured it'd be pretty standard fare.  I was wrong.  This soup was rich, meaty, spicy, and unique  - Some lamb noodle dish that had one of the most delicious broths I've ever had with some nice red pepper on top.  Truly delicious.  I'm very happy I tried it and once I return, I will write down the name of it  - Solid service.  Pretty quick"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  This is NOT a place for egg rolls.  Or Mongolian beef, or kung pao chicken, or any other Chinese-American food you're looking for.  The idiots that rate this place low for the lack of actual egg rolls need to expand their horizons and understand that \"Chinese\" food as they know it, does not have to conform to their narrow expectations of chow mein and sweet & sour shrimp.  This is Shannxi food.  North-central China.  Abuts Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, and 4 other provinces and the food is influenced by them all.  They use Sichuan chili peppers so be forewarned and expect the numbing, tingliness that it brings.  Especially on the sliced pigs' ears.  Great texture, good heat, along with a hefty dose of sesame oil, this is an excellent dish.  Liang pi (noodles in a sesame based sauce) were awesome.  The deep nuttiness of the sesame permeated the dish and added an unexpected richness.  Shaanxi style handmade noodles were fine, I've had better noodles with better chew, but I'm not going to complain about these.  Braised chicken with potato and pepper was quite good, very filling, and a great meaty course to add to dinner.  Stir fried greens were good, just as good as anywhere else.  Biang biang noodles had a great spicy kick and the noodles had excellent chew.  Finally, I like lamb.  My wife does not.  We ordered the Shaanxi style sandwich with the lamb. I love it.  The crisp edges of the \"bun\" along with the deep meatiness of the lamb, well spiced, with some heat.  It is delicious.  On a side note, my wife, who doesn't really enjoy the Sichuan pepper feel, raves about the fried rice here.  I don't see it, but she says it's the best fried rice in the Valley.  Hmmm . . .  Weekend nights can get crazy here, so be prepared to wait a bit."}
{"text":"Does anyone know what \"Chow fun\" is? It's one of my favorite chinese food dishes. The people at the house of eggrolls had no idea what I was talking about. I don't read or speak any deviations of any of the Chinese dialects. So I did not know what half the menu was(the menu is mostly in Chinese). None of the people behind the cash register could tell me what anything was. If you can't read any of Chinese dialects, don't go there. Chances are, anything you order there, will be a surprise. If you like surprises, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Nice hole in the wall with great tasting Chinese dishes. The noodles are my favorite. Add beef or chicken to the chow mein. Eggs rolls are good and employees are very proud of their restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered from postmates. Three dishes. Two of them are in English. One is in Chinese. But the people there just did one in Chinese. Due to the high delivery fee I paid, which is even much more than that one dish. I'm so angry for that. It definitely lower their device in my mind. It's worst experience I ever had before. I'm sure the deliveryman ask them a lot is this all the dishes. But that girl wouldn't carefully look at that. Don't expect good service from them."}
{"text":"We chose the place for lunch, highly recommend the lamb noodle very warm and delicious.  Service was so so and apparently they take food deliveries during their lunch rush (not typical) but the food definitely makes up for it.    One of the people within our party, was not happy with their dining experience. We mentioned it to the wait staff and they charged him for the dish that he didn't like and replacement choice as well (also no typical).  We assumed they would remove the undesirable choice from the bill.  Additionally they didn't have any eggrolls at the place called \"house of eggroll\", bit odd.  Taking all of this into account we still thought our experience was 5 stars due to the hours of entertainment that we have received when talking with our colleague at \"house of eggroll\".  Well done goes to the staff in their ability to alienate and completely perturb one person in our dinner party but blissfully meet all of the rest of the party's dining needs.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting great entertainment and fodder for hours to come."}
{"text":"The low reviews must be because of some other reason and not for the food.  The Mongolian beef that my husband ordered was crazy good and my chicken chop suey was even MORE crazy good than my husbands (loved that it had no corn starch). It came with crispy noodles but they were really little crispy chips and sooooo delish!   It is primarily a \"take out\" place so you order at the counter and they prepare your food fresh to order.  We did dine in and so we seated ourselves and they brought our food to the table in take out containers with plastic silverware which was ok with us because then we didn't have to go ask for a to-go box.   Our meals came with rice, 2 fantastic crap puffs (the best I have ever eaten)  I usually want sweet and sour sauce but these were already sweet and so there was no need for the sauce.  They are very different from the traditional crab puffs and I highly recommend them.  The veggi spring roll was also fantastic but did need some sweet and sour sauce so next time I will request some.  We ordered the wok wonton soup and the wontons were soooo good and the ingredients were amazing (super fresh shrimp, chicken, pork, wontons and veggies) but the broth lacked in flavor so I would probably skip the soup and try some other soup next time.  If dining in, don't expect much in the ambiance department just expect a \"take out\" atmosphere.  Also, they do not serve hot or cold tea but they do offer other limited drink options.  Highly recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Huge, huge fan of HOER!  As has been said, there has been a change of ownership. I was never there before so don't know how that was.  I do know that I am in love with it now.  This is authentic Northern style (Shaanxi ) Chinese food. Some of the staff have limited English so probably best to come armed with some dish recommendations. Definitely look for Helen Y's review for some more ideas.   We had a variety of dishes on our first visit. 2 stood out strongly.  The Shaanxi-Style Handmade Noodle dish (#52) was fantastic. The noodles were amazing & they were topped with chiles, soybean sprouts, boy choy and vinegar. So good. A bit salty but I'm a fan of salt.  Our other favorite dish was the Hot & Sour Pork Dumpling Soup (#50). This was a recommendation from our server. This was absolutely wonderful. Excellent tasty dumplings with lovely wrappers (that would have been great on their own) in a yummy broth with vinegar, sesame oil & lots of cilantro. This was brilliant. I saw after we ordered that they also have this dish with lamb dumplings.   We also had the Shaanxi Pan-Fried Noodles (#54) on a recommendation from our server. A nice dish. A bit sweet, a bit of heat (sliced jalapenos), pork & onions. I like these noodles but liked the handmade noodles in the first dish even better. Definitely nothing to sneer at.  And then our first recommendation from our server after pointing at the Shaanxi-Style Handmade Noodles was Kung Pao Chicken (#30). It was good but we couldn't get over some of the other dishes. We'll be digging more on the noodle side in future visits.  On our second visit, we had to get the Hot & Sour Pork Dumpling Soup again and it was as amazing as the first time.  We also ordered the Tomato Egg Soup (#14). This was lovely. I'm glad it came out before the hot & sour dumpling soup as its flavor was far more delicate. I'd be happy to eat this again for certain.   More exploring to come!  Pretty much pining to return as soon as I stepped out the door both visits. And I want to go right now too!"}
{"text":"Food is great, and delivery is fast! The customer service is awesome. I order from them often, and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"No egg roll for you! I thought it was hilarious when I first visited. There was a sign on the door, no egg roll, no general chicken, no sweet sour pork, and no orange chicken. Customers are trying to order egg rolls and they kept tell them no egg rolls here.  The name alone is totally American-Chinese style food as what I would expect. I first heard of the restaurant was from an article voted as one of the best Chinese restaurant in America. Seriously! I got to find it out myself.   I dined second time around during dinner time on Father's Day. I hesitated to come again since parking spaces were so limited last time. The small parking lot is shared with other businesses too.   I mainly grew up eating Cantonese food. I love trying different non-Cantonese cuisines. As Andrew Zimmern's would say \"be a traveler, not a tourist\".   We ordered so much food. I only recalled just a few:  Shaanxi Pan-Fried Noodles - I love pan-fried noodles with a slight char. It was savory but greasy.    House sandwich - it was ok for me. All I tasted was mostly spicy Sichuan and chili peppers. I found the Shaanxi sandwich with pork more flavorful.    House Biang Biang Noodles: hot oil noodles = hot burn. If you can't handle the heat, don't even think about eating it. This can be a good hangover dish. It was so greasy.   Lamb Kebab: I don't normally eat lamb. There were so many different unique spices in kebab. It smelled great and tasted just like chicken.   Jelly fish - stay away from this, not fresh.   Stir fry with garlic - the vegetable of the day was really fresh. Just a tip, always ask the server what is the fresh vegetable of day is."}
{"text":"The bad: House of Egg Roll - do not order their namesake-unless you want something that was previously frozen with your typical bright red sweet and sour sauce. Mehhhhh.   Zero parking in this lot.   Will be seated with other people at tables.   Worst tap water ever-get tea or soda   They were out of 3 chicken dishes -those must be good?   Disgusting restroom. And you only went to wash hands-I guess I'll Bring hand sanitizer next time?   The good: We had the scallion beef-good-would order that again. The chicken chow mein was decent, a little greasy tho. The yahnzoo fried rice was good. I think it tastes better even without the ham.   Decent prices, good portions, will come back and try other items and update review.  Almost 100% of diners were Asian-and it was packed. Got to be a good sign, right?"}
{"text":"Really amazing food - pretty authentic considering my friends are from Xi'an. The restaurant opens at 4:30pm for dinner on Saturday so we were the first ones there. The waitresses looked like kpop stars with their all black gear, pale makeup & beanie attire. The service is nothing to desire for but their food is delicious. We had their noodle soup with lamb, pao mo noodle soup, braised chicken (???), Liang pi & lamb skewers. So so delicious and spicy right where you like/need it to be!  The restaurant was freezing cold & again, could use some improvements on the service (like smiling, putting the food down rather than throwing it on the table practically, checking up on us at least once during the meal)."}
{"text":"Low quality food, crappy service, and high prices.   I have been a patron of H.O.E.R for many years (and I mean fifteen or sixteen years), and tonight was officially the last time I will dine with them again. The food has gotten worse and the portions have gotten smaller but the prices are higher than ever.   I ordered the po po platter and this is what I got:   1 crab puff, 1 fried shrimp, 1 beef stick, and a big hunk of rancid pork. I was only able to eat a couple bites of the pork before I had to throw it away. You could tell immediately when you bit into it that something was very wrong.     There are places with much better (and probably safer) food for the same price."}
{"text":"Very nice little place to eat. Service is great and food is tasty. We had the braised chicken. Love it!"}
{"text":"After reading an article on this being one of the best Chinese food places, and after a friend confirmed that they were good and recommended the Mongolian beef and fried rice, we finally tried it and ordered the Mongolian beef and fried rice, as well as the seaweed salad. We tried to order one of the three chicken dishes, orange, sesame and general tsos, but they were out of all three. I was not impressed with the Mongolian beef, it was bland, cut in large pieces and average sauce. The fried rice was bland and not as flavorful as I was expecting. The seaweed salad was delicious, but WAY too spicy, I couldn't even eat it. The few bites I had were full of flavor and crisp! If you like spicy, I recommend that, otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this place. I will add that we ordered items not from the region they are known and praised for, so those might be better."}
{"text":"Its different type of Chinese food ! No egg rolls hahah be prepare but the soup and noodles were delicious! It always good to try a different spot and the food its spicy and it has a lot of flavor . You only see asian people which is a good sign ! My kids love it"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I'll never go back. My first time here & I needed more time to look through the menu & the girl (waitress) rolled her eyes. Everything is oily and unhealthy. Felt like I ate a whole tub of lard."}
{"text":"They mean well at this restaurant.  The service is arguably the worst I have ever experienced in a restaurant.  The food makes up for it signficantly.  Sesame tofu is my entre of choice, and it comes with an egg roll, two batter-dipped shrimp, and sweet + sour sauce.  I believe all (or most) entres come with the same, as my boyfriend also receives those sides when he orders something different.  The food is excellent!  I would recommend buying and bringing it home, since the service is so terrible.  On my first visit, the teenage girl working there would not pick her head up from the counter and scribbled our order down without ever looking up or smiling.  The food was then thrown in front of us.  But don't worry; something about the food is good enough to keep us coming back."}
{"text":"This place de facto markets itself as a delivery and take-out joint.  It has tables you can sit at and mentions eating on-site in their materials, but their emphasis is on delivery and take-out--you shouldn't expect a compelling, dine-in experience because that's not who they are.  That being said, they are pretty good at what they do. In my book, the yumminess of a Chinese restaurant's shrimp lo mein is a key performance indicator of cooking ability. They do a very good (i.e., a \"4.5\") shrimp lo mein: not excellent, but very solid.  Where they lost 0.5 point is for their skill at \"understanding what the customer is saying\" and \"attention to incoming online orders.\" The good news is that if you place an order online, it will probably get FAXed to the restaurant. The bad news is that they might not look for it or notice that a FAX has arrived. This was the first time I used their online ordering capability so I also called in to give them my order (telling them that I also made an order online) just to make sure my food was ready when I got there. When I arrived, my food was ready, but only because I'd called in: when I asked the person at the counter if my online order arrived, he said, \"Shrimp lo mein?\" I said, \"Yes, but did you receive my online order?\" To which he replied, \"Shrimp lo mein?\" We did that again before I told him to get someone else to the front. That other person understood my question the second time I asked it, looked under the counter, and pulled up the heretofore ignored incoming FAX of my order. He then looked at me and said, \"Yeah, we got it.\"  Advice: call in your order."}
{"text":"Got the orange tofu, was cocked quickly but very bland and not chewy.   From the east cost, I like my food rich in flavor and this wasn't it. It was not bad, how ever it wasn't good.  Would not go again, but food was edible."}
{"text":"Epic fail. Good food but they never EVER get it right on the first try. It's not worth waiting 3 hours for.  Done. Done. Done."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. It took over an hour and a half to get our food and when it finally came it was cold, incorrect and disgusting!!! How is this place in business?!"}
{"text":"I was told by close fiends that new ownership took over this resturant and their chinese food is authentic (that means they don't just serve orange chicken or Kung Po chicken...people that ISN'T chinese food). Finally, I had a chance to give it a try yesterday afternoon.   The parking is chaotic. It is located in a small parking lot as it is. All the stores in the plaza are marking most of the parking spots. I almost turned around and left simply because everyone was fighting for parking spot aggressively. Fortunately, someone happened to leave the restaurant and I was lucky enough to get the spot. (And someone tried to steal it while I was waiting .... r u crazy???)  The restaurant was super packed and we ended up sharing tables with other customers. Nice people. There were only 3 people working. One is the busboy and two waitresses who are also acting as cashiers and hostess at the same time. Those poor ladies were running around like chicken the entire hour I was there. For appetizer, we ordered fresh cucumber that was marinated in garlic sauce. It was average. For main entree, we ordered green string bean and beef with scallion. String bean is absolutely delicious but the other dish was also average. As I was leaving, I've noticed that most people ordered the noodle dishes and perhaps that was what I should have ordered.   I'll come back here again to order something else different. But for sure, I will not come back here during lunch rush hour lol overall, I think this place is OK"}
