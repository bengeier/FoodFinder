{"text":"Been going here for 20 years - amazing authentic Mexican and great family run service!"}
{"text":"This place introduced me to mole sauce and I am forever grateful! This restaurant is a little out of the way but worth the trip (Van Horne and St. Urbain)  I used to live in Montreal and when I come back for a visit, I make sure to visit La Hacienda.  The guac is amazing and while I haven't tried many things on the menu, based on their mole sauce..I'm sold."}
{"text":"A place to skip for sure!  Food was tasteless and staff/service was horrible.  We all felt like we were bothering the waitress.  We ordered 6 meals and not one was flavorful.  There are too many wonderful restaurants to choice from, this not being one!"}
