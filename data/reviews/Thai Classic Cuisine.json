{"text":"I like the food but the service is terrible.  It is painful to order anything for delivery.  They never seem to have anyone that can so much as take an address let alone an order."}
{"text":"Was there a couple weeks ago cause I was starving and craving for Thai food, it was also raining outside and I didn't have an umbrella. I ordered vegetable spring rolls and Thai spicy noodles, this is what I normally order at any Thai restaurant, but the experience here was shocking. I was the only one in the whole restaurant (I should have known from that fact that this place is not that great, but hey, we are all human, and I was hungry!), and it took them about 20 minutes to make the spring rolls, and 30 minutes to make Thai spicy noodles, ugh, why, why?   The spring rolls looked ok, but when i bite down, the centre part was icy cold while the outside crispy part burned my tongue, was it intended that way? I don't know, I had to send it back, cause I can't eat spring rolls that filled with little ice chunks in the centre, and it took them another 20 minutes to make another order.   Don't remember much about the spicy Thai noodles, just remember it was being below average quality comparing to other places.   Anyway, I've been to many restaurants that serve vegetable spring rolls, but it was the first time I had one that was filled with little ice chunks, I hope you can learn something from my mistake."}
{"text":"To me \"Thai Classic Cuisine\" is the best Thai restaurant in Bloor West village. The best bang for your buck !!  It has everything I expect from a 5 star restaurant on Yelp: 1) Clean environment. 2) Good/friendly service. 3) Reasonable prices. 4) Generous portions. 5) Tasteful food"}
{"text":"Can't ask for a better Thai place.  Been there a few times, and everything from service to food is always consistent.  You always know what you're going to get.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  You don't have wait for food too long, and when it arrives it tastes amazing.  The portions are great and can't beat the prices."}
{"text":"We were there last night and were the only diners - must have been an off night due to folks being out of town.  I cannot agree with the previous reviewer.  Food was just so-so.  Tom Kha Kai was too watery and way too stingy on the chicken.  Spice noodles were very spicy and tasty but had way too much sauce and not enough noodles and meat.  A dessert of mango slices with sweet rice was simple, but a winner.  Prices are about average for Thai"}
{"text":"Lately, I am craving thai food day and night. I felt compelled during a jaunt in Bloor West Village, to try Thai Classic Cuisine. Mixed yelp reviews left me curious.    I went  in for the lunch special - $7.95 for a spring roll, soup and main course. I chose to opt for 2 spring rolls and a main course of ginger chicken and pad thai. The server was pleasant but the food was awful. The pad thai did not have very much flavour, the ginger chicken lacked chicken and the sauce on top was not gingery. The meal was basically a disaster.   My thai cravings are going to have to be filled somewhere else. I don't think I will be returning to Thai Classic Cuisine."}
