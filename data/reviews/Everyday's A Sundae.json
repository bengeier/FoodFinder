{"text":"This place is disorganized and unprofessional.  It seems like all/most of the food is, or was, frozen at some point.  Not fresh.  Much of their coffee is flavored and tastes old.  Their espresso machine is so loud, I swear it's broken.  It took a girl like five minutes to steam my milk and the latte still wasn't hot.  Don't advertise yourself as a cafe if coffee and drinks aren't a priority.  This place is trying too hard.  It's basically a bakery/ice cream shop/deli....weird.  I say get rid of the nasty frozen food and focus solely on pastries and ice cream."}
{"text":"I stopped in this past Saturday for coffee and I'm so glad I did. The space used to occupy Vanilla Pastry Studio and still has the cute, modern atmosphere which was very welcoming. The two women who worked there greeted us and told us about the two coffees of the day. I had the Nutcracker, a blend of cinnamon, almond, and sweet cream which proved to be a great holiday coffee to start the season!   For lunch, I tried the Southwestern wrap from their amazing list of sandwiches. The wrap came nicely grilled from the panini press and was filled with the perfect balance of fresh spinach, tomatoes, cheese, and chicken breast. It came with a side of potato chips (or you can choose potato salad), and drink (I chose coffee) for under $9.  Our server brought it to our table and made sure we had everything we needed. She didn't rush us and answered all of our questions.  They also offer homemade pastries, ice cream, gelato, and fresh-pressed juices. The next time I stop by, I hope to try some of their sweets. They are incredibly nice, the food was delicious, and I hope they get more business."}
{"text":"Great variety of sandwiches and all day breakfast. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and my wife had the Verona (turkey breast, smoked applewood bacon, cheddar, lettuce and tomato on ciabatta) The wrap I had was delicious and my wife enjoyed her sandwich but they forgot the cheese on the Verona. Fret not, customer service was amazing and when I mentioned the missing cheese after a hostess asked how everything was they offered a free pastry! Chose red velvet and wow moist not stale and sitting out for days- very satisfying. Visiting from DC but when we move to Pittsburgh will definitely come back for the all day breakfast cause it looked just as amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this east-side gem for some brunch while I waited for my dentist appt. Ordered the triple meat breakfast sandwich and it exceeded my expectations. The place has a cozy casual vibe, where I was able to briefly work on my laptop with their free wifi with minimal interruptions. The food and service was enough to know I should stop in again whenever I'm in the east-side area."}
{"text":"I've tried the breakfast food in this place twice and been disappointed both times.    First visit:  Tried to enter this place at 8:15am,  15 minutes after they open - the door was locked.  Took about 5 minutes of knocking to get someone's attention to open the door.   Ordered a sausage, egg, and cheese bagel sandwich to go.   Upon unwrapping the sandwich and beginning to eat,  I noticed the egg was essentially a fragile lump of undercooked scrambled egg.  So the sandwich disintegrated rapidly every time you took a bite. It was quite messy.  Also the cheese they used tasted like one of those individually wrapped slices of fake cheese you buy in the supermarket when you are on a low budget.  After I paid,  I asked the woman at the counter how business was going.  She replied gloomily that the Starbucks down the street takes all of their morning business.    Second visit, a month later:  Walked through the door at 8:15 (this time the door was open) and the woman behind the counter (a different one this time) seemed literally shocked to see a customer...  I asked if they had any muffins.  She pointed out three cupcake-sized blueberry muffins in wax paper.   I bought one only because I hadn't eaten yet and needed to grab something and run.   The undersized muffin was half-stale and cost $2.    These muffins look like what you buy at Costco in bulk at low prices - not what you would expect from a cafe..    Yeah... Starbucks is their problem...  Meanwhile,  all summer long,  just a few doors away from them there is a huge construction project with dozens of hungry construction workers...  I walk by this cafe everyday and have never seen a construction worker go in or out of this place."}
{"text":"I love it here! They are so nice. This is the first place I have been where it feels like I'm right back in Texas because they are so kind and helpful and personable. The food is yummy like a home cooked breakfast;) will be back over and over again!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today after learning they have an all-day breakfast menu. My coworker told me about this place.  I got a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel. I had my choice of a plain or everything bagel. I chose plain. I also asked for my food to go because I only have a half hour for lunch. I've heard that they take a while to make your food even if you call it in ahead of time. I decided to just go and hope for the best. I was greeted by a sweet woman who took my order. They also have baked goods there, so of course I had to get something to try. I got the Oreo blondie. I didn't have to wait long for my food at all... Definitely less than 10 minutes. My sandwich was huge with generous amounts of egg, bacon, and cheese. I will definitely be back to this place! I can't wait for the summer time so I can try their ice cream. Overall, if you are out in East Liberty, you should definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream. They even support local ice cream shops. They have their own brand of coffee as well. Unsure of the taste. They do breakfast as well, with only 3 items on the menu which is better than what u would expect. None the less. It's great."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, so much that I've decided to finally write my first yelp review. First off, every single employee is friendly and goes above and beyond. Second, their sandwiches. For $4 their breakfast sandwiches are the same price/cheaper than other places and are insanely fresh and delicious. Get it on a croissant, it's amazing. If I'm not mistaken they bake their own bread here. The other sandwiches are great too, especially the one with the artichoke spread. The coffee is great (they can make any flavor latte you can think of) and from a local source. Third, they sell fresh from the farm juices at exactly what you'd pay if you went down to the actual place.   This place is legit and has some of the friendliest service I've seen around."}
{"text":"Eat here! This place makes amazing sandwiches at an awesome price. Attractive and clean shop. Friendly service. Eat here for lunch, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderfully operated family run and owned gem off Centre Ave.   The food is delicious. They always have a special which is delicious.   The cookies and pastry display has had only good things to offer that I have found.   The cupcakes are incredible.   Cool flavored coffee's   I have yet to try the ice cream but I'm sure that's good too.   It's also really well decorated. Very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've stopped in a few times for cupcakes and decided to have Natalie cater my baby shower tea party.  She made amazing mini cupcakes and let me choose any flavors I could imagine (went with chai w/cinnamon frosting, pistachio, lemon raspberry, and chocolate hazelnut).  She also made delicious scones and finger sandwiches.  The egg salad was amazing & their homemade pesto in the caprese sandwiches was excellent.  This our new go-to cafe in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Most people know this as a great place for ice cream. But I was delighted to find lots of wonderful options for breakfast and lunch.   Although the menu is extensive, they can fix your breakfast anyway you like it. Prices are very reasonable.  But most of all, I like how friendly the staff are, they welcome everyone and work hard to keep their business.  I had a nice talk with the owner, Natalie,  and I told her I would definitely be back.  One other note, they do catering."}
{"text":"Tiny ice cream/coffee shop in East Liberty on Penn Circle.  Not a lot of selections but open early.  Four stars for coffee for a dollar.  Hard to find parking at later hours due to construction nearby.  Walking distance from Target."}
{"text":"Super cute place. Bright, clean and friendly service. I had the bacon, egg, and cheese croissant sandwich which I enjoyed. It was a substantial sandwich for me and quite filling. As another reviewer mentioned, the croissant is not the flaky, puffy croissant that  you would get from a French bakery. I got a delicious chocolate chip cookie on my way out. Happy to have happened upon this family owned eatery."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Not only do they serve everything you could possibly want: breakfast, sandwiches, coffees, ice cream, bakery items, etc. at very reasonable prices. It is a great and usually pretty quiet place to study. Above all, the service is AMAZING. I have not yet been anywhere else that treats their customers so well! Every time I come in here they treat me the same way, no matter how busy they are. They offer samples of items that you are unsure of, provide refills on coffee (that is way less expensive than any other coffee shop - and yummier too!), they cater to your every need and are just adorably sweet. I love coming here to study and highly recommend it. Keep up the great job :)"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! I came here after walking by it several times. It is the perfect lunch spot - quick, delicious, and cheap! The turkey with bacon on the ciabatta was excellent! And the Sante Fe wrap is also great! It came with a side of soup (I got the chili and it hit the spot) and a drink for $9! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"DA veggie is just amazing. As well as the potato salad. Mmmm they are always super nice and the place is sooo clean and lovely."}
{"text":"I always knew this place was good for ice cream but have you tried the breakfast food  one day me and my boyfriend Second time there and we got breakfast food this time, he ordered waffles with sausage, hash browns, & eggs, I got a breakfast burrito. My boyfriend loved his food and especially his eggs because he's a texture kinda guy and I loved my breakfast burrito  my favorite part was the hash browns, they where perfect we will highly recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Neat little cafe--good sandwiches, friendly owners, and lots of desserts. The Da Vinci sandwich was an inexpensive and quite filling lunch option and paired well with a strawberry lemonade. Will go for the ice cream next time as per their name!"}
{"text":"I've lived in this area for three years and have never tried this place. I'm so glad I finally did. Stopped in on a Saturday morning after looking for new breakfast places to try on Yelp. It's a cute little café that offers a lot of different items - including its own ice cream parlor. I love a good breakfast sandwich and after seeing all the different options, I knew I was at the right place. I ordered the Butchie that has fried capicola, provolone, a fried egg and tomatoes on it. It traditionally comes on a bagel, but they were out. However, I got it on a croissant instead and it was SO good. I also got a hot coffee, which was also great. Everything here is homemade and the staff was super friendly. Seemed like they knew everyone that walked in the door. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is my spot for breakfast and lunch sandwiches, a macaroni salad that's unparalleled, good coffee, great pastries, delicious ice cream and a super kind staff that is always a pleasure to give my business to. Small cafe, big hearted people."}
{"text":"the food is well above average and the staff is friendly.  What more could you want?   I come here occasionally to get work done and it's a good place to hunker down, connect to the wifi, and knock out some emails."}
{"text":"It was that time of day where you wanted lunch and a coffee. Well, I wanted lunch and a coffee. I'm a frequent flyer of Starbucks since it's close to my house, but I'm also a huge fan of local businesses. I've never been here and the first time I passed it I assumed it was an ice cream place. The parking situation kind of sucks because it's along that main strip where there's construction and turning lanes. All you really have right there is curbside parking that's usually quick to fill up. I found a spot though!  Upon entering I noticed it was bigger than I imagined and the space was inviting/clean. There were tall round tables to the right and near the window there were two to three spacious tables situated. They have a lot going on in terms of menu items. There was breakfast with extremely friendly prices, sandwiches, coffee, muffins, buckeyes (I got three and they were huge and delicious!), lemon bars, cupcakes. They of course have ice cream as well, but I didn't see or sample any this time. There were two friendly ladies helping two of us out.  I grabbed a bottle of water, got a tall vanilla latte, and a Milano sandwich. The total for all three was $11. I really enjoyed the sandwich and my vanilla latte. The combination of flavors was just right and the sandwich itself was a good size cut in half. I'd love to try their ice cream. There were only two things I wasn't a fan of: When you walk in there is a noise to let people know someone walked through the door. It wasn't like a ding...a bit lengthy and annoying. Another sore spot was the steamer whenever someone ordered a latte due to how obnoxiously loud it was. Maybe it appeared loud because it was quiet or something with the space being smaller, but I don't recall ever hearing anything so loud when coffee is being made. Just my take though and not something that would take away from the great spot."}
{"text":"Fantastic wrap! $7 lunch special included chicken bacon ranch wrap, chips and home made lemonade! Friendly service and excellent food. Can't wait to come back for the ice cream"}
{"text":"Really good place and nice people. I like the pastries, cakes, and Icecream. I have not had their food though. I bought my gf a cheesecake from there and it was very good. I like that the owner is willing to stock different items the customer may like."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch yesterday as I was looking for somewhere I hadn't been yet by my office on the East End. The place looks inviting and the staff is very friendly. The menu was nothing that knocks your socks off, providing several sandwich and salad selections. The nice touch though was the availability of gluten free buns. I got a Milano Sandwich on ciabatta and my lunch friend got a turkey sandwich on a gluten free bun. For me, the hallmark of a good sandwich has to start with the bread and this passed for us both. The ciabatta was really good and the meats used were fresh. That said, it was still a run of the mill sandwich. I've had better, I've had worse.   They also have a nice selection of Hershey's Ice Cream which is typically very good (see my review for Scoops in Bloomfield).   The one negative I did have is while the service was friendly, there was only 2 people working so things were slow for just two people ordering, but any kind of a rush and they might get overwhelmed quickly."}
{"text":"I only came in to grab a breakfast sandwich to go but I thought the women running the shop were nice. I didn't have to wait long (~5 mins) for the sandwich, but it turned to be just okay. There are definitely tastier croissants to be found elsewhere in the city and the cheese looked like your average slice of Kraft singles, but the price was  reasonable and I'm all for supporting local businesses. They also have a bunch of pastries so I might try on my next trip there. But for now giving the place 3*, but will update it when I try some of their other stuff"}
{"text":"Clean and cute cafe! The people who work there are very friendly and personable. I had an incredibly difficult time deciding on what to buy because all the sweets seemed so novel! There were chocolate peanut butter pies, banana walnut cupcakes, caramel apple pies, and the like. In the end I decided on a slice of cheesecake and a red velvet bar with what looked like cream cheese frosting swirled on the surface and baked with the bar.  The cheesecake was SO rich and sweet that even as someone with a major sweet tooth, I found it cloying after about 3/4 of it. The other customer who ordered it as dessert had to split it with two other people for that reason too.  The red velvet bar didn't have the characteristic taste of red velvet though. It didn't even taste of chocolate/cocoa at all, which I found odd. And both cakes had bits of paper stuck to the bottom, so I probably ingested quite a bit before feeling a piece in my mouth. I do, however, like that they just make \"whatever they feel like\" that day, as it makes for a pleasant surprise every visit.  For my second visit, I tried the \"peppermint stick\" and \"strawberry cheesecake\" ice cream flavors. Peppermint taste was strong without being overpowering - wonderful flavor. Strawberry cheesecake was tougher to identify, though the strawberry part definitely provided plenty of flavor. They weren't so much creamy as icy.  I definitely have to stop by again to try the sandwiches!"}
