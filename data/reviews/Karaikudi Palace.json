{"text":"Food is average, cost is Moderate, service is bad, too crowded and not organized. Comparing to good indian resturant this is not good."}
{"text":"As someone who eats a lot of Indian food, this place was great!  Excellent service and the curries were awesome."}
{"text":"Good food but horrible service. I called in for take out and came to the restaurant about 45 minutes later, as they told me to. When I arrived the man working said it would be ready in 5 minutes. I ended up waiting 30 minutes. Only reason I didn't leave was because he kept telling me it would only be just a few minutes. DONT order take out."}
{"text":"Love it.   Spicy, good selection, CLEAN, friendly, amazing food!  So glad it's in e neighborhood. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Tuesday evening, didn't know what to expect based on reviews that were all over the place.  What we 4 noticed was a reasonable number of other folks enjoying themselves on a sweltering summer Scottsdale evening.  Now onto what's important:
-the food was great; tasty, authentic, not  cookie cutter Indian (probably because this is S. Indian food), as good as other out of town restaurants we've sampled
-Dosa were tasty, fresh, even vegetarian; other dishes as well.
-service and atmosphere were fine, friendly and competent
-only downside is no liquor license (\"yet\") so no Kingfisher with our meal
-only other downside is my inability to remember the name, so it's now the \"Palace Place on the north side of Shea near the 101\"
-Dinner for 4 hungry adults was about $75 before tip

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We went here a lunch buffet and found the food awful. The food was stale, greasy and tasted bad. The food tasted old or spoiled. The yogurt rice dish they had was positively gone bad. The fruits were old , dry and smelled like onions possibly they were cut with knives which were used to cut onions and not cleaned. The Naan bread was hard and chewy . Food was running out and not being stocked. They also charged us an automatic 18% tip for party of 8 for a lunch Buffet!! There was absolutely no service except for the water jug they left on our table. No one bothered to ask if needed anything else to drink. We had to stop by their cash counter to let them know that they did not have enough glasses on the table. All this when the place did not even look busy.

The restroom was not clean , smelled bad , floor was wet and paper towels ran out and not stocked. You can tell the cleanliness and hygiene of a restaurant from the way they maintain their restrooms, i would stay away from this place. This place should be checked and cited by the state health inspector."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent in the buffet. Tasted just perfect and I enjoyed the food. 
South Indian dishes were outstanding including the non-veg.

I will go there again."}
{"text":"Food is average. I went for a lunch buffet. Lots of food in buffet. Only turn off of huge crowd in the small place. It's a long line to get buffet and if you wanna go for 2nd round you have to stand in the big line again. By the time you get turn, most probably you won't be hungry anymore!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat at Karakudi at least twice a month.  We come back because the food is outstanding and the service is always great, both in attitude and attention.  Sam treats all customers as if he's known them for years and he soon makes you feel that he has.  Whether your a first timer or a regular, Sam often surprises his guests with a complimentary menu item, including their addicting coffee mousse. In addition, if your're a wine drinker, Sam is also very generous with his pours.  Truly great food, warm staff and always a fun meal."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch today. it was really excellent.  We had the buffet - hands down the best yet. They even had two different types of soups - both excellent. You will not find  better Indian dinning in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!!!

We had yet to find Indian food we really loved since moving here three years ago but alas everything we had was delicious. We were mostly familiar with northern Indian food so we mixed a favorite of that style with a great set of appetizers, soups, and entrees of southern Indian style.  Things do skew a little on the spicy side so as others have said, just be aware and have them tone it down if that's not for you.  There were a couple of menu items they were out of but they kindly suggested similar alternatives that were excellent. 

Atmosphere was really nice - very stylish and modern, not what I'd experienced in most Indian restaurants. Our service was friendly and attentive. 

Food arrival was on the slow side - worth the wait but be sure to give yourself enough time. We were needing to be somewhere so it did cause some stress at the table that did detract a bit from the experience. 

Overall we all agreed we would definitely be back again soon to have our new favorites again and try some things we didn't get to this time.

FYI they apparently used to be open on Mondays but aren't any longer."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Indian restaurants! Yummy! The malai kofta with the cashew sauce is divine. The chicken tikka is really delicious. Garlic naan was a good choice and to finish it off the gajar halwa was oh so tasty. The waitstaff is really running but still ultra friendly and helpful.Â  My husband (who is Indian) and I always enjoy ourselves."}
{"text":"Delicious indian food! Loved the fact that there was both North and South Indian food in the buffet so I got to eat my dosa :) Chicken biriyani was also delicious which I found surprising because I feel like my mom's is the best and never order it at a restaurant. Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"The newest place in town which serves south Indian food. Always a rarity if you aren't in Chandler so I am glad for another option to try (The other one is Madras Anand Bhavan). Needless to say, always go for the buffet so you can try multiple dishes. The buffet here has a mix of both north and south indian food . My feedback is mixed. The sambhar was quite watery and the north indian dishes were pretty average but I liked everything else in the buffet. Ask for the dosa in the buffet, there are plenty of other places you can try Naan."}
{"text":"I have eaten their lunch buffet once a week for several weeks now and think its the best Indian I've tasted in the Valley so far."}
{"text":"i love indian food...glad they serve buffet style so I can try a lot of different dishes. I like their selection of food...vegetarian, poultry, dessert. I wish they add some indian beverage too."}
{"text":"We went for dinner here. While they took the order without much delay, it took more than 30 mins for them to serve the food although the order was only for fried rice. There was also a big scene with a bunch of families walking out due to chicken served in their vegetarian food, which made us scary. After the families walked out, when we were talking waiting for food, the chef came out, voluntarily sat down in our table and started talking about that even though we clearly showed in our face that we would rather be left alone. He finally left after we didn't speak at all. Food was only ok, have had better food at other places. Would not go back again,"}
{"text":"Moved to Scottsdale from the Washington DC area and we were craving some of our favorite Southern Indian cuisine but had a hard time finding it UNTIL we found Karaikudi Palace.  We had eaten at other Indian restaurants in the area and they were okay but when you are craving Dosa or Uthappam there is no substitute.  Read the reviews here and set out to take a chance on Karaikudi Palace tonight.  The decor is not overstated but very appealing and clean.  The restaurant wasn't very busy when we arrived.  The staff were very friendly and attentive.  We ordered two of our favorite appetizers - Idly and Medu Vada and they were delicious.  The chutneys that accompanied the apps were yummy too.  They were familiar flavors but these tasted very fresh and had a bit of a kick to them.  The Sambar was thick and full of flavor.  We were pleased so far.  From there we ordered Masala Dosa and Paneer Uthappam.  I had been craving Uthappam since leaving DC and tonight's was outstanding.  Dare I even say the best I have ever had. The Dosa was crisp and light and the potato mixture was seasoned well.  We were very happy people as we ate and couldn't stop talking about how great this place is and more people need to go so it sticks around.  We live close by and having a gem like this within biking distance is awesome.  We also had an order of the Butter Naan and it too was wonderful.  We love to dip our Naan in Raitha and this one was thick and luscious, not watery which is what we were used to.  You could eat it with a fork and it was good with all of our food, a great accompaniment!  We intended to order a curry dish or Vindaloo but we were fat and happy at that point so we will just have to go back soon to indulge.  If you are a fan of Indian food you gotta go try this place.  It would be a shame if they didn't stick around."}
{"text":"Very very good! Chicken Tikka for the non-spice lover & Kadai Veg for spice-lover me; mine was spicy enough with great flavors. Loved the pappadum, really liked the roti & was less impressed with the aloo paratha (seemed a little skimpily stuffed). Our order was taken by the guy who seated us (apparently not a waiter), who forgot to bring out roti & raita. Other staff were friendly, informative & chatty. Next we're trying the buffet lunch. Definitely better quality than most of the Indian restaurants I've tried."}
{"text":"Best Indian food and buffet in AZ. Frequent customer... Great food and friendly people."}
{"text":"Went with spouse for Buffet on a Friday. As a vegetarian, I didnt eat the other non veg varieties. But I can say this. The food tastes really good. Three varieties of desserts, and four options at least for veg and non veg curries. They provide complimentary masala dosa AND  Nan, so its your choice what to eat. With most other Indian restaurants, its an either/ or. The veggie bondas( dumplings) were Amazing.. Just the right amount of spice, and the chutneys to accompany them were tasty too. As for non veg curries, they had South Indian, Tamilian, pepper fry versions of lamb, and to cater to the Nan, Chicken tikka masala. Their a la carte menu looks extensive. Will go back for dinner definitely. 

Hope they remain true to the Tamilian tradition and offer more authentic dishes."}
{"text":"I took my parents yesterday for a dinner. They gave us the table right away but it took another 10 mins to come back with a menu. We looked at the menu and were ready to order in 5 mins but no one would come to table to take the order. Another 10 mins later waiter came with Papadum and Chutney... Took our order... Than the waiting was unbelievable as I asked the waiter and the manager after 30 mins where is our food... And the interesting part was that another family who came after us and order after we ordered but their food was served within 25 mins... Finally, after 50 mins part of the order was served and waited another 12-15 mins to get the remaining order. Service was horrible and had to asked them twice to get us pickle and onions. The food was terrible...despite telling them medium spicy the food was tasteless. It felt like it was warmed up in the microwave and served except garlic naan. I am not sure why the owner is not taking any action to improve the service."}
{"text":"Been there twice for lunch buffet, it was quite good. Specially desert and Shrimp fry"}
{"text":"Went there for the buffet today after we had two enjoyable dinners previously. We got there at noon and half the food wasnt even ready.

The food was awful. The rice was uncooked, the paneer was sweet, the chicken was questionable. They had no naan until 45 minutes after we got there and I swear it was frozen and reheated. The dosa never made it out. The waiters kept saying it was coming and never did. There was no apology. No one even asked if we wanted anything to drink.  The most appetizing thing at the restaurant were the cheeseburgers at the next table that two kids brought in from Culvers. Awful. Save your money.

I think they are under new (totally disorganized) management. We are never going back."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to try the lunch buffet... Wonderful! Lots of vegetarian options. We will be back ... Maybe weekly?"}
{"text":"Food is good. Over priced!!! Not worth. 
Service: VERY BAD. We went with our family including a baby. While paying the bill in middle of the lunch buffet, the owner adviced us not to take more food and waste them. He asked us to restrict to whatever can be only consumed. In fact, we had some gravy leftovers which could not be taken. This was really dissappointing and hurting. 
VERY INDESCENT behaviour to customers in a buffet. I spoke to the owner in person and informed him that there was no food which was just wasted without even being tasted and asked him if he was specific in any item being wasted. 
His response was that \"Next Time I will take a Photo and show you\". This was the most filthy answer you can get out of a guy owning a restaurant. 
I would definitely stay away and keep my friends and fellow beings stay away from this restaurant!

The last thing, we had to step out to take care of our baby towards the end of the lunch. When I came back to check my dish at the table, the table was fully cleaned and was ready for the evening. My bags and my baby car seat was still hanging around in that table and the table looked very well that it was unfinished. 

Stay Away! I read the other comments just now.. Will not repeat getting in here.."}
{"text":"We ate lunch and ordered from the menu- the lamb curry was delicious!! The garlic nan just melted in your mouth. The owner / manager was very friendly .
Will surely come back"}
{"text":"Had lunch buffet on a Sunday afternoon. Food was below average. Dosas and Mysore bondas were the only eatable stuff. I should better not talk about the non-veg dishes, simply avoidable. Dessert was good especially the moong dal payasam. Won't be going to this place again for a long time."}
{"text":"Why Did i ever go here... wasted Money and left back the food, complained it was not good but was ignored and they could not wait to charge my card.

Never again...dont visit either ....there are better places chennai chettinad, delhi palace for example"}
{"text":"After a long wait the waiter finally came to our table, however about 5 seconds  one of the cooks went storming out of the restaurant and our waiter ran out after her. The waiter came back and explained that these things happen. Again after a long wait our food finally came. The food itself was pretty good, but they forgot to bring out the Samosas. Finally after complaining after we had finished eating they brought out the samosas, but by that time we were too full to eat them. They also forgot to bring out the sauce. The people at the table next to us were in a hurry (and had told them at the beginning of the meal) and had to leave before their food was served. Another table who's food was also late also ended up getting upset. I know a little Hindi and I think that I heard someone from the backroom swear in Hindi, but I'm not sure.  I know that they won an award last year, and maybe they had different management, but this was a pretty horrible experience and I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Good Food
Awful Service

We were seated relatively promptly but the problems began when it took 10 minutes for the waiter to come over to take our order (2 chais, chana saag, lamb rogan josh, and garlic naan).  Our chai arrived in 10 minutes--pretty tasty, enough for another helping.  After 20 minutes with no food, the waiter said the kitchen was backed up and that our food was coming out soon.  10 minutes later, a different person (maybe the manager?) came by just to ask if we had ordered yet.  When we said yes, he just nodded and walked off.

Soon thereafter, the bus boy came by to refill our water.  When I asked him if they had free refills on the chai (which is not an absurd question), he seemed surprised that I was asking him anything, and muttered that he could ask someone.  He seemed apathetic and annoyed, was dressed in street clothes, and had no accommodating atmosphere whatsoever. I wasn't expecting him to come back with an answer and he never did.

We were looking at other places to eat on our smartphones when the food arrived, 50 minutes after we sat down.  There were 2 other groups near us who also waited a similar length of time.  Both entrees were surprisingly good, served in the traditional bowls.  It was enough for a meal, but I was expecting more for the price, or at least some papadum or other accouterments.  The garlic naan was just naan and there was no oil or butter on it at all.

I asked the server about more chai (free refills?) and he said he would get us some because of the long wait.  I didn't expect him to return and he sure didn't.

You can read other Yelp reviews who had similar experiences.  I might try the buffet, but I will never come back to this place for regular service again.

After reading about some people's credit card receipts being edited, I will also be watching my next statement to make sure they didn't cheat me out of more money."}
{"text":"Two of us dining & big fans of east Indian food. Our first time here - using Groupon. The service was very good with lots of attentive employees making sure we were well taken care of. They bring a little crispy bread with 2 sauces shortly after your sit down. The mint sauce was great, the other way too sweet, esp. prior to dinner. They had some good wines by the glass. We opted for a bottle of one of our favs, 14 Hands Cab. I liked the ambiance and lighting though the Indian music got a little screechy sometimes, which is normal, I guess. Our American wait person was very personable. Another wait person was a friendly Indian man who also took care of us. We ordered with the idea of sharing. We started with a \"smashed eggplant & peas\" for appetizer (under veg meals). It was great and super spicy - we had asked for level 4 and whew, glad we didn't order higher. We then order a chicken tandoori and a curry fish of the day. I had first asked what the fish was and told Mahi mahi, which we both like. Turns out it was Tilapia which we don't care for. The texture was nice and flaky but it had that Tilapia taste - very different from Mahi Mahi. The curry was great! The chicken tandoori (called 007) was also very good. We would order it again for sure. The ambiance sort of changed when we were told the following: the owner KEEPS the tips of the waiters, or atleast that's what both waiters told us. They asked if we'd pay them cash instead of adding to our Amex. We did. Eating out is our entertainment - do it a lot. Never had we heard of this. Apparantly the Indian owner told them that's how it's done in India. Well, this isn't India. Another couple were told the same thing and also gave tips in cash. It's possible the owner just wants to skip the credit card fee on tips - who knows. Though the food was great, we didn't care for the dishonest feel of things. Not sure if we'll return."}
{"text":"I tried the lunch buffet with my family and felt the food was pretty good, and service was average. 
The positive aspects of this restaurant are the mix of south indian food and north indian food, an abundance of non-vegetarian dishes, and the lunch buffet. 
The not so postive aspects are the weird flooring I noticed when I walked in, the lack of fresh naan or idli/dosa at your table (you have to just get the idli, dosa, naan at the buffet station...this is not a standard I have seen at other indian lunch buffets), and the price is quite high for the level of options and services (the above mentioned naan/dosa issue and the extremely low variety for vegetarian dishes). If they keep up or improve the food choices, and keep working on the interior's atmosphere, customers will be happier when they walk out and more likely to return. I on the other hand will likely not return. 
The dosa and sambar were my favorite on the entire menu, along with the chicken 65 and gobi manchurian. The kerala fish curry was also delicious. 

However, some reasons I won't return for the buffet: 
1) We had to request the sambar to be warmed up separately....it was barely lukewarm. and the rasam was the same but we felt bad already having had to ask about the sambar. 
2) My standards of a buffet have already been set with fresh naan and fresh tandoori chicken being served at the table....and the prices are the same in Los Angeles restaurants. 
3) Unnecessary items on the buffet: chickpeas in spices in the salad, goat curry (noone really eats that in my opinion), and the weirdly sweet paneer makhani dish.
4) Another thing I thought was annoying was that there was dosa on the buffet, but no masala filling to put into it....maybe some simple aloo, or even a spinach dish could be used both with naan and in the dosa! 

I hope this restaurant can take these suggestions and work on improving the whole experience."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC! I had great Indian food in India, in London and in New York City -- this is on par with the best I have had, anywhere. The service was also excellent. The entire staff are working very hard to build a loyal following. I went today for the first time and I am taking an Indian friend tomorrow -- it was that good. And, save room for the desserts! This is not just my favorite Indian restaurant, it is one of my top three favorite restaurants in the Valley. Great job!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible!  We were told the two entrees we ordered were not available (20 minutes after we ordered).  Our backup orders were average at best, and not nearly spicey enough).  Only saving grace was that the server was good, but way overworked (1 waiter for the whole restaurant).  We will never go again"}
{"text":"Great food that has lots of south Indian specialities.  Crowded for a Friday lunch, we probably had to wait a good 15-20 minutes to get seated, and even then there was a line from the buffet back to the entry hall.  However, the food was quite good.  We also had Dosa ordered from the kitchen, and that was yummy.  The desserts were a bit overly sweet compared to some I've had.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Great place. The service is awesome but the guy to see is Yousef. He treats you like family. Yousef is so friendly and welcoming. He is also hilarious! There is a great family vibe and the food is DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"great. .nice food. must visit to taste real Indian food."}
{"text":"Great south Indian food with no compromise to taste... Really tasty... :) should visit once, if u r looking for a really tasty Indian food"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner and had a very bad experience. First this place is expensive compared to other good Indian restaurants in the valley. Second this is another Indian restaurant which don't have the real south Indian flavors or food varieties other than dosa's and vada, there is nothing special. Third - Bad service, we waited for almost an hour to get the food. And some of items which we ordered were not delivered. Just one person handling the entire crowd so we ended up getting wrong food items. Fourth - They don't have enough space for big groups, unfortunately we were a big group and ended up sitting in two different set of tables. Fifth and final is food, very regular food. Spicy Andhra chicken gravy was not at all spicy and it was like butter chicken and for the first time I saw a chicken 65  with full of bones guess it should be named as Bone 65 :P.  Gopi Manchurian was even worse were it was simply a fried cauliflower with ketchup coating. And please never order a Lamb biryani it was uncooked and not edible. And lot more including the chlorinated water .....

Good things - Ambiance, Lassi, Frice, Dosa"}
{"text":"I went in for the Sunday buffet. The food was left out too long and tasted poorly.  The freshly made entrees are good-however the buffet was not maintained w fresh food."}
{"text":"Really horrible food!!! Never ever go there with groupon. Watery paneer tikka masala. Usually their gravy is creamy but this was just water and tomato. Disappointed with their food service."}
{"text":"Good food, but the service was horrible. It was 95* outside today and they did not have the air conditioning on. It Took over 45 minutes to get our appetizer.
No refills on the kids sodas. We were told we would get an extra order of Naan for our long wait and it never showed. 
We won't go back. Warning - they added
Gratuity to the check, we were a family of
Five with a $60 bill and they added $10 on to the bill. Watch out or you'll overpay!"}
{"text":"South Indian food, so it's not quite what most Indian food eaters are used to, but that will change when they try this place. Ridiculously amazing buffet, it goes on and on, and the food was OUT of this WORLD! How can they make all this complex, time-intensive, spice-heavy food for so little money at their buffet?  Surely, their margins are minimal. I definitely got my money's worth and more. My new favorite place for Indian food in PHX!"}
{"text":"BTW the music played over there is in South Indian language Tamil."}
{"text":"Waiting, waiting and more waiting ... that was the theme of a visit to Karaikudi on a slow Sunday evening. Went my with wife, daughter and a Groupon - otherwise I probably wouldn't have known about this place. We always enjoy Indian food, whether it's the late Indian Grill in Mesa, Jewel of the Crown or Tandoori Times in Scottsdale, but this place left me sorely disappointed.

No one came to greet us when we walked in, so we carefully ventured further into the restaurant before a server appeared and approached us with a warm, heartfelt \"3?\" Just like they do at Denny's - only they smile too.

Started with an onion naan. Delicious. Ordered main courses: a chicken dish and mixed grill. Some 10 minutes later, my wife's dish appeared - steaming hot. No rice in sight, so we asked for some to which the gal reacted as if we had asked for french fries. And then she proceeded to start taking orders from other tables. After 3-4 minutes, I got tired of seeing her stand a few feet away, taking orders, so I went up to the bar and asked the guy there for a bowl of rice. Again, same reaction - rice??

A couple of minutes went by and then my dish came out, sizzling hot. Still no rice. We ordered a side of sauce to get some flavor. Again, waiting .... There were no more than 4 other parties in the restaurant - it was very slow. The guy came by but his English was extremely limited so no help there. Finally, probably 12 minutes after the first dish came out, the almighty rice arrived. And 5 minutes later the sauce came. Voila - luke warm main courses now ready to savor. 

The food was okay, but nothing I'll reminisce about tomorrow. My mixed grill was chicken, sausage and two burnt shrimp. My wife liked her basic chicken dish (the one w/o sauce). I'll spare you the disaster of getting the check plus a couple of boxes, but they probably went out to Fountain Hills to produce them - judging by their arrival time. Another couple nearby seemed equally frustrated with the wait staff and the 80F temperature in the room. What a disappointment - thanks to the super-incompetent staff, and what a shame for a new restaurant trying to create a clientele."}
{"text":"Good food compared to the other South Indian buffets. May be cannot compare to real Indian food (none had till now), but so far one of the best I tried.
It seems the owner was previously employed at Anand Bhawan."}
{"text":"Okay, third review...Evening meal...tried the Saag Gosh.it was excuisite...it is an unusual blend of lamb and spinach...You may be alarmed by such a combination...but do not be...I would never have thought of such a combination...but it is really great...The  manager, Kojak. Is rightly full of pride about his establishment..is quite a character...and is willing to do anything to make the dining experience enjoyable for all...Tim, is a young lad also helping to make the dining experience a happy one....I get the impression that each dish is made from scratch...the spices and food all seem so fresh...The prices are quite reasonable in view of the quality...A great bargain and opportunity for trying several dishes is the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Ha! The bad reviews on here make me question whether or not they are written by competing restaurants. 

Seriously? You write bad reviews about what is possibly THE BEST desi buffet in AZ?

Whatever. Ignore those reviews and bring your family and friends.

Disclaimer: I've traveled India and my friends' families taught me how to cook the authentic stuff.

By all means, bring anyone with an appetite-- if they can't find something they like, then ditch them.

This place might be too high class as their buffet offers EVERYTHING. Felt like Vegas compared to other lesser Indian Buffets. 

Do yourself a favor and celebrate such an awesome restaurant. Can't believe the jerks rating this place anything less than 5 stars."}
{"text":"My fiancÃ© and I love this place for Indian food.  Nothing else in town compares!  Try the Kashmiri Naan - to die for!"}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon because this restaurant was close by.  We usually go to the west side on Bell and 24th avenue where the food and service are both top-notch. Okay, we entered Karaikudi at about 6:30 and were not served our dinners until after 7. No excuse. The place wasn't that crowded.  Chicken Vindaloo and Chicken Biriyani with paratha bread.  Made a point of NO BUTTER on the Paratha.  Both dinners were ordered spicy.  The vindaloo had a nice taste but the spiciness was lacking.  The biriyani had a nice level of spiciness and the chicken was tasty without being overdone. Bad part --- Ifound the rice part a bit too salty.  Never experienced this in other restaurants.  The paratha came with enough grease to lube a car.  The waiter insisted that he said \"no butter\" and, in fact took it back to the kitchen to confirm that no butter had been used. He brought back the same sample and stuck by his claim that no butter was used. \"oil was used for the oven.  All paratha is made like that.\"  Maybe this is true of Karaikudi but certainly not at all other  indian places we have frequented.  We refused the paratha.  The waiter brought us nan as a substitute, which was fine and dry as we originally ordered.  When presented with the bill, we were told that $10 is added to the Groupon total --- as specified by the owner, not by Groupon.  We refused to pay the additional $10.  The waiter  made a phone call, probably to the owner and the bill was totaled correctly.   We paid with a credit card and below the total we wrote out this total in words so as not to be scammed with any changes. (we learned of how tip amounts were altered after reading other reviews of  Karaikudi.)  Other people who gave this place 4 and 5 stars may have had a delightful dining experience.  We did not and will not be returning. Instead, we'll drive to Mayuri Palace on Bell at 24th avenue and enjoy delicious food, prompt and courteous service and at less expensive prices."}
{"text":"Can't say I know much about Indian food, but I like this place. The staff is friendly, quiet Indian music is playing in the background, and the food is wonderful. A true wealth of flavors. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Quality Indian food but overpriced. When it takes over an hour to get your food, and you get it at the same time as the table that came in a half hour after you, you know there's a service issue. There was also a span of 25 minutes between all the entrees reaching the table. I had to flag down the server multiple times to find out where our food was and to make requests. They have a bar, but it's not stocked as they wait for their liquor license. They should lower their prices, especially with all these issues, to make it worth the trip here. 

Although the restaurant is clean, I suggest the Chicken Tikka Masala...to go."}
{"text":"Great Place. Went when it was about to close, but still very friendly staff. The Garlic Naan I was hoping would be a little more flavorful, but was still very good. The cauliflower was AMAZING! Hope you like spice! Get the Eggplant as well! Steer away from dessert... There is frozen Custard at Culver's in the same parking lot if you're looking for a sweet treat to follow!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with Rand H. and I found all the food at this Indian buffet to be a little different then most Indian buffets. The tandoori chicken was a little mushy on the outside but was very tasty. They brought naan bread that looked plain but was awesome,they brought us a dosas for the dosa fans , I think they suck. The veggy dishes were all good as was the curry goat meat.For dessert they had cream of wheat mixed with mango and other mixed fruit and it was very good. So I will give these guys a solid 4 stars and a good recommendation for anyone that loves Indian food."}
{"text":"I'd give it the rating \"most improved\" if it were an option.

We used to love this place before the new ownership moved in.  Then on a visit shortly after the new management came in, well, lets just say new didn't seem to be better... far from it.  And into the restaurant penalty box this one goes.

Move forward a year or so  to today and I really wanted something different, so I gave the buffet a try again.  

The food - the buffet food - both in quality and selection was much improved.  

But there were a few things that I thought could use some work.  First off, a greeting - a smile, a welcome.  Not a dry \"how many\" and be directed to a table.

Second off, I'd like something more than water.  However, I never had a chance to ask anyone.  Guess it is water... or water.

Finally the naan.  Can we go back to bringing fresh naan to the table versus a pile on the buffet?

I'll go again, but I'm certainly not going out of my way.  Based on the reception, I won't be missed."}
{"text":"I am Indian and have lived all over the world and appreciate excellent food when I taste it. This restaurant is truly authentic. Quality food in a nice ambiance.I would say one of  the best Indian restaurants in Scottsdale.

Warning\" Spicy - order the mild."}
{"text":"Service was non existent and they did not make me feel welcome at all here. I came during lunch because I had bought a Groupon, but they told me my Groupon does not apply to the lunch buffet (why the heck not, I do not know) so fine, I'll pay again for the lunch buffet. I have never found so many bones and hard, inedible bits in my food at any other place I've ever dined at. In one plate of food, I found 7-8 of these that I had to spit into my napkin. I told the waiter about it and he seemed totally unfazed like this happens all the time. This was NOT a pleasurable dining experience and I have since refunded my Groupon. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"We deserve good food for our hard earn we spend... As a Indian open suggestion to all don't waste your time and money here .. Food is crap . Honest suggestion ."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Great service! Price for the area is good."}
{"text":"Food was very good. A great menu. Service was slightly below average, but It is a new place and I am sure it will get better."}
{"text":"So I went there for lunch today, I think they have a new owner now.  The food was good but it can be better. The nun was good. As got desert, the rice pudding was wonderful. 
I tried this place 2 months ago, the food was much better, the new cook is not as good as the previous one."}
{"text":"Have lived in India, always hit and miss to find a good Indian Resturant in the Valley. This place is terrific, even better for its Southern Indian menu and Southern Indian chef.  Definitely five stars for a Scottsdale Indian Resturant."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service! Especially loved the chicken curry.  Planned what we would order next time before we left. Very happy to have found our go-to Indian spot!"}
{"text":"This place had some of the best Indian food for dinner that I've had in the valley.  Reasonable prices and great service too.  The Indian bread was very fresh and tasty and so was the rest of the food.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this amazing authentic Indian restaurant 5 stars only, because Yelp doesn't allow 10 stars.

I've been frequenting the restaurant on a weekly basis since the start of the year (I think I'm getting addicted to their food), and the food and the service seems to get better and better every time I go there.

A customer looks for 2 things in a restaurant - a great tasting food and an excellent customer service. This restaurant provided both of this, hands down. 

The Manager, Sam's energy and the positiveness, is exemplary. He is a natural, talks to everyone at every table and gives his honest opinion about the food and the drinks.

The food selection is amazing. 

The bottom line, I won't (and I don't anymore) go to any other Indian restaurant!"}
{"text":"Mixed review here, but generally positive. Had to ask to be seated, but after that the service was prompt and friendly. HUGE menu but were told a couple things (including a beer) were not available.  We tried eggplant which was excellent, curry fish, clay pot chicken dish and lemon rice were ok to me, my friend liked them more. GREAT mango lassi and they had a great sauvignon blanc."}
{"text":"We were so happy to find an Indian restaurant in our new neighborhood, even more so after having a great dinner there! The staff was super friendly and attentive and the chef really knows his/her business! Everything we had was fresh, flavorful and spicy (which we ordered). A great experience and we're looking forward to trying the buffet soon."}
{"text":"I was finally able to use my Groupon after they re-opened and I was very pleased. Me had the mattar paneer, malai kofta, and some potato dosa. Some of the best Indian food I've had in the valley.

Regarding the service: maybe they took a queue from the reviews on here because it was almost TOO good. Dude was kind of hovering over our table and refilling our water every 10 minutes.

In any case, I'm definitely going back soon to try their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"THE WORST PLACE WITH FOOLS RUNNING IT.......

I have been there on Wednesday for lunch, they had a buffet going on. Surprisingly there was no food in the butter and one server cam there and told that they are going to refill. we waited for 30 min and they did not fill I complained to the owner about it and though he is busy collecting the bill I thought he would also consider our complaint. but i think he is the leader of the fools and never bothered about it, we were frustrated and thought to leave and we noticed that he added gratuity to our bill. Then i corrected my opinion that he was not only a fool but also shameless person taking money for not serving. MY RECOMMENDATION IS NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE.....WORST SERVICE, WORST FOOD AND BEST IN TAKING BILLS AND TIPS."}
{"text":"I learned about this restaurant when they offered coupons on Groupon.  This was our first time there.  We go to Indian restaurants frequently.  It's located in a strip mall and is a typical Indian restaurant atmosphere.  We'd read many good review about this place and were looking forward to trying it.

There menu is extensive so there should be something for everyone; they even offer some \"Indo Chinese\" dishes.  My wife ordered Chicken Tikka that is prepared in their clay oven.  It came with a very nice, tasty salad on the plate.  The quality of their meat is very good, better than we expected.  She liked her meal.  What I believe may have been the owner, took our order.  I told him I wanted a curry or masala seafood dish (in a sauce).  They offer 7 selections that fit this bill priced from $13.99 to $14.49.  I told him I frequently order fish masala but wanted to know if he could recommend any of the others; I wanted to try something different.  He asked me if I liked salmon because they had that on special today.  He said \"leave it to me; I'll take care of you.\"  The salmon curry dish he served was very good and the salmon was excellent.

Now for the bad.  We arrived at 5:30 pm on a Saturday.  There were only two other tables occupied on the other side of the restaurant.  They immediately took us to our table but it was 10 minutes before the owner even brought a menu to our table.  We ordered drinks, asked some questions about their menu and ordered.  The drinks arrived 10 minutes later.  We sat there for 50 minutes and did not receive our meals (Red Flag #1).  We couldn't even get anyone's attention because they were all over on the other side of the restaurant and there was a divider that prevented them from even seeing us.  By this time a new person appeared on the scene and was seating new arrivals.  The place was filling up and we noticed lots of take-out orders being picked up.

Finally I caught the attention of a waiter and flagged him over to our table, telling him that we had now been waiting for over an hour to get our meal.  He became immediately angry at us and spouted off several sentences that we couldn't understand because of his Indian accent and rapid fire talk, but we did understand his last sentence, which was \"I'm just telling you how it is!\"  What it \"was\" we never understood?  We were both sitting there with our jaws dropped open and never responded.  (Red Flag #2).

We finished our meals and asked for the check.  It was much higher than we expected.  In looking it over I saw that the Salmon Special was $20, 70% higher than any of the other fish entrees from which I told the owner I wanted.  He certainly, as he told me, took care of me.  Bend over.  (Red Flag #3).

As one previous reviewer indicated, this owner is a \"Shameless Person\" obviously only interested in money.  BE CAREFUL.

Food quality was excellent but we've had better Indian food taste at other restaurants.  I have one additional coupon for this place which I expect I'll order as a take-out, since it qualifies for such and I don't want to ever experience their service again.  After that, I'll never frequent this place again.  I don't like dishonest people."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the food here because I love, love, love Indian food. However, it was OK. Nothing was over the top flavor wise and there wasn't a wide variety at the buffet. It was good, but it wasn't great. Southern Spice, The Dhaba, and Madras Ananda are over the top flavor wise! The service was good."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect since some of the reviews are... odd and difficult to understand. I really don't know what they are talking about. I went here last week for the lunch buffet. From what my co-workers have told me, Friday is usually the best day to go since they have the best dishes then. I've only been on a Friday but that's what I've heard. We got there right when they opened and there were several other tables already seated when we arrived. 

The food is served at a smaller buffet table. About 10-15 dishes with 5 or so desserts. We also ordered Dosa (LOVE DOSA) with the potatoes and naan to dip in our curry dishes. I had two types of rice, one with curry and one without that were very flavorful. And the curry cheese squares- I think they are Paneer - AMAZING!! The Tandoori chicken was excellent. They have really amazing food, and I'm a picky person!  There were several other dishes I tried which were very good. I did not have one item which I thought was bad and pretty much cleaned my plate. Oh, and the desserts... I could have eaten them as a meal! I can't believe how delicious the Gulab jamun was. It was like eating a donut hole covered in honey goodness. I'm sure it's similar but WOW. DEE-Licious!

The wait staff were excellent too. Prompt, helpful and polite. I think they were on the borderline of being too helpful. BUT my glass of water was never empty and my co-workers ice tea was the same. I can safely say I will be back again  :-)"}
{"text":"A delightful waiter...excellent mango mojitos...a most interesting appetizer...a delectable pan bread, very good entrees.  What's not to like?  Although the restaurant is in the Pima Crossings strip mall, the owner has done an excellent job with the internal decor."}
{"text":"My first time trying Karaikudi, and I found lots to like. One minor glitch, though: the host's station is in a little foyer not easily visible from the main part of the restaurant, and no one was there when we arrived, nor did anyone notice us as we stood there and waited. I finally had to flag someone down, but after that, we were seated promptly, and the service was courteous and attentive. I liked how the interior space was divided into two seating areas, so that it's quieter & feels more private. You can converse at a normal volume. The dining area was clean, warmly lit, and nicely decorated.

The menu was large but laid out with tabs to make it easy to find the section you wanted, if you were looking for something in particular. I knew I wanted to try some of the regional specialties, so I got the Kerala fish curry & the guthi vengaya, a curry of stuffed baby eggplant. My friend & I ordered both at a spice level of '4' (1-10 scale, 10 = hottest). The fish had a nice spicy kick that didn't overwhelm the other flavors of the dish, BUT, I couldn't taste any coconut milk (so I guess maybe it overwhelmed that flavor, lol). The eggplant was a little less spicy, but still DELICIOUS - I would get it again. My friend got the Murg Malai Kebab after being told they were out of Hariyali chicken. It was very tender and a little too salty, as if it had been brined too long before hitting the clay oven (the salt level moderated a bit as it cooled, though). We also got paneer kulcha and lemon rice, and I got a glass of Sauvignon blanc and, later, a mango lassi. All were really good. Between the pleasant atmosphere, good food, and the fact that there are 6-7 more things on the menu I still want to try, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First thing I have to say is excuse my spelling up front.  Me and Indian words don't go hand in hand.  Second thing is that everything that I tried here was excellent!!!Paneer Tikka, Nann, Chicken Birhiani, saffron rice, and my absolute favorite the Spicy Peppered Goat Curry!  I mean this thing was all the right types of salty, peppery, knaw on the bone, goodness that I didn't know I wanted but am now addicted too!  When I first moved here I was pretty impressed with all the great pizza offerings in the Valley, but now I'm starting to think that Indian food is actually what Phoenix should be known for.  With out a doubt, these guys are one of those doing it right!  Buffett ranges from $10-$12 which is a steal, but the setting definitely lends itself to dinner as well!"}
{"text":"Drove there last weekend. They were not open on a Saturday at 8 pm. A sign said on the door said closed due to technical and utilities problem. 

Have they shut down?"}
{"text":"We wnt for our Anniversary. We had the manager puck something special for us. He order rack of lamb which was delicious and a curry chicken. Both amazing. We will be back to try the buffet."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food. Yosuf is the most amazing. We were in India in October. This is most authentic and wonderful."}
{"text":"My new fave Indian place in my 10-mile radius!  Anyone who remembers the fried cauliflower from the long-gone Taj Mahal may be happy to know it exists at Karaikudi.  It's actually not on the menu, but when we tried to order another cauliflower dish, we were told of the \"Chef's Choice\" appetizer.  Our eyes lit up as if we had just seen freakin' Santa Claus when the dish arrived and it was fried cauliflower in a spicy chile sauce.  The paneer pakora tasted bland in comparison.

Dosa, which is nothing more than a big crepe, was new to me.  The masala dosa is a meal in itself.  Maybe it's meant to be.  I've only ordered chicken dishes from the menu, Makhani and Khorma and both were flavorful and most importantly, devoid of all non-edible, non-discernable chicken parts.  The medium spice level does seem to really be \"medium,\" but even my husband's \"hot\" lamb vindaloo was tolerable.

The only time we ordered the buffet was Mother's Day, and that was all that was offered.  It had quite a large selection including lamb chops.  Not sure how much variety is on the standard buffet, but I would like to try it sometime.

And not to be forgotten, the garlic naan was toasty and garlicky.  What else can I say?  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Place has changed owners. He raised the prices for same exact food and service. Except now they are running out of food and too many of his friends are there and you can't go and have a quick lunch anymore. It is not an enjoyable experience anymore. Really unfortunate."}
{"text":"This one-star review follows multiple chances I gave to this restaurant, starting with my initial four-star review. The level of outrage experienced by myself and people I've come here with far outweighs the few pluses they have to offer. Despite living very close by, and being Indian (including my fiancee's South Indian family), we will not return. 

On our last visit, the food was below average to put it kindly. Because they are perennially understaffed, the wait times for basic service is outlandish, and the service itself disorganized and chaotic. During one meal, all 5 adults were brought out their meals (after a hair-pulling delay) but the 7-year old child in our group didn't get hers. It took them 10 or 15 more minutes to bring hers out, last. Of course, it had gotten so late by the time we could put in our orders, wait for the plates and finally get them, that on top of the munchkin being hungry she was also falling asleep. 

To compound such atrocious service standards with food that doesn't even make the aggravation worthwhile is just not going to cut it. Mediocre food + horrible service = 1 star."}
{"text":"I had the buffet today for lunch. Overall it was a good buffet, with good variety. The staff was pretty attentive, too.

The good:
- The paneer dish, except it was basically cheese, and runny sauce. I think it was called Tikka Paneer. I love tikka masala paneer. It's my favorite, in fact. This was... OK.
- The rice dishes I had were quite good. In fact there were three, including one that was sweet.
- The desert \"crunchy thingy\" was very good. It had I think pistachios in it.

The \"uh-oh, I better run to the bathroom!\"
- (I'm not joking about that)
- The eggplant dish that I think had bell peppers in it. It tasted good. Except it was in a fiery sauce... that \"roasted\" my mouth!
- (I'm being a 'little' overly dramatic. It was seriously hot, for me. And made my nose begin to run.)
- There was also a soup I had, which - same as the eggplant dish was not labeled as spicy - which in fact was a little over the top spicy for my tastes, which I think of as \"medium spicing is good\".

I did skip altogether the one soup labeled \"spicy\".

(I did have to use the men's room again for that soup, to blow my nose again.)

Also, as a minor \"alarming moment\", I thought I locked the door to the single-person bathroom. I'm glad it was as I was almost ready to leave, although the server (perhaps owner, I don't know) walked in there. He bolted the door shut, instead of using the knob I did, which apparently was broken.

The naan also was kind of hard, and unappetizing. Although the rice dishes were so good, I didn't miss the naan.

I would have also liked a saag paneer dish, which was not on the buffet. And I think of most Indian buffets as including chai. This one did not. And I was not even asked for a drink order, or I would have bought chai.

All in all, I would return here. And probably choose it after I've eaten at the other two favorite Indian buffets on this side of town, which I love (Mayuri is #1 and Indian Paradise is #2)."}
{"text":"Being from india and have tasted many indian restaurant in and around phoenix. I would say this is my least favorite, The food that i tasted felt like its been frozen and served after days. I found  chicken/Lamb in my vegetable briyani. The service is ok. but the food is delayed and was not hot when served."}
{"text":"Best Indian food and prices reasonable. We used a Groupon.  Amazing Gobi Manchurian, had the Paneer  Butter Masala (Delish) & Baingain Bhartha.  All were equally good.  When I thought of taking a picture, I had eaten all the food.  Beer was a little pricey. I read previous reviews of the service, we had a very good experience, our servers were very prompt and courteous, food came out super fast.  We did get there at around 6:00pm on a Friday, it wasn't busy.  I will definitely come back to this place, fantastic food. Yum!!!!!"}
{"text":"Used a livingsocial deal for this place, it had a nice atmosphere and the staff seemed friendly. However the food was a little spicy for our liking (we ordered 'mild', and I normally eat spicy food, but this was over the top). Overall decent experience, nothing flashy with lots of south indian dishes."}
{"text":"Average at best.  Tikka masala tasted more like tomato soup than Indian food.  Saag is fairly good.  Food not their best product."}
{"text":"Food: I will give 6 starts If I could. Chicken Biryani on Buffet, count me in. It was just great.

Service: Well, they are striving to provide you that authentic experience I guess. I am now scared to talk to any of the waiters and waitresses there. 

We did the mistake of asking one of the waiters if we could place an order of Chicken Biryani to take out after having such a great food at the Buffet. \"Order\" being watch word. We should have stopped after getting chided by one of the waitresses, \"We don't allow to take out Buffet\"  (welp!). We pressed our luck and asked another waiter, now explaining him that we are not after more free food, but would like to place an order and will pay for it.. (hello..., more money?) We could literally see the cogs turning in his brain through his eyes...his eyes became shifty, averted our gaze.. and answers turned into monosyllables.. \"no, no order...\" sigh...

In all seriousness though, go there, eat the amazing food, shut up and be happy. That is what we do back home."}
{"text":"This place is definitely good.  We've had the dosa, dal, birhiani, garlic naan and one of the lamb currys.  They need more help on the floor.  I've been here twice and I've had to flag down a server both times to order.  Since it's a mile away, I will definitely be back..I'd like to try the buffet."}
{"text":"I am a blatantly honest critic and I am seriously unforgiving when it comes to restaurant owners trying to make a few bucks more saving on labor. 

A restaurant of this size on a Saturday Nigh should have no more than 3-5 tables per station until close to closing time, and maybe dropping a little. These guys maybe had 2 for the whole restaurant, and a busser come waitress.

Here is the plus:
Vegetarian Dishes
Consistently good Indian Food - Their taste is always pretty good for all the dishes I experienced. Its all services issues that lost them all the stars. All a result of simply not enough people servicing their guests.

The negative:
1) Warm tap water served (dude: ICE IS FREE!)
2)  No water for the toddler more than 15 minutes after requesting
3) Food order taken 15 minutes after seating
4) Appetizer came during dinner after 45 minutes
5) Food came out at different times for a 2 1/2 top

The absolutely unforgivable:
In a vegetarian restaurant, serving Chicken Tikka Masala when the guest specifically asked for Paneer Tikka Masala. 

My best advice: Go with their buffet when they have it. Currently its Lunch only. If you are Vegan, double check your order when it comes as they made this critical mistake today simply due to carelessness. If you go in the evenings than go with the expectation of poor service if you are coming in during peak times. No large parties or you guys will get your food in about a 30 minute span of each other. 

Despite serving good quality food, I cant allow lazy owners to get a good review for not staffing correctly."}
{"text":"we came here with a groupon since i had bad experience with some indian restaurants in the past, always spendet a lot of money and were not happy with it at all.
So i thought, since we love this kind of food so much...give it a shot.

The restaurant: might need a little fixture(shaky table) here and there, but all in all a friendly atmosphere. It had been nice if there had been somebody at the frontdesk to seat us, we got just noticed after i called one of the stuff from the back. 

I personaly had the feeling that our service had been a bit friendlier without the groupon. I compared this with the table aside of us. Small things like we didn't had any water while the same server filled the other one twice allready and i had to ask.. Dont get me wrong our server was still professional and friendly and made sure all of it was all right.but there was still something different.

The food. was the best i had it in a long time.  

I had a Masala Dosa.this was for us a new dish and we loved it! it was huge and big enought to share as an appetizer

I had the Malai Kofta! it looked so small in this little cup...but trust me dont get fooled by the looks...and  ohhhh was this good. i also loved the fact that he asked me how sharp i wanted it.

Hubby had the Lamb Biriyani and was pleased as usual! 

Iam happy we tried it,and we will be back."}
{"text":"If you are diverse with your palette,then come eat here.  Food is always tasty and an all you can eat buffet for approximately  $10 ... Booming deal!"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is delicious, especially the fish curry!  I was pleasantly surprised by the number of vegetarian options available.  Service can be a little slow during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Bad Food and Awful Service. Previously the food was good, but the service was OK..Now with the new Chef and maybe management both are bad."}
{"text":"Great food, one of the best authentic south indian food and buffet I had on the west coast of US. Desserts were delicious. Service was very attentive. Ambience is casual not restuarant type but the quality of food and service outweighs this. Best deal. I recommend this place if you want to experience authentic Indian food especially south Indian."}
{"text":"management changed and quality and service have deteriorated. decent ambiance."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic SOUTH Indian food.  Had a great experience here with food.  They know how to do dosas right!  Service was sub-par but to be expected in a casual Indian restaurant, I suppose.  They took 20 minutes for my tea (I think they forgot) and when I tried to cancel it, they said its coming momentarily and it still took another 10 minutes...seriously, its just tea...are you going to India and picking the tea leaves itself?!  Sheesh."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome! Yousef showed us a really nice time, recommending drinks and dinners. Providing us with a very nice dessert. Very good and \"spice\"y food. Traditional Indian and delicious. 
Thank you Karakudi Palace."}
{"text":"I had the Sunday brunch and was pleasantly surprised.  The saag paneer tasted fresh and flavorful.  The tandoori chicken was excellent,  with a nice smokiness that had me going back for seconds.  The murg makhani was chicken in a deliciously spicy red sauce which atop the rice was splendid.  The Naan was a bit cold when I went up to the buffet and a departure from the cooked to order that I've come to enjoy, hence the 4 stars. The gulab tamun was warmed in a sweet syrup and a perfect desert to end this lunch."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them a 2.5, but I feel more \"meh\" than I do \"yay,\" so I'm going to have to go with two stars.  

Strangely enough, contrary to what most negative reviews on here show, the service wasn't bad.  I went on a Sunday afternoon with my fiance because we're crazy about Indian buffets, and the service was fine -- in fact, I would say that it was pretty darn decent.  The servers took our plates out of the way quickly and brought us our naan and dosa in a very timely fashion.

What I'm really not impressed with is the food itself.  I've been to a lot of Indian restaurants, and although this place has by far the largest selection I've ever seen, I feel like the quality is just not there.  I specifically remember this one goat dish, and it tasted so old and chewy, like I was eating an old boot -- now, I've never had goat before, so maybe I just don't like goat, but regardless, I don't feel like meat should taste like old boot.

I've had much better naan before, though this was the first place I've tried dosa, and it was quite good.  The rest of the food was just not memorable.  Usually, I rave about at least something, but I had this whole meal there and I feel like the only thing out of the wide range of buffet food I would go back for is the dosa.

My fiance and I went a while back, and I feel like if I asked him about Karaikudi Palace, he wouldn't remember even coming here for lunch.  Aside from the dosa, there was just nothing special.

I don't know if I'd go back.  Probably only if I were really desperate for Indian food and couldn't go anywhere else -- it's the closest Indian restaurant to my place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is charging 9.3% sales tax ?  The local rate is 7.95%.  This, coupled with \"adjusting\" credit card receipts in their favor suggests they are very unethical.  Good food but these guy's are thieves.

When I called the owner and asked about the inflated sales tax and to advise him that his staff is inflating their tips on credit card receipts he seemed to care less."}
{"text":"Friendly attentive service, but buffet choices are nothing special. Tandoori chicken dry, as in left-out-overnight-and-then-warmed dry...

--fruit custard is refreshingly and simply cool with bits of pineapple
--naan basket is fresh and just the right mix of soft and crispy, but bland
## rice wafer with potato filling not hot, and potato mix tastes of dishwasher rinse liquid
## star anise not removed from chicken biryani. Wow that's a powerful spice when tasted in the raw! FYI, I don't want to bite into a bouquet garni either!
## dental warnings should be given on donut-hole desserts... rock hard

Good value for buffet but wishing they would try a bit harder."}
{"text":"Came back today 130pm and had the lunch buffet and it was good.  Lots if variety and food was hot.  I like ordering off the menu though as I really like what we ordered last time including the garlic naam. :-)

Staff remembered us and treated us well and they were very friendly. They made sure we had everything we needed and more.

I'm so full m uh eyeballs are ready to burst out of my head!"}
{"text":"The Good Part:
Look at the menu closely and some items will jump at you; I'm taking about the Karaikudi Chicken Curry, Eral Varuval (Shrimp) and Kerala Fish curry. Not having eaten these dishes in recent times, I was really excited to try them. But then having been let down by so many Indian restaurants in recent years, I was very skeptical when it came to deciding whether or not to try one of these dishes. I went ahead and ordered Chicken Curry and Eral Varuval anyway. The wait was not long and I was pleasantly surprised at how well both the Chicken curry and Eral Varuval tasted. Though both the dishes were toned down in their level of hotness, they still retained their authentic taste and flavor. 

The Bad Part:
I went back a couple of weeks later and ordered the chicken curry and a dosa for takeout. As I started eating the chicken curry I could clearly tell that there was something amiss about its taste. It just didn't taste like the first time. Was it a quality or a consistency issue? Going by my experience of Indian restaurants, I had a gut feeling that it was both.

I'm not going to review/comment on other items (like Chicken Tikka Masala or Masala Dosa..etc) on the menu since a lot of them can be found at almost any Indian resturant and they all seem to taste more or less the same.


Now coming to the weekday buffet, which I can tell you straight up that it is very mediocre and not attention deserving at all. The spread is limited and selection of dishes for a Friday lunch buffet was very poor. The taste was slightly off for a majority of items and the entire experience was a little disappointing. I'm just hopeful that the weekend buffet is not the same."}
{"text":"The food and staff are excellent here, they made our lunch fresh and medium/mild spicy just as we asked. We will recommend this restaurant to our friends and family, and will return here again and again.  Keep doing what you are doing and we can't thank you enough for bringing really good Indian cuisine to this part of the valley."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Indian food, and it was so delicious!! Great customer service, and the food is truly amazing. We got the chicken khorma, which I recommend. Amazing experience :)"}
{"text":"DOSA.

I would come to the lunch buffet just for this, as I feel no more than a mild affection for the usual naan but a mad passion for dosa.

The other reason to come here -- second only to dosa -- is that the chef is not yet jaded by preparing endless tubs of chicken tikka masala, so he experiments and he broadens the range of culinary styles available at buffet time. 

It's usually a safe bet to find the aforementioned chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, some variety of biryani, something vegetarian, rice pudding, gulab jamun, and carrot halwah. So the seekers of comfort food can feel secure.

You can also luck into tandoori fish, egg bhurji (what scrambled eggs dream of becoming), a Tamil coconut pudding, CORN FRITTERS, and numerous varieties of curry-type-things that are not sold in foil packets at Big Lots. Every trip, we end up doing play-by-play and color commentary as we go down the buffet line, because it is like opening presents. What will it be today? Egg biryani? The thing with the green beans? 

Positively my favorite Indian buffet, and the owner is charming."}

BEWARE if you are planning to use $50 Groupon and check before leaving that CREDIT/DEBIT CARD given back is YOURS.

We visited this place today after a very long time...food is good, rest (services) were all bad to worse. Understaffed, high wait time, biased / preferential service - though we were seated first, two other tables that were seated after us were attended to first for giving the menu and taking the order.

Though the servers could see us waiting at the entrance none came and asked anything until 10 minutes when a guy came and said he will get a table soon. Service was slow, got the starters and main course together! The worst part of the service was the issue with the Groupon that we had...
I had bought the \"$25 for $50 worth of Indian food for four or more people\" Groupon. We were four : 2 Adults + 2 Kids and finally when the check came and I gave the Groupon I was told it has to be 4 adults. A family next to our table also had the same issue. I told him that the Groupon does not say that it has to be 4 adults. We were asked to wait and after 10 mins another guy comes and says the same thing - it has to be 4 adults and he goes back saying, let me check with my owner. He came back after another 10 mins and then accepted the Groupon - it took 30 minutes just for bill payment alone....
Is it a trick to lure customers saying valid for 4 people and once its time to pay the bill to tell that it has to be 4 adults? I was surprised that he was acting confused about \"4 people\" definition because on Groupon site it says already 80 plus sold...unless we were the first to present the $50 Groupon.

One more instance of biased / preferential service: When we were having our food, a couple opposite to us were paying their bill using Groupon and the server came with his smartphone to the table to scan their Groupon. When it came to our bill payment, the same server (thin, short) wants to take my iphone to his billing counter for scanning the Groupon voucher!!
After paying the bill I got the receipt and credit card slip, but instead of my credit card, there was some other card, which I was told is their POS card! When informed he came and gave the credit card...on the way out my instinct told to check the card and to my shock I found that it was not my credit card! Went to the cash counter and I told the guy that the card is somebody else and read the name, the family already who were at the cash counter said it was their card. The server was acting funny and searching for my card and it was in his shirt pocket!

I was reading another review about inflated / modified tips! So not sure whether the guy was trying to play some tricks with giving me a POS card, then somebody's else credit card! SO BEWARE !"}
{"text":"Very nice dinner at Karaikudi place. The Karaikudi chicken which was a new dish to me was very good but does not surpass my favorite chicken makhani. The dal, chana saag and mango lassi drinks were all good, the only off dish was the cheese naan which was not stuffed with paneer but some horrible oily fluorescent greasy orange cheese like substance...avoid! Service was  very friendly."}
{"text":"Visiting my family in Arizona can be a hungry time for me, as I'm a vegetarian and they love to eat meat for every meal. I was so unbelievably relieved to find this place last Thanksgiving day and absolutely ecstatic that they were open and willing to do take out at 8pm! My Paneer Tikka Masala was phenomenal- the perfect consistency and the paneer was buttery and cooked to perfection. The nan was moist and fresh. My family remarked that they were jealous to see me eat it while they were eating microwaved turkey, and of course they were, because who could resist the aroma of fresh Tikka Masala? Anyway, when we visited again last month, my brother and I got to eat here with our dad and it was just an excellent meal from start to finish. The gobi appetizer is so good! If you like cauliflower, don't miss it. We had every course and the owner was so kind that he even gave us some samples of different deserts. We truly enjoyed chatting with him and we will be sure to visit Karakudi Palace the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on valentines day and vowed to never visit this place again ever.
I guess the reviews I read earlier (about good food long wait time and billing issues) just came true...food is OK not bad at all lemme start with this.

However the wait time is like hell 2 hours or something.(in short i reached by 7:30 pm and was out of the place by 11:00 pm)
This is what happened with us
We were two families wanted to enjoy the valentine dinner at this place.

We had to wait like 1-1.5 hour almost to get a seating. 
Rarely anyone showed up at the main gate to let people know of the procedure like...does one needs to write down the name on the wait list  or what?  people were just figuring out on their own and the curiosity turned into boredom soon.. After almost half an hour another known family(with kids) known to us joined us in that wait time.
They listed their name after us (which we figured out after almost 10 minutes and remember two families were already waiting for past 45 minutes or so) and then the wonder boy from the backyard showed up and somewhere in the closed cabin was calling out names oblivious of the fact there are many people standing outside of the best known dining and someone waiting could be present there as well.
As a result everyone rushed inside to check if its their name.(lemme also tell you close to 4 or 5 tables were already empty).
And we had to wait another 10 minutes when our name was called out and we decided since the third family is also having kids why not join them in our table and we specifically asked the guy that we two families have one group-on and this family has another group-on for them self is that okay if they join us in our table and you can bill them separately and bill two of our families separately and we were told yes that fine by the wonder boy.

Now the wait time will start more.
We ordered quickly and requested the serving person to bring some items for kids first as they are real hungry now (almost 9 pm) and we were promised yes irrespective of that fact the order came haphazardly and kids were left on their own waiting further more.

It was hell of a ride and then after one to another two hour of terrible wait we had to wait for the food again (another 1 hour)
and to our surprise after finishing up the dinner  with lot of further wait times since we ordered just one more dish.
The guy came in and told us the policy of groupon that one table can have one groupon (which is understood) however given the circumstances and you agreed that was a pure icing on cake.

I wont recommend this to families at all with kids if you have all of the time in world for this place must visit."}
{"text":"Best South Indian food around the Phoenix area. I recommend their masala and rava dosas."}
{"text":"Food was not bad but they need to improve the service which was extremely slow and  forgetful because only three waiters were running around managing a full restaurant. I doubt we will ever go there for dinner but I heard the lunch buffet is supposed to be good and we will give it a try."}
{"text":"How many ways can I say down hill? Quality, variety, cleanliness: all gone to the cheap side  we won't be returning"}
{"text":"IF YOU ARE VEGAN OR HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES, DINE W/ CAUTION!

We went @ 8pm on a Saturday evening.  It looked closed, but once we got closer we could see that they were open, and there was just an evening ambiance inside. (Very nice for a date night.) No one was at the host station when we walked in, however, we were greeted within seconds and shown to our table.  The tables were pre-set with plates. (I'm OCD & not a fan of this practice.)

Papadum (lentil crackers) arrived moments later, served w/ a tamarind sauce & green chutney. I inquired if the green chutney was vegan. The waiter had no clue what I was talking about, so I asked if it had any dairy in it, such as yogurt. He shook his head, no, and said it was made w/ mint. 

We ordered: Samosas, Spinach Pakora, Gobi 65, Mysore Masala Dosa, Aloo Paratha, Plain Naan. I advised him (again) that I am vegan and inquired if any butter was put on the dosa or the paratha. He was very confused. He began to stumble his way through an explanation, saying that they may put butter on the dosa, but he wasn't sure. I reiterated that it mustn't have ANY animal products, and I nicely, yet firmly, directed him to find out, and to make sure any butter, yogurt, or dairy, was omitted from all of my dishes. He said ok, and jotted notes on his order pad.  
Also, he noted that the Gobi 65 is $4.99 on the menu, but rings up as $6.99. I do appreciate being informed of this right away, but they should update their menus; put a sticker w/ the new price over the old price. (There were stickers, for lack of a better word, over other item edits on the menu, so this shouldn't be a difficult task.)

Gobi 65 - deep fried cauliflower covered in a red sauce (not spicy), arrived in less than 5 minutes. It was DELICIOUS & bursting with flavor!  Easily my favorite dish!
 
Samosas were HUGE!

Spinach Pakora - battered and deep fried spinach.  Generous portion. It was good. I would prefer more seasoning, but I like things heavily seasoned. 

Aloo Paratha - whole wheat bread stuffed with spiced potatoes (not spicy). It was good. I think some Earth Balance would make it better.

Plain Naan - They have a \"Butter Naan\" on their menu, so I'd assume the plain naan has no butter, but I let the non-vegans have it; I didn't try it.

Mysore Masala Dosa - rice & lentil based crepe filled with potato masala & spicy chutney.  It came out as this enormous triangular-shaped crepe, bigger than my entire head! I honestly did not know what to do with this monstrosity of a beast.  Do I roll the whole thing? Do I cut the corners and nibble inwards?  I made a big mess of it, but it was delicious, and I could taste a small kick (might be a more noticeable spice level to those who are spice-sensitive).  Large enough to share.

2 more chutneys came with the dosa. 1 was an orangish color and the other was a light green color. I recall her (someone other than the waiter was bringing out the dishes) saying that the light green sauce was coconut based.  I inquired if any of the sauces contained any yogurt or dairy, and I backed that up with, \"Are they vegan?\"  She also gave a bewildered look, shook her head and shrugged her shoulders, saying, \"I don't think so.\"  She didn't care to find out either.  I simply abandoned those sauces off to the side.

The restaurant was clean (Although my fork had caked-up food on it, which the female server did not attempt to replace once informed), the tables were nicely spaced in distance, and there was nice elegant meet rustic decor.  It was quiet and peaceful, but there were only a few other tables present and they were on the opposite side of the restaurant.  

The waiter and the lady (different from the female server) who filled our glasses with water were very nice & attentive.  Both came over several times to inquire how we liked everything. 

I called Karaikudi this morning because I had questions about the ingredients. The woman who answered asked the chef about the dosas.  She said, \"There's a lady on the phone who's vegan, you know, vegetarian...\"  HOLD UP! Vegan & vegetarian are NOT the same thing! She continued to ask about butter on the dosas, to which the chef said that he puts butter on the dosas. But I ate here last night and they made my dosas w/o butter.  She mentioned this to the chef and his response was that they can NOT be made without butter. (She also informed me that the green chutney has yogurt!)  You fed me non-vegan food; I am terribly vexed!  

Yummy food, pretty good service, but the staff's lack of knowledge regarding the meaning of vegan, the ingredients in the dishes, & last night's staff's unwillingness to assure that my requests were honored, are unacceptable! What if I was allergic?!

I'd be more than happy to reevaluate & update once the owner:
1 - educates the entire staff on the meaning of vegan, what is/ isn't and can or cannot be made vegan on the menu, and
2 - mark the menus to indicate vegan & can be made vegan dishes."}
{"text":"Good food - chicken curry and tikka sag but horrible -- I repeat HORRIBLE SERVICE! Not coming back again."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Scottsdale/Phoenix!  Just moved here from Philly and thankful to find a fabulous Indian restaurant.  You know its good when other Indian people come to dine and that's what we observed.  Food was great (ordered Chicken Tikka Masala), service was fantastic (Sam was our waiter; who also made a killer Grey Goose Gimlet!) We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"A first for me. After two beers and waiting an HOUR, we got up, left our Groupon on the table and walked out. I can't rate nonexistant service. I have truly never done that before. We're now at Oregano's:-)"}
{"text":"it was a good experience. We ordered Gobi 65 and they got the dish which was burnt, we showed it to the owner and he was unhappy and replaced that with a new gobi 65 but it tasted OK, was not that great as mentioned in the reviews before. 
Then we ordered paneer tikka masala and garlic naan. Both were really delicious and the naan was nice lightly crispy just the way we wanted it."}
{"text":"My first visit to this restaurant surprised me with friendly and warm greetings. Not only did the food tasted authentic and exquisite, the food service also deserved my praise. Even though we had 6 occupants on the table, we did not wait long for the food to be served. The staffs were really nice and polite, they were attentive to our needs and made sure to satisfy our dining experience. I highly recommend giving this restaurant a shot. We are definitely coming back to dine again. Thank you Karaikudi Palace for your wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Tasty food! We had the chicken tikka masala with garlic naan. The chicken was spiced just enough so that the taste was not masked. The naans were soft and tasty. The service was good, with two waiters coming to check on us."}
{"text":"went for lunch buffet a couple of times... they served raw chicken in tandoori!!!!....  quite scared to eat in there anymore. the service is bad. buffet items are not refilled... they keep ppl waiting for food."}
{"text":"This review if for lunch buffet. Stop in almost every week. Great food and variety. Always hot and fresh. I really like how the chef mixes up the dishes. Place is always clean and staff very friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Empty items on the buffet has turned into a regular occurrence on my last few visits and I've reached the tipping point where I'm finished giving them additional chances.  

It happens both when it is slow, and when the place is busy.  When it's slow it's as if there's so little effort put in to making sure there's dosa and naan available, and the time it takes for refills to the buffet is about as long as it takes to eat your meal.  Out of frustration I started to watch as I ate, and the staff isn't watching over the buffet and making sure things are right.  It's especially annoying because you would think that a slow day would be better for not having empty items on a buffet, but no, the slowness just turns into a sort of excuse to blow off having to monitor the buffet carefully.
  
When it is busy, sometimes the problem is much worse, and though they seem to be trying harder to replenish the empty portions it just shows they're not prepared for the lunch rush when it happens.  Then they resort to walking around and trying to serve various tables directly, but on multiple times they've done this and served newly seated tables instead of those of us who have been there awhile and been unable to get the items.  So then you're not only ticked that you've been unable to have any bread on an Indian buffet, you also get to see people who arrived 15 minutes after you be served hot fresh bread that you can't seem to obtain.  

All other Indian buffets I visit simply do not have this sort of serious, regularly occurring problem."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Indian food in all of Phoenix. I've lived here for 1.5 years and made a point of trying every Indian restaurant in the area to find the best place.  This restaurant easily takes the cake...or naan for that matter. Lunch buffet is a great deal but dinner that's where they really shine.  The service is great and Sam stands out as probably the most accommodating server I've ever had. The food is authentic and consistent.  Lamb pepper fry is amazing..Bindi Marsala to die for.  Fresh food and quality ingredients is what this place is all about.  The naan is made in house and the aromatic spices just calls your name leaving you with a taste in your mouth in a way only a true Indian restaurant could. They have live music occasionally..just be sure to make reservations cause they fill up quick."}
