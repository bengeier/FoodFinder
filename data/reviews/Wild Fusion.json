{"text":"A great little place in Brunswick for Sushi. The Chinese part of the restaurant is standard fair - but not as oily has the other local places in the area, which is a plus. The owner is nice, and the have a nice new girl working the front counter. I recommend the \"yum yum\" roll if you are looking for something new to try."}
{"text":"So good!!! Great fresh sushi and really good prices .. The hibachi is also really good .. The chinese was just ok. I also like that you can order online!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time tonight, very good. I had the hot & sour soup which can be hit or miss at most places and I really enjoyed it. Prices reasonable for the amount of food you get--will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"For take out its great. My sister loves the chicken hibachi. I got steamed and fried dumplings, they were some of the best I've had! I would definitely go back. This place is VERY reasonably priced and Yummy."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food place! Indeed the best crab Rangoon. So far my favorite \"Chinese food\" place!"}
{"text":"Dumpy little place and the lady takes your order with little enthusiasm but WOW what great sushi...been back three times in 2 weeks.  Their specialty roles are amazing.  Fusion roll ..order 2 you will thank me.  Price very reasonable."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place, so I had to try it. Outstanding! The sushi is quality. Fast service, clean place (brand new). Girl at the front counter could be friendlier,  but the gentleman that handed me my takeout was very polite! I will very likely become a regular here!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Brunswick! I order the country style bean curd and it is perfect everytime! The inside of the restaurant is a little small but cozy and clean. The employees are so nice and your food is always hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best chinese food I've ever eaten. Their sauces are so rich and tasty, not bland and disappointing like some restaurants. I won't eat Chinese food from anywhere else. Everything is always hot and delicious and I've never had a bad experience here. Owner and staff are friendly too!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from Wild Fusion for the first time this past week. By the next day, I was back again to fulfill my craving for more! I have ordered the House Lo Mein, Hot and Sour soup, Wonton soup, and egg rolls. I have been very dissatisfied with my local Chinese food restaurants for years, so I ventured a couple of cities over per referral from a friend. Their Wonton soup is delicious! The broth is a very simple, yet flavorful, chicken broth sparsely dotted with chopped green onions (no greens in this soup which is something that I enjoy in my Wonton soup) but, the Wontons are delightful! They are filled with a generous and delicately flavored portion of pork filling. Anymore, it's been hard to find any pork at all in most Wonton soups, let alone this very generous portion. I loved it! The Hot and Sour soup was exceptional! This soup was filled with an abundance of flavor and ingredients which included thick, TENDER and delicious strips of pork (not the usual thin and tough pieces of pork) and large chunks of vegetables and tofu. For my taste, it could have had slightly more heat, but for the mass appeal it was perfect! The egg roll. Was it the best I've ever had? No, but again, due to it's simplicity it was perfectly executed from the freshly chopped cabbage to the deep frying. The only filling is the cabbage and bits of pork. I would love to see a vegetable or two inside, but it isn't their style. Not a drop of grease from deep frying is present on these egg rolls. Once you get used to the delectable bite of delicious cabbage and crispy roll, I think you may agree that they are perfect as they are. Their House Lo Mein is a fantastic fusion of flavor and texture! The noodles are thick and hearty, the meats and shrimp are cooked with care to ensure their tenderness, and the fusion of flavors offer just the right amount of sweetness and seasoning. Their pricing is just as agreeable as their food."}
{"text":"I dined here for a late lunch today with one other person and we ordered the General Tso's tofu, which came with some broccoli in the same container and a separate container of steamed rice. he tofu was crunchy and delicious and the sauce on it wasn't burned or anything. Very delicious and filling!  There is only one size for this meal as it's not on the menu, I just inquired about if they would be able to make it and they obliged. We shared it and there was enough leftovers for a 3rd person.  This is a take out restaurant with some space to eat in if you would like and we chose to eat there. The woman who took our order even gave us a super cute Chinese calendar for free. All in all, great experience!"}
{"text":"We had 3 sushi rolls and they were All  very good.  1.  Fusion roll 2. Fantastic roll and 3.  Rainbow roll.  The staff was friendly.  The drinks are bottled.  Prices are reasonable.  Would visit again."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened at Wild Fusion, but it has changed. First of all I have been there on 2 occasions recently and one of the women working there has been horribly rude to customers, making everyone waiting stop and stare. Second the food has changed. It's not as fresh as it was. My hibachi chicken was very dry and bland tonight. Rick said he's wasn't great either. (He had steak and shrimp) My last visit I picked up food for 5 and it was all under whelming. The tempura dishes used to have large chunks of chicken and now it has become mostly breading like most other places. This place was a gem, don't lose that sparkle!"}
{"text":"The service is always super fast even though they are busy. The restaurant is clean and the staff is very friendly. You can watch the sushi chef make your sushi. The sushi is fresh and there stuffed with plenty of meat. Unlike a lot of places Wild Fusion uses just the right amount of rice. I would say this is one of the best sushi places I've ever eaten at. The sushi rolls are very flavorful. The rice compliments the meats in the sushi really well.  It is owned by the same people who owned King Dragon."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite local Chinese place. The food is excellent and really, really fresh. They are quick, and always get my order right. (I tend to special order a lot)     They haven't let me down yet. And on Christmas Eve they gave us free dessert!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place around!!!  I'm lucky it's right around the corner from me, sushi is always fresh and you can't beat the price.  I requested this as my Mother's Day dinner!!"}
{"text":"Danielle and i really like Wild Fusion.   my friend Jeff introduced me to it years ago, telling me it was the same people who used to run the kitchen at The Dragon. not sure that's true or not, but their Black Pepper Chicken is the same and i love it.   D and I normally order the hibachi dinners (she'll get chicken and i get chicken and shrimp). these come with salads which are really good. I'd go so far as to say the hibachi dinners are better than the ones we've had at a nearby \"Japanese\" restaurant (ahem... Samurai)  i think this place is definitely worth checking out. it's better than nearly every other takeout style Chinese restaurant i've been to."}
{"text":"Wild Fusion is the best option for Chinese/sushi/hibachi in Brunswick...hands down. That's the best part...you can get whatever you are in the mood for. My wife and I have been ordering takeout from here since they opened and have not ordered from any other Chinese restaurant in the area since. The staff is always friendly, the portions are large and flavorful, and your order is ready when they say it will be. For me there are no other options in Brunswick...it's Wild Fusion every time."}
{"text":"The sushi is pretty good, but I haven't tried anything else yet. I usually get 4 rolls and it's under $20. The price is decent. The menu looks like your typical Chinese food menu, but they also branch out and serve Hibachi and sushi. Easy dinner solution!"}
{"text":"Love the take out Hibachi, and so cheap. This is my families staple take out. Delicious. Their fried rice is really good, but if you like that black fried rice some places make (yuck), this isnt it. It's very clean. The wife normally gets the sweet and sour chicken with lo mein. She says it is some of the best she has had. So if you are thinking of take out, try this place out. Not a lot of indoor seating but still worth a visit... grab a meal and some chop sticks then maybe hit a park! Good stuff"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I have ever had food is always hot and very good will definitely tell friends about it for who has never been"}
{"text":"Ordered take out one Sunday evening and it was very tasty! The order took awhile because they were so busy, but i would definitely recommend this place for sushi and Chinese takeout!"}
{"text":"Let me start with saying I like the food. But the service stinks now.  Over the last year and a half they can't get an order out. The last time I had to wait an hour and half for my order after it was to be done. Today I ordered ahead waited an hour and when I got there they had not even started my order. Horrible!  If you have the time the food is good but don't expect it to be done when they say.  Maybe add an hour"}
{"text":"Well, the chinese part is blah.  Maybe, I made a mistake on going with safe choices.  I tried the sweet and sour pork and won ton soup.  The lunch sweet and sour pork came with vegetable fried rice and no egg roll.  The fried rice was very bland, its had spouts, peas and big pieces of onion (this at least attempted to add flavor).  The sweet and sour pork was small pieces of pork with a slightly sweet tempura batter and a very good sauce.  However, it was the only part of meal worthwhile.   The won ton soup was average.  The won tons had small chunks of unseasoned pork, the soup had broth and a couple slices of green onion.  They also have sushi and a rolls, but I did not venture there.  The place is very small and although there is a table and bar that seats two, I believe eating here is not really their idea with tbis restruant.  The place is fairly new, maybe three months.  There were three orders and mine about 12:30, so Im not sure if tuesday is bad lunch day or others have same opinion that I had. My $7 dollar lunch was not great deal either.  Lunch specials are all $5.50 and dinner specials $7.00.  Rolls started at $3.25 and roll specials went as high as $10.95."}
{"text":"Good food. Ordered general tso (spelling?) chicken and chicken chop suey. Both good. I would order from here again. The food was timely and people were polite."}
{"text":"My parents had been raving about Wild Fusion for a while and I finally got to try it on a trip home when a friend bought us a huge array of food for me to pick up one night. This restaurant is really only for take out. They have one table for 2 and 3 or 4 bar seats for sushi eaters. It's clean and bright and friendly.  They cook up everything fresh so be prepared to wait a little while for your food. We got the mango chicken, pork egg foo yung, veggie mei fung, and fried rice. I don't eat egg foo, but my dad and brother really enjoyed. I really liked the mei fung, which was crisp stir fried veggies with angel hair sized noodles in a super light seasoning. The mango chicken was a very americana dish. Deep fried white meat chicken and super sweet sticky sauce. Good, of course, but while it's my dad and mom's favorite, it was not mine. Veggie fried rice was solid.   Food to feed about 8 people was only $53!"}
{"text":"At my work we've gotten into the habit of ordering from Wild Fusion a lot and I haven't gotten tired of it yet. Great food and it's always ready fast"}
{"text":"I don't make it out to the southwest area of town often, but I'm certainly glad I did last night. The sushi at Wild fusion was fantastic and not overly priced. I was not able to sample the rest of the menu but from what I saw it looked pretty good. If you're looking for reasonably priced sushi for takeout Wild Fusion is the place to go in the southwest area of town. They have very little seating in the restaurant though so if you were looking for a restaurant experience this is not the place to go. I'll tell you though this sushi taste extremely good in your living room."}
{"text":"We happened upon Wild Fusion because we were in the area for a soccer game and needed to work dinner into the evening. The positive Yelp reviews brought us here.  Let me start by saying that this place puts other Chinese takeout spots to shame on so many levels. I'll try to name them all:  1. It is nice, bright, and super clean. 2. It has a real wooden table with real wooden chairs AND a nice little sushi bar for those who choose to eat in. Those who have attempted to \"eat in\" at your typical Chinese carryout place will know why this is mentioned. 3. Staff is friendly. 4. Non-canned vegetables are used in their dishes. 5. The chicken was much more high-quality than the norm at such places.  We shared 2 sushi rolls, a dumpling appetizer and the garlic chicken. Food was well prepared and came out fairly quickly. Everything was very good, with the sushi being a pleasant surprise.  If we're in the area, we'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"They have great food for the whole family. Every time my family gets food from there we are never dissatisfied and always receive generous portions of food when we order. A must try place! You will not be disapointed."}
{"text":"We tried this place a few weeks ago and have been back since. The food is much better than the surrounding Chinese take out joints. While nothing about this restaurant is ground breaking, the taste is pretty on point. I will say though that I'm tempted to give a lower rating because of the customer service. The woman at the front who takes the orders is never really friendly, clearly doesn't want to be there and just makes it seem like your presence annoys her. While the food is good, it's bad for business to have someone with a bad attitude running the front of your store. Also, don't bother asking to modify an order, they're very snippy and short about it, which is annoying. Also there's no room for a real dining experience, but I guess that's not really the type of business model they chose."}
{"text":"This is our second time ordering from here.   People are really nice and the food is delicious as well.   We got a sushi roll, soup, hibachi chicken and a diet dish with steamed chicken and mixed veggies. All Of it was great!   We will be back again"}
{"text":"Wild fushion was delicious. We had sesame chicken, general tsos and chicken fried rice. I was so excited to see BROWN fried rice instead of the sketchy yellow stuff other places serve. The only thing I will do next time is get the GT hot because even medium had zero heat (but great flavor!)"}
{"text":"really good bargain, great Wonton Soup[..  my only complaint is that everything is kinda sweet .. even if you ask to make it hotter.. still no so hot...IMO...  other than that, always good"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some Chinese so I brought up my buddy Yelp and nailed it.  The place is very clean and they were very fast and polite.  I went in on a Tuesday at 11:45 am and placed an order.  She told me 5-10 minutes and if it was 5 that was a lot.  I went boring with sweet and sour chicken however it was as good as s & s can be.  My meal was hot and the portions were very fair.  No egg roll though.  If you are looking for a place to sit down you may want to keep looking as it is very small inside."}
{"text":"Great little Asian food carry out place. Wish they had delivery, but willing to drive for this. Everything we have gotten from here has been fresh and good. Not a sushi fan so I have to exclude that from this review."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese restaurant in Brunswick food was fantastic portions were huge and they even have hibachi to carry out highly recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"The owners are absolutely awesome! Friendly atmosphere. It's a mix of Chinese and Japanese food.  I'm very picky about my sushi but I would have to say.. It definitely replaces my cravings."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a new Chinese food place since my old love moved to a new location and apparently left their recipes behind. By the beard of Zeus, I think I found it. Not only do they have Chinese food, but they also have Japanese and sushi as well! First off, I am in love with the online ordering with the little cart that follows you around. So convenient! Second, the food is amazing.  We ordered the crab Rangoon as a pre-appetizer...appetizer, the Volcano roll as an appetizer, plus the General Tso's chicken and cashew chicken as entrées. Yea, we may have over done it a little... The crab Rangoon was delicious! Crispy, yet creamy on the inside without the crab overpowering everything. The sushi came in this cute little carry out container with flowers on it! Adorable and tasty. It was fresh and cool despite being packed in a bag of hot food. Which is no easy feat, so hats off to Wild Fusion.  Now for the main event! Combo platters. You know them, you love them. Here, they are perfect. The General Tso's was breaded to perfection and came in wonderfully large pieces with fried rice. I hate overly breaded and fried chicken...but that's not here, oh no. The cashew chicken was a little bland, but it was still good. Not only did we order all that, but the graciously gave us some free desserts! Maybe it was because the two of us ordered for eight people and it's some kind of quantity prize. Who knows, I'll take it!   One last little pro in the ongoing list...they gave us napkins, sauces, and chop sticks. I really appreciate a Chinese restaurant providing all of those things in a takeout bag. Especially the chop sticks, which I have a love/hate relationship with. Love the idea, frustrated by the fourth piece of chicken.  I strongly recommend trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wild Fusion is our go to Chinese restaurant. We have never ordered anything there that we didn't like!"}
{"text":"I loves my Wild Fusion (I can never remember the name so I call it the Happy Asian). The Godzilla roll is enough to fill me up, I LOVE the way they do spicy tuna here.  Normally pretty quick service, however when ordering prime time you may want to give yourself a little more time to order.  Fresh food, well cooked and something for everybody. From a value perspective is pretty reasonable for sushi in Brunswick, Ohio - in our experience order with confidence the quality is great."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING!!! If I could give no stars I would. Ordered honey chicken, crab rangoon, & California cheese roll. The honey chicken is sweet & sour chicken with a different sauce, crab rangoon was inedible, & the Cali roll was dry & spongy. Literally, the one thing that was remotely decent was the vegetable fried rice. Called to complain, & had the owner flipping out on me & how I'm the only person whose ever complained (highly doubt that.) I threw it away & got McDonald's instead, which was way better, & that's coming from someone who very rarerly eats fast food."}
{"text":"Love their food! Best crab rangoon! I always get the teriyaki chicken meal with the fried rice! I can eat it for several meals and it is delicious! Love their veggies too. I have tried coconut shrimp and it was great! I just usually stick with the chicken bc it's not breaded. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Everything was really good and fresh tasting - we had sushi and Chinese. Not greasy tasting like most places and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This was absolutely the worst Chinese food I've ever tasted. The sushi was dry and had a chewy texture. The Crab Rangoon was cold, the oil in the fryer probably needs changed and it tasted horrible. The orange chicken had a thick breading on it which I have never seen before and it wasn't even appetizing. The sweet and sour chicken was just \"ok\" and I'm not sure how you can mess that up, but some how this place managed to. I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and we'll be back next weekend again.  First - it's a hard thing to pick which direction to go in. Chinese, Japanese, or Sushi. I'm a sucker for flavored chicken so to have Bourbon, Mango, Honey Chicken and Coconut Shrimp to choose from would be too hard. The hibachi choices all sounded great as well, but it was the sushi that made us try it and the reason we'll be back.   Large portions and great prices - the prices are almost too cheap, they could easily price these higher and we wouldn't hesitate to pay it. Their dinner hibachi portions even for shrimp & scallops combo is under $11 - a large specialty sushi roll is usually just about $9 or so, and the dinner combos for the chinese menu are only about $7.50.   Big fan, nice staff, and I like that you can see into the kitchen and see that it is large, clean, and well staffed. It makes you feel better about the food, especially with the reputation that some other Chinese locations notoriously have.   Only cons to this place is the parking can be pretty cramped but that is no fault of their own, and only one table (there is also a sushi bar with a couple seats) inside but just about everyone does take out so it makes sense. Keep up the great work, we'll be regulars now!"}
{"text":"While visiting family in Brunswick I had an opportunity to try the local Chinese restaurant everyone raves over.  Well, its not all that. I ordered the Hunan Chicken and Hot & Sour soup. The chicken dish was okay. Could have used a little more heat. Portion was a bit smaller than I was used to but still adequate for a single dinner. The soup however was not even close to being palatable. No heat, No sour, wrong mushrooms used, no tree ear fungus, and what's with the corn and broccoli in it ? No lily buds either. Just plain wrong all the way around. Even PF Chang can do an acceptable H&S soup. Another in our group had the salmon sushi rolls. 4 of the 5 got thrown out. Not up to the usual standards. Won't be back."}
