{"text":"Love the food but the service could use a little work. I get that you want to move people through as fast as possible when it's busy, but you don't have to stare me down. I just want to enjoy my food and not burn my mouth trying to hurry up for you."}
{"text":"Tried many times since 2009, not sure why so many people liked it. Very limited menu items, nothing really makes me wanna come back for a second time, probably not my type, but a very busy place."}
{"text":"A hidden gem with a simple but tasty menu.  Our whole family of 8 went and we had kids aging from 2 to 5 and they loved it.  The bibimbap was excellent and all the soups and appetizers were great."}
{"text":"This is one of the most authentic Korean restaurants that i have been to in North America. The food is fresh, well made and the ambiance of the place is homey, fast moving and yet sociable. Food is quickly served, waiting staff responds quick and overall the quantity of the meals is generous. Your stone pots will be super hot and so will be the food."}
{"text":"Without question the most delicious soondubu I've had anywhere. Their most spicy dish is dangerously hot, but definitely worth the oral destruction that awaits you. The location itself looks pretty shabby on the inside, but that's pretty standard fare for Asian restaurants. The rear parking can be exceptionally crowded and also looks like the kind of place where you'd be attacked by a rapist. All in all, I'd heartily recommend this restaurant to anyone that enjoys Korean/spicy food."}
{"text":"Food quality is VERY GOOD!  
Compared to other places the food was very well. BUT, the cashier comes off as very arrogant and rude. Firstly a \"TIP\" was included by default in the price of the dish. The dish that I had bought was $7.99 before tax.  Which is $9.02 after taxes. The cashier gave me a bill for $13.00. A four dollar tip was automatically added. That's fine, as the food was great and so was the service BUT the cashier demanded ADDITIONAL \"TIP\". I had no problem tipping them, but if you have already automatically added a tip on the bill before even expecting it from me, WHY IN THE HELL would i give you another 3 - 4 dollars tip! The cashier expects too much from his customers. A 50% tip on one dish is already HIGH AS....so how dare you have the audacity to ask for extra tip. He specifically demanded that extra tip three to four times. IF I had drove that day and used their parking lot, then I understand that I should help the business by paying a small tip for the using the parking, but on this occasion i had bused. TBH the experience was ruined at the point he asked for more tip. ALSO unlike other businesses, at this establishment the cashier collects all the tips. Thus there is no guarantee that the hard working students and teens in the restaurants would actually get anything."}
{"text":"Food 5/5
Atmosphere 4/5
Service 4/5

Food:
This is my definition of cheap, delicious, comfort food. I come here often. I usually get #4 dumpling soft tofu, extra spicy. It usually comes with two dumplings, which doesn't seem like a lot, but along with the side dishes and the bowl of purple rice, the whole meal really fills you up. There are five levels of spiciness. I get the hottest one, which isn't spicy enough for me, but it's still very good. 

Atmosphere:
Nothing special. Typical Korean restaurant. Clean and simple, all I need in a regular restaurant.

Service:
Staff was polite and welcoming. They are quick at taking orders, and the meals come within 10 minutes. After you are done, you just go up to the counter to pay. My whole meal including tax and tip is just $10."}
{"text":"The food is ok, I like the light taste of the tofu soup, also, it is cheap."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buk chang dong. This place is fabulous for many reasons. Having traveled quite a bit, I can't seem to find value as good as this one. The menu is simple and easy. Because of that you're served quickly with some appetizers and tea while it doesn't take long for your order to come. Quite a nice gem near Christie Pits. I crave it often."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, large serving portions and reasonable price are the highlights. 

Not fantastic on taste or creativity. I have been once before when the menu was larger and someone cared about the food beyond finding the arithmetically correct proportions of rice to vegetables and meat. 

I prefer Ka-Chi, the food actually tastes good there. And yes you still leave with a full belly.

{"text":"When the weather is hovering around the zero, I hit this place! You can't go wrong with these $8 bowls of spicy hot goodness, of beef or dumpling or just plain spicy kimchi with plenty of tofu. 
Not only do you get the soup that fills your tummy with superpowers(hell yeah), but you get a big bowl of rice and unlimited side dishes! unlimited!? yes. 

*great place to meet a friend that you haven't seen for awhile
*hell, eat solo there too, plenty of seats...but expect to wait a bit during the supper time 6-8:30pm? roughly.    waiting time is no more than 15 mins max

cheers and enjoy!

if you're 3 or more, order the sizzling bulgogi on the hot plate to share!!

when you have something that sizzles, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Toronto for soon tofu. They have two locations, one at Yonge/Finch and the other around Bloor/Christie. The tofu is so soft and silky and the soup is delicious -- not too sour, which is the problem I find with some other restaurants, and a little bit thicker consistency in my opinion. You can ask for mild, regular or extra spicy. The rice is delicious too!! And the service is always excellent, very friendly staff at both locations."}
{"text":"This is the best cheat day meal. OK I lied - this is an ideal EVERYDAY meal! 

One of the BEST meals for all under $10 with tax and tip for most dishes!

I usually get #4 - dumpling tofu soup. I usually fill up on the unlimited sides and usually asked for a 2nd round of the beans! I use my mild soup for the normal rice and save my tofu and dumplings for the soupy water stone bowl rice.

YUMMY! This is definitely a Mississauga favourite and you can find me there often!

There are three franchise locations with the other two in Toronto.

Hope this helps!

{"text":"So amazing. I recommend #4. The atmosphere is not cozy but the food is so good and so affordable. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place... it totally nails it on the taste and price! The location is very convenient- walking distance from Christie station, and the atmosphere is friendly and fun. they could do slightly better with the decor, but hey- for the price, I'm not complaining. One thing I recommend- if this is the first time you're trying genuine Korean hot pot, go with the 'mild' spice level. The hot is really hot! I tried the Kimchi Soon Tofu and was really satisfied. Good with friends and family too."}
{"text":"K I don't know which ahjumma (lady) it was but when I was paying, the fucking owner (i think) gives me the most sassiest attitude and says, \"Tip is not included, bitch\". Just kidding, she didn't say bitch but she probably did in her mind. Wow rudest lady I have ever met. And I was gonna tip!!! So sassy, and not the good sassy. Oh yeah, and my friend found a piece of the scrubby sponge in her food... gross.The food is mediocre. SOOOO many more other places that have bombdiggity soon dubu. The waiters we're uber nice though lol!!!"}
{"text":"Cant beat this place. Not as crowded as the north york location, food and service is just as great. Staff are friendly and nice. Typically visit here 2-3 times a month."}
{"text":"I came here for the second time. What I like most about this eatery is the fact that they have the simplest menu ever. It consists of 9 items all priced under $10. 

I had their dumpling soon tofu. It comes with a large bowl of tofu, 2 pieces of dumpling, a bowl of purple rice and of course the free appetizers! 

The prices are on par with the other cheap korean eateries around the area. It was approx $7.50 for what I had before tax. The service is a hit or miss. The first time I came here, I still did not have the glass of water I asked for after asking for it 3 times.The service is better if you come on a weekday when it's not so busy. 

Although the service is not the best, the food comes out very fast. My bowl of tofu was still bubbling because it was so hot. 

Heres a tip: you pay at the door. No need to ask for a bill, when you are finished with you meal, just simply walk to the cash register at the door and you are set to go."}
{"text":"For those who are trying to get an idea of what this place is like before going there - this is not a place of atmosphere. No soft mood lights, but closer to harsh fluorescent lighting. However, the food is cheap and tasty. Seems sodium-heavy, but delicious. It's also one of those places where you won't feel strange dining alone."}
{"text":"I loved the food. I had bibimbap and my husband had bulgogi. They were vry delicious. The staff were very friendly and nice. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"This place use to be a 4 for me, but is now a 3.

I haven't been here in almost a year, but my friends decided they wanted soon tofu this pass Saturday, so we headed to our favourite soon tofu place. Of course, it might not have been such a good idea to be getting steaming hot stone pot soup on one of the hottest week this summer. We arrived around 7:30pm and there was a short wait per usual, but we get a table relatively fast. The first thing I noticed was the increase in price since my last visit. All Soon Tofu choices were now $7.97, that's only a small increase in price so not too bad. Bibimbap, Bulgogi, and Broiled BBQ Beef were now $11.51, this is a pretty big increase because I remember those being in the $8-$9 range the last time I was here. I've been coming here for over 5 years now, and have seen the price slowly increase. The prices are still ok, but not as worth it as before, especially the $11.51 items. A can of pop has also increased in price to $1.50.

So the 4 of us all get the Dumpling Soon Tofu, Mild. The wait for our food was ok. 5 mins to  get the standard 4 banchans and our drinks. Another 5-10 mins to get our Soon Tofu. In the mean time, I started to notice how hot it was in there. The AC was definitely on, but you could barely feel it, especially with several pots of hot stone bowls of soup and rice on each table. By the time the sun had set, it was cooler outside than it was inside! They really need to get better AC during the summer. I noticed a lot of people had bubble tea drinks they brought in from other places, so they seem to be ok with people bringing in outside drinks. Maybe I'll have to do that the next time too to help cool me down when we crave Soon Tofu in the summer. 

The Soon Tofu is good as usual. I love that they give you purple rice. This is still one of the best places for good, cheap, and fast Soon Tofu. I use to get the other items as well, but now I think I'll stick to Soon Tofu when I'm here. Maybe I'll just stick to coming here when its cooler out as well. They have free parking in the back, but it can get very messy back there. You can enter from the back door. I'd rather park at Finch station during the weekend when its free, and just walk the 2 blocks down then deal with the messy parking back there."}
{"text":"Great portions, and the soup tastes awesome. I like being able to choose how spicy I want the soup. It's definitely the best Son Tofu in the area. However the décor is pretty sad. You have to ignore it for the great flavor of the food. The hardest part is trying to find a seat. It's always so busy!"}
{"text":"This is a staple of the Koreatown in North York and Bloor West. 

Having been here on multiple occassions, I can attest to the deliciousness of the food here. There is a simple menu showcasing their specialty in soon tofu. 

All their choices are good, I have tried with friends all of the items on the menu!

The soon tofu is served with your choice of beef, seafood, or dumplings, and comes with a bowl of purple rice in a stone bowl. The rice is later scraped out by one of the (good looking Korean male!) waiters so that you can later pour your extra soup into this bowl to flavour the rice still stuck on the side of stone bowl.

Will keep coming back again and again."}
{"text":"After reading so many great reviews about this place, i decided to try this it out for myself. 
To honestly say, coming into the restaurant, I did not know what to order. The menu was very limited but I was very unfamiliar with the food served here. The most common dish I was able to observe at most tables were the bubbling Tofu Stews served in a clay pots. With recommendations from the staff, I ended up ordering the Mild Combination Tofu Stew (beef, shrimp, mussel) which tasted fantastic! It came along with the piping hot stone pot rice which is a purplish color. To prevent burns from unknowing customers; it is served to us by the waiters. After tasting the stew I then understood why the place was called Soon Tofu... the tofus were sooo silky and they literally melted in your mouth, it was sooooo good! I really enjoyed the broth as well which I just kept pouring over my rice because they tasted amazing together! 
I also forgot to mention that once you are seated, the waiter brings out four side dishes which consist of kimchi (spicy pickled cabbage), seasoned soy beans, spicy pickled radish and bean sprouts which were very yummy. They are very nice about bringing some more if you ask them. 
I ended the night with a very full stomach along with a small wallet burn. I had thought I ate the same amout of food that would satify all of Africa but it turned out that each bowl was less than $8! For all that food they give you. That's a bargain! The service was fast, in spite of the restaurant being packed. It was money well spent!"}
{"text":"Great experience 
Highly recommended 
Authentic Korean food 
Parking can be a hassle but worth the trouble"}
{"text":"I love soon do bu and this place doesn't disappoint. The prices are very reasonable too! The interior is quit simple and the focus is on the soup and not anything else"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing customer service. Friendly staffs eager to explain their food and culture. They make us feel like home at their restaurant."}
{"text":"As the new Ka Chi location in Korea town has not opened yet & was dying for some simple Korean food last night, I recalled reading a lot of great reviews about Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu. So I decided to give the place a try. 

I really enjoyed the shrimp, mussels, beef and silky smooth tofu prepared in the spicy broth.  Cracking an egg into the boilng hot stew made it a more interactive experience and added more texture to the stew.  The waiter said that the purple rice served in a hot stone pot (which comes with the tofu stew) is healthier then white rice.  This dish is definitely best having during winter, as it kept me nice and warm after having it.

The beef bulgogi bim bim bap was also served in a hot stone pot. I love it when the rice was seared to become a bit crunchy.  At some previous places I've been to, the hot stone pot is not hot enough & does not allow the rice to get crunchy.

Four good portioned side dishes - kimchi, bean sprouts, marinated soya beans and I think the last one was spicy turnips -  were all very tasty.

The waiters were very friendly & the food came out fast.

Definitely will come back here again!"}
{"text":"Okay service, good food, cheap price!
If you're a fan of eating mini dishes of simple, but nice food, this is the place for you!
Food:
1. Very simple, less than 10 items on the menu, 7 of which are just variations of soon tofu.
2. You can pick your level of spiciness from white (not spicy at all), spicy (this isn't even spicy for me, but it is for others, if they're sensitive), and extra spicy (yeah, this IS spicy).
3. Nice boiling pot of soon tofu, purple rice and 4 side dishes if you're ordering the soon tofu options.
4. Although the food is really good, there is nothing so special. It's sort of like eating a really nice meal at home!

Price:
Including tax, about $8 a meal. This can be split into 2 for 2 people and still be enough to keep you full...so $4 a person?
Free refills on side dishes.

Service:
They're doing their job...that's all I'll say...
The place isn't as crowded as people say, but there are people coming in and out a lot, so this place's reputation is probably good.
The owner is nice; she doesn't push you to order more items if you're unsure you can finish it all.
Question: Why do they never remove the stone pot from your table after removing the rice?

If you're in Koreatown, this is probably one of the best places to go (Koreatown's REALLY small though, so please consider this fact)! Don't miss out!

On a second thought, I might have to move this up to 5 stars considering how terrible the other Korean restaurants I've tasted were....ha...."}
{"text":"Simple menu, great tasting bibimbap, aromatic and tasty purple rice. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for a long time and I'm glad I finally did! The food is delicious and the staff very friendly! Very clean, limited seating."}
{"text":"Good price/quality ratio. The seats is little crowded and you can see what other tables ordered. Only a few menu items but they are great foods. Waiter do serve but don't wants to talk with customer. Pictured menu with well desciption helps a lots."}
{"text":"The soup flavour was very tasty and not too salty. The taste of the tofu was very soft and moist and the flavours of the dishes were tasty. However, the menu lacked selection and variety. The side dishes were like other korean restaurants. Its good to give it a try for the first time."}
{"text":"This place wasn't the most delicious Korean that I've ever had, but it's very good food in large portions at a reasonable price, which makes it pretty standout. They only have about 10 things on the menu, and everything is less than $8--places that focus on doing a few things tend to do them well, and that's true here.

Everyone gets a whole bunch of sides as starters, and I got sizzling meat plate that came with rice and miso soup. The meat was nicely seasoned, fairly tender, and not overly greasy. The presentation, aside from the cheap plastic water bottle, is pretty great--you feel like you're getting a feast for the price of fast food. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"A very small menu but the staff were very nice, the food spicy and very delicious. I can't wait to go back. :)"}
{"text":"I'm a first time user of Yelp and this was my first restaurant searched on the app. The menu is small but the food is delicious. I had the beef, prawn and mussel soup and it was wonderfully hot and spicy. To cool your tongue they compliment the soup with tender purple rice and a few tasty side dishes. The staff were very friendly and the atmosphere was warm. I will certainly return."}
{"text":"I freaking love this joint. But I can never get the name right. It's always, 'Let's go to... Chang Song Dong Buk... Soon Tofu!!' Some days it becomes simply 'Soon Tofu'.

Whatever I have dubbed it in it's latest reincarnation, it's always 'Extra Spicy' for me. I'm sure we always exasperate the waiters by asking for our food, 'Korean spicy... we want it Korean spicy! =o' 

Eight things on the menu, keeping it basic. Go for the stews, they're always a pleaser- my favourite is the Kimchi. Nothing hits the spot on a rainy day like one of these red bubbling bad-boys.

Did I mention everything is under $10?"}
{"text":"I've tried the other Buk Chang Dong locations, and this is the best one hands down.  Portions are good and food tastes great - all of it!  The kimchee is the best I've had in a long time.  I'm a Korean that hasn't been able to find good Korean food and I've finally found it.  I most definitely will be frequenting this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite food is tofu soup,and they do the really good one."}
{"text":"We came last night, a Saturday on the way back from a day trip up north.  This was our second time at this location. Lots of free parking and fairly close to home. Any of the other locations we have been to in the past only had 7 menu items so we like the extras they have here.

The service was excellent, except that they assumed we would want the water in the rice pot after the rice was scooped out. We prefer the rice crispy but that was the only disappointment this trip and the reason for the 1 less star. The food was served piping hot and they did remind those of us that had soup to put the egg in right of the bat.

Each meal comes with the purple rice hot bowls that they scoop out most of the rice and put in a bowl. The rest of the rice about 1cm) is left in the bowl, presumably as it would be easier to clean after, but that's just a guess.  The pots are usually left on another table near yours so you can bring them over and enjoy their smokey goodness at your leisure.  You also get a number of sides that everyone shares in, which you can ask for extra of if you run out. The sides are kimchi, beans (they are like a firm baked bean), bean sprouts and pickled radish.  Soups also come with a raw egg which you crack open onto your soup and stir it in right away.

Today's meals:

I tried #11 today, which was a grill pan with spicy pork and onions. It was a little sweet and nicely spiced. I don't mind a little heat so might ask for another level up next time. I would definitely order this again, though a soup is always a good choice.

#2 (seafood soup) - my pre-teen liked it last time and tried it again and loved it. He went with a mild and would consider upping it to Medium heat next time.

#4 (soup with beef and dumpling) - my teenager loved that this one, mainly because of the dumplings in the soup.

#9 (grill pan with beef) this wasn't spicy at all and was on the sweet side, almost like caramelized in flavour without being caramelized. You can probably up the spice level if you like but my wife enjoyed it the way it was.

We also ordered an appetizer of dumplings. They didn't appear to have much filling and were more like a small flatter egg roll in shape but they were very flavourful and served hot and a little crispy. Yum!  You get 6 in an order. 

All together we left happy and full, only a small container of leftover rice to take home which my youngest had for breakfast this morning."}
{"text":"Once you get past the long name - ha ha this place is great! 
You can always tell that a restaurant is great by the line up at the door. And for Asian restaurants you know it's good when there are mostly Asian people inside :)

Went to the North York location for the first time tonight and it was just as good as the downtown location.

The menu is limited but the food is great and always consistent. They really only have 3 items on their menu: bulgogi, bibimbap, and tofu soups. They have about 4 or 5 different tofu soups but they are essentially the same wi slightly different ingredients. They also have 5 different levels of spiciness for their soups which range from extra spicy to mild and then below mild was 'white' - ha ha ha

love that you get to crack your own egg into your soup - that's kind of fun. also love the purple rice and the clay pots the come in...

The prices are also extremely cheap for the amount of food you get. Two people can eat for $20."}
{"text":"Soup was piping hot and was packed with a lot of seafood based flavor. Tofu was very smooth and silky. Amount of seafood and meat in #1 was less than I expected. 
I'll order this again if I want a lighter meal. If you finish all the food served (side dishes and all purple rice in the pot), it will fill you up. 
I'd come back to try other items."}
{"text":"Drove all the way here with two college friends from Chicago and it was the best sundubu we'd ever had. And we're from California(if you are not in the know, look up Koreatown in L.A.). 
. 
This place is serious for sundubu. Serious. You see, normally, when I order something \"extra spicy\", it is a joke that I laugh off casually. This place changed that, it made me believe that there are restaurants that take their heat seriously. It was so hot that I nearly wanted to cry out of pure ecstasy.And the tofu, such tofu! How sensuous an experience, it was so soft and delectable, coupled with the hotness and the rice that I spooned in to soak up all the broth...I could cry right now... Oh how I wish I could go there now to warm my inner soul with yummyness. 

 This place also confirmed my belief that Toronto is more of a metropolis than Chicago(if you disagree, you are wrong, I know, it's tough, but be real, nothing compares to Toronto's food scene in this region). 

And let's not forget the stone bowl with the crunchy rice, it was so delicious to cool my tastebuds after the sundubu. This coupled with the fact that actual Korean people ate here sealed the deal on authenticity in my book. 

The $3 beers are a plus as well. 

P.S. To Adam P., from what I see on my side bar while writing this, you only gave it 3 stars because you made a mistake. Go back  now and bow down to its awesomeness. If you've done this, good boy."}
{"text":"The place is pretty much always packed with Koreans so you know that is a good sign. The food is amazing, the price is right and the servers are all very polite and fast. What more could you ask for. Word of warning though...unless you enjoy eating extremely hot Suicide wings, just stick with regular spicyness. I usually always request extra spciy, but no need to here.

My Korean wife and I frequent this place quite often and she says this is the best soon tofu in the city.  We always get the kimchi or combination soon tofu. The stone pot bi bim bap is also pretty amazing.

Suggestion for any newbies in the area, there is customer parking in the back so you dont have to find pay parking on Yonge st."}
{"text":"The best soon tofu ever! Love their broth. The tofu is so smooth and soft! Love their special rice instead of white rice. This is the perfect food for winter! I also had bibimbab, it's average, the outstanding soon tofu makes everything seems just fine. There's only a tiny bit of meat in the bibimbab thought, if ur a meat lover probably u won't enjoy it as much. But still amazing!
This place is always packed for meal time. If u want a place to sit comfortably and chat with ur friends,  probably this is not an ideal place. 
It would be five star if they can improve their interior."}
{"text":"Best Tofu house ever. 

Always crowded and i only order No1, combinatiom combo. Very tasty. 

Service can be better but i never have any problem. 

Highly recommend to those people who would like to try new things."}

Overall: 5 of 5 stars (I come here once a week!)"}

{"text":"Clean and modern Korean restaurant with a small specialized menu. Had the bibimbap and combination tofu soup. Bibimbap didn't have any meat in it and the egg wasn't fried. The soup was flavorful and the meats were well cooked. Only came with plates of banchan and a bowl of black rice. Tasty and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Good tofu but no other dishes (such as seafood pancake)..."}

{"text":"???????????????????extra spicy kimchi???????????????????????????????????????????????????????the most delicious Korean tofu soup in Toronto??"}
{"text":"My favourite soon tofu place!
I like how they can choose the spicy level.
I don't like how some soon tofu will have a layer of spicy oil on it and this one doesn't.
I like the dumpling one.
The grill beef here is also good~"}
{"text":"The worst services I have received from Korean restaurants in my life, not because of the employees but the management of the boss. And the food were also very bad as the shrimp and meat were both very cheap quality ingredients

I will never come here again knowing there are much better choices in the same area."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is it's price. However that low price comes with the cost of pretty much everything else. The server is slow, unfriendly staff and very decent food. I have tried a fair number of Korean restaurants as it is my favourite food.   And i have to range the food quality of this place as one of the lower ones. Of course when it comes to q/q, this is one of the best. About the place itself, the decoration and atmosphere are pale and feel a little bit cheap. Overall, i recommend this place only when you want a hot meal with a great price. Otherwise, this is not the place for you to enjoy delicious Korean food.
Edit: i forgot to mention that this place can get very noisy as there are many Korean eat here. I am not being racist or anything, just statin the fact."}
{"text":"Food was hideous! The food is dry and the soup is awful! I had to call for the server to serve me tea like im not sure how many times!"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to describe the heaven that has been in my mouth everytime I come here.

Over 6 years I have been coming here to taste the smooth spicy soup base, combined with the savory bean sprouts. Washed down with a shot of sweet and bitter soju. 

So many memories, never once has the taste wavered. You need to go. Now."}
{"text":"A great place to go if you want a no-fuss, inexpensive and tasty meal (the food comes out quickly, so it's also a good bet if you are in a hurry). The bimbimbap is my favourite and I love the side dishes, especially the kimchi.  Also, the beer is cheap!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years, the crowd doesn't deter us at all. After all the food is well worth the wait. 

The menu is very simple and straightforward, there are pictures to help for those of us who can't quite guess what the items are. And very reasonable in terms of prices. You will definitely feel full and studious. 

I always go with the bibimbap and am never disappointed when the steaming hot pot comes out and I dig in. Just the right amount of veggies and meat. The rice is nice and crunchy at the bottom too. 

I also like the cold side dishes they bring us. They are very flavourful and we usually get a fairly reasonable portion of each dish. 

Over the years they have changed owners and so the quality of food has changed a little but it is still our favourite place for bibimbap."}
{"text":"I come here often with my significant other. The food is always great and never disappoints.  Servings are good sizes, food is always hot and tastes fresh. Will definitely come back. I like that the menu is small and simple. Often we go to restaurants that have a novel sized menu. Simple and delicious. 
The staff is always friendly and attentive. The interior is clean. 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Bibimbap means mixed rice. It's a bowl of steamed white rice, with sauteed vegetables, including cucumber, zucchini, mushrooms, soybean sprouts, daikon and chili pepper, accompanied by meat (though optional) and an egg on top. Oh, take me to Seoul.

Our Koreatown culinary tour guide (aka a good friend who has spent weeks in Korea) took us to this amazing locale for Sunday night dinner. 

\"What should we order?\" I inquired.

\"Anything but dog.\" she replied.

Do they even serve that in Canada?

I didn't wait to find out.

The bibimbap was good enough.

Korean people always seem to look good and now I understand why. Their food is healthful, but tasty. The starter plates were equally pleasing. Among them was Kimchi (a pickled vegetable, in this case, cabbage) We topped the evening off with a visit to P.A.T, the local Korean supermarket. 

What a fun adventure. 

 Kamsamnida (or thank you) Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu!"}
{"text":"If u r a Korean grew up eating Korean food, you'd know that this place isn't that great. 
I've had much better. It isn't bad, but I would only eat it if someone pays for me. 
The soup tastes average, toppings: poor, side dishes:average, service:not great, meh
Isn't worth the money, not even eight bucks."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a great price. Strongly recommend this place. Small menu, but what they do, they do well. If you're looking for an incredible Korean soup, this is the place to go.  I wasn't a fan of their Korean beers though - next time I'll go for domestic instead (or maybe try their soju)."}
{"text":"As someone who likes Korean food, this is showy, but doesn't taste great. Filling, cheap, and dynamic (you get the soon tofu and the purple rice in the stone pot; if you're still hungry after finishing your rice and soup, you can have some of the porridge in the stone pot) but not anything amazing in terms of flavours. They don't have a big menu, so choosing what to order is pretty easy, and you can choose the level of spiciness-don't be too careful, as their spicy isn't that spicy (in my opinion, but then again, I like Korean food). Side dishes...there are 4 and they give you really little. I personally won't be going back.

In conclusion, cheap and filling, but if you're looking for high-quality Korean food, this is not the place; you get what you pay for. Considering the price, the quality is pretty good, and portions are huge. Side dishes: variety and portions is too small.

I would say, try it; you might love the stone pot and purple rice experience. And a lot of people seem to like their soon tofu."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place almost once a month for the 4 years that I attended the high school across the street. This was my first experience with korean food, and it still stacks up with all the other korean restaurants that I tried later on. My favourite from this place will always be the bulgogi, as it was always cooked to perfection and didn't seem too greasy by my standards. A great joint if you want to enjoy an authentic korean experience at relatively inexpensive costs."}
{"text":"Delightfully tasty. I was incredibly surprised by this restaurant. It blends in with with the myriad number of other Korean restaurants in the area, and doesn't look special at first glance. 

Decided to give it a try as I was recommended by a friend. Couldn't have been happier to discover this place. Buk Chang Dong has opened my eyes to Korean food and soon tofu. Their dishes are exceptionally delicious, every bite bursting with taste. 

The food can be nice and spicy if you ask, but unlike many other restaurants, spice here mean actual flavour and not just heat they throw in to make it spicy. 

Service is awesome. Super friendly, and fast! Prices are also incredible 

I'd recommend the Bulgogi beef plate #9 and the Kimchi Soon tofu  #3 I think. I wouldn't recommend the Bibimbap, not because it's not tasty, but because the other soon tofu dishes are less mainstream and incredibly satisfying. 

Must try."}
{"text":"I've always loved Korean soup. I got the Kimchi soon one, with regular spicy-ness. It was awesome! Not too spicy to the point where I couldn't taste anything, but spicy enough for the cold weather. If you're not the spicy type you can ask for mild. Or if you're up for a culinary challenge, you can opt for the super spicy option. 

With $8 you can get four pretty well portioned side dishes (bean sprouts, kimchi, radishes) and a huge bowl of rice. They give out rice so generously. It's the perfect amount for the big bowl of soup they give you. Such a happy atmosphere there, the waiter who helped us kept smiling. All in all it was a good experience. :D"}
{"text":"When I first tried soondubu here in high school (2009?), I instantly fell in love and it became my go-to restaurant whenever I went out with friends. Around two years or so ago, all the staff changed and everything has been going downhill since then :( 

My biggest complaint is the overall cleanliness of the place. Just the thought of the aggressive flies hovering around the whole time combined with the strong soap smell in the bowls that overpower even the soondubu makes me shudder. The kimchi has gotten so bad that I actually avoid eating it and the extra spicy option is nowhere near what it used to be. The amount of meat has decreased and what little meat there is is freezer burned. 

It makes me sad, how did it get so bad so fast?"}
{"text":"Great Korean food! Brings back great memories of my time in Korea. The tofu soup is so good with plenty of vegetables and tofu. The bibimbap is great too..all with fresh veggies. We ordered the regular spicy which to me is equal to mild/medium. So if you like it HOT make sure you try the one above it. 
Service was great and prices made us smile. This place rocks! Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"BUG in soup! Horrible experience and attitude. Their health and hygiene conditions is unacceptable. We went for lunch today and just as we were finishing our kimchi soup, my friend found a black BUG floating in her bowl! Disgusted and horrified we immediately called the waiter and no apologies at all, he brought the bug to the back kitchen, then came out serving other tables. We were left at our table for 15 minutes while nobody bothered to apologize. A few kitchen staff/ manager looking guy checked out on us through a little window. Maybe because we looked young and harmless, the owner refused to apologize and told us it was red pepper. What kind of red pepper have legs and wings?? All we wanted was an apology. I'm glad I took some pictures before the waiter took the bug away. I would strongly recommend people to avoid this place. We used to eat here often, but we won't go again any more."}
{"text":"Favourite place to come for cheap and good food. I come here very often. The menu is limited. I think there are only around 10 dishes on the menu. I have tried them all and the kimchi tofu soup is definitely my favourite. Their bibimbap is also very good.

Most of the dishes are below $10 which is a very good value as you also get the side dishes.  Staff is friendly. The food come fairly fast. 

Come and try this place. You will leave full and satisfied."}
{"text":"I came here with my Korean friend for dinner on a Sunday night and I was told that this is her family's go-to restaurant. To be frank, I can't think of anything else that other reviewers on here had not mentioned. Very strong, robust flavours in the tofu soup and I like that you can pick from the spiciness scale. For less than $10, my tummy and tastebuds left with tremendous satisfaction. 

Incredible value and authentic taste. Will definitely return and highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"If you're new to Korean cuisine, I think it's a great place to start.  I've tried most things on the menu (it only takes a couple visits with friends to do it) and I've been thoroughly impressed every time. 

I have successfully ordered the combination tofu stew with just \"beef, brocolli, and mushrooms\" which sometimes the waiters aren't in the mood for. It's definitely the best of the meat and veggie soon tofu's combined ;)

Typically my partner and I wolf down the soy beans and bean sprouts in like 5 minutes and then have to struggle to flag down the busy waiters to get resupplied, but it's always worth the hassle.

The food is delicious and you can't beat that price. After a couple visits you'll probably want to grab a bag of black rice at PAT Central down the street like I did :)"}
{"text":"I walked into the place with an open mind and a hungry stomach I encourage you to do the same! While the service is nice, you will get the most help from the pictures around you in terms of understanding the menu, unless you speak Korean of course. 

The food was super tasty, and affordable. I had the barbecued beef (number 9) and a few small Korean dishes. I didn't find my dish to be spicy at all, and my meal partner's \"spicy dish\" was normally spiced as well. The rice came in a cool stone dish that kept it nice and hot. The portions were quite generous and great for sharing."}
{"text":"SOON TOFU. The soup is unbelievably good, with an unbelievably good pricetag to go with it. $8 flat after tax for the soup, rice, and 4x sidedishes (which you can get a second round of if you're so inclined, free of charge).

This place is just as good as the Christie location. Extremely flavourful soup.. spicy, meaty, tofu-y.. and a nice stone bowl of korean rice to go with it. Don't even bother going anywhere else for soondubu because I guarantee you you'll regret it if you know the potential this soup has, as demonstrated at Buk Chang Dong."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt one of the best restaurants in Toronto. I`ve eaten at my share of expensive restaurants, but nothing leaves me more satisfied than coming out of Buk Chang Dong after a big bowl of soon.

The soon is full of flavour and vigor. Each spoonful is like a gamma ray burst exploding in my mouth, saturating it with spicy broth and delectable tofu, kimchi and beef.  The rice is the perfect compliment, and there`s nothing better than a stone bowl rice.  The side dishes are of course a staple of korean cuisine, and they do not disappoint.

Bottom line- if you haven`t visited this fine establishment yet, go immediately don`t even finish reading this sentence, I mean it."}
{"text":"Worst service ever ! The women forced us to sit at a 2 ppl table (there was 3 of us) just because she wants anothee korean family to take our spot . When we see that there was another table opened for 3-4 people we asked of we can switch . She said no because we are only order two meals . We ordered a seafood tofu soup -which had no seafood taste to- and a bugogi -the beef taste so bad- . They even force us to pay and leave so we pay the full price of CAD$21 with no tips . Never going back ."}
{"text":"Restaurant was located on a busy street. If you drive you would have to walk through the mall or along the side walk. It's a cosy place inside with less than 10 tables.  It wasn't busy when I came in for lunch during a weekday, I and was immediately greeted by a friendly lady.  Most of their dishes are tofu based, served with purple rice in a hot stone bowl. The meal also come with an egg so you can mix it in the hot bowl.

Food was delicious and the spices were just right. You can't beat that on a cold winter day. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Korean dish (soft tofu) for a great price. You cannot complain about the food here.
However, it must be noted that this restaurant is really popular and busy. The last time I went, we were told the waiting time would be 20 minutes and we ended up waiting 50 minutes for a table. Once we sat down and ordered, it took another 45 minutes for the last dish to arrive."}
{"text":"I had never had soon tofu before reading about this place. All of the positive reviews made me decide to try it out. Wow, thanks for helping me discover this place Yelp!

Cheap and cheerful place with amazing food. My only warning is that I consider this more of a \"mild to cold weather\" meal as the soup really warms the bones and I don't think I could handle it on a hot summer day.   

Also, be prepared to wait in line. The fact that lots of people wait in line in the freezing winter is a testament to how good the food is."}
{"text":"I ate a bibimbap there. It wasn't the absolute best I ever had, although I am not a specialist, but it was pretty good really, and the price is right. Service was fast. A great place to eat lunch!"}
{"text":"I  usually come here and order Combo #1, #8 or #9. Great foods for good price. Student friendly budget  $"}
{"text":"My favourite Korean place. Always get the Bulgogi with a light and refreshing Hite. Tasty side dishes, and good service. I once left my hat there, and they were as cooperative as possible in making sure I could come and get it!

Get's packed easily, but I've always been lucky and haven't had to wait more than a few minutes. Some of the seating is easily cramped, so if you like wide open spaces it may not be the best choice."}
{"text":"After my umpteenth visit, I think it's time to bump up BCD to 5 stars. (Cue the trumpets and confetti tossing!)

They manage to keep the quality of ingredients high yet still maintain a low price tag of $7.08 per dish. AND you get stone-pot purple rice AND fresh sides.

So the fifth star is for integrity which counts a lot in a business where so many cut corners. Congratulations, BCD! You're my fave restaurant on the Bloor strip!"}
{"text":"This place just made it to the top of my food list!  Great korean food.  Small menu but each item is cooked perfectly.  Service is efficient and thoughtful.  Will definitely be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy tofu soup. There is no other restaurant can make soon tofu as good as this one.

I always order the medium spicy one."}
{"text":"???????????????

??????????????????????"}
{"text":"This is a great place for bibimbap. I have been here numerous times and always leave impressed with how flavourful and filling their food is. They have a very small menu (around 10 choices) that they specialize in. This place has very casual and simple decor - it has a family-run style. If you ask for water they will give you a whole jug to put at your table so you can fill it up yourself (one of my favourite things about Korean restaurants)."}
{"text":"Another one of my favourite places.  I confess that I can often be found here having lunch after a night of over imbibing.  The mandu soon tubu chigae (dumpling tofu stew) always seems to set me right again.  Lots of great side dishes, as is typical of Korean cuisine.  And to get out of there paying as little as you do has to make any budget-conscious diner happy.

I lived in Korea for several years (not Seoul, I was out in the sticks) and I can tell you that the food and the atmosphere are the real thing.  It's really like stepping into Korea for a while:  it's crowded and busy, but great.

All of the chigae (stews or soups) are great, but definitely try the dol-sot bibimbap (mixed rice in a very hot stone bowl) -- one of my favourites.

BTW when they bring you the egg, you can just crack it yourself and put it in the soup.   And when they pour water into the stone bowl containing the remainder of your rice, that's dessert.  :)"}
{"text":"Soups and sides are always fresh and delicious! The only time I was disappointed here was when I tried the dumpling soup. However, this is not their fault. Almost every place I try dumpling soup at, I have the same complaint: too bland. My favourite however is the kimchi soup! Their tea is also good. The purple rice and the stone pots where it gets filled with water is also good to eat after a flavourful meal! I really like this place! :)"}
{"text":"Consistently very very good, very helpful and informative staff too. Cannot recommend it more."}
{"text":"Hmmm... Buk Chang Dong shares the same acronym as my favourite 24 hr soon tofu chain from Los Angeles (BCD)... Coincidence or strategy? In any case, their soon tofu is presented the same way as BCD in LA with the rice served in a dol sot and then the dol sot with the leftover rice is filled with hot water to make a porridge. The soon tofu is silky smooth and the soup has just the right amount of heat in it. The \"regular\" soon tofu is already pretty spicy, so if you can't handle the heat, go with the mild. I'd prefer it if the soup had more shellfish in it to give it more flavour, but other than that, it's perfect! Their ban chan selection leaves a little bit to be desired, but the quality of their ban chan is still above the rest of the Yonge/Finch restaurants. There are a few other soon tofu wannabes TO, but in my opinion, BCD is the most authentic of the bunch."}
{"text":"Prices are very reasonable for a fast meal. There is a limited number of items on the menu, and I've tried almost everything. It's all really good. The soups come with purple rice. It's cooked in a hot stone bowl, scooped into a little bowl, and water is poured into the crisping rice in the stone pot. I eat it after like a porridge. Consistently good and fast service."}
{"text":"The Kimchi Soon Tofu (Medium Spicy) here is great!! Good side dishes too!  Love the beans. Ive introduced this place to all of my friends and none have ever complained about the soup or service. Be sure to expect about 15mins of waiting in line if you decide to come at dinner time. It's worth waiting for the soup though. The bugolgi however, isn't all that great, stick with the soup. They also have another location downtown (Korea Town: Bloor & Christie)."}
{"text":"I really like soondubu (Korean tofu soup).  This place's version is pretty solid.  I ordered it medium spicy and it was actually pretty mild (compared to what I've had before at other Korean restaurants).  Service was very good as well.  Tables are close together (like most  successful Asian restaurants in high traffic areas).  All in all, pretty good place with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"everything on the menu (9 things) is divineness.

service is quick, but that's asian food for ya!"}
{"text":"Having lived in TO for more than 10 years, sad to say i have not been to this place all this time - i feel that i have been deprived.  I went on a weekday after work during one of the coldest days this winter.  When the weather is sub zero,  its time for hot spicy soup.

So I went to Buk Chang Dong Soon as this was suggested by my ex bf's friend (and no, this was NOT a date). He said it was at the corner and with a yellow sign.  I had no trouble finding it on Bloor Street from Christie subway station as I arrived there early. 

As soon as i stepped in, i noticed the place was jammed packed.  The wait staff who are Korean looked like the owners, although they don't appear to speak much english, they worked hard to find us a seat.

The menu is fairly simple. There are only a few choices to pick from.  If you go to this place, you must order the tofu soup.  Any other choice would seem counter-intuitive.  So i ordered the beef and seafood tofu soup.  The meal comes with apetizers, an infusion of tofu/soup, and purple rice.  The soup is hot and spicy - same as the pictures posted.  My hot stone bowl came to the table bubbling with the infusion.  Inside was a succulent mixture of mussels, beef, bean sprouts, squid, clams, and a shrimp. It also comes with a small egg that you can crack into the bowl.  The meal was nothing less than delicious and fully met my expectations. You feel very full in the end but yet you still feel as though you haven't had enough.  

The meal came out to around $19 for two including tax and tip. They accept credit card (thank god). I had to swipe since i had no cash, and given this was not a date (as qualified previously).

The ambiance is casual, the place smells of delicious soup aroma, the apetizers were delicious, the service was fast, and the waitstaff/owner were friendly and courteous. 

Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Amazing and at a price you can tip big.  Service was not the best, but they stepped it up.  I love number 8 all day.  It's marinated thinly sliced beef in a sweet, smokey broth.  There are sliced carrots and other vegetables mixed too. They bring it out in a boiling stone pot and every main dish comes with Korean sides and rice.  Small menu but every item is real good.  Small strange place in mall, but always clean table and cutlery."}
{"text":"A hot spicy boiling pot of tofu soup would the best I can ask for in a cold cold winter day! This place is already so awesome and famous what else can I say!! Number 4 dumpling soon tofu is my all-time favorite. Highly recommended! The best soon tofu in town! #nomnom"}
{"text":"The food is cheap and delicious. Service is fast."}
{"text":"This is normally one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto, but after dinner there on Friday night I may have to reevaluate.  

The place was packed but our group of four was seated quickly.  But then we waited for ages to get menus, had to walk up to the counter to put in a drink order, waited for the drinks, and when they arrived they were wrong.  

When we finally we able to put in our order, we got 2 Bi Bim Baps, one Vegetable Soon Tofu and Bulgolgi Beef to share amongst us.  BBBs were disappointing compared to previous visits -- the bowl was almost all rice, with very little veggies or meat.  Vegetable Soon Tofu seemed zucchini-heavy, but maybe our fault for ordering veggie version.  The beef was great, though, and freebies were good as usual.

I guess in a packed restaurant on a busy Friday night you can't expect the best service, but that combined with overall lower quality of dishes than I'd gotten used to on previous visits made for a disappointing experience.  Still, price can't be beat.  I'll be back, for sure. but might try a few other places in Koreatown in the meantime."}
{"text":"So so tasty! It's your cute local restaurant that just feels casual and like home. You might want to try #2 and #7 ! Absolutely loved it. Great service too."}
{"text":"Great spicy hot meal on a cold day. Great deal for the money. Rather crowded when we went on a Wednesday or Thursday. Popular place!"}
{"text":"Would give no stars if it was allowed. Love tofu soup! Been to the location at koreantown since 4 years ago... And the north York location after moving nearby. Tried this location because we were nearby. DISAPPOINTING! She mixed up our order not to say, there were flies everywhere! One drowned in my cup of water, the other drowned in our tofu soup!!!!!! And there were many flying around while we were eating. Feeling extremely uncomfortable, we quickly paid the bill and left. Walking up the stairs we noticed that it was COVERED with flies. DISGUSTING! Never going to this location again. Will continue going to the Korean town and north York location."}
{"text":"Quite kind of difference from other Korean restaurants. Foods are very good except a little salty. This location needs more serving persons. the waiters that serve us literally has to run back and forth to serve customer, poor guy."}
{"text":"Well , I feel the taste is fine, nice rice,but eveything is small, I ordered seafood toufu, two dried shimp ,not fresh one, a clam shell  or so, well you can not call it sea food."}
{"text":"I'm not Korean, but I've had enough Korean food to know this is not the best ever. The menu is very limited and there is very little space in the restaurant. But I have to say, at that price point (almost all dishes are below $10) and huge portions, the food is as good as it can get. My bf had the kimchi/beef combo extra spicy and I had the seafood regular spicy.. Loved the kimchi/beef one a lot better! Was so stuffed afterwards!!

Oh I forgot to mention, service was good and despite the large crowds that were there, noise level was tolerable. Not bad, but will def try to find better Korean restaurants in TO."}
{"text":"I don't typically enjoy tofu so I may not be the best reviewer to listen to. The place was quite busy so I seem to be in the minority.

That said: I found my meal exceptionally bland and tasteless. I don't mean it wasn't spicy enough; what I mean is that the food - the meat, broth, tofu, egg, etc. - had no flavor. 

There are some pluses: low prices ($8-$9 per meal) and unlimited sides with every meal (Kimchi, radishes) that are quite tasty. If only the soup was as good as the sides."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go to, especially when its cold outside. But today was a little off. Got the dumpling soon tofu mild today but it seemed like they forgot the salt! No flavor. Then the beansprouts were super salty and the kimichi was not s flavourful as it used to be. And I felt a little rushed to leave even those there were lots of tables. Maybe the people waiting wanted our table because it was far from the door. But still they should just take what's available and not stare at us to leave. Like I said it could just be an off day. I still gave them 4 stars because of the many other times I've been here it was good. I'll see what happens next time."}
{"text":"My friend brought me to Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu for dinner. Though crowded and packed, it has a warm friendly environment with amazing service. The staff was very friendly and fast to respond. 

Despite the limited selection on their menu, the food was delicious. Like many Korean restaurants, it came with unlimited amount of appetizers (bean sprouts, kimchi, radish etc.).  My friend ordered the seafood soon tofu (extra spicy) while I had the kimchi soon tofu (regular spicy). Both came with purple stone pot rice and two eggs.  It was amazing, and now one of our regular go to places. All in all, it was completely worth it for the price of $8 for each plus tax. 

Note: They only accept credit card $10 or over."}
{"text":"If you want fast good eats, this is the place.  Though their menu selection is small -- tofu and seafood soups or a traditional grilled beef plate 'Bulgogi' -- their meals come with a selection of traditional pickled side dishes and Korean-done rice.  Their price is amazing, you can get a full meal for under $10.  They are fast and efficient.  This is not an excellent \"date\" place but good for friends and those nights you just don't want to be stuck slaving in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Pretty good, stick with the tofu, the bbq beef was a big dry. I like it but I've had better in Korean Town in New York. Having said that, I will definitely go back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"There are only 7-8 dish in the restaurant and $8 each. It is a good deal and easy to choose.

I like the Seafood Tofu soup the most. It has seafood taste and spicy enough.

I also try the stir fried beef. I found it is a bit sweet. ( Maybe the sweetness is the Korean Style ).

If you cannot have hot and spicy, dont go. I ordered no hot and spicy in the soup for my kid and it does not taste good."}
{"text":"Consistently good, fast service and cheap! I always get the number 8 or 9.  The bulgogi, or the bulgogi in broth."}
{"text":"I've now been to both branches of Soon Tofu. Both are cheap, friendly, and serve solid food.

My dining date and me were some of the only non-Koreans in the joint - I always like this. The servers were very patient and friendly with us as we probed on the 9-item menu (amateurs we are!...well more her than me...but still).

First, the kimchi and sides are solid and somewhat addictive. Several pack a serious kick, so make sure you have your water handy (we had to ask for some, leading to a few unpleasant huffing moments of spice).

This time around, I chose the bibimbap. It was a nice dish when some of the spicy sauce was mixed in; the pot crisped the rice nicely, and the veggies were fresh. My dining date had the bulgogi soup (this is what I had in Koreatown South); she found it to be too sweet, which I have recollections of as well, but I have a sweet tooth (and numerous cavities from my childhood sugar habits). A few flies circled us, likely because of the sugar.

No matter - as long as it's clean and they don't die in my food, I'm game to go back for some authentic Korean here anytime."}
{"text":"This restaurant is near the subway station, so you won't have a hard time finding it. 

I ordered the number 4 which is beef, wonton, and tofu mixed together in a stone pot. You can decide how hot (spicy) you'd like for your meal to be. I asked for mild and it was very good. They provide you with purple sticky rice and assorted side dishes to eat with your meal. I also ended up ordering hot pot Korean barbeque beef with onions and carrots. I can't complain about anything because everything was very good and the food is very flavorful.


You definitely should check this place out."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and so cheap! $10 including tax and tip will fill you right up. 

There is limited parking in the back. You can double park, you just have to let them know.

You can't sit down til your entire party is here, but it's not a big deal. It's not really a sit down and chat kind of establishment. Food comes pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Great food and very pleasant service :-). All what we tried was very tasty  and fresh. My son who loves Korean food, said it was one of the most delicious Korean food he ever had. I will come for sure again."}
{"text":"Not as good as the Toronto one. This place uses too much hot pepper paste and you can really taste it. other than that it is really good and cheap. get the combo soup if you dont know what to order"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a Korean restaurant in this area but the one at Yonge & Finch is definitely better. The waiters and kitchen there are pretty slow so expect to wait for your food."}
{"text":"Buk Chang Soon Tofu.... been going here for years, it's a guaranteed good meal.
The only downside is its far away from home but whenever I'm in the area its a place I have to consider I want a good inexpensive tasty meal."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed when I come here. Food is always delicious and I'm always leaving very satisfied. The side dishes are one of the best parts, they compliment the food so well. The service is generally very quick especially when you first walk in. Sometimes you get seated at the tables that are a bit too close to each other which isn't ideal but the food and service make up for it."}
{"text":"Best jiggae in town! I love everything they have in this restaurants from side dishes to main plates and it's pretty cheap too! Coming from Montreal all the way here, it's a must to go eat korean food! :)"}
{"text":"The place is clean. Menu is limited. Don't have a lot of choice but pretty straightforward and clear. Service is efficient and good. I ordered seafood. The rice is excellent. The bean and the bean sprout are amazing. The white hot pot is terrible with stink shrimp and oyster."}
{"text":"Consistent tofu hotpot dish all the time! Their side dishes are good as well. Perfect for a cold cloudy/rainy day :)"}
{"text":"We ordered #9 and #8, food was quite bland and we left with much of it untouched. Bulgogi soup was really sweet for my taste, and I have had much better regular bulgogi in other restaurants. Service was decent, but don't think we will be going back again."}
{"text":"Listing all the great things about this place is almost as hard as pronouncing its name. 

The food is not only great, but incredibly cheap. This is easily one of the best bang for your buck you can get in the city. The little side dishes are all delicious and the food always comes amazingly fast.

I always get the bulgogi, which is really good. Their purple rice is also a thing from heaven. The restaurant is nothing fancy looking but really who cares, the food is freaking amazing."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this restaurant. My go-to dishes are the kimchi soon tofu and the bulgogi. They are so yummy and the service is always perfect. Plus it's so cheap for the food quality you get. Whenever it's cold out, this restaurant is the first place I think of :)"}
{"text":"Have I really never reviewed BCD? I was the duke of this place for a while!

All I ever order is the chigae, usually either kimchi or dumpling because I have no interest in fighting with shrimp in my soup.

Quick points:
-- Served in traditional stone pots
-- Extremely hot! Be careful!
-- Great flavour combination, purely Korean
-- Unlimited side dishes (kimchi, sprouts, soybeans, etc.) if you ask nicely
-- Always busy, expect a wait, but the turnover is quick
-- So cheap, one of the best flavour to price ratios in the city

Love it."}
{"text":"I feel I should declare that I'm not a tofu person. Most of the time it's tasteless, and I don't care what anyone says: it's not a good substitute for meat (tastewise)! But if it's tofu from Buk Chang Dong Soon, I will gobble it up like nobody's business.

They have a variety of tofu choices, including seafood and vegetarian. But really, they all taste too similar as the soup base is the same. So when you find one 'topping' that you like, you're most likely going to just stick with it. My fave is the dumpling.

With that said, don't underestimate how good the soup base is. You get to choose how spicy you want: mild, regular or extra spicy. There's no point in getting the mild unless you really can't take the heat. Go with regular even if you are only slightly spice-tolerant; it has much more flavouring. And there's something about their purple rice dipped into the spicy soup that's just so comforting and addictive. 

Their bibimbap is also very good. They get the stone hot enough so that the rice at the bottom really crisps up nicely. 

As for the service, they are very efficient. They're quick to tend to your needs because the restaurant is always very crowded and they want faster turnovers. However, I've never felt rushed and they've never been rude to me on any of the many occasions that I've been there.

So even if you don't like tofu, give this place a try. You might find yourself liking at least one tofu dish."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  This isn't revolutionary, mind-blowing food, but I always come out feeling happy.  To summarize some of the pros and cons:

Pros: 
Cheap - for under $10 including tax, you can get stuffed like a little piggy
Delicious hot pot - an array of spice levels, lots of tastiness
Close to the subway - We're in a cold country, this is self explanatory
Small menu - this is actually kind of a good thing since it means less thinking and that means faster food in stomach thing happening.

Cons: 
Service - The place gets completely packed, so if you arrive during a busy time, you're going to have to do your best to catch the waiters zooming by, if you want a glass of water for example."}
{"text":"When it's cold outside, this is the best place for Soon Tofu.
The food and quality is exceptional. I had the bulgogi soup. Very tasty.
The rice was cooked in a korean stone pot which made the flavor exceptional.

When it's cold outside, this place will warm you up."}
{"text":"I'm Korean. The best tofu stew hands down. No other restaurant stew tastes the same. Simple menu but excellent at what they do. Always a line during busy hours. Staff are quick and efficient. A great meal for under $15"}
{"text":"I decided to make this the restaurant I try korean food for the first time due to the reviews. Unfortunately I don't get what the hype over korean food is.

I ordered the seafood soup and my boyfriend ordered the dumpling soup.

Seafood soup claimed it comes with mussels, shrimp and oysters. Mine only came with one mussel and one shrimp, beef slices, mushrooms and a heck of a lot of tofu!
3/5

Dumpling soup only came with two dumplings (which was very tasty) and the rest was tofu. 


Yes the portions are great for the price you pay ($9 per person after taxes, not including tip), but the it wasn't great for the taste. It tasted like regular broth soup with spices added to it. The side dishes were good, I just mainly ate the bean sprouts. Perhaps I'm not a korean food fan."}
{"text":"This is THE place for Korean Tofu Stew in Mississauga, hands-down I was blown away by the value and the products.

For a little while now, my buddy has been raving about this really good tofu stew place out in North York, that has a small menu selection but some of the best tofu-stew money can buy.  Turns out they had a location in Mississauga too, which makes it so much more accessible!

When we first arrived, the restaurant was about 80% full, which was a pretty good sign at 8:15PM Thursday night.  The decor is nothing to write home about - the brighter ambiance highlighted sparse wall decor, with occasional posters and a large menu placard.  It was pretty clean, and the tables were close to each other but not too close to be uncomfortable.  I really liked the chopsticks and spoons (metal, long style) neatly packed in a decorative box on each table.  Tables were clean, stain-free and sticky-free, altogether providing a nice casual place to eat.

The menu is spartan.  There was a total of maybe 10 items, with the majority tofu-stew.  The prices are great - ranging from 7.08 to just over 10.  My buddy commented that the menu items are priced so the bills come out to be even numbers, which is a great convenience!  We each ordered a soup item, and shared a plate of beef for a grand total of 40 dollars after tax.

I was told that the tofu-stew really is what the place specializes in, so I chose a dumpling soon. tofu.  I was also warned beforehand that the meat amount in the stew is minimal, so our party of 4 shared an order of beef.  The beef was sizzling hot when it came and it had a nice sweet marinate, making the beef tender and juicy.

The stews arrived bubbling hot and smelled absolutely delectable.  My glasses steamed in a matter of seconds and I had to turn away to let'm clear up so I could actually see my stew.  The bowl of stew / soup is rather small, and true to form did not contain much meat and about 2 regular sized dumplings.  I had also ordered it medium spicy, and I found it had kick but nothing to be alarmed over.  

To complete the dish, the meal came with a bowlful of the purple rice.  While the entire stew was delicious, the real highlight to me was the quality of the tofu.  The stew was really filled up with this tofu that I can only describe as silky smooth. They held their shape (instead of breaking apart when you try to pick it up), but offered absolutely no resistance when biting into them. The texture was out of this world and was really some of the finest tofu I've had.  

Altogether the price was right, and the food was tasty and delicious.  I was not entirely full from the meal, but I would say that the portions are sufficient for your average meal.  We did end up spending quite a lot of time there - a combination of slower service and taking time to enjoy the meal.  I did find that the wait-staff were slow to pay attention when we needed anything, and after the food came, they pretty much left us alone (I would have expected them to come back, ask how it was, ask if we wanted to refill our tea cups).  We did ask for water and they provided a nice plastic container of filtered water, which was a nice touch.

All in all, this was a great place to get some steamy tofu stew and I was more than satisfied!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for spicy tofu soup and they didn't disappoint. Great banchan and the rice was really yummy. Great meal for less than $10 including tip and tax."}
{"text":"I walk past this restaurant all the time but never had the desire to go in myself. I guess tofu soup just doesn't sound that appealing to me. 
A friend of mine really likes this place so I finally went in with him. 
Got the seafood tofu soup to try. There was no visible seafood - probably all dissolved in the soup. Only a few small pieces of tofu - not appealing. The soup itself was very thick & super salty. Maybe they mixed in too much chilli powder & salt. 
The only thing I enjoyed was purple rice. Their side dishes were very average. 
My friend really enjoyed his meal. Maybe salty tofu soup is just not my thing. 
There are so many Korean restaurants in the area so I won't be revisiting anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place has been very consistent each time I've gone. The food is hot and tasty. The service is quick. The prices are very reasonable. 

I don't order it but my friends always get excited about the purple rice which I'm told isn't offered in many places in Toronto.

I only wish they'd give me really spicy when I ask for it!"}
{"text":"We had the combination soon tofu and the bulgogi soup, both were very flavourful.  Portions were good for the price and you can fill up on the side dishes! Overall, one of the better Korean experiences I've had around the area.

Presentation is cool; dishes serves in traditional stone pots keeping the food hot throughout the meal.

The service was not phenomenal because the place is so busy, but this is definitely worth the price you pay!"}
{"text":"Very solid bibimbap, maybe not the best in the city but pretty darn close and great for the price. Good amount of vegetables, nicely cooked egg and crispy rice. Could have been spicier gochujang. Small menu, but the tofu dish seemed popular and looked good. Banchan was good, nothing special - kimchi and sprouts were fresh."}
{"text":"I love and eat a lot of tofu .. particularly in a soup broth and this place hits the jackpot. It has all of the flavors in it. The side dishes are pretty standard and they're pretty stingy about giving you refills but you'll be stuffed by the end of the meal. 

Also LOVE the purple rice. Knowing that I'm consuming probably a week's worth of salt intake it somehow feels healthier."}
{"text":"Spicy and satisfying are the perfect words to describe soon tofu.  I wish this stuff was more mainstream.   I think it is far superior to the pork bone soup, just on the healthy factor alone.

Excellent side dishes here: kimchi, kimchi beats, beans and bean sprouts.  All very good and seconds are inevitable.

Complete delicious sit down meal at 8 bucks taxes in.... come on, how can you go wrong!"}
{"text":"seafood and combo tofu were both delicious, hot and swimming in a gorgeously flavored broth. Sadly, I only had one mussel in my seafood tofu but it was yummy."}
{"text":"Really good Korean food! Definitely one of the best in Mississauga. Their selection is limited, but the quality is very high due to that. Side dishes, like the beansprouts, were very fresh and tasty, and the main dish itself is great and very flavourful. I love the purple rice they have. I came with two other people and our bill was around $30 including tax and tip. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"soon du bu

{"text":"Great place for soup. It has a limited menu so if you're a picky eater then move along. I, for one, love trying new things so it was fun. They give you 4 sides (you can always ask for more) and rice comes with your order. The soups are great and come with an egg to break into the soup while it's still hot. Not a fancy place but it's clean and food is good and it is very cheap. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Always my go to place for some hot soon tofu, especially on a cold day like today. I love the choices they provide with my usual being the dumpling soon tofu. The menu is small with options for the types of ingredients with the soft tofu and the spiciness level. 

Today I tried the medium spice which would usually be a big deal for me who can't handle too much spice but today's was more than doable. I have noticed that their soups aren't as spicy as other authentic Korean run restaurants so if you like it extremely spicy, I would recommend the max level. 

Dish is always served boiling hot to the table with a raw egg to cook in the soup. It also gets served with a side of purple rice cooked in a stone pot and 4 sides: bean sprouts, pickled radish, Kimchi and soy beans. They also serve the crispy rice from the stone pot diluted with water. Personally I don't eat it as I find it too bland. 

Food is cheap with a typical soon tofu stew with rice for $8.95 plus tax. For that price and the tastiness of the soup, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Well, thar she blows. I've got my new jjigae joint. Good-bye, Korea House. So long, McDs-of-the-Korean-world Yummy BBQ (located a mere 2 steps from my front door). You are not wanted any more. 

For $10 (tax and tip) you can come away having experienced jjigae bliss. The menu is limited - I sampled the vegetable option, which is swimming with broccoli, zucchini and onion. BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BROTH. Bubbling. Steaming. Frothing just as much as you're frothing at the mouth. Drop in an egg if you like. Give it a stir. Let it settle. Inhale what is about to coat your insides with delectable warmth. Giggle at the purple rice. (What? Purple is hilarious)

Anything else I've had in this city doesn't hold a candle to this jjigae. I will be back - that is a warning. And hide your kimchi, because I will eat it."}
{"text":"I tried the seafood soondubu in mild and in medium from here. Mild has almost no taste while medium is not that spicy either, although I don't drink the soup. Overall I thought the flavor was slightly bland and there are not enough side dishes. Though, the service is much better than nak won, which is another Korean restaurant down the street from this. :P"}
{"text":"Sundubu is easily my favorite Korean dish, and I've never had it better anywhere (meaning Maryland, Chicago, NYC, Cali) than at Buk Chang.  This place for me got everything right - from the rich, spicy sundubu broth down to the last small banchan side dish of pickled bean sprouts.  

What's more, I ate at this place after my buddies and I basically did an eating tour of Toronto - meaning we walked around all day eating throughout the city and by the time we had dinner at Buk Chang we'd basically had over five meals and felt like dying.  Yet somehow, the first sip of this broth totally revived my appetite.  Rock on Buk Chang."}
{"text":"I always have the Kimchi soon tofu.  The food is delicious and affordable.

The place gets busy though, especially when it's cold.    The service is usually very good."}
{"text":"I went here about an hour before closing with my close friends and it was amazing! When I suggested this place to my friends they didn't seem to be as excited because of the menus choices and tofu options, but once we ordered and ate the food they loved it; as did I! The servings were great, brought number 9 and 8 and it filled all four of us! Not to mention the pricing, the food is set at such an affordable price; totaled 31 for everything split between the four of us was like 7.75! Lastly, the service was amazing, the two male waiters that served us were so cute, sweet and kind! Because of them we said we would come back  overall, we really enjoyed eating here and the food was so well cooked and seasoned; felt very comfortable here too! I would recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"It was a hot day but we decided to go and get some hot soup.

The place wasn't too busy on Saturday noon. I hope the place to be air conditioned but it wasn't.

The water they served was lukewarm and I really wished it was ice cold on the hot day.

Compared to the one in Toronto, Kimchi and the bean sprouts were too salty but I preferred their sweet and salty soy beans.

The actual Soon Tofu that we ordered were really nice and tasty...it got a lot of kick to it.

Overall, we liked the place for their food as much as we like the one in Toronto.

I wished there was an AC, and ice cold water though and also I wish the wait staff and owners don't take a break or eat their lunch there where every one can see, it's just not professional like in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here after reading other Yelp reviews... This place did not disappoint me.

I tried the dumpling soon tofu, it was a stone pot of flavorful soup, with tofu, a couple dumplings, and some beef in it. The soup came with a bowl of rice and some pickled vegetables. Overall, a healthy and warm meal for 9 bucks.

I just don't understand why they had to use stone pots to cook rice if they serve rice in regular bowls. The server scooped rice from the stone pot, poured some water into the pot and left it on our table... I completely did not get this... Maybe it was just me though.

But anyways, it's worth trying, and I'll come back for more tofu."}
{"text":"I didn't expect that much from Korean food. 
This place is always crowded and has a long line. 
We didn't wait that long today and we got our food within a short time. 
The menu had only one page, simple to choose from, easy for indecisive person like me. I ordered #9 and my friend ordered #7. The pot was sizzling when the waiter brought it and the rice was purple. We shared metal chopsticks with the table right beside us. I am not used to metal chopsticks, because they made me feel like I don't know how to use chopsticks. The food was suprisingly good, especially the purple rice. The price wasn't high. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The servers were super nice! And honestly this is the smoothest soon tofu I've ever had. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love soon tofu. Love it. I also Love Kimchi and those little sweet soy beans.  I also love eating places that are cheap and authentic. Buk Chang has some really tasty Soon Tofu, and with only a couple of things on the menu they have a good shot at doing it right. 

I've been here before, but what prompts todays review is Toronto Life's \"weekly Lunch Pick\" http://www.torontolife.com/daily/daily-dish/weekly-lunch-pick/2010/11/01/weekly-lunch-pick-the-7-stew-at-buk-chang-dong-soon-tofu/ Just seeing that bumbling soon had me rounding up some adventurous co-workers and hopping onto the TTC headed towards Korea Town. 

If you read my reviews, you know that I like Hot tea upon being seated Check! and reusable chopsticks Check! Service is fast and friendly. Nice generous portions of kimchi and soybeans too. 

My only complaint (and its often my complaint at Asian restos) is that when I order \"extra-spicy\" here, I end up with something closer to \"white\" - regardless of how firmly I say \"EXTRA SPICY.\"  Still good, but I am barely sniffling.. grr. 

It is a great value, 2 soon tofu soup with tea and refilled side dishes came to $18.00 after tax. Soju is $10.80 a bottle, just saying. 

Bonus Points.. I thought I saw Adrienne Clarkson there, and after a quick Google search we confirmed it was her and her husband. So they get Governor General cred.

I still like House of Soon slightly better (plus they WILL make it Korean spicy), but Buk Chang is an institution and I will always come back. Kamsanida!"}
{"text":"Piping hot comfort food for under $10 (tax&tip included) and tastes the same every time you go. You crack your own egg in (it's all part of the interactive fun) and you get noorungjee from your stone bowl after (toasted rice cookie). What more can you ask for? The service is alright and I always feel a bit uncomfortable taking the stairs down to the sketchy washrooms but dang that soontofu tastes so delicious. This chain does it better than any other place. By keeping their menu short, they focus on what they do best and it obviously works because they're always busy and people like me just keep coming back for more. 

If you're not good with spicy food make sure you ask them to make it NON-SPICY, but for all you tough guys out there, they also do SUPER-SPICY. If you take the challenge, make sure you get all those red pepper flakes off your teeth before you head back out. Note: for that reason, it's probably not a good idea to get extra spicy if you're on a date or trying to impress someone at the table (trust me I've made that dreadful mistake before) =S"}
{"text":"This is one of my standbys for affordable, warm meals in the area. The sides are great, the soups are ideal, and the bibimbap is perfect. A great place to catch up with friends, knowing all eating restrictions are covered and the beer is insanely cheap."}
{"text":"Delicious cheap food. Simple options so you know they do what they do well."}
{"text":"Love this place!

Eat here once a week - great food at a great price.

I think the service is quite good, although others complain about not being able to understand the servers. Never been a problem for me!!!

Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Korean restaurants in the area. I love their number 7 (Bibimbab) and 9 (Bulgogi)!"}
{"text":"Living outside of the city now, I miss this place. From 2002-2004 I lived near Bloor/Christie area and this was my go to spot. I'd order takeout 2-3 times a week and was never disappointed. Hot, thick, spicy, stew with tender pork and tofu throughout. It would always fill me up for a reasonable price. Healthy(ish) option as well!"}
{"text":"Came here because it's the only Korean restaurant that has sufficient reviews. The menu is very simple which is actually a good thing. They specialize in soon dubu. The food was good but didn't really stand out. What stood out was the price, every item is under $8. 8 bucks... REALLY?!?!?? I never realized how overpriced Korean food was in Boston. Anyway, you should definitely give this place a try when you are in town."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by my Korean colleagues. I have a pretty high standard when it comes to Korean food as I have had really good Korean food growing up thanks to friends and colleagues. 

This place did not disappoint. Their menu is smaller than most Korean places on Yonge st. However, this only means that they are able to perfect what they have. Their Tofu soup is excellent. I had the Kimchi Soon Tofu which had lots of Kimchi and silky tofu in it. You can order the soup with different level of spiciness and I had the normal. The soup had lots of flavour and goes really well with the rice.

My wife had the Bibimbop which is pretty good too, but the tofu soup is much better as I love the flavour. Highly recommended and will definitely go again. They lost 1 star for the space. The place is small and sitting by 2 we basically shared a table with the people next to us."}
{"text":"I don't like this place that much, maybe a 2 star.
But my gf would def give this place a 5 star.
She's obsessed with this place b/c she likes tofu. We've tried tofu dishes elsewhere too, but no apparently this place is the best.

SO:
if you like tofu, go here.
if not, forget it."}
{"text":"Phenomenal.  I love the soon tofu soup here - extra spicy of course (just stick with it and you'll get used to it eventually) with an egg.  Super flavorful - i would never use the word bland to describe it - might be too spicy for some. This location is the original and i find that there is a drop off in quality at the periphery locations.  There can be crowds but i find turnover to be fast, service prompt, and the wait (if there is one) worth every minute.  Consistently great - nothing better on those cold winter nights."}
{"text":"only one word: incredible

after eating here I don't think i'll be able to eat soondubu at any other place without thinking of this place and wishing I was here. the fact that they have a short menu is actually amazing, because the chefs can focus on the main dishes more. also I love how they have other choices for people who don't like seafood, usually most Korean places only have seafood for soondubu dishes. 

overall, EAT HERE. !!!!"}
{"text":"Seafood bibimbap yummy.  Lot of bean curd some seafood.  Soup very tasty.  Menu has only 8 or 9 items.   After 9pm still a lot of people eating."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is so highly rated. I went to give it a try. I didn't order soon tofu as I wasn't in the mood for soup.

Food:  Bulgogi BBQ plate - beef was over cooked and many pieces were burnt. I can't even comment on the flavor, as all I tasted was burnt. The portion size was below average. Cheap thin slices of beef were used compared to other Korean restaurants.

Customer Service - They were quicker to serve and take orders than many other Korean restaurants. I give credits for that. However, points deduction for the fact they charge extra money if you ask for spicy sauce. Hello? Spiciness is common for Korean food, and customers get charged for it? I wasn't expecting a bottle of sauce, just a spoonful of it. Very disappointed.

Environment - Clean. Good air circulation and ventilation for a hot humid day. Comfortable. Although I didn't use their parking lot, parking space is available at the back. It isn't so typical to have parking space available to yonge street.


Overall, I don't recommend and will not go back. Go somewhere else on the street. There are plenty of options around."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

For what they do specialize in, the Tofu, they do this well. Order anything else and you're on your own. ie. Bibimbop was poor.

Akin to the downtown location, it has an orangy interior, mirrors on the walls to give an illusion of larger space,  burn marks on the table surfaces,  tea never voluntary filled. The seating is tight unless you get a separate table.

There's free parking in the back, if you're lucky to find a spot."}
{"text":"Love this place. A bit crowded when eating in and often have to wait for a table but food is delicious and fresh. Take out is just as good.  A very cheap and cheerful experience all around."}
{"text":"If only other chains could combine price with consistent quality as well as Buk Chang Dong does!

I'm a huge sucker for their Bibimbap though I do enjoy their Soon Tofu dishes. Love the stone bowl and stirring like a mad man to work that egg into the rice. =D

Gotta get their act together for their spiciness scale though as I find that they have tamed their chili level down to moderate (the horror!) for a korean restaurant.

Love getting tons of their Banchan especially the kimchi and the sticky soy beans!

Only thing I hate about this location is the lack of space, it fills up quickly and I have had to turn back twice when I came by with my gf. Took my business to Lim Ga Ne (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/lim-ga-ne-toronto-2#hrid:nurTkLFCKBEI4_6aNM_HPQ)."}
{"text":"Similar food offerings to the other location though the kimchi is less fermented. 
Very friendly staff.

They have a special going on for the gamjatang, Definitely a big hit for the majority of people coming in though I do prefer the bimbibap. 

Would recommend if you're looking for your korean food fix in chinatown."}
{"text":"So after a hiatus of eating out, I decided to give this place a try.  It came highly recommended by a friend who recently ate at this restaurant.   

There are only 9 choices to choose from the menu.  I like that.  Too many choices can often cloud one's mind.   So, after over hearing some dudes in the corner table saying that # 2 and #9 are really good, I opted for #9 the Broiled Beef + Dolsotbab, my friend #2 the Seafood Soon Tofu (Oyster, Shrimp,Mussel) 

After receiving some dishes, I attempted to ask my server what these wonderful looking dishes were, but he stepped out to look for his personality.  Aside from the kimchi, I wasn't sure what everything else was.   

Our main dishes rolled out steaming and sizzling!  The smell was amazing.   The soup was flavorful and savory.  The beef was sizzling with flavour along with some sweet onions that added much crunch to the tenderness of the beef.  

It would of been nice to know the egg that came with the side dishes was raw and that it was an option to put in the soup as opposed to me thinking it was hard boiled...oops.  

Just when I thought my server found his personality, I realized he was there to seat some other customers.  No matter.   The egg situation was self correcting.   

If you are coming here for the first time...I'm going to recommend to listen to what repeat customers are ordering and perhaps ask them about menu items.  Otherwise, this place is pretty decent. 

Dinner for two $18.50.   
Personality not included."}
{"text":"I always walked by this place and see it full with line ups sometimes extending to outside. I went in one day and waited 30min to get a seat for two. The food was quick and almost all items on the menu were under $10, which quickly filled me up. If your into Korean soups/stews this is the place to be, especially on a cold winter day. One of the best Korean restaurants I've been to but you'll have to wait a bit for seating during peak hours which is well worth it."}
{"text":"Only been once but their soon tofu has captured my heart. One of my favourite seafood soon tofu places. Super yummy! Although I prefer the side dishes from Tofu Village this place serves some great ones as well. I find the place a little squished but it's not horrible.

Came with a group of six in the evening and we didn't have to wait long to be seating, can definitely hold a large group. Staff is friendly and the outside and inside of the place look pretty good. Inexpensive and yummy, will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Goodness, I still feel guilty, I couldn't finish all that Soon Tofu...
I got the Kimchi Soon Tofu (which came BUBBLING HOT with forbidden rice and tons of veggie fixings), and shared some of the JapChae (I hope I remembered that name right) Noodles and these DELICIOUS ricecakes in sauce that I can't for the life of my recall the name of.

But, those ricecakes were amazing. I'm definitely coming back, if only for that.
the noodles and tofu were excellent as well, but served super hot (hope you have time to let it cool lest you scald yourself) and when you have the option of how spicy you want it, do NOT be arrogant like me and assume you can take the spiciest possible level. Not even my daily sriracha-guzzling prepared me for the spice in the tofu!

The staff were great- they even overheard me mentioning that I didn't want meat and asked if they should remove the fishcakes that were in the ricecake dish. I thought that was really considerate!

I hope to come back and not overestimate how much heat I can handle next time!"}
{"text":"Cheap, tasty and cozy.  For 10 bucks you can get a really filling meal including their special tofu soup, rice and their appetizers.  Overall a pretty nice place, only problem is with their small menu.  It only has like 10 items on it."}
{"text":"They keep the menu nice and simple. 

I really want to order both bibimbap and their soup together (that's how you should eat the both dishes in my KOREAN opinion...haha) However I'm overwhelmed by each dish portions and bulkness of the serving dishes... 

They should definitely make a combo menu!!"}
{"text":"When you travel to Seoul, Korea, and find yourself missing a Korean restaurant back in Toronto, you know it has something special. This is my favourite place to get soon tofu thus far, with very good reason. 

In terms of decor and general ambience, the restaurant doesn't provide you with anything particularly noteworthy. However, the staff are kind, the service is great, and the food is really what you're there for anyway. Right off the bat, remember to park in the back! I spent a solid chunk of my total visits paying for street parking, but there is room behind the restaurant. It's a tad inconvenient, but you must walk around to the front. 

Now, let's get down to the food. The menu is limited but, as the name suggests, they're famous for their soon tofu. You can select from a variety of different types - dumpling, kimchi (my personal favourite), seafood, vegetable, etc. You may then select the level of spiciness. I'd avoid getting the \"white\" (no spice) option, because it seriously detracts from the soup's flavour. They provide you with several Korean side dishes to begin, and a small egg that you can crack into your soup later on. Upon delivery, your soup is in a clay pot, accompanied with a purple grain rice - one of my favourite aspects of the meal. The server will scoop the rice from a clay pot into a bowl, then fill the bowl with water, forming some sort of rice snack that people enjoy eating later. The texture of the tofu is to die for, and the soup is generally bursting with flavour.

From a price and value perspective, this place is great. Including tips and tax, the entire meal totals around $10 per person."}
{"text":"I went today with my daughter the location was easy to find and the staff was very friendly.  The food was great we got 2 #3 combos if you like spicy I would recommend ordering regular spicy or higher. The only thing that I wasn't happy about is that they don't serve alcohol beverages when I searched the pictures before going it showed a menu with beer and soju but not the case anymore. Overall It was great."}
{"text":"Good value Korean food.  Small menu, limited options, but fast service, good tasting food which is decently priced.  This place is almost always jam-packed with people, out the front door.  If you're looking to eat at peak hours, be prepared to wait anywhere between 15-30 minutes. Cash or debit only.  Overall, not bad for a quick meal, or a really cheap date option."}
{"text":"the pork bone soup is some of the best in the city, a wise choice!"}
{"text":"Very good Seafood Tofu dish!
Delicious and very inexpensive.
Recommend."}
{"text":"This is my first time having Korean, therefore I can't compare this to other Korean restaurant. I had the combination soon tofu, while my girlfriend had the Bulgogi Soup (beef), and we were impressed! I'm glad that you can choose how spicy your food can be, since I love spicy food while my girlfriend hates it. We will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"An above average Korean tofu joint. Portion sizes are smaller than some other similar places and their level of spiciness leaves something to be desired. 

The best part I think is the stone bowl rice. The tofu was silky, as it should be, and the broth was flavourful. I recommend this place to anyone who might be in the area. Overall 3.5/5 I think."}
{"text":"Yum! Delicious Korean food at a great price. Every item comes with a generous amount of purple rice and a bunch of tasty Korean side dishes.  Service is fast and efficient and the restaurant is clean. For the more spice-sensitive (and for spice enthusiasts, for that matter), they let you specify how spicy you want your dish.

Top notch! A must try in the area."}
{"text":"My favourite tofu soup place! Good portion and good price, service was fast too. Side dishes are a bonus!"}
{"text":"I was hoping this place would satisfy my craving but it was EXTREMELY SALTY!  Had the dumpling soon tofu and my hubby had the seafood one.  We both love BCD tofu house in NYC and was hoping this place would be similar but not a chance."}
{"text":"Ordered the seafood soon tofu and it was extremely underwhelming. 4 pieces of seafood in a bed of tofu. Maybe it's just me but I'm not sure how special one soon tofu is compared to another. But the scarce seafood really killed the point of the dish."}
{"text":"lots of people. may need waiting in peak hour. My Korean friend and i have lunch there. he said the food is good and authentic. But the waiters there cannot explain the menu clearly."}
{"text":"What I crave on a cold winter day. Hot, spicy, flavorful tofu soup under $10. Can't get that anywhere else, and I haven't had tofu soup as good anywhere else. 
Their side dishes are delicious. Just a plus to this great place!"}
{"text":"Tucked away along a corridor towards the corner, I almost missed this place. Once I went in, a delicious smell of pork bone soup greeted me. Overall, I would come back when I'm in the mood for some soup and dumplings comfort food. 

Food:
Came with lots of side dishes and refills we're  available. Ordered the dumpling soup and the portion was decent with yummy good quality sized dumplings. I liked that it came with purple rice. Seemed healthier and good texture.

Service:
Good service. Part of our group was late and the waiters were very patient and did not rush us to order and leave. Seating was a bit uncomfortable but overall atmosphere was okay"}
{"text":"I love this place. Fast,fresh and addictive.  Small,unassuming place that is keeping a delicious secret. The purple rice and the bulgogi  beef soup are my favourite. Sweet, tender morsels of yumminess with slippery glass noodles...I am getting so hungry! Plus free Korean appetizers as well! Amazing value, all dishes in the $10-12 range."}
{"text":"They have a simple menu with about 10 items. Friendly servers and good food. They have fermented soy beans as a side which was new to me but tasted great."}
{"text":"Massive plate of delicious bulgogi with a side of tasty kimchee for $10 including tax? Perfect."}
{"text":"These guys know how to make their bibimbap. The purple rice in stone pot looks exotic but is nothing fantastic"}
{"text":"I got the seafood stewed tofu. It was just me at one table, but they still served a lot of side dishes. The seafood stewed tofu itself was great! The side dishes were okay, I've had better, but the portion sizes and variety were amazing especially considering it was just me.

Service when I went (it wasn't crowded) was pretty fast, only thing is that there were too many servers I think so some were standing around (not being obtrusive or anything, more like looking for things to do?).

Overall everything was around $10, can't beat the value at that price!

(Sorry for bad picture quality & angle haha but you get an idea of portion sizes)"}

Extra information:
*Specialize in Spicy Tofu Soup
*3 locations in Toronto
*Vegetarian option Avail

This was my 2nd time visiting Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu, the first time was 2 days after I arrived in Toronto and I don't even really remember anything from the visit. 

I was actually really looking forward to this restaurant because there is one in New Jersey (US) with the exact same name and that location is just awesome. First of all, this location is nothing like the one I've been to in the States. It's much smaller and they basically have 3 things on their menu, varying from Spicy tofu soup, BiBimBab and BBQ Meat. I was disappointed with the choices but I guess everything is bigger in the States so I shouldn't complain.

We were served 4 side dishes which consisted of KimChi, Bean Sprouts, Spicy radish and Brown beans. All of the side dishes were decent (decent using my standards for Korean restaurants in Canada), no complaint there.

Ordered: #1 COMBINATION SPICY TOFU SOUP 5/5
*Spicy Tofu Soup with beef, shrimp, mussels and Hot Stone Pot Rice for $7.53
*Comes boiling hot in the black stone pot 
*They will scoop up the rice from the Hot Stone pot for you in a bowl, and then pour hot water in to Stone pot which will make a type of congee you can enjoy after your meal
*You can control the spiciness (White, Mild, Medium, Regular Spicy and Extra Spicy), I got it Regular Spicy
*Regular Spicy is not spicy at all and I don't really enjoy spicy food to begin with
*When the Tofu soup comes, add in the egg and wait a bit (depending on how you like your eggs cooked)
*It came with a shrimp that was smaller than my pinky and two mussels
*You eat this more for the soup than the ingredients in the soup anyways
*Soup has good flavor and it's really good with the rice

Ordered: #9 BBQ BEEF AND HOT STONE POT RICE 3/5
*Bulgogi beef on sizzling hot plate served with Hot Stone Pot Rice for $8.85
*When they first bring this to the table, it's so hot that the sauce will be popping everywhere so be careful
*It's basically BulGoGi (sweet soy sauce marinade) served on hot plate
*Stir fried with carrots and onions
*Beef isn't the best quality and it's kind of overcooked but the marinade makes up for it
*Marinade is a little too sweet but it's ok

Summary: Again, not the best Korean food (which I don't expect anyways) but their food is pretty consistent and you can always depend on them for good spicy tofu soup. But keep in mind that there is nothing else to eat here unless you want the spicy tofu soup. If you want more options, go to other Korean restaurants along the street."}
{"text":"This place makes me drool sometimes....my friend took me here two years ago and I am so glad they showed me this place.

Food: I always order the seafood soon tofu and broiled bbq beef. You can choose the level of spicy-ness that you want. The food comes in bubbling or sizzling depending on the dish. The sides are yummy to munch on and compliments the main dishes. I always find the food to be consistent here. Their menu is limited but it just shows that they specialize well.

Purple/black rice love~~

Atmosphere & Service: Fast and efficient. They are understanding when we ask for an extra bowl of purple rice.

Pricing: Always the same and I would say is reasonable."}
{"text":"Fast, delicious and cheap. I wish there were more sides though. One of my favourite places eat."}
{"text":"Love this place I had nu#9 What a healthy meal and very filling best for the bang."}
{"text":"Outstanding.

THE FOOD
I had the squid and pork. The chili paste was just thick enough to coat all side of each morsel.

THE SERVICE
Very friendly and super courteous.

THE ATMOSPHERE
Smallish, cheerfully appointed. Bathroom could use a makeover."}
{"text":"I feel like the only person in Toronto who's not in love with this place. Here's why. I got the Seafood Soon Tofu, mild. Meat-wise, that amounted to 1 oyster, 1 mussel, and 2 shrimp with the heads still on, which after removal, amounted to barely any meat. It's not my preference to see the eyes of what I'm eating, but I get this place is no frills.

The Soon has tons and tons of tofu. I guess I'm not a tofu conneisseur because I got sick of it pretty quickly - and I love tofu. In spite of that, the side dishes and the purple rice are excellent. Towards the end I tried my boyfriend's kimchi Soon which was Medium and man it was a million times better. If you want flavour and can handle a bit of spice, do NOT get anything less than medium.

Lastly, the place is usually full, with tables almost touching. We went around 9pm on a Friday. You can hear everyone else. That's fine if the people on either side of you aren't irritating, but it's hell if they are.

I plan to come back and try some of the more expensive dishes, but I'm looking forward to checking out Tofu Village nearby first."}
{"text":"Solid meal! Full disclosure: I ordered bibimbap and had major food envy- should have got a boiling soup! Alas, a sweet spot for a quick and cheap Korean food. 

As soon as you order, condiments and little dishes start flying out to your table. The kimchi had a nice kick, without being too spicy. The bibimbap in its hot stone bowl was majorly filling and fresh. So many veggies on top, that cooked as the meal progressed. But the egg on top- it's like they cook multiple eggs on the same sheet pan and then cut them away from each other, leaving weird straight but slanted lines around each yolk. 

The soup on the other hand - beef dumping and tofu variety - was an even bigger exploration. A raw egg was dropped off at the table and cracked into the soup, cooking it to the desired doneness. It also came with some just-steamed purple rice. The soup opened up a new, glutenous dimension to the rice. Comfort food at it's best! And witnessing the pot bubbling away is pure magic. You know that you're in for something good."}
{"text":"If you are looking to eat something that cost between $10 to $14 and that is relatively healthy and filling,then I recommend this place.  They specialize in stone pot, in particular tofu soup served with purple rice. You can choose the level of hot spice, in which I chose mild, but think I could of done medium spice. FYI, do not expect to order the famous Korean pork bone soup, they don't have it here. Also the washroom is not the cleanest with sticky floors and a easily clog sink."}
{"text":"Home made tofu is good and it's the best thing about this restaurant. The rice was passable, the broth was relatively flavorless even though we ordered spicy. There is far better Korean to be had elsewhere in Toronto."}
{"text":"Whoa, this place is busy and a bit cramped! Three of my girlfriends and I dined here for an early dinner and we were immediately assured we made a great choice upon walking in and seeing almost every table full. The restaurant stayed busy the whole time we were there. 

Between the four of us, we ordered two tofu soups, bulgogi, and bibimbap. The food was great! Prices are also a bargain. We left feeling full and happy!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Saw the raving reviews and decided to check it out.

The sides: 4/5. Great, fresh, healthy servings. Nothing to complain about here.
Tofu soups: 5/5. I love this place only offers 8 things on the menu, keeps things simply and really helps the restaurant focus on the things they do offer. The soups come in a hot steaming pot, and you place the raw egg inside and wait for it to cook. Very flavourful and I loved the entire experience. Healthy portion size too our family left stuffed. Service was quick too for a Friday lunch hour.
Price: 5/5. If you are hungry it is well worth spending the $11 to get a bit more food, otherwise $8 will leave you full.

Final thoughts: 5/5 this place is amazing. If you are in the Toronto area you definitely need to check it out."}
{"text":"As a Korean-Canadian, I can validate that this place is serving authentic Korean style soft tofu soup. It is a Mom and Pop style chain located at Hurontario & Dundas. You can adjust spice levels, and they have different types (seafood, kimchi, beef). I always get the kimchi because I am not a fan of frozen seafood. The rice is purple but healthy and delicious. Not as starchy and unhealthy as traditional short grain Korean rice. A meal here will cost you $10 including tax. Other dishes on the menu include bulgogi and bibimbap which I haven't tried, but will be a safe bet if you dont like spicy tofu soup. 5/5 for consistent delicious food."}
{"text":"Went with bf and friends based on Yelp recommendations. Was disappointed. There broiled beef was over cooked and the beef soup was overly sweet. The portions were extremely small. It was cheap though."}
{"text":"I lived in South Korea for four years so I know my Kory food. However, since relocating back to my mother land, I haven't been able to find any decent restaurants that serve up any Korean specialities. Thankfully, I have some friends who are in the know and I was soon taken to this hot spot in Toronto's Koreatown. I immediately felt like I was back in Seoul and suddenly the 5 words that I had learned while living there came to mind. I was at once relieved that I still knew Korean. 

The menu is pretty teeny tiny, but I like to think it's because they have perfected the items on it. It didn't take long for me to order the kimchi soon tofu soup (medium spicy!) and then sit back to think fondly of ajummas and soju. Before my order arrived, my friend and I were served some nice tea and a few side dishes. Of course one of them being the famous/infamous kimchi. I avoid the stuff unless it's cooked, but it's like crack for others. They just can't get enough of this fermented cabbage. The server also brought along an egg for us to crack into our soup, and a pot of rice. A ton of rice to be honest...I felt like I could have fed at least 12 kids with it.

To sum up, there is truly a reason why this place is continuously jammed with a mix of people. The food is tasty, quick, and very cheap. Much like it is in Seoul. So, if you feel like being transported for an hour or two, be sure to check out Buk Chang Dong and get your soon tofu on. I often do, and it never fails to bring me back to \"The Land of the Morning Calm.\""}
{"text":"My friends and I came by this restaurant walking around the area. The menu is exceptionally small and concise, having less than 15 items on their main menu consisting mainly of soups and select rice dishes. While some find this unappealing, I think it gives a restaurant character to specialize given the abundant amount of establishments in the area. 

I got the soup with beef and mussels (#1 on their menu) with extra spicy customization. If you can handle spice, it is not that hot. Otherwise, I would recommend others to take the regular spice level. The food itself was not exceptional, but the presentation was what brought the score up. The meal was served with purple rice and water is added to the stone pot so that you can eat the leftover rice in soup form. Traditional, but definitely not everyone's cup of tea. 

Service is on point and staff were prompt whenever we needed anything. However, they did try to fit five of us in a smaller table, making it a cramped experience. So if you're coming with an odd number group, I would make it a point to get a table to comfortably fit your party."}
{"text":"Interesting place, menu has less than 10 items mostly for $7.08. Soup is rich and very tasty. Place is almost always busy. 

If you like tofu, you'll love this place. It's like pork bone soup but far less fatty. I've had it a few times and I've developed cravings for it. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"As a huge tofu fan, I love soon tofu! It's cheap, tasty and you leave feeling warm and fuzzy inside. I can understand why there's always a huge line up during the winter, and even in the summer! This location is around the same size as the location downtown, but I'm glad this one is so close to home! 

The service is fast and efficient. Due to the lack of variety of their menu (which I have no complaints about), the food arrives at the table within 5-10 minutes tops. The side dishes may not be too diverse but they're all great for accompanying the purple rice that comes with you bubbling tofu pot. 

I always wanted to ask if I can eat the remaining rice in the stone pot. Does anyone know?"}
{"text":"An immense amount of food, for an abnormally low price! We were each served a steaming pot full of delicious tofu, an egg to crack into it, a bowl of purple rice served from a stone bowl, and 4 side dishes. Then we asked for refills of the side dishes (twice hehe), poured water into the stone bowl and ate the remaining rice as porridge. Everything tasted so good and we were all stuffed to the brim afterwards.

The missing star is for the less than wonderful service. Since it was lunch time and there were only 2 waiters from what I could see, it was pretty difficult getting anything, from our orders to more tea. Also, the menu is very limited - as in one page long - so don't come if you don't like soon tofu! BUT, I would 100% recommend this restaurant to anyone who does! I am still in awe of how delicious everything was :)"}
{"text":"In recent months, I have become a Koreatown regular and am slowly trying every restaurant in the area.  BCD is an infamous spot among other Koreatown regulars.  
They have a very focused and limited menu, either Soon Tofu, Bibimbab or Bulgogi.
My friends got the Seafood Soon Tofu, I love the fact that they bring you a fresh egg to crack in your soup!  Both my friends enjoyed their soups.

I order the broiled Bulgogi, it was not-bad, a bit of a small portion in comparison to the other places I have been to in the area.  I was still hungry after my meal.  I did really like the side dishes, I could not get enough of their kimchi!

The meal was cheap though - $10 with tip!

BCD is worth a pit stop in Koreatown but there are other places with bigger portions if you are hungry!"}
{"text":"Love that we can select the spicy level. Be careful with the first bite because it comes boiling hot! ( I burned my tongue and throat... ) food was quick to be served. Will come back for sure :)"}
{"text":"The soap is very nice. I ordered regular spicy and it isn't that spicy for an Asian who's used to spicy food. 
The seafood pancake is huge and very yummy. It's a must-order for me. 
My cousin had bibimbap and he said he liked it. 
It's a very nice experience. The restaurant is in a corner so it might be hard to find in the plaza. The restaurant is very clean and the ppl there are very friendly."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. It's so cheap! Just 10 dollars for a soup,  rice and side dishes. It is completely worth. My soybean soup was the best or second best I have tried in Toronto. Come here for a delicious soup!"}
{"text":"I love the Buk Chang Dong Tofu in North York so when I heard that a new location had opened closer to home, I was more than excited to try it out. To keep it short: I was not disappointed. 

I ordered the usual Seafood Soon Tofu and Broiled BBQ. Every meal comes with hot stone pot rice as well as a variety of side dishes (including Kimchi, spicy pickles radish and steamed bean sprout). The Broiled BBQ also comes with complementary miso soup. 

The food was amazing. The Broiled BBQ was very tender and seasoned to perfection - not too salty/strong but not too bland. The BBQ was served in a little pan which added a very nice touch in terms of aesthetics. I highly recommend getting the BBQ along with the Soon Tofu - they make the perfect pair.

The Soon Tofu was the star of the show - it was the best Soon Tofu I've ever had. They offer varying degrees of spiciness (from not spicy to very spicy) so anyone can enjoy a good bowl regardless of their tolerance to spicy foods. The soup is beyond words - I couldn't get enough of it. It was rich and flavourful but also had a very clean taste. The Soon Tofu was packed with tofu, veggies and seafood (e.g. shrimp, muscles) - definitely well worth the money! Even though the Soon Tofu contained seafood, I was please to find that the soup did not taste fishy at all. 

I highly recommend this restaurant, especially on those chilly days. I promise you that you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had the bi bim bap. It was good! but I\"ve had better. 

Service was rushed and we never got our water, but it was really super busy so I kinda understand.

Price was good and cheap for the amount of food."}
{"text":"One of the most promising, consistently good quality Korean restaurants I have been to so far in Toronto. Staff is attentive and courteous even though this place is often packed. I especially love their balloonflower banchan, which is a pleasant surprise in Toronto."}
{"text":"Is it the best soon tofu in town? No, but I checked those kinda of expectations knowing it was going to cost $8 for a full meal. 

Make your choice between a 2-page menu, of which all options include a hot stone bowl of purple rice, plus four mini side plates of a tablespoon or two each of beans, kimchi, bean sprouts, and daikon (the customary freebie banchan).  A plastic, blue-capped jug of water will also accompany these dishes, but don't pull a Lesley L. and try to drink it (boo, I like my water, 'kay?).  The waitstaff will be using it to pour into the emptied hot stone rice bowls to loosen those bottom-crisped pieces of rice.  The result tastes sorta like barley tea. 

I tend to go for the seafood soon tofu. The photo description says it contains oysters, shrimp, and mussels, but I've yet to come across oysters in it.  Tonight I had 3 pieces of tiny, head and shell-on shrimp, one very large mussel, and lots of tofu. 

Credit and debit cards are accepted for orders $10 and over.  They validate parking if you park in the back. There's metered parking in the front for $2.50/hour, but you have to be able to parallel park quickly because it's Yonge Street which is also regularly monitored by parking enforcement. 

My final tip: crack the raw egg in the bowl immediately the tofu bowl is served, then carefully spoon the molten hot soup over the egg to cook the egg whites but leave the yolk runny. 
Awww yisss."}
{"text":"Can't tell if it was this place or maybe I'm not a fan of Korean soups? But I didn't understand all the hype for this restaurant. The soup was a bit too salty (almost msg-ish), and all it was was just tofu and shrunken up shrimp. They also messed up our orders and made mine spicy instead of mild."}
{"text":"Nothing hits the spot better on a cold Toronto night than the restaurant that defines soon tofu!  The tofu is silky soft in a rich flavourful soup, the kimchee has a satisfying kick, and ouuu I love the marinated bean sprouts!

My favourite as with the other reviewer is the dumpling tofu.   But I always manage to convince whoever is with me to partake in the Bimbimbob which is full of yummy veggies.  If you share the two, you get the best of both worlds.  A warm satisfying soup, and a tasty rice bowl.  Oh, and I absolutely love it when the rice at the bottom turns crispy.

If you're really hungry you can also add an order of sizzling bulgolgi.  With such reasonable prices, you can afford to order three dishes between 2 people and you'll probably even walk away with leftovers for lunch the next day.

The only downfall is there might be 20 other people with the same craving at the same time and you'll have to wait for a seat...BUT it's always worth it!"}
{"text":"Always come here for tofu soup. They have couple of locations around GTA. This location is one of the better ones. Food taste nice and price is cheap."}
{"text":"Great Korean food. Casual place -great for lunch. Lots of quality food for very reasonable price. Place can get busy but it's ok. I would recommend to new to Korean food or others. I will return. Staff are attentive."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for soon tofu for YEARS. Their menu consists of only 9 items, my favourite being #3 (kimchi soon tofu). With only a couple of items on the menu, it makes it easier to choose from and you know what they serve is the best. Every dish on their menu is filling. 

Their signature dish is any of their soon tofu but also their purple rice. The purple rice is brought in a stone pot, the server will scoop it out then pour hot water to soak the rice. The one thing people don't know if you can eat this! You can either drink the water and eat the rice, or you can scoop the rice out (I do this). Kimchi soon tofu is my go-to order, regular spicy. Withe every tofu stew, they give you a little egg. Crack the egg into the boiling stew and either stir it around or let the egg cook whole.

If you don't like tofu, the #9 (broiled bulgogi) will not let you down. 

Come here on an empty stomach because you are bound to be full!"}
{"text":"They have the same logo as the famous BCD chain that started out in LA.  I admit the NYC one is bad too.  But this one took the cake - these little pots of soup is supposed to be made from scratch.  But I can see that they simply dump ingredients (which ever version you ordered - mushroom, beef, pork, seafood, etc.) and a scoop of the same soup into a pot, bring it to boil and serve.  I guarantee you that is not how it's made in LA.  My beef tofu soup had clumps of the ingredients on the bottom and it wasn't as hot.  Just the bubbling effect - not a true boil.  You are a shame to the BCD name.  Shame on you."}
{"text":"My favourite Korean restaurant, and what I consider to be the best of K-town in Mississauga. This restaurant opening up in Mississauga is my dream come true. I discovered its franchise down at Bloor St. in Toronto before I realized they opened a franchise here and tried this place and was blown away.

There are not many things on the menu, but from most of the things I've tried, everything is delicious. So I was jumping for joy when by accident, I found the same franchise in Misssissauga, walked in... and realized it was the same restaurant. I will soon be a regular at this place every time I crave Korean.

Agree with fellow Yelpers that this is hands down best place for soon tofu - love their soups, especially on cold Canadian winter nights. I love that this restaurant comes with good selection of side dishes and servers are polite to refill and ask if you need more. Also like that the entree comes with the purple, mixed-grain rice. Delicious and healthy. For ~$7-8 for a hot pot of delicious broth, fillings, and rice, you really can't go wrong.

Their soon tofus - wow, there's something that keeps me addicted to eating it beyond what my stomach tells me. I always leave this place bloated.

What I usually order: vegetable soon tofu or the mandoo soon tofu. I also love their bulgogi, and also the one with the bulgogi in soup."}
{"text":"It's always promising when you walk into a restaurant that features a menu with less than 10 items and still have people constantly waiting for tables. 

As the restaurant name suggests - try the soon tofu chigae here and you'll be hooked. I think what sets this place apart is the richness of the broth, you can really taste the difference. They have a variety of choices for their tofu stew (kimchi, beef, seafood, combination, dumpling etc.) I've tried them all and each of them have been equally amazing. They also serve bibimbap and bulgoki here but please give the tofu chigae a try!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back! This place's purple rice and super silky smooth tofu is delicious and fantastic. For sure I can never become tired of this tofu, even in the heat of summer! A must have for any hearty meal craving."}
{"text":"I went here since @BlogTO recommended the original location (Bloor & Christie) as their top choice for Bibimbap in Toronto and Yelp reviews I read said that the quality of the food at this location was the same as the original. After trying the place out for myself I now trust BlogTO reviews/lists less.

My friend and I ordered two orders of beef bibimbap - one for each of us - and a dumpling soon tofu soup to share. The server, though he was a nice enough, was pretty much unable to help us since his English was broken at best. We tried asking him about different menu items and he just basically stood there, smiled, and nodded. Even when my friend - who is severely allergic to fish & seafood - advised them of this concern they were unable to fully confirm whether or not their kimchi used any seafood (which traditionally, kimchi does).

The tea they brought out tasted like nothing. It was essentially hot water. 

One of the dishes of spicy sauce they brought out was fully congealed which means it had been sitting out for lord knows how long. Thanks, but no thanks. 

The food itself came out pretty quickly and the bibimbap was definitely tasty but I wouldn't call it the best in Toronto, not by a long shot.

The dumpling soon tofu soup was ok except it had a grand total of 2 dumplings and the rest was pretty much a mixture of tofu and broth.

We sat waiting after we finished our meal, even going as far as stacking our plates to indicate we had long since finished when we realized they likely weren't going to be bringing us our bill and time soon and we would have to go to the front to pay.

I'm giving this place 3 stars to be nice because the food was pretty good but with the abhorrent service and complete lack of communication skills by the wait staff severely impacted our meal - and could possibly have posed a health risk for my allergic friend. From here on out I will be sticking with 2 other establishments when I want my fix of bibimbap in this city."}
{"text":"We ordered a beef barbecue without rice. The waiter told us the price is cheaper?about two dollars. However, on the final bill, the beef barbecue is the regular price. We didn't find out that till we got home. Because they didn't give us the receipt."}
{"text":"oh man I keep hearing about this place, finally went by myself the other day to try it out. I ordered the signature beef + seafood tofu stew. 

the good:
- broth is so extremely delicious
- tofu literally melts on your tongue

the bad:
- small portion :( at least for me
- very average side dishes. very basic. borderline disappointing. 

the neutral:
- I don't know how i feel about the purple rice... it had an interesting texture. but i think i prefer the traditional white rice when it comes to tofu stew. 
- the service was meh"}
{"text":"Great place in the winter to grab a quick meal to warm yourself up. Many varieties of tofu soups to chosen from such as vegetarian, seafood, regular, and dumplings. You can customize the spicy as well. Good and quick service, was packed when I went in on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Bang for your buck! 

Affordable, tasty, filling, and great service! You get all of these things at the great restaurant/chain. 

They only have 7-10 items listed on the menu so don't come here if you're looking for a variety. Although there are few items, these items are done WELL! All delicious from the soon tofu to the bulgogi to the bibimbap. 

The service is always authentic and friendly, even when we ask for additional appetizers they never hesitate to provide. (The apps are my favourite part, they come with the meal).

The food is really delicious. This location carries to the purple rice (rice cooked with dates which makes them purple). They have different spice levels to accommodate different preferences and also offer vegetarian options as well. Most of the menu consists of soupy items but fear not there is also bulgogi, and bimbimbap as well. 


Come here if you want a good meal that won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"Almost $11.00+tax is not that cheap for this kind of dish.  The food is average and not in a big amount.  The dishes are lack of variety.  I won't revisit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu is fantastic! 

If you like Korean food, tofu and hotpot style eating this is THE place to go! The food was prepared with care, grippingly tasty, piping hot and very inexpensive. 

I ordered the kimchi, beef & pork soon tofu dish - which is a boiling bowl of tofu, broth, meat, and kimchi. It came with the usual Korean side-dishes, a bowl of rice cooked in a special stone pot (with an interesting purple hue) and a raw egg which was promptly cracked into the boiling soup bowl (cooking it). I did not mix the rice in the soup (which can be done if one chooses) but mixed it with the broth andin the spoon - very tasty.  It was ordered regular hot and it was not overpowering - great spice flavor without unreasonable amounts of heat. 

Buk Chang probably gives one of the best \"bang for the buck\" meals in the city. Dishes are all under $10 and beer is very reasonable as well. 

I will be going back to this place frequently. Home-cookin' Korean style! No wonder this place is so highly rated on Yelp!"}
{"text":"I used to hang out in Koreatown a lot and dined at Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu a few times.  We renamed it \"Green Sign\" because none of us can read or speak Korean.  I'm no expert on Korean food, but the food here is delicious, served piping hot (almost too hot), the service is quick and the prices are great.  I especially like the side dishes that come with your meal."}
{"text":"Wow! I loved this place!  Other than Korean BBQ it's the first time i go to a Korean restaurant!  I loved the presentation of the food! I would definetely recommend this to anyone! 

I ordered the BBQ i think it was meal 7, it came with a pot of rice (I loved how the rice was served), kemchi,  beans and soup! It tasted great and the portion is just right for 1 person! 
A friend of mine ordered the seafood soup! It was served with a raw egg that u had to Crack when the boiling soup was served! Well I won't hide my excitement,  it was pretty awesome! This meal was served with rice and other side dishes too! 

Looking around, almost everyone had well presented dishes which honestly made it hard to choose what I wanted to try!  The serviced was great and the servers were very friendly! 

When ever you're in Korea town this place is a goto place!"}
{"text":"My friends and I claim this to be our Korean go-to spot! 

Had the bulgogi soup, I think that's what it's called. But whatever the name is, it's amazingly delicious! One of my favorite restaurants in Korea Town. Every dish about $9+

The appetizers are classic and you can always ask for refills. 
Your dish comes with the traditional purple rice. So good!

This place is perfect for groups or you can dine in by yourself, doesn't matter because the food is just exquisite and very tasty!"}
{"text":"Don't know what the fuss is about, the soon dubu jjigae is not all that great here. OK, it's decent but i've had wayyyy better. This franchise is actually a smaller shop compared to the other BCD's in the states. They don't offer the combo menu where you get grilled meat AND soon dubu. They don't even have Kalbi. What a shame. There was a huge line though, but i think because this place might be somewhat new and people go for the name. NOT THE SAME BCD as the rest of the chain, be warned. My Bulgogi was not all that awesome and the sides were horrible. Im glad in seattle there are korean people everywhere and the food is amazing. Sorry BCD Toronto, Im not a fan."}
{"text":"Soontofu is a comfort food for me. I think it stems from college, when a night of heavy drinking would commonly conclude with hearty soontofu. Instead of late night Chinese food, Atlanta has some late night Korean food. 

Anyways, I'm no expert on Korean food in Toronto, but I think the soontofu here at BCD is pretty solid.  At around $9 a bowl, the value is hard to beat. The portions are pretty generous with seemingly endless tofu. 

My go-to is the combination soontofu with beef, mussels and shrimp. For $9 don't expect too much seafood. You actually only get one of each. **insert sad face here*

Not to fret though, it's still a lot of food especially when you take consideration of the banchan. The banchan is tasty, but they only give you 4 items: kimchi, bean sprouts, pickled radishes and sweet black beans.  

The menu is simple with only 10 or so items, but it works. There are fancier places out there, but BCD always seems to hit the spot."}
{"text":"When there last week. The service was fast and efficient. Love the tofu soup. Would definitively go bake when i am in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Be and my bf come here all the time. It's one of our favourite joints for quick homey hearty food. We order exactly the same thing each time. 

He gets the sizzling beef dish.  Tasty tasty. 

And I order the soon tofu with beef dumpling (and he eats half of it lol). By far this is the best place ever hands down to go for soon tofu and once you have it here you cannot go anywhere else! My bf doesn't even like soups usually but he loves this stuff! 

1. I order mine extra spicy. Personally I don't find it so spicy it's just extra flavourful. I've ordered it with less spice to make sure I wasn't missing out, and you definitely need to order extra spicy! 

2. I ask for it with less tofu. I love the soup, and this gives me more to slurp as the tofu certainly expands a ton. Even when I ask for less tofu there is plenty, trust me! 

3. Why hold the egg? Cmon now people! Drop the egg in ASAP when they put your bowl down.... The tricky part is to eat around it and wait till the end. I'm really particular about this because I do NOT appreciate when yolk mixes into my soup. So yes eat around it and at the end you have this perfectly delicious medium boiled egg to enjoy that doesn't disrupt your soup! Mmmm baby! 

I've tried the other flavours of soup and think the dumpling is by far the best."}
{"text":"Ok so let me start by saying I'm not too adventurous with food.... and first time having Korean.

The place is small, and was busy during a weekday lunch hour.  FYI,  there is no chicken on the menu.
I had the vegatarian soon which is basically a soup.  I wasn't brave enough to Crack a raw egg in to the soup bowl, which came out boiling hot and continued to boil for a few minutes in its hot stone bowl.  Watch out its VERY hot. Duh!
It was tasty actually! So I recommend.
Overall the place is decent but not super decor by a long shot.  Staff are friendly and food was out quick.
The menu has 10 items on it.. I guess that makes it simple for consumer and owner :)"}
{"text":"I like this place. I love the authenticity.. Good Prices. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Dumplings (score: 5/5)
It is crispy and tasty ! Yum!  

Pork Bone Soup (score: 4/5)
It is good! It comes with a stone pot of rice. In the pork bone soup, there are a lot of meat  on the bones. It is pretty good. It tastes very good with the rice and the side dishes. The side dishes also make the soup less salty. It feeds two people well."}
{"text":"Silky soft, homemade tofu in hotpot, enough said. Small place, but always a fullhouse. Ban chans are good as well."}
{"text":"I love eating here and at their location downtown in Korea town (Bathurst and Christie). They make a great bulgogi and I love the rice. The price is decent. They have a small menu but really that's all you need the Korean classics. I would highly recommend this place for a quick meal. They are busy tho during the dinner rush so be prepared to wait. Tables turn pretty quick so I wouldn't worry too much about your wait time. Enjoy! You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Cheap, filling and just soooo good, especially on a really cold day. Go for a skate in Christie Pits then walk over for a bowl of hot spicy soup. It's the best way to spend a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"I have been a regular here for a few years. The servers are very nice, the food quality is good and they provide several small accompaniment dishes. I have tried almost the entire menu and each dish has been well prepared consistently. For 2 people, your bill will be around $22-25 (w/o drinks), so you won't be breaking the bank."}
{"text":"I always come here for a quick dinner or lunch for the tofu soup. It does get really crowded on weekends at prime dinner time so plan accordingly. 

Their main dish is the tofu soup. You can get it with different spicy level (even white). It comes with the soup and the stone pot rice. The waiter/waitress scoops the rice out from the stone pot! 

Very good and filling for the price ($9.79 I think)"}
{"text":"Ever since a cheap eats review of this place on CBC radio, I've been eager to try home made tofu. However, Korean food doesn't really appeal to all my friends. So, I've resorted to take-out while my friends go across the street to Tacos el Asador.  The spicy tofu stew here is natural tasting and good. The vegetables vary depending on what's in season. The egg cracked into the middle has been variably cooked depending on how hot the stew is when they put it in the take-out container. Overall a very pleasing stew of spices, tofu, egg and vegetables.  This is unique in Toronto, from what I can tell, most other cities don't have a Korea-town district. If you eat in, the hot stone bowl crisps up your rice and cooks your egg into a wonderful bi-bim-bop combo.  Rock-bottom prices, too."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Always good customer service!! My favourite is their kimchi tofu soup and their veggie tofu soup!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I have been here at least 10 times in the past two years, and always enjoy my visit. I love the fact its always crowded, the fact that the food is always as you ordered, and that there are never any surprises - what you order is what you get! 
For $8 of great food, what else do I need??"}
{"text":"The best soon tofu in the city. I usually go for the seafood or combination soon tofu. Super satisfying especially in the wintertime. Casual vibe, cheap eats, definitely filling."}
{"text":"Aside from K-BBQ, and Pork bone soup, I'd never had a more traditional Korean lunch, and just before the holidays I managed to slip a quick visit to Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu near Yonge and Finch.

The streets were empty but the steam climbing up the outside windows of the restaurant were a signal that BCDST was gonna be backed - and it was. Tables were packed wall to wall on a weekday lunch and we were the first of a growing line up that was out the door by our meals conclusion.

The process here is fast, and the staff know how busy they get and don't wait for you to waffle between options - probably why the menu is smaller to limit the need for debate, and if you can't decide between two options either order them both or come back again.

I went with a bulgolgi soup which was served with an assortment of pickled fixings on the side including my fave, kim chi, as well as spouts, beans, and others. The highlight to the meal in my opinion was the preparation, presentation and service of the famous Purple sticky rice. Served in a scalding hot container, the server moves quickly to serve this into bowls for everyone at the table and then tops off the remains with rice so those interested can eat the mushy remains later once cooled.

The soup was A-OK in my books, a little too sweet for my tastes, but the flavours were new and exciting and I wasn't going to poo poo them for introducing me to something new. I actually liked the meal overall but in future I would likely go for something with a little more kick to it (love me that spicy pork bone soup).

Check this place out if your haven't already - they also have an equally popular Mississauga location. I'll be there!

Eatcrest Out - Welcome to 2015!"}
{"text":"Bibimbap was made with ground beef and was somewhat underwhelming.  The sides were very good though.  I read some reviews that said stick to Tofu and I say I might have to agree.  It was cheap and quick with great service though."}
{"text":"Delicious spciy kimchi tofu with purple rice and raw egg to put in the soup, your choice is seafood or meat ( pork and beef) with very cheap price : 7.5$. The restaurant is quite ok, not too many items in the menu, staffs are not really friendly. But acceptable with the price for either Korean lunch or dinner ;)"}
{"text":"Great place!

Service was exceptionally friendly and efficient despite the fact that the place was PACKED,

Ordered the seafood soon tofu and it was great.   Loved the free side dishes.  Now, I want to return to try the bibimbap!"}
{"text":"This place specializes in soon tofu, the menu is pretty short compared to other Korean restaurants. They basically have a page for the different variations of tofu soup and another page for other popular Korean dishes (bulgogi, bibimbap etc.). I tried the dumpling soon tofu and kimchi soon tofu both with mild spice. You can choose your spice level from none to spicy. 

The soup was very delicious and they give you a small raw egg to crack into the hot soup. I personally preferred the dumpling one better since it had 2-3 pieces of dumplings for the same price of the kimchi one. The soup base for all of them are the same, the variations are just for the toppings. I only gave 3 stars as I found the portion to be quite small. They give you hot stone pot rice, where they scoop out the rice and you can either eat the crunchy rice crust (at the bottom of the stone pot) or they add water to make it into congee. You'll definitely be full with the soup, rice, congee and side dishes, but 3 stars because I felt like you just filled up on rice/congee and not so much the actual soon tofu which didn't feel as worth it. All of the soon tofus were the same price (or maybe a dollar difference) at $8.85, so after tax it was $10. 

Not sure if I would come back, even though the soup tasted great, I didn't really feel that satisfied after the meal."}
{"text":"Great spot for some soft tofu. This place is a chain and have not yet been disappointed with the few I've visited so far( ie mississauga location). I normally order for takeout and they prep it really fast. Price is really reasonable as well. We normally order 1 soup and 1 meat dish and this is plenty for 2 adults. Taste is really good and they give you the option for spice level in your soup. This place is always busy."}
{"text":"First time there.  Place was packed so you know the food is good.  We ordered #8 & #9 not sure what it was called.  #9 was BBQ sliced beef and #8 was sliced beef soup.  The broth was slightly sweet.  I particularly enjoyed the glass noodles buried in the bottom under mounds of beef.  Both dishes were very generous portions.  Two people tax and tip was $25. Not bad.  I recommend you to try this place."}
{"text":"My roommate and I went for some Bibimbap last night and it was delicious. 

When we rocked up last night the place was crawling, which is always a good sign. The bibimbap wasn't quite as aesthetically pleasing as I'm used to, you could tell it was thrown together with haste, but it tasted good which is ultimately what counts. 
 
I liked their kimchi and the other sides and can vouch for the meal being a good price point for so much food. 

The woman who cashed us out at the end was lovely and it was nice to use my very limited Korean vocab with her and receive a smile."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in the city (if you like Soon Tofu). Here are the reasons:

1. Very friendly and appreciative: We go there so often, we are treated like regulars. It is always a pleasure to eat there. For this reason, we always give a generous tip to say thanks.

2. Limited Selection: I know this seems counter intuitive to some people but there are some very good things to come out of their business model. For example, the food is always bang on, they also don't make you wait too long and, it keeps the price down. Don't be fooled by restaurants that have a huge selection. This usually means that some dishes are not going to be fresh and you'll have to wait a long time. In addition, to stay profitable, these restaurants charge more than the plate is worth to cover their \"working capital\" i.e. stale ingredients that are seldom used.

3. VALUE! You won't be spending more than $50 for two people. Actually, if you don't overdo it, you can spend $25 for two people with a generous tip. You'll also leave full and happy!"}
{"text":"This is where I go for dinner/lunch when I'm extremely lazy to cook dinner. Their soon tofu stew is the best comfort food.
I discovered this place last summer while walking around Koreatown and I'm upset that I didn't discover it any sooner! 
It is definitely one of the restaurants with better service in the area. The food comes fairly fast and the waiters are also very nice. 
I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the most dissatisfying meal that I have ever had. My wife agrees and we are both self-proclaimed foodies. As it was my first time here (and also my last), I thought we were in for a treat based on the great kimchi (although the beans were a mix of crunchy and very chewy). My wife's Seafood Soon Tofu was terribly fishy. I mean that it was a rank, very strong fish taste. Only one mussel, 2 shrimps and not a single sign of oyster in the entire bowl. One of the shrimps (both were complete with eyes antennae and shell) had its clan of eggs still attached to its underbelly. Not very appetizing, let alone the putrid fishiness in taste.

My \"bulgogi\" was a soup. What gives with that? Essentially flaps of fatty beef in sugar water.

We went to this place based on all of the high ratings and kudos on Yelp. I am baffled at what everyone sees here. Mystified even.

You may argue that I'm missing the essence of true Korean cuisine (which you'd be wrong about) but all you need is a set of tastebuds to know that this place stinks."}
{"text":"Soon tofu, soon tofu, and more soon tofu. Good customization with the spiciness levels. I usually get number #4 which is soon tofu with beef and dumplings with mild spice. Make sure you put your egg into the soup once they serve it to you so it can cook in the soup!  

Still an ok place to eat. Prices have increased now so with tax it turns out to be $10 and with tip it can range from $11-12 per person. I find this place is better for lunch as the portions are not that big. 

Another note. Crack your egg with caution. I attempted twice and it did not crack so I attempted to crack it on the table and the egg broke on the table. I admit it is my fault and I asked for another egg but the server either forgot or just bluntly ignored me. And of course, they did not even bother cleaning it up while we were eating."}
{"text":"Food was good. Particularly the item no. 9 in their menu was great. The beef tasted very good. We also ordered the dumpling stew which was ok but the beef was definitely our favourite.
Note that you only can pay with your card if you spend more than 15 $, which means if your going there alone, you should have cash!"}
{"text":"It's really not that great. Beef was dry, dumplings were reheated and cold inside even the miso soup was average. We thought this place would be great given the reviews, but I wish I had gone to one of the other great Korean places along this strip of Bloor street."}
{"text":"Went for our usual haircut date on Yonge & Finch and decided to go for an early dinner at 5pm. ? I was feeling for something savoury and soupy, so we decided to pop in this restaurant after reading all the amazing reviews on Yelp!  Even though it was 5pm, it was quite full. But we were seated right away since they had a table for just us two. It got really busy at around 6 though, people had wait outside, so come early if you can! 
Their menu is small, pretty much just soon tofu with some other rice dishes. I loved that! Easier for me to decide on what to eat  I decided to order the seafood soon tofu because that's my faveeee kind of soon tofu. There was only 4 side dishes; kimchi, marinated soy beans, pickled radish, and bean sprout. I really loved eating the picked radish, just sour and spicy enough for me! The purple rice came in a stone bowl but scooped out into a bowl, leaving the crunchy rice bits bathing in hot water (it soaks the rice so you can eat it once it becomes unstuck!).  The seafood soon tofu came bubbling as usual, and the aroma got me trying the soup RIGHT away (a TINY LITTLE bit though cause it was still boiling hot LOL). I swear my eyes went like  because damn the soup was SOOOO GOOD.  The flavours were phenomenal, I have never tasted such an amazing bowl of soon tofu!!  Spicy, savoury, and just warming to the whole body. The seafood was perfectly cooked, and I noticed they used sweet shrimp (amaebi) in it!!  I loved that so much, made my soup so flavourful. And not to mention how soft their tofu was!! The purple rice was aromatic and a little bit sweet, so eating it together with the soup was delicious. It was so good we barely talked to each other. LOL that's how you know it's a good ass meal. Frigging so good, we need to go back real soooon. The service was also so fast too, they knew exactly what to do all the time.  I highly recommend this restaurant to any soup lovers!! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A friend had been raving about this place and night of, couldn't wait to get her hands on some o' that beef. We had a group of six & so arrived around 6pm on a Friday to beat the crowds -- also helped that it was Halloween weekend and most people were most probably getting dressed up and boozed up.

Although Buk Chang Dong's beef seems to be the best seller, I opted for the Kimchi Soon Tofu. All I can say is if the Kimchi Soon is inferior to their Broiled/Bulgolgi Beef....daaaaamnnnn I have something to look forward to next time! Piping hot broth, silken tofu, lots & lots of kimchi thrown in, and a mix of beef & pork. The meat was a little scarce but even still, I really enjoyed the meal. We scarfed down the soy bean/bean sprouts/kimchi/daikon banchan and they happily obliged when we asked for som'ore.

the way their soon tofu warms me up almost makes me LOOK FORWARD to this winter! cheap, filling, comforting. can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Delicious, hot, gut-filling tofu in a savoury, spicy stew of assorted goodies (ranging from bean sprouts to beef to large mussels with the shell still on - although you can also get a noms vegetarian soon tofu) - personal favourites are the special and seafood soon tofus. It's like happiness in a bowl. 

I will be back every chance I get, with friends, $10 and an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Arrived about 45 minutes before the restaurant closed up. Food was brought out to us really quick, although the server brought my girlfriend something different from what she had ordered. It was still great food regardless. Portion was great. Friendly staff, just wished the dining tables weren't placed so close to each other. Overall, pretty nice place for an affordable meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been a favourite of mine for more than a year or two.  It was my go to restaurant with my friends, when we wanted something inexpensive and delicious.  It's definitely a meal worth of it's value. I would say it's on the top of my list for the best korean restaurant I had in Toronto so far (def. a bang for it's buck!). 

If you haven't tried it, and want something warm for the upcoming cold winters in Toronto, this is your place.  Portion size is perfect + it comes with delicious side dishes.  

They provide for you a range of spiciness that you want your soup to be, I always tend to lean for medium! & if it is your first time, your dish always comes with a egg,  which you usually crack into the soup when you get it, so make sure you keep stirring until its cooked or to your preference. 

My personal preference is combination 1/ 2 because I love seafood.  I've never really ate their sizzling meat dish (Bulgogi). However, when my friends are feeling meaty.. & decide to go with it, they always say how there is too much meat overload for them; resulting in them not finishing it. 

Not only will this place fill your tummy, but I find it is the most affordable restaurants I have came across to, when looking for a healthy but good quality restaurant.

Decor isn't the greatest, but if your in to food mainly and just want something to warm you inside and out, this is the place. 

As for parking wise, if you have a friend that lives close by.. I recommend you ditch your car at their place & walk there.  Parking is located behind the restaurant, but it's absolutely insanity when trying to get your car out. In a split sec, someone will be parked behind you and the only way to get it out is to let the restaurant staff know that a car is blocking you.  As a result, they will write down the license plate & go around the restaurant asking, if the car belongs to you & if you could move it.  *A real pain in the butt*."}
{"text":"If you like good quality hot and spicy food at a cheap price then you've come to the right place. Even those who can't handle the spice can be satisfied here since you have 5 levels to pick from ranging from white to extra spicy. I'm Korean and I go for the regular spice. Kudos to anyone that can handle the extra spice. 

The menu only has a few items but every item is worth trying and is delicious. Also comes with 4 sides dishes that compliment the menu items well. I love the stone pot rice.

Here's some tips:

- let the rice soak in the hot water for a while to get a tasty congee
- put the egg in the tofu soup as soon as it's served"}
{"text":"The menu is small and concise, which is perfect because I prefer it over a lengthy menu. I had the BBQ beef with rice, and I personally thought the beef was too sweet, but some folk might like it that way. The bibimbap was good. Their best dishes are the soon tofu soups. The side dishes are great. It's very crowded though."}
{"text":"Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu is always packed so prepare to wait.  The food here is cheap and tasty.  I usually get the spicy Seafood tofu soup or Bulgogi.  I love the appetizer they give you especially the tiny black beans.  You can select your spiciness so don't worry if you cannot handle spicy items.  Service is friendly and fast as well.

{"text":"This is a great place to eat if you're looking on a cold winter day. They use lots of fresh ingredients while keeping each meal under 10 bucks

Order the kimchi tofu or dumpling tofu, I get it extra spicy ! Be warned the next day your ... will feel like ..."}
{"text":"Love this place! You can't go wrong with it.  The price is super cheap! For 2 people it comes to 18 dollars with tax.  

The menu is small with I think only 8 options where most of the 8 are types of tofu soup.  You can also get bulgogi and bibimbap but the really good stuff is the tofu soup.  I like spicy food so usually go with the regular spicy which is the second highest spice level. 

The service is fast and the guy servers are always flying around table to table.  

The side dishes you get are all really good!  Kimchi, soy bean sprouts, beans in a sweet sauce and pickled radish (daikon?)

Apparently you can park in the back for free but I am always confused to where the store is so just park on Yonge or on the side street.  They used to let people exit through the back which I did before but then I was told I can't do it anymore but I still see others doing it.  So I just park on Yonge.  

Take out is also great from here and well packed with good portions! Call ahead and you can run in and it will be ready in 10 mins. 

Been to the Bloor location as well and it is also great."}
{"text":"C'est le restaurant le plus blindé de Koreatown, ce qui est très bon signe. Les plats servis ici sont principalement dans des plats en terre cuite brulant accompagné d'un bol de riz (violet). Enormément de choix comme : boeuf, fruits de mer, végétarien.
C'est typique de la gastronomie coréenne et c'est définitivement un établissement à faire si vous êtes de passage à Toronto.
PS: vérifier le nombre de piments à côté de chaque plat qui spécifient le degré de \"piquant\""}
{"text":"Never knew this place existed in Richmond Hill. I been to the one in North York a handful of times and the one in sauga twice.  This used to be a chinese HK style diner if I was correct here. It is nice to have some amazing Korean in Richmond Hill now.  The soup was very good and they serve it with purple rice like the other locations. This menu was larger than the other places as well which is a plus"}
{"text":"As always like their other locations this place is quick and delicious. The servers are always nice and bring out side dishes and tea quickly. Quality is always good and you can't go wrong for a great meal for under 10 dollars. Got the regular spicy dumpling and it was great with good portion size. Free refills on the side dishes as well!"}
{"text":"Nothing like good tofu soup to open your nostrils! This BCD tofu house is located in Korean town of Toronto. Reminds me of BCD tofu house in LA. 
I wanted to look around Korean town and get some Korean fix.
I got the spicy seafood tofu food. Good for cold weather. 
Service was fast. 
There are many Korean restaurants open nearby."}
{"text":"Last time I was there was a couple months ago. Food is consistent and good. Price is great. By keeping a small menu and focusing on a few items, they really make them special I think. I only ever had the seafood and beef soon  tofu ever, and they are both very flavorful. Actually quite soothing to eat them after feeling weak from a stomach flu."}
{"text":"Good food.  Tofu was excellent.  Got the Mandu tofu, wife had the seafood.I should have gotten it spicier.  Bulgolgi was also good.  Service was fast and attentive.  Sides should have been replenished though. Not enough bean sprouts and marinated black beans, although we were there right before they closed.  Overall great.  Another Yelp find."}
{"text":"Best food I've had in Koreatown thus far! Loved #7, #8 on the menu."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday for lunch. It was packed! Even at 2-3PM. There are still people waiting for tables. 

This was definitely a different type of experience with Korean food (as compared to the rest of the places in toronto). The menu is very small but everything is delicious. It is great that diners get to choose the amount of spiciness in their soup, from five levels, instead of the usual three. This makes the place accessible for most taste buds.

Between 5 of us we got five different dishes so I was able to taste most items on the menu. My favourite was the Bulgogi Soup. The meat was well seasoned as compared to other places that may just leave it tasting plain. The soup was flavourful and sweet. There were also generous amounts of meat and sweet potato noodles!

What surprised me was the hot stone pot they used to serve the rice. This left us with crispy rice at the end! My favourite! What a treat to end off the meal!

One downside was that service was slow and they forgot one of our orders. I guess its cause the place was so busy and the servers were tired out?"}
{"text":"How do you pick a restaurant to go to in Koreatown? The smallest one with a line up at the door.

Luckily my friends got there at 7 pm and missed the sudden rush to get Bibimbap! 
The menu is small. Not a lot of choices means they can do their main dishes well. I ordered the Broiled BBQ. It was a burst of flavours. I usually load my food with hot sauce but I didn't want to ruin this dish. It was on the salty side, however.

I would have given this 5 stars but I didn't enjoy the little appetizers that come with the food (kimchi...etc). I've had better.

I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"We found the Toronto location for Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu using Yelp and were very impressed, but it was so far away, it was tough to visit. When we noticed this new location in Mississauga, we had to check it out. Is it as good as the original?

I'm happy to say, yes! They don't seem to be as busy in this location, so we've always been able to get a seat and our orders processed quick. With a simple menu like this, it makes is much easier to choose your meal adventure. Though our one problem is, remembering what we had each time. Thank you to whoever posted a photo of the menu!

So, some of our favourites:
#4 Dumpling Soon Tofu + Dolsotbab (rice) comes with a raw egg that you crack into it when they serve it. YUMMY, and a huge portion with extra rice.
#7 Stone Pot Bibimbab (mixed vegetables in rice) very tasty too.
#8 Dukbegi Bulgogi + Dolsotbab (beef soup) + (rice) is fantastic.
#9 Broiled BBQ + Dolsotbab (rice) is a great option for anyone who shies away from the \"tofu\" part of the name, as it is fantastic BBQ!

We like to bring friends from out of town when they visit, and even the pickiest eaters leave full and with a smile... With only 9 options to choose from, you really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"- this place is terrible.
- ok. it's not. it's amazing, but it's always so busy and cheap and delicious and makes winter tolerable.
- so stop showing up."}
{"text":"I've definitely been here 100+ times by now -- where else can you find such amazing food for $11 including taxes and tips (used to be $9 all-in!)? I'm convinced that no one (excluding the owners) has been here more than me. Soon Tofu is by far my favourite food, and I can say with confidence that no other place in Toronto makes it better than BCD (no other place is even close for that matter)."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this BCD location bi-weekly for the past 3 years since I moved downtown and while I still don't believe it's as good as the North York location, it has improved substantially. Further, it is still much better than any other soon tofu joint on Bloor (yes, I've tried them all)."}
{"text":"It took me a while to realize I was at a shop by the same name in Mississauga, are they related?? I stopped by this shop a year or so ago on a summer afternoon - needless to say it was quiet as we were off peak hours and it was summer - when not many want piping hot soon tofu surrounded by nature coming indoors (read: flies). I had no complaints at the time as soon tofu is a comfort food favourite of mine, and the location was super convenient. A specialty store with a high rating on Yelp - what could go wrong? It must be decently authentic, price-quality must be good, and portions must be standard at the least. Alas, back then, I was not disappointed.

Then recently, I came on a Friday right at dinner time. We were already on the latter end of the night - something like 8pm - but a table for three still took a 40 minute wait. I got it - the place was actually packed! It was cool for the season and doors had to stay closed - but the shop was steaming hot. There wasn't enough ventilation, but hey, everybody is eating a bubbling bowl of soup in the store, so it must be tough to keep the temperature down. We waited patiently and looked past the heat, and we're finally seated. The menu is simple - your classic soon tofu with the typical options - pork, seafood, beef, dumplings...and a few alternatives like bibimbap. The portions were great and what I appreciated was that my rice was moist. When food arrived the server did all the prep work for us with scooping the rice and pouring the water into the hot bowl so the crispy flaky bits will soften for later - except rice was being served out of the bowls so fast nothing really crisped up.

My tofu wasn't as smooth as the location in Mississauga - probably a source issue. I got the dumpling soon tofu and the dumplings were tasty - but nothing out of the ordinary. Everything else was as expected, and I was able to get my soup at a spice level I can handle without going completely spice-less.

Overall, everything was as expected except for the wait - if not for the wait this could be a solid location for some basic home style Korean comfort food on a cold winter day. Summertime - stay away, busy times - stay away. They offer take out and even free delivery of you're right in the area, but everybody was already so busy so I'm not too hopeful."}
{"text":"BCDST is one of the best dining experiences in my arsenal of jaw dropping, mouth watering, incredibly tasty and tummy satisfying meals. There are a plethora of positive characteristics with this establishment and really nothing negative to say which is why Buk's IS the most popular Korean restaurant in the city. Yeah I said it.  

This quaint little restaurant specializes in their rendition of Sundubu Jjigae (pronounced chee-gay), a Korean stew containing the softest tofu within a 1000 mile radius. I will religiously order the #3 - Kimchi Soon Tofu because I am an absolute kimchi whore. The stew is made with items such as beef, pork, vegetables, kimchi, tofu and gochujang (fermented pepper paste) among other delicious ingredients. 

The bowl of jjigae will arrive to your table between 6-9min after you order bubbling with heat, seriously, it is literally boiling away when it hits the table in front of you shooting love-steam up your nasal passage. This is your cue to crack the egg that was placed on your table with the condiments into your soup, the boiling stew will cook the egg for you with ease.  

Buk's stew/broth has a similar effect on me like that of Pho Tienh Thanh's pho broth. I honestly feel so charged up and empowered after consuming it I feel like scooping up a manhole cover and launching it into space. It is that good. 

In addition to the Sundubu you are presented with purple rice and 3 types of banchan (Korean side dishes). The rice is a glutinous rice and when it is unmilled it can produce purple and or black grains. It is served hot in a stone pot and although it is tasty, it is definitely more visually pleasing. The banchan really floors me because they are always so tasty and so much fresher than most Korean establishments I dine at. The kimchi (fermented/seasoned cabbage) is arguably the best I have ever had in the city, I would assume it's made in house. Same goes for the Kongnamul (cold boiled bean sprouts w/ sesame oil and other seasonings) and the shredded pickled daikon. 

A beauty of this restaurant is their limited menu, there are only 9 items. I feel that every restaurant should have a menu similar to Buk's because how can one restaurant make over a dozen perfect dishes? Each and every restaurant should specialize in one genre of cuisine and do it as perfectly as possible. Buk's limited menu ensures you that you will be ordering a quality dish, it's as though their menu is a listing of their \"house specials\" when really that's just their actual menu. 

In addition to the ideal menu the staff are courteous and efficient and it is so important to be courteous, it has the potential to make or break a meal for me. Price-wise it is one of the best deals in town, you can change your life for under $10 a meal. 

Well played Buk, well played."}
{"text":"We were feeling \"Korean\" last Sat, so my husband and I went to Buk Chang Dong after reading some very positive Yelp reviews. Very true! We loved the place and it is quite unique, I don't think I ever had such great Korean soups before. My hubby ordered beef tofu stew and I had a soup and beef bibimap - we shared and both meals were delicious. The price is right, we paid $30 incl. tip. Great place!"}
{"text":"yum yum yum. this place never disappoints. quick service and piping hot food. seems to always be relatively busy which is a good sign, must be delicious"}
{"text":"Found this place off Yelp actually, and was pleasantly surprised. I've got a soft spot for soon tofu so this was perfect - and a convenient find as the small plaza the shop is located in features a Chinese bakery and a tofu shop too! We got in right amidst the Sunday lunch rush, but fortunately got a table for two. The setup is your basic Korean restaurant - simple décor, self serve utensils, just soon tofu and a few other dishes on the short menu.

We ordered the combination soon tofu and the bibimbap. It took a while for food to arrive, which really deducted points given we were hungry and expected the food to come sooner than 30 minutes in given their short menu list. Perhaps we caught them between batches, or the bibimbap took longer than usual? Or they were out of rice for a moment? Side dishes come with the main which sucked - would've been nice to get our side dishes while we wait. The order in which they presented things was not ideal for the situation, but I understand that it's in their routine.

The tofu was super silky and soft which was a pleasant surprise. The soup was good and the mussel and beef in my combo soup was great. The shrimp looked overcooked, but served its purpose of flavouring the soup. The purple rice was moist but not overly so - which I thoroughly enjoyed. The side dishes featured yellow beans, bean sprouts, pickled radish, kimchi...generic and not disappointing. The stone bowl was alright - generic and nothing to write home about. 

Overall the location and tofu texture were great winners, but the wait time was not. I'll have to come back when I'm in the area to lay a verdict on whether it was a one-time mishap, and they're worth more merit for their food."}
{"text":"3.5 
Solid soon do bu. I always get the seafood option. I like the purple rice as well. The noorungjee is also super yummy - a really nice way to end your meal. 

The side dishes are average. Me and my boyfriend like the beans though. Those are good. 
I think with tax and tip, I pay $11 per person. Not bad. Not bad at all. 

Parking is annoying. It's in the back and there's a chance you might get blocked by another car by a customer in the restaurant. When the waiter takes your order, they always ask for your licence plate in case you need to move your car in the middle of your meal."}
{"text":"Went here after Snakes and Lattes! It was busy but we were seated promptly. I got the bibimbap. Food was delicious and service was fast. Would come back again."}
{"text":"There are two things you can do to get 5 stars in my book. You can blow me out of the water with you impeccable service, and outstanding food, or you can be cheap, filling, consistent and close to where I live. Freebies don't hurt either. Ok, I'm cheap. Freebies are awesome.

BCD is clearly in the second category. The decor isn't much to speak of. It didn't give me a food-gasm. But it does, time and time again, fill me up for under $10, and those little bowls of kimchee and other delightful snacks to munch on while you're waiting for the meal... well, they just cheer me right up.

I haven't tried other Korean resto's in the area because I've been going here since high school, 10 years ago. And that says something. It says I'm old.

P.S. This time I ordered #7 and #9 (to SHARE people, I'm not THAT piggy.)"}
{"text":"YES YES YES! They make the soup perfect, every single time. The soft tofu stew here is the real deal - it tastes the way it does in Korea! It's definitely authentic. The food comes out fast and piping hot. I love the purple rice and how they add water to the stone bowl after they scoop out most of the rice for you so you can have some watery rice (for Koreans, this is called \"jook\"). 

I've literally had everything on the menu and it's all amazing. I always get the stew extra spicy. The bulgogi soup is nice too if you're wanting a little more meat and some sweeter soup. But really, this place is all about the soft tofu stew! If you haven't tried it yet, you're missing out. Highly recommend! It's the best soft tofu place in Toronto, by far (and much better than the North York location too)!"}
{"text":"My friends barber (who is korean), recommended Soon Tofu as being the most authentic korean restaurant in Toronto. So my friends and I come here quite often. The cost is $1/2 higher than other places, but for the amount of food that is given - it's very worth it. 

The usual dishes we often order are: seafood soon tofu, kimchi soon tofu, bbp, soybean soon tofu and bulgogi. They give a lot of side dishes - which are all delicious.For all the soup dishes, they give you purple rice, which is quite a bit as well. I also found it very interesting that they give you the eggs separately, instead of adding it in directly to the soup dishes. Very neat! My favourite is probably kimchi soon tofu (I love kimchi..). I have tried many different korean restaurants, and learned to be picky with my kimchi... This is one of those restaurants that have good kimchi in my personal opinion. I would say that the food served here is stronger in flavor than some other restaurants I have gone to. 

There's a good amount of space, so waiting is never long. Servers are courteous and are quick to our aid as well."}
{"text":"Really solid place. Came by while I was in town since I was craving some soft tofu stew. It really hits the spot on a cold day. The service was friendly and fast and the combination stew was delicious. 

They have a decent menu with lots different options and a variety of spice levels. They also have a combo option where you can also order a sizzling plate of korean BBQ on the side. I also appreciated that they give you the rice in the hot stone bowl and they put water in it to make an extra rice porridge after your meal!"}
{"text":"\"everyone knows, when you go to Buk Chang's, it's for the soon tofu. unless you have a serious aversion to the texture of silk, do as the locals do and order one of the gloriously smooth tofu soups. they are THE BEST in the city!
although, soon tofu is sometimes referred to as stew, it's more like a light, flavourful broth with pieces of vegetables, tofu, and sometimes meat. it's served piping hot, and in my opinion, best eaten in the colder months.

hints: 
parking is in the back alley
nearby subway is finch station, head south 2 blocks
see jimi's review of the toronto location at: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/buk-chang-dong-soon-tofu-toronto"}
{"text":"Make sure you order Combination instead of any of the other ones.  It has the bets flavour because it brings the beef broth in with the seafood flavours whereas some of the other ones such as Dumpling are so bland....it's no wonder some people don't like it as much.

They used to have a seaweed side dish which was to die for, but they stopped serving that about 3-4 years ago I think because too many people kept getting refills and it wasn't a cheap item lol...

This location is so much better than the one at Yonge and Finch even though it's the same company.  But in the winter, it's so annoying when the doors keep opening and the cold rushes in."}
{"text":"Bubbling hot spicy tofu soup... Damn good on a freezing cold day...  But also good on any day!  

You get 4 side dishes and refills if you like.  All meals come with a stone pot of rice which is scooped out into a bowl, and then they add some water so you have a light porridge after you're done.  

For around ten bucks, you get a cheap but totally satisfying meal.  

Service is usually quite efficient, but sometimes you might have to wait a bit if they're slammed.  

I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple of times as I'm not from around the area; but overall the quantity and quality are comparable to the Christie location."}
{"text":"Best soontofu in town, period. 

It gets pretty busy during prime hours so the wait can be excruciating while you're staring hungrily at other people's orders - but the end reward is worth all that mouth-watering and shivering in the chill winter winds."}
{"text":"This place doesn't get a lot of traffic, but the menu is the same as the rest of the chain. The food is still delicious, and my only qualm is that the quantity seems more restricted compared to the Christie location."}
{"text":"reasonable price, delicious tofu hotpot!
I had the kimchi one and my friend had the seafood one. Mine was super tasty!!!She said she would order the kimchi one next time. 
busy little restaurant, be ready to wait.
just made my day"}
{"text":"We usually come here for their tofu soup (number 3) and bulgogi on the side. Food is always consistently good and served with delicious black bean rice. The restaurant is always packed at meal time and this is an Asian place so don't come expect top notch service, you'll be a very happy person after your meal."}
{"text":"I got here around 5 pm and the place was not packed just yet.  Within seconds of being seated, I had two menus and two warm teas at my table.  Once my friend arrived, we quickly looked over the nine item menu and placed our orders.  We got our food within a few minutes of doing that. 

Each one of the nine items on the menu comes with four side dishes that include kimchi and beans.  I believe most if not all came with a side of rice as well.   I ordered the BBQ beef dish whereas my friend ordered the seafood/tofu soup.  All the items listed on the menu were less than $10.  They also have a limited list of beverages (a few beers and about five types of soft drinks).

The food itself was great and filling.  You can't really complain for the price. Halfway through our meal the restaurant started to fill up and got busier, at which point, we had a hard time grabbing the attention of our server to get a refill on one of the side dishes and some water.  When we finally got his attention and made our request, he quickly disappeared but all together seemed to forget about us.  We had to grab his attention again after a few minutes of waiting and remind him that we were still waiting on those two things.  He quickly cleared up our side dishes and replaced all four of them with fresh plates along with a bottle of cold water.

My experience with Korean food had been until now limited to ayce Korean style BBQ. The experience I had tonight, at a place that seems to be a bit more of an authentic venue, was overall a good one and I will most likely be returning again."}
{"text":"9 items , mostly tofu  soup and Bim Bibimbap. I'd like to eat at more Korean before I can give an honest opinion. The only other Korean I've had is Korean BBQ and one or two other sub-par places in Koreatown. It's decent, the food is quick and the sides are good. The only thing I found was that the Bibimbap was a tad bit bland. I'll review when I have the soup again.

 I'm also confused by the rice in the water that they bring with the soup. Do you do anything with the water or just take the rice out of it?"}
{"text":"Simple menu,  food was delicious and arrived within about 5 mins.  Service could be friendlier and was the difference between a 4 star rating for me.  Prices were fair and portion sizes average.  Overall a nice authentic Korean meal!"}
{"text":"Tucked away on the far west side of Korea Town, this place is a hidden gem. The number one favourite is the combination hot stone soup with tofu, beef, shrimp and mussel, which is every bit flavourful and warming. Even when the place is packed, service is quick and food arrives promptly. The restaurant has a homey vibe and the food is super cheap = happy student!"}
{"text":"The menu is limited but they are good at what they do! The stone bowl hot pots are amazingly flavourful, and are delicious with the purple rice. I ordered the dumpling hot pot and my friends picked out the kimchi hot pot (one ventured into the super spicy realm and was very pleased with their dish), and all of them were great. The service is fast and friendly, and the place filled up quickly during the lunch hour rush. I need to try the bulgogi hot pot, so I'll definitely be making another trip here again. 

The place isn't really baby friendly since the bathrooms are located downstairs and there's no place to change the little one, but they were totally okay with me carting my big stroller in and plunking it next to our table and letting me take up a chair for the car seat."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Extremely rude and inattentive service. Too bad, because, did I mention the food was great?"}
{"text":"This place has been going downhill for a while now.

Though the food is still good, the customer service is appalling here. Servers ignore me and my friends often and constantly look miserable. They need to shake this place up and fire some of the guys who make customers feel uncomfortable.

I have only found that when I am here with Korean friends I get a good quantity of food. Otherwise if you are a bunch of non-Koreans, they will gyp you on food quantity.

I have stopped coming here and hope the place gets its act together because they actually do have good food."}
{"text":"My cousin dragged me here and at first I thought \"what a hole in the wall\". Then I had the food. Boah it was good! Had a #8 and #9, so yummy ..."}
{"text":"This time around I told the male server to just leave the rice alone and I saved a whole lots of rice from being drowned in water to be thrown away for no reason lol

Also, recieved only one egg when I was with my dad and he also ordered soup lol so I asked for another onr and it never came LOL that guy just does not care what a jerk lmao because there was a lady behind us who was eating ALONE and somehow she has two raw eggs??? I mean she must've at least asked for another one and they gave it to her but why not give one to two people who both ordered soup??? 

The only reason why I was here today was the soon tofu ofc its always on point, probably always will be until the chef dies or loses their tastebuds or brains and it made me so very happy to order the REGULAR SPICY this time around because i ordered MEDIUM before and it was a tickle here and there in my mouth. The reg spicy does the soup justice and if you're crazy for spice go ahead and ramp it up.

My dad ordered the bulgogi soup and he hated it like it was so sugary and so sweet he ended up putting his beef and noodles into my bowl LMAO I mean I've had bulgogi soup elsewhere too but it wasn't as dessert like as it was here.

Once again, never going to recommend bibimbap unless you have to eat here with friends and someomes forcing you cause comon, youre in koreatown, there are better bibimbap places out there. Now, ALSO never going to recommend the bulgogi soup, unless you like eating sugary beef soup."}
{"text":"Had a delicious Friday night dinner here and I left feeling absolutely full!! Before I forget, I should also mention that they sell cute Korean socks at the front (4 for $10). Needless to say, I bought 4! 

We ordered the dumplings (6 pieces), kimchi soon tofu, bulgogi and a spicy pork dish. There was so much food and every single thing we ordered was delicious. All dishes were served with purple rice, After they scoop out your rice, they ask if you'd like water added to your rice for later.

It was fairly quiet and we received excellent service. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"$10 tax included...can not get any better! Always my favorite tofu place for years now and never it disappoint me!"}
{"text":"WAY worse than the Tofu Village nearby. Tofu soup tastes like broiled water. It is cheap though with a very simple menu."}
{"text":"Delicious bubbling bowl of spiciness and a raw egg to crack inside and swirl with your chopsticks. Soft, pillowy tofu with little morsels of pork and beef. 

Purple Rice arrives in a bamboo steamer and is scooped into a bowl for you to add to your tofu or eat alone with the yummy bean sprouts, spicy kimchee and daikon.

This hearty and heavenly meal was only $8.50 with tax. For a deal like this, I left a fiver for a tip. These guys hustle and 20% of $8.50 ain't much.


Amazing Korean food and an unbelievable price!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some Korean food with a couple friends, but didn't know exactly where we wanted to go. We ended up walking down Yonge Street for about 20 minutes before picking Buk Chang Dong. A friend of mind had already been here before and said it was quite good, so we decided to try it out.

Like most other Korean Tofu Soup locations, they had meal options that included a soup, rice, and, of course, side-dishes. I decided to go for BiBimBap as I wasn't in the mood for soup, and it was quite good. A good amount of ingredients and a very good sauce to go with. My friends got the soups and they seemed to be quite happy with them too. They said it was quite spicy, but in a good way!

Service was quite good as well. Everyone was quite friendly and the food came quickly. They were quick to refill our teas and side-dishes as soon as we asked.

They seemed to have a tiny, private parking lot in the back, but seemed to be a little inconvenient as they had to ask customers to move cars partway through their meals

A good choice for some soup if you feel up for that. May need to speak to the staff if you do want to park in the back though! Kamsamnida!"}
{"text":"Been here many times since I first moved to Toronto, and easily the best soon tofu I've had in all of Toronto. Other places aren't even comparable, and there's usually a line up around the corner during the dinner rush. 

Perfect place for a quick bite and an affordable price. 

Check it out if you haven't!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Best kim chi I've had in Toronto. We were advised by a fellow veg to order the Bibimbap with tofu instead of beef, and man I'm glad we did. We also got the vegetarian stone rice bowl dish which was good, but confused us a tiny bit when the server poured water into the stone bowl. (We love the crisp rice at the bottom best.) Luckily I'm not afraid to ask questions and learned that this watery rice concoction is basically dessert, to be enjoyed once the myriad delicious pickles and hot pots have been demolished. Though who could possibly have room by then? The portions are generous and the prices fair. I see why the wait was so long for a table at night, and well worth every minute of being jostled while waiting by the winter-drafty door."}
{"text":"This is one fantastic Korean tofu soup place! It's ALWAYS busy and that's because they do what they do very very well. Because they know what they are focused on, their menu is super simple with 6 soup options which are basically variations of the same tofu soup plus three other options. 

If you come here, you should be coming here for the soup because their three other options are dishes that you can find better version of at other places and if you've come to Buk Chang, you've come here for the soup!

It's a simple place so there really isn't much to say other than the soup is really awesome here and the prices are amazing for what you get!"}
{"text":"Best tofu soup I've ever had! There are 9 things you can choose from on the menu. I ordered the seafood combination tofu soup in mild spice. The tofu is so soft, fresh and comes out piping hot, also comes with banchans, purple rice, and a raw egg. The price is right (~$8) and the food is great!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Korean restaurants in Toronto! The soft tofu soup and bulgogi are my go to dishes when I visit this restaurant. Both are very delicious. Like many other Korean restaurants, price is also very chip. The service is good and the food is delicious. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"It's not the fanciest place nor does it have an extensive menu, but their food is delicious. Don't come here if you're looking for Korean BBQ, though. They've got tasty soups and a couple of sizzling platters and bibimbap. That's it and it's all you need!!"}
{"text":"The food quality was okay, but the sweetness is too high. While service was terrible ! No one cares until you ask for a menu, or to do anything! We had to grab the waitress every time even though only 1/2 of the seats were taken"}
{"text":"This place is going to be my fav. place to eat some real good korean food!  I ordered #4 (Mushroom, Beef, Dumpling) with extra spicy just enough for my taste! Came with 4 tasty side dishes. The portion was large! Finished my soup with some tofu left over, i only had a spoon full of my purple rice. (too full to finish the rest) I can't believe its only $8!!"}
{"text":"Quality and authentic Korean food located in Richmond Hill. The pork bone soup itself was flavourful and was just the right amount of spicy, with an abundance of pork bone, as well as potatoes and spices. The soup dishes come with purple grain rice which was a good addition. As per any Korean restaurant, the typical side dishes were provided; fried soybeans, sprouts, cold noodles, and kimchi. All the sides were quality and the waiters were friendly and quick to refill the side dishes. Overall, a casual but authentic Korean food experience!"}
{"text":"My favourite place for tofu stew.  Tasty and cheap.  Also free parking at the back.  I still remember the first time I came with my friend who was a regular and parking at the back and going in the back door through the kitchen to get into the restaurant.  Something must have happened that they changed the rules and you're no longer allowed to cut through the kitchen.  When coming in from the back you now have to go down a dodgy stairwell and go in where the bathrooms are which the floors were wet and smelly and then up the stairs into the restaurant.  Minus 1 star for that.  Will walk around and go in the front next time.  Walking through smelly toilet water is not something I want to do before eating my lunch.  

Food itself is delicious there.  Tofu is silky and I love that the rice comes in a stone pot and they pour water in it after they scoop it out for you."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the North York location so I was super excited that this opened up much closer to home. The quality is the same as the North York location, servers are attentive and there is plenty of parking. Minus one star as the other reviewers mentioned, the seafood tofu stew doesn't have much seafood, but what do you expect for $8? The star of the tofu stew is the tofu, not the seafood anyways."}
{"text":"Quick service and pretty tasty food, but I preferred the soon tofu at Chowon, which is more north."}
{"text":"We kept waiting for a table for two. However, the waiter served the table to the next 3 people waiting behind us! We ordered Kimchi Soon Tofu and Beef Bulgogi. It's nice and not too sweet."}
{"text":"good food, good price, Waiters are cute. Love the purple rice. Their side dishes are everything. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Best tofu in Toronto hands down and the prices are very reasonable. Soon tofu is 7.97+tax. The servers are fast and although many of them don't speak English well, their effort is apparent and it definitely makes up for it. 
Tofu is gorgeously soft, they serve the rice (purple rice) and pour the water into the stone pots for the soup for you too! Basically y'all need to head on over ASAP."}
{"text":"consistent taste. fast service.
simple menu and they've been all good.
highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food was yummy and it was really filling too! For the price, I'd definitely say it was worth the visit after a long day strolling in Koreatown!"}
{"text":"Amazing seafood tofu soup for only $7.99! Plus it comes with this korean rice and several side dishes. Couldn't complain with this price!"}
{"text":"Good smooth tofu. Authentic Korean 
Cuisine with a simple menu. 
A tofu soup set comes with tofu soup and a large bowl of healthy rice served in a hot pot, and 4 side dishes. Portion is good enough for an adult with average appetite. Though not the best food in town, the dishes are all well prepared. But very little meat and veggies, so you can get hungry very soon. 
Overall, this restaurant offers excellent value for the price paid ($10 a tofu soup dinner set, tax included),  especially when you want just a simple meal."}
{"text":"The food absolutely phenomenal for the price. I tried the beef and dumpling soup with 4 side dishes which included kimchi, bean sprouts, pickled turnip and soybeans as well as rice all for 8$. The soup arrived bubbling and delicious! The broth was so flavorful. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I usually go to the yonge location but since they opened this one closer to home, I thought I would give it a try.

This place is hard to find, not going to lie, it's tucked away in a corner. The decorations inside is trippy, the mirrors inside made me think it was larger than it actually is. 

Food is excellent, same as the one at the young location. 

The waitress was awesome as she was dancing to kpop as we were eating, it felt like I was watching a live special. The kitchen staff came out wearing slippers to joined in the fray moments later. 

I like it. Its chill."}
{"text":"I have been a sucker for soups lately, so the first couple of times I have been here I normally go for the closest thing they got to pork bone soup. 
I also had their Kimchi soup which is alright but sadly I had better but not by much. 

However the great thing about this place is the quality and tastiness of the food to their price ratio. It is seriously tasty and spicy food. Which I really like and trust me I am not the only one, during dinner time this place is packed. 

I will be making a point of having the BIBIMBAP next time I go, since one of friends claims that Ka-Chi up the street actually makes it better, which I am seriously doubting. So I will put on my lab coat, set my taste buds to maximum receptivity and venture in if just to wager on his crazy hypothesis.

For those who like and are used to a vast array of menu items, you will surprised with Soon Tofu, since you can count all the items this restaurant serves using both hands. Yup, just 9. However they are made well. So, it is easy to overlook the quality over the quantity.   

Service is generic-Asian-restaurant. Most servers suffer from  a language barrier so don't expect chit chat. But that is nothing new or unexpected at this point.  

If you do come out, remember you are coming for the food, and here, that is quite the treat. I recommend it. .    

PS:. They do not serve pork bone soup. Just as a FYI. 
PPS:. Great for small (8) groups."}
{"text":"God bless this place. May it never change.
For under $10 you can pretty much get two full meals out of this- or 1 very filling meal if you're a big eater.

Free refills on side dishes.
GREAT side dishes.
I've been coming here for almost 10 years now and will continue to do so. Prices have barely increased.
They take credit card now too!"}
{"text":"Went with a large party of 7 people and luckily secured a table for dinner.  The menu is simplistic and really helps to show the images on there.  Since we had so many people, I do not think they served it in the same dishes that were in the photos which is a shame since it looked quite authentic.  Ordered #3 with beef, pork, tofu spicy kimchi.  And be warned, even me who can deal with the heat, the regular spicy is spicy, no question (in a way, glad I didn't go to the max level).  Don't expect a lot of meat, it is a tofu restaurant but there isn't too much special with the tofu unfortunately.  Still the dish was put together well and it was quite unique the banchan."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. Food is nothing special and the portion is so small. Parking is quite easy to fins though."}
{"text":"Consistency and simplicity at its best.  

The menu is short...several varieties of Soon Tofu plus bibimbap and bulgogi.  All pretty good but Soon Tofu is THE STAR.  

Tables are placed close to one another, call it \"cozy\" or \"communal\", don't mind other people staring at your food or sharing their conversations with you, it's mostly unintended. 

A few things I've noted lately: 
-- \"spicy\" on their spiciness scale is not very spicy; think I need to notch up to \"extra spicy\"
-- kimchi is sometimes under-aged or under fermented; please leave them along for a little longer, I prefer flavour well developed

Will definitely be going back again and again."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Food was good. Rice was absolutely fresh, having just been cooked."}
{"text":"Authentic, affordable, and most of all deliciousness!!! The parking is kind of weird because you have to either park on the side, or at the back of the building where theres no access into the restaurant. Once you know how to get in though, its not a bother. The menu is very simple, they only serve soon tofu soups (Seafood, Kimchi, Combination, Beef, Pork), Bulgogi Soup, Bibimbap, and Bulgogi. They've perfected these dishes, so I cant complain. I don't recommend the seafood soon tofu as they dont put in enough \"seafood\", but the kimchi and combination are good. Lots of meat, and the broth perfected to your choice of spice level. I can't forget to mention the main reason I return, PURPLE RICE aka black rice, Known to be the healthiest rice in the world, mostly due to the high level of antioxidents it has. Score! Healthy and delicious, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Authentic delicious tofu pots! Shippable waiters :)  Everything is delicious, and thankfully they only have 9 items on the menu so it's super easy to decide. A lot of tofu! Delicious all around :)"}
{"text":"...i have a new found love for this place! a full hearty traditional korean meal costs less than some combos from mcdonalds! the quality and authenticity are top notch. 

i ordered the seafood soup (combo 2) - comes with rice and 4 small side dishes. it was so authentic that they even give you an egg to crack into your soup. I have been to many Korean restaurants and have ordered this soup and most have disappointed me by not serving the egg - until here! 

would definitely return again and again :)"}
{"text":"I'm definitely not an avid Korean food lover but I really can't say that my meal here was out of the ordinary. I mean, I thought it was nice that they poured hot tea into my remaining rice pot (since this isn't customary at other Korean restaurants I've been to) in anticipation that I would eat it later and well, overall, the food was decent. I think it just wasn't the 4 star rating I was looking forward to. Their menu is rather limited, and the price point is very standard. I never really crave Korean food unless it's fried chicken so I doubt I'd be coming back here."}
{"text":"I've been here three times , and it was decent . Service was all right , food was good but not the best I've tried . I was disappointed when I brought my whole family here suggesting to them that it was really good . We received the worst service . We ordered three different Soon tofu dishes . They got all of our dishes wrong and the waitress looked pissed . Not at the cook nor the waiter that took our order .. but at us ! She never apologized either .. to top that all off, in our seafood soup, there was only ONE muscle ..nothing else . We paid an extra 2$ for one piece of muscle . VERY disappointing ... Another thing to add, they never served us the rice in a HOT STONE POT .. Maybe cause it was in the evening that they didn't want to clean the stone pot ? I know this is a long review but I really wanted to let you guys know. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Well priced Korean comfort food! Brought me back to my travels in Seoul. The menu only has 9 items but they do them right (as far as I'm concerned). The broth for the soon tofu was very flavourful and the purple rice is delicious!"}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars - I am indeed a fan.  Tasty and very affordable. Certainly not the best Korean food I've had, but definitely some of the best value I've had. Yummy banchan side dishes, friendly young waiters.  A pitcher of water on each table. NOTHING to complain about.
I had regular spicy which wasn't enough.  Will crank it up to Extra Spicy when I go back... tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu, but the other locations are always packed.  This one is always empty when I pass by.

They have the same menu as all the other restaurants.
I ordered the soon tofu with pork for approximately 7.50 and excited to see what exactly a soon tofu was!

It was quite spicy with tofu, and some pieces of pork.  It came with a raw egg, which I cracked open into the soon tofu.  The taste was a bit odd, and although not bad, I didn't particularly enjoy the taste - a bit sour.
I also received 4 banchan.

Although the owner was very nice, the service was definitely lacking.  Apart from bringing the food, she was never to be found.  Even to pay, patrons were expected to go to the front.

I think if you enjoy soon tofu, this may be for you, but I think I'd try a different restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"First off, I'd like to say that the service is amazing. The waiters were nice guys who were warm, inviting, helpful, and patient (with customers who ask a lot of questions like myself). 

However, I must also be honest and say that the food was overall very mediocre. My boyfriend order bugolgi which tasted fine but I had issues with my order which was the seafood tofu soup. There was evidently a lack of seafood (only two shrimps and one mussel) and the shrimps were pretty disgusting. They were tiny shrimps not de-shelled and worse, not fresh at all. I liked that they had purple rice but I also found that to be a little too soggy/soft. Overall, I wouldn't rate the food experience to be poor but I definitely commend the waiters."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best korean food i had outside of Korea. Family vacation to Canada back in May and this place came across when we were in Toronto. My dad and I had bulgogi soup and my mom and sis had soon tofus. I honestly did not expect the foods to be good bc we didnt do any research before going in, but foods were so delicious that made us to consider staying one more night just to go back to this place.
If i ever go back to Totonto, i would definitely go to this restaurant. Highly recommended!

(Not the best picture because everyone was hungry but this is what we had!)"}
{"text":"I can't believe how much I liked this place for someone who has never tried this kind of food before!  I came here because of all the good reviews and had a craving for Korean food.

I tried the kimchi beef soup and the dumpling beef soup on two difference occasions and both were excellent; although i slightly preferred the dumpling.  The choice of appetizers are really tasty and the rice is delicious too, especially when dipped in the soup broth.  The only complaint I have is that if your hungry the soup + appetizers + rice is not enough to fill you up.  I would recommend the bibimbap for really hungry guests."}
{"text":"I fear I'm becoming something of a regular here. It's tasty, it's near my house, and it's damn cheap. I'm after only one thing: the vegetarian hot pot (#6 on the menu). It comes bubbling hot, with an egg, purple rice and some intriguing little sides (kimchi and who knows what else - sorry, I'm new to Korean food). Also, I love pronouncing the name of the restaurant. Minor drawback: I often need an Alka-Seltzer, stat, after eating there."}
{"text":"Great place for Korean tofu soup. Service is always great, beef on sizzling plate is also delicious."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant featured in an episode of Kim's Convenience (season 1) and ever since then, I've wanted to try it. I ordered the most popular dish combination soon tofu and dolsotbab with beef, shrimp, and mussel. The stew came with a few slices of pork, one mussel, one unpeeled shrimp, and an ABUNDANCE of tofu. It also came with a hot stone pot of purple rice which was scooped into our bowls by the server. The server then poured water into the hot stone pot and left it soaking on our tables. I was unsure if there was a purpose or they wanted to grab all the dirty dishes together. Puzzled, we ate with soaking wet rice on our side.

The stew was okay, the soup wasn't too rich in flavour. Maybe it was because I didn't ask for it too spicy. It also came with an egg on the side you crack yourself into the stew which is pretty cool. I love rich stew and the soon tofu wasn't the greatest for me. I hope their other dishes have promise and I believe they do based on the number of customers. The prices at Buk Chang Doon are definitely competitive compared to their Korean restaurant counterparts in Koreatown. Good service and convenient location!"}
{"text":"Been here so many times I can't keep count. It's like a McDonalds, you know what you're going to get and you know how it's going to taste. Although there are some misses here and there sometimes, they always make sure you leave satisfied.

I always get the veggie soon du bu and sometimes with a side of bulgogi (depending on how hungry I am). Always good and spot on authenticity. I don't know if the wait staff has a system but it functional and fast. Just don't expect smiles and hospitality - they have a job to do... and it's to get my food on my table as fast as they can and to get me out.

For all you talkers and hanger outers. This is not the place to squat and chit chat. This is NOT a Starbucks coffee. Eat and leave so the others lining up can have their turn in the experience. If you haven't notice but I'm there with all the others eating giving you dirty looks to get the hell off the table!"}
{"text":"I've tried soon tofu at two other restaurants on Christie and this place has the best. Service is quick and food comes almost immediately. I had the vegetable soon tofu which was good. I really like the side dishes that come with it. Great value for what you're getting."}
{"text":"the tofu is to die for, that's why you come to this restaurant. the tofu soup that soon tofu makes is rather special?even compared to the myriad of other Korean restaurants in the area. price wise it is not the most affordable in the area, but if tofu is your thing you probably won't do any better than soon tofu."}
{"text":"Really great Korean restaurant. Portions are generous, food is well priced, and service is great. You can tell by how busy the restaurant is that most people agree. A must try."}
{"text":"Love it. A staple in Koreatown. Extremely tasty, great price point, friendly service.

The menu is very basic, but I like it that way. This place knows what they're good at and sticks to it. 

On my most recent visit, I ordered the combination soon tofu (choice 1 on the menu), medium spicy. Spice level was perfect for me. Tofu and broth/soup were delicious. While description said it included beef, shrimp and mussel, don't expect too much of these ingredients...it's mainly tofu with some beef pieces, one mussel, and one shrimp. Also comes with purple rice instead of plain white rice, which is a plus!

The appetizer dishes are awesome here - you only get four, which is less variety than what you'd typically get at a Korean restaurant but what they do give you here is so so good. The kimchi, the bean sprouts, and those beans!! 

I'd definitely recommend this place if you're looking for some good eats in Koreatown."}
{"text":"The food here was good, I'll give them that. Service was quick, but nothing more. 

My friend and I had the Kimchi Soon Tofu. I feel like you need to know a little bit about eating Korean food to eat here. Before they brought the dish, they placed a couple side dishes on the table and 2 eggs. They then brought the main dish that was sizzling hot. I didn't know I was supposed to crack one of those eggs into the bowl of soup, so I sat there, waiting for the rice. Suddenly, after the sizzling had subsided, my friend realized the eggs were on the table, and exclaimed \"THE EGGS! QUICK, CRACK YOUR EGG INTO THE BOWL!\" We then had an uncooked egg floating around in our soups... It cooked after a while, but it would have been nice if the server brought our attention to the eggs and told us to crack an egg into our bowls while the soup was still hot. 

The environment was a bit cramped, but it wasn't bothersome. The floor however, was wet and slippery even though it wasn't raining outside. 

If you plan on driving, they actually have free parking behind the restaurant. Just make sure you let the waiter know you parked back there once you get seated inside. 

Overall good food, just lacking a bit in terms of overall experience."}
{"text":"Awesome! Had the white soup (non spicy) based seafood tofu soup... I love spicy food myself but would definitely recommend this over spicy soup base for the seafood as you the soup is so flavorful and the seafood flavors would've been covered up for sure. Service was pretty fast and prompt. Banchans were great too, would definitely come back. Only thing I didnt like was that there were some flies as the door was left open and the washroom could of been a little cleaner!"}
{"text":"I have a new favourite restaurant!   Dining alone and wanted 2 items.   Cancelled the Broiled Bbq + dolsotbab as I could always come back tomorrow and have it freshly cooked.    
The Combination Soon Tofu (little amount of beef, 1 mussel, & 1 shrimp) but with lots of tofu was excellent. You get a raw egg which you crack into the boiling soup.   I will get medium next time as mild are good but I could do with more chilli.   The dolsotbab was great as well all the appetizer of Kim chi, bean sprouts, beans, & radish."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant on a Tuesday evening and at first it was quiet with plenty of tables open, then halfway through my meal, the restaurant was filled - and for good reason too!

The menu is quite sparse and you don't get a lot of options if you aren't a fan of soon tofu. Soon tofu is a Korean broth with tofu and additional toppings. This time I ordered the Dumpling Soon Tofu ($10.95 + tax). I had mistakenly ordered the medium \"spicy\" but it wasn't at all spicy to me. I would go with a regular spicy if you're into a little bit of a kick!

All broths come with a bowl of rice and appetizers to share (bean sprouts, nuts, kimchi and pickled raddish). The appetizers were standard and nothing spectacular. The rice provided is a purple rice and they spoon it into bowls for you. After scooping the rice into bowls, they add rice water to the pot of rice to make a post meal 'porridge'. I am typically so full that I cannot even fathom finishing my bowl of rice and the porridge at the end!

The soup is very flavourful and they also provide a raw egg to crack into your soup when it arrives (the soup is still so hot that it thoroughly cooks the egg). This is meant to make the broth and tofu smoother than it already is. The soup is flavourful and great on a cold winter day!"}
{"text":"Always come here with my family and friends. Food and service is amazing. I just don't know how they flip table so fast. Would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Summer? Perfect time for some hot tofu soup. Visited on a Friday night around 7:30 pm, and it was almost full. Ordered the kimchi tofu soup ( kimchi, beef, pork)  with mild and it came promptly along with the side dishes. Food wise its average, as the toppings are somewhat small. The tofu is good but wish that was more the highlight as opposed to the rice and soup. But value wise this place is great, at 8.85!  

Have returned multiple times already and each time has been positive. Good option in the rhill area!"}
{"text":"Yes, Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu has some tasty tofu soup.  The tofu soup is served in a blazing hot stone bowl and the tofu is silky and flavourful, as per all the reviews here.

However, the stone bowl is also great for dolsot bimbimbap!!  This place has the BEST dolsot bimbimbap because their stone bowl is SOOO hot!  They must have a crazy oven in the kitchen to heat up their bowls this hot, so of course be careful not to touch!

Mix up the rice and the toppings and add the spicy sauce to your liking.  After you're done, the bowl will still be crackling hot while the rice gets all crispy - yum!  Because of this, the dolsot bimbimbap is not soggy like other places where the bowl is not hot enough.  So yes, come here for the tofu but don't forget about their dolsot bimbimbap too!"}
{"text":"Here's my review in one word (just skip to the bottom).  I'm just here to confirm what everyone below me wrote.  :)

I had the dumpling combo whatchamacallit.  The soup was awesome.  The only thing I'm mildly disappointed with is the number of starter dishes you get isn't as many as the places up near Yonge-Finch corridor.  That's getting a bit nit-picky though.

I can also do without the water & rice bit that my dad would probably love.  You're supposed to pour water into the rice in the pot after wards to scrape off all the dried bits.  Ummm yeah, it tastes like.... well what it looks like. Rice and water.  I understand that when poor folks were poor they had to do this, and this reminds my parents generation of their childhood, but I'll just pass on this.

Anyways.. my real review in one word: \"Ditto\"."}
{"text":"This is my definition of a 5 star restaurant. It doesn't need to be fancy or exotic. It just needs to have a good model and deliver on that model and at a good price. 

This restaurant specializes in making soft tofu stews and is easily the best at it. Not only is it the best tasting tofu stew I've tried anywhere in Toronto, it's also the best value by far because it comes with a stone pot rice! At comparable restaurants, they charge you $3.50 for this rice + the rice stuck to the pot. 

If I may expand on the food options, they have several varieties of soft tofu stews. If you don't want stew, they also have bibimbab and bulgogi. You can't really go wrong with the options here as they are all delicious and under $10. Plus you get your regular array of side dishes. 

There is a reason why this place is always packed. Great value + delicious food = success. Your only real concern is being able to get a table during busy hours."}
{"text":"The restaurant is hidden in the shops area with plenty of parking in front (same plaza as the supermarket). 

I ordered the combination tofu and it comes with lots of tofu, topped with one mussel, one shrimp and some beef. You can choose the spice level. I like how they serve you purple rice that is cooked in a hot stone pot. The broth has a mellow flavour due to the tofu.

Friendly staff that offered great service"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Korean soon tofu soup! I have been coming to this place for a few years now. The price point is amazing for super yummy soups and great free appetizers! I could not recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"This is honestly my most favourite restaurant in the city. Can't ignore the amazing price point - so good if you're a student! Free unlimited sides??? YES PLS! 

I always order the seafood tofu soup, regular spice, and I usually ask for just a bit of tofu (lol I know, I know). I also order the bulgogi to share."}
{"text":"Came here in the winter with a few friends after studying, didn't get around to writing a review until now. My friend was eager to bring us here for it has, apparently, some of the best soup broths in terms of Korean food in uptown Toronto. Getting to the restaurant, we were greeted by friendly faces and we were fortunately seated right away. The wait staff was efficient and kind, and our food came shortly. It was delicious! Since I usually get kamjatang, it was nice trying soon tofu stew - something new. It really hit the spot after an anguished (I'm exaggerating) afternoon of studying for midterms and made up well for the frigid cold weather we faced outside. I'd definitely come again on a cold winter day. Yay!"}
{"text":"I was here to purely compare it to it's (almost) next door neighbour Tofu VIllage and I must say while I completely enjoyed my food here and it was some of the best Korean I've had, something about Buk Chang fell short of my experiences at Tofu Village. The restaurant just seemed too cramped up and very rushed. 

Their banchan was very nicely done, and my order of kimchi soon tofu + bulgogi was not entirely what I expected and there seemed to be a lot less tofu here than Tofu Village (go figure??). 
It took me the longest time to keep swiveling my neck to catch the attention of the staff for more tea while my mouth burnt up so a few marks off for service. 

But as is with most Korean establishment, the food is amazing and cheap and they are what I crave when I look ahead for Korean food. Buk Chang deserves many repeated visits but with Tofu Village so close by I'm afraid Buk Chang might have to take the second spot in my life."}
{"text":"My third time at Buk Chang Dong for some savoury Clay Pot Rice!  The first 2 times I had #9 on the menu, which is their Broiled Bulgogi (think beef on a sizzlin hot plate, served with a side of their house clay pot rice).  

The communal starter dishes (which I always want to ask for seconds and thirds of) were:
Broth-Braised Bean Sprouts
Some sort of soy sauce/hoisin sauce-tasting glazed soy beans
Pickled Cabbage
Kim Chi

This time I decided to change it up so I tried their Stone Pot Bibimbab (#7), which consists of bean sprouts, shitake mushrooms, greens (can't recall what kind atm) topped with a fried egg on a bed of jasmine rice.  It comes with hot sauce to add to the mix.  It not very rich in flavours, but it was delicious and filling.  It was not as savory as the Broiled Bulgogi dish that I had the first time, but still gets honorable mentions!

Service was friendly and quick, although they do forget to refill your tea when it gets busy. At $8 being the most pricey thing on the menu.... I'm in love! And it won't even break my piggy bank!"}
{"text":"Food alright service was fast. The place was extremely busy i suggest coming in earlier in order to get a spot."}
{"text":"The extra spicy soup actually wasn't too hot.  It was super tasty and I loved slurping the soup.  Everything was so delicious.  I especially liked the dumplings (two came in the pot) in the Dumpling Soon Tofu.  The beef could have been more raw but it was still good."}
{"text":"So delicious and soo cheap! My favourite is the tofu with the beef!!! The broth it's in is soo flavourful and the tofu is the perfect texture! When you mix it with your rice it's the most satisfying meal in the world!

They only take debit or credit for bills over $15 which is a bummer since all their menu items are under $15. But the past two times I went the servers were super friendly and happy to let me pay debit when my meal came under $15"}
{"text":"The menu is simple but everything you find on that list delicious, especially their hot pots. The seafood soon tofu is a must try. It is very comforting and full of flavour. They have plenty of seafood, zucchini and tofu. Very affordable and filling. This is what I always get when I go to Buk Chang. They have other food items but this one hits the spot. 

Side dishes are delicious but don't offer a lot of variety. The servers don't mind when you ask for more. 

Service is okay. Always a busy place so servers are really fast paced and try to get you your order as fast as possible. They are very quick to deliver your food on the table.

Overall one of my favorite Korean spots in North York."}
{"text":"I came here after trying the downtown location.  I actually like this one better. There was a line up around 1pm on a Saturday, but we quickly got a table.  

They have free parking at the the back (says the sign on the front door). You can park behind someone but just let them know your license plate so you can move it. 

The place has the usual soon tofu, bibimbap and a soup/grilled bulgolgi. 
Got the bulgogi in the stew (tastes awesome, and comes with glass noodles, tastes like a sukiyaki but better). The grilled was really yummy too. Both come with the purple rice. Normally they put the water in the rice bowls after they scoop it out. They do it so naturally, tha tif you blink it'll be done. I'm not a fan of the water rice (dessert) so this time I asked if they don't put the water, and letting the rice sitting there during our meal, it became crispy and yummy.  It was really good scraping it with a spoon and munching on it. 

These guys are super friendly. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for tofu soup! The menu is small but it works since it allows them to provide quick service. We went on a Friday night. The place is not big so it can get packed quickly. We did not have a problem getting a table though. I think not a lot of people know about this place yet. Our order came pretty fast. I ordered the Combination soon tofu (number one on the menu). I love it! It came with an egg which you crack yourself and mix it with the soup. They also give you purple looking rice on the side.

I used to order tofu soup in other restaurants mostly Korean-Japanese ones. I think the tofu soup at Buk Chang Doong is way better!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I don't get why people are arguing there's no chicken option here. ITS SOONDUBU, which translate to TOFU SOUP. 

The broth here is delicious, it's even better then what you get in Korea. 

The tofu is outstanding, so silky and smooth.

The rice is well made and the side dishes are always present when you come in.

It's classic, delicious and simple. The menu is small but it forgivable when it showcases it's best. 

Anybody who's a Korean cuisine lover has to come here for a taste on their own."}
{"text":"another five star rating...am i too easy?  

anyway...this place was super cheap and really good korean soon doo bu with good banchan as well.  come here on an off time so you don't have to wait in line."}
{"text":"They do have great Bibimbap annnddd Soon Tofu!

Thanks for recommending this place Yelpers!!  It was aweeesome!

I bookmarked this page to try and recommended it to my friend who had been a frequent visitor to this joint anyways, so we decided to go yesterday!

I had the STONE POT BIBIMBAP, which was aweeesome, you know the stone bowl is authentically hot when the rice is all crispy on the bottom and sides.  Yummmm.

My friend got the SOON TOFU (mild), which I took a taste of and it was also delicious.  I would personally go for the spiciest level, so that will be something I will need to try next time!

They start by bringing to your table the little dishes: kimchee, kimchee radish, soybeans, and bean sprouts.  It tasted very fresh and authentic - and it's ALL FREE RE-FILLABLE!!

They are great, always busy, we did have to wait a bit but they turn over the restaurant very quickly, and the service is very fast.

Thanks for the recommendations, I will have to make this place one of my regulars!"}
{"text":"That's a lot of reviews. Here's to add to the pile. 
YUM. 

The food is great. I came here many years ago and I remember it was the best bimbimbap I've ever had. I'm glad I could come again to try, and it still stands. 

As for the Soon Tofu. Not the best place to come with dietary restrictions or allergies. Note, most things are made out of soy anyway, I would just avoid, and get the bimbimbap or bulgolgi. Asking the servers will get you no where. 
They gave me a small sauce with my Bimbimbap, and I asked what is this? \"Paste\".... very descriptive...

The Soon Tofu is a korean stew with Tofu and other meats/veggies. It will come with a stone bowl purple rice called Dolsot and a raw egg. Why are people so afraid of throwing the raw egg in there. It will cook in the boiling soup and will become the highlight of your meal! Mix the purple rice with the soup, or vice versa along with the myriad of Korean appetizers (kimchi, bean sprouts, soybean). 
What they do with the stone bowl is leave it on the table, and add water to it. Supposedly this is your dessert, but I LOVE the Crispy rice at the bottom. If it were me, I'd try to watch them, and make sure they DON'T add the water, so I can scrape my crispy rice from the bottom of the bowl as a treat. But act quickly if you want to do this., 

Meal came out to be $10 including taxes and tip. 

You can't rate the service and treatment in a place like this. It's no frills, it's Koreatown, it's local and cheap and they really do want you in and out so they can seat as many people as possible. Honestly, if they do an efficient job and don't give you any hassle, you got a good place. 

 We did have a large group and got a table quickly (good timing) and they didn't bother us as we did overstay our welcome a little bit. 
No one will come and bug you unless you need something. Don't be afraid to wave them down asian people stay (flapping your arm at them) to ask for whatever you want."}
{"text":"I have always like this restaurant. I have been coming here for a long time now but forget to write them a review.  I think this location is pretty small compared to the other ones.  Regardless the food is still amazing.  For the price, its ridiculously good.  I salivate thinking about this place.   As a typical Korean restaurant, they start with around 3-4 appetizers.  They serve their soon tofu with a side of rice in a stone pot.  They put water in the pot for later at the end of your meal to soften to Rice.   My wife loves that part.  The mix of crispy and congee like leftovers.   For some dishes but not all, they include a raw egg for u to crack into the soon tofu when it first comes out.  What attracts me the most is the price.  For this much food, and the food is great, the price is amazing. I have been coming forever and will continue to do so.

Service 4.5/5
Location 4/5 Not much parking unless you go to the back by the Dumpster.
Food 5/5
Price 5/5"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. We came when the restaurant was busy. We ordered several of the tofu stews at our tables. Overall, the broth was okay - nothing too spectacular, but not bad. The tofu they use was super soft, which is a plus. However, service was slow and lacking in taking our orders, refilling drinks, and refilling the side dishes. Also, no one informed us that we were to pay on our way out, so we sat at our table at the back for a while with no service. Food is decent, but there are so many other dining options around that I probably will not be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"In the heart of Yonge and Finch where Korean restaurants  fills the street what better to stop by Buk Chang Dong if you're a fan of Korean soon tofu. 
I've had much seafood soon tofu soup at innumerable Korean restaurants but none stands out quite like this one; their broth is very aromatic with the kick of heat. Tofu is very silken and soft mixed with the stone pot rice is heavenly. 
The place speciality is their tofu based Korean dish their other dishes are also a must try, the place is over all welcoming and will unquestionably give you taste of Korea while making Koreans nostalgic for a meal from home."}
{"text":"Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu is one of my favourite restaurants in Koreatown. The menu is simple and straightforward. There's only nine items on the menu, but all of the items are done well. Moreover, the prices are very reasonable. 

One of my favourite is the combination soon tofu ($9.74) which comes with beef, shrimp and mussels. The silky tofu in the spicy broth really hits the spot. It's Korean comfort food at its finest. The soon tofu comes with a side of dolsotbab (purple multigrain rice in a stone bowl) which allows you to mix the soon tofu stew in with the rice. The soon tofu taste great with the rice.

My other favourite is the dolsot bimbimbap ($12.39). It comes in a stone bowl. It is a nice mix of veggies and a fried egg cover the bed of rice.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is not fancy. You do not come here for great service or atmosphere. You come here for great Korean food at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"My favourite place for soontofu! Their tofu is so silky smooth and I love that they serve purple rice, which is a more healthier alternative! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"98% of the time when I come around this area is because I'm craving for this dish. This hot soup dish is absolutely perfect for colder weather!

Soontofu or Soondubu is probably my favourite Korean dish so far because it usually comes spicy, it has both meat (should you choose), egg(s), and veggies (tofu, cabbage and stuff)! Not to mention, Korean places always give side dishes - even though I've had better side dishes elsewhere instead of here, haha

Both E and I get the same order #3, just different levels of spiciness. At this restaurant, they have about 5 levels of spice - from white (aka no spice at all) to super spicy (my favourite!!). They also have different variations of Soontofu/Soondubu - kimchi, seafood and I believe pork. E and I always get kimchi aka number 3, haha. Don't fret, the kimchi option still has some sort of meat inside.

Along with the soup, which will come in a heated bowl so the soup will stay warm the entire time. It'll also come with purple coloured rice, which I believe is actually mixed with red bean. They'll also provide side dishes in the beginning, along with an egg so you can crack it and let it cook when your soup arrives.

Note: They are a speciality Soontofu/Soondubu restaurant, which means they serve majorly of Soontufu/Soondubu options and only 1 other food option which is Bibimbap.

The service here is alright, although they always ask if you parked in the back. Not sure why this is the case.. However, the price is cheap and good because this meal always fills me up, even when I'm staaaaaarving. Definitely my go-to place for Soontofu/Soondubu!! If only it was closer..."}
{"text":"Was recommended this place by a friend of mine. Didn't have too high of an expectation upon entering this place. After my trip to Korea, I never thought I would be able to find a restaurant in Toronto that would meet my expectations. Until I tried this place, literally blew my mind. 

Since this place is known for their soon tofu, that's exactly what I ordered. For those who can't eat spicy or enjoys eating really spicy, you can choose the level of spiciness you want for your soon tofu stew. Each seafood soup comes with a raw egg which you can crack into your soup and a bowl of japgokbap that's prepared in a hot stone but scooped out in front of you by the waiter/waitress. The tofu was super soft and silky. By far one of the most delicious seafood soon tofu I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The menu is simple, the price is good, the stew is comfort food at it's best. The simple options leave little to think about. Group favorite include the kimchi stew, the bulgogi, and the squid and pork. The stews are cooked to a nice thick boiling consistency that tantalize the senses. The flavors explode with each bite. I enjoy this especially on cold nights and winter day. The only thing is service is a bit slow, and at times, the vibe aren't all that welcoming. The shop is quint but the plaza is stupid busy. I would recommend this place and its subsidiary branches. Come with friends, family, or date...always nice to get some stew."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today and I doubt I'd return, unless I was on a diet.
Apart from us, there were only 2 other tables, all the time we were there.  The menu is pretty small but they specialise in soon tofu, so that's what we went for.  I ordered the dumpling soon tofu and my friend ordered the soybean soon tofu.  We waited a while for our food and they brought the banchans with the food.  When the bowls came, we were disappointed in the size.  The bowls of soup were tiny but also seriously lacking in protein.  The soup and tofu were nice but they should at least offer a larger size.  I would pay extra to upgrade but with such miniscule ingredients added to the tofu, I would only come back if I was on a diet.  The side dishes are pretty ordinary, not great and not much variety.  It was kimchi, radish, beans and beansprouts.  We also got one raw egg too, between 2 of us.  I also hated how they added water to the crispy rice stuck on the stone rice bowl.  I would've prefered to add my soup, instead.  Or just scoop it out with my spoon and enjoy it crispy.

We didn't get great service that others have experienced, one guy was completely silent and the other guy just said, enjoy your meal.  

For the amount of ingredients you get, apart from the tofu, it's totally not worth coming here.  Unless you eat child sized portions or are on a diet.  But the flavours are good."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant! I probably go at least once a week when I'm living in Toronto. 

Tip for those who don't like seafood: get the combination tofu and ask for no seafood and extra meat! I get this every time I go"}
{"text":"Same as the place as in Mississauga with only 10 dishes or so. Unlimited banchan/side dishes with 80% of the dishes being different variations of soon tofu. 

The banchan were very good and the soup came out piping hot.  It was very tasty and wasn't salty at all. Probably very limited MSG. 

All the soon tofu is 8.85 plus tax, which works out to $10 even. A great soup and decently healthy.  Verdict: I will be back."}
{"text":"Food tastes good. similar to the other place at finch and yonge. Price sounds fair. Closer to subway station."}
{"text":"A friend told me this was the best place for Tofu soup. He was the one who introduce me to Ka Chi for PBS :-) Personally I am not a big fan of Tofu. Then again I eat alot of crap and don't have anything I really die for :-) Anyway, Back to Buk Chang. The place is small and crowded. Not to be sexist. The crowd was mostly girls. Gee Tofu and Girls goes hand in hand eh!. I order I believe the chicken soup and my friend ordered some weird stuff. I am not as brave as him. The rice came in some mud bowl. Pretty cool. They even scoop it out for you and the server pour water into the mud bowl. I was told to the burn rice in the bowl is one of the best part of the meal. LOL I sound like some redneck from a farm now. Anyway, back to the food. I must say it was not bad. Would I go bad again? May be. But I won't drive all the way to that part of town to eat tofu soup. Would I recommend this joint to anyone. Sure if you are on a Diet :-) May be you can order two portion. Small bowl of soup doesn't do it for me. Its just a starter. Unless you plan to hit Macdonald after lol."}
{"text":"I just love the only single item that I always have here. Number 7 on the menu (i obviously don't remember the name). But I dream about this food. Super value for money. Great food. Great people. Nothing more to say honestly. Except for that if the place was nicer physically, it would have 5 stars for sure!!"}
{"text":"My friend ordered Song Tofu and it was watery and not much in her bowl... My bibimbap was ok but we won't go back again"}
{"text":"Average place. Service is good. However, I didn't like it as there was some kinda of smell in the fish. At least not gelled well with my taste buds."}
{"text":"Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu is a great place for authentic Soon Tofu. Soon Tofu was a nice change from the typical Galbi and Korean Barbecue I am used to having a lot.

The interior of the restaurant is very casual as the design is very simple , but very welcoming.  The place was packed full of customers.

The waiters were very pleasant as they were very helpful in helping me and my friend make a selection, as it was our first time trying Soon Tofu. They were very descriptive in terms of describing the various levels of spiciness we could choose from.  The menu was not that big as this place only serves Soon Tofu. 

I chose to try the Combination Soon Tofu (Shrimp, Mussels, Beef) , while my friend decided to try the Dumpling Soon Tofu. We were not disappointed. The price was very reasonable for the quantity of soup, rice, and banchan we received. The soup had a lot flavor inside with the right amount of spice inside the broth. The rice was a nice complement to enjoy with the soup.  The banchan was very enjoyable to have with our main course. 

I was very happy to pay the price for the meal in its quality, alongside with the quality service we received. I definitely will be returning to this place soon, especially, during the cold winter days."}
{"text":"Not a good place to go if you are a vegetarian.  Only one vegetarian dish (a soup) and as it was quite hot outside I did not want soup.  Ordered a dish and had them hold the meat, but it was awfully bland.  The meat eaters seemed happy enough, however."}
{"text":"The food and price overall is amazing, but the parking and location was a bit bothering, it was a rainy day too so u had to park behind the building or to the side and walk a bit. The service was pretty good, there was no trouble, I forgot my jacket in the end and one of the workers came out to give it which I was grateful for so thanks to that :)"}
{"text":"You get a really good amount of food for the price you pay! The menu is very simple, but I think that's part of its charm. We ordered the dumpling soon tofu and bulgogi soup. Both were excellent! I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more items off the menu."}
{"text":"One word: YUM. 

I had the bulgolgi combo. As per usual :) it's one thing that I always get.

The bulgolgi is seasoned very well. So flavourful and soft. It sorta just melts in your mouth? 

What I get is more of a bulgolgi and clear noodle soup. So you have to fish things out of the really, really hot soup. I burn my tongue every time! But it's worth it.

The combo also comes with purple rice, which works well with the food.

The banchan is delicious, too. Kimchi on point. Really delicious pickled radish. Good beans. 

The service is good as well. They're very nice and accommodating when you want more water or tea."}
{"text":"4.5 stars out of 5

We've been here various times and it's usually packed during dinner.  They have a small menu but what they do (tofu soup) they do amazing.  We usually go with the dumpling tofu soup.  I only deducted 0.5 because the soup is sometimes on the salty side and the eggs they give you are extra tiny!"}
{"text":"I love Buk Chang Dong's soon tofu. Been to three or four of their locations, and all of them are consistently good. This one is no different.

Pipping hot soon tofu dishes in about eight flavours/varieties. It's quite cheap.

With their purple rice and several side dishes, it is definitely a great deal. Pretty filling. And really just plain deliciousness."}
{"text":"The rice was over cooked. The food was bland. And worst of all my friend and I both went home and sat on toilets for the next few hours. Man oh man my tummy had a circus going on after. Not cool. Great service though."}
{"text":"Food was good had number 8 ... Fresh and hot I would come back again but I'm more of an owl of Minerva fan ;)"}
{"text":"For $8, you get your selected type of soon tofu along with purple rice and very decent portioned kimchee/side dishes.

Servers here were very efficient and nice. We went at a later time right before they were about to close and there were no problems.

I love soon tofu and this place is deserves to have it in its name.

Only downside I can think of the lack of other dishes. Dont remember seeing gamjatang etc on the menu, but the bf tried their kalbi beef and he liked it."}
{"text":"They say you will always remember your first time, it's awkward, you have no clue what you are doing, and it never quite lasts as long as you hope, but as soon as you finish you can't wait to do it again. I'm talking about my first time eating soon tofu of course.  As has been well documented my heart belongs to gamjatang (pork bone soup) but I recently cheated and I loved it! 

I came to Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu on a Saturday night and the place was packed. Nonetheless my friend and I were seated promptly. The menu consists of a few varieties of soon tofu as well as a couple of other Korean dishes, all in all about 10 dishes on offer. I opted for the kimchi soon tofu with beef and pork, regular spicy. I was in heaven after one bite. The tofu in the soup was unbelievable, velvety texture and mild flavour soaked up the broth very well. The broth had a great spicy kick with some depth added by the veggies in it. There was not much meat in the soup but I really didn't care because the mound of tofu in it was so good. The soup was accompanied by purple rice served out of a sizzling stone pot, I love purple rice! I also had a bit of my friend's seafood soon tofu which was also delicious, served with shrimp (head on) and mussels (they were out of oysters on this night). The broth was so good; it basically tasted like the ocean. As soon as I finished my bowl I was immediately craving another one. 

We also got 4 banchans with our meals which were all pretty tasty. I especially liked the bean sprouts and pickled radish. I also tried a Hite (Korean beer) which was light and accompanied my spicy soup perfectly. I found the service to be spotty on this night and it was difficult to flag down a waiter at times. However our food was brought out pretty quickly. Everything on the menu is under $10 and the beer was $4 so this is definitely a great option for a really good, cheap meal. I will be back to try the extra spicy broth! 

Sorry gamjatang, you and I had a good thing for a while but my heart belongs to soon tofu now."}
{"text":"It was my first time here at Buk Chang Soon Tofu. It was a first for me to eat a kimchi tofu dish, too. I ordered the been, pork, kimchi soup, number #3. It came with purple rice in stone pot, the condiments like cabbage kimchi, bean sprouts, radish, and some beans. One cup of hot tea came with the meal, of course. Came out to an even $9. 

I didn't even know where to eat the dish (i.e., eat inside the rice bowl or the kimchi soup bowl). I told the server about my silly lack of experience, and she chuckled but helped me at the same time. She actually cracked the egg for me and stirred it into the soup. It was still bubbling hot when the egg got added to the mix. Yummy! The sound is so much better than \"snap  crackle pop\" from you-know- what cereal. 

I never cared about the presentation of the meal, when there's no need for it. It was kimchi pot, and that's what it looked like. I always thought that these dishes were spicy, well, from the kdrama, that's what I thought. I read that some dishes can be greasy, but mine was not so. I will review again when the opportunity comes. 

The decor is just right. Wooden chairs, utensils in wooden boxes, and I have no complaints. I didn't use the washroom, so I cannot comment on that. I can say that sitting the closest to it, I did not have any qualms and got a whiff of anything bad."}
{"text":"I love variety and selection in a restaurant's menu, so coming to BCDST put me in a bit of a pickle.  Like any good Korean restaurant, there's variety galore when you factor in the fact that you get banchan (side dishes) with everything you order, but their list of mains are all of 9, count 'em, 9 choices, and of those 9, 5 are variations on one item (the Soon Tofu soup) - Bibimbap, Bulgogi Soup, and Broiled Beef rounding out the rest.  Kind of makes you (or at least me) feeling food-cornered - I mean, what's one to do if the 3-4 things on offer don't tickle your fancy?

I realized how irrational that was, of course, considering diners pretty much come here expressly for their one signature dish.

And I'm glad to report that that one dish was worth the (admittedly easy) trek up to Koreatown.  The soup was incredible, perfectly seasoned (I got a medium heat level), and filled with all sorts of deliciousness (I had the one with dumplings and beef).  The silky quality of the uncurdled tofu, the rolling boil of the soup as it comes to your table, the stoneware to keep everything hot enough to last the whole meal, it's an example of why food traditions are worth saving and sharing.

The service was also refined to an art, with the very friendly waitstaff bringing everything promptly, reacting to any and every request quickly and efficiently.  They even scoop your rice out into a bowl for you and fill the stone bowl it was cooked in with water (something you're expected to do in other places).

The banchan were simple, but classic and more-than-competently prepared:  kimchi, pickled radish, nato, and beansprouts.

Any criticisms are minor - 1)  it would have been nice to get something to put your cracked eggshell into once you were done (though I understand the challenge of adding yet another dish to the already-crowded table), and 2) the beef in the soup was not particularly tender, but after having had Soon Tofu soup in multiple restaurants, I'm coming to the realization that this is likely due to the cut of beef rather than the preparation.  I'm just going to switch to veggie or seafood next time.

And, as others have stated ad nauseum, the price for everything is incredible.  With tax and tip, my feast came to $11.

TIP:  Walk four doors eastward to PAT Mart for all your Korean grocery needs."}

Neither pro nor con

It's a good place for quick soon tofu but I would have moved if they had Pork bone soup

Edit: moved = loved"}
{"text":"Delicious food and amazing customer service. I had a shellfish allergy and my server as well as the owner ensured they understood my allergy despite not being fully fluent in english. They were very thoughtful and thorough. Service was fabulous!

We couldnt have asked for a better experience. Really touched by their thoughtfulness and attention."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of tofu soup but fall in love with this place after trying their bibimbab, bulgogi soup and broiled beef! My mom and I ordered the two beef dishes every time we are here. They definitely put more beef and veggies than other Korean restaurant in Finch/Yonge. Worth the waiting!"}
{"text":"I'm a little bit disappointed with the Yonge and Finch location. First the menu are missing dishes at this location. #8 on the menu was the beef was extremely sweet. The side dish is minimal. My friend stone pot was not used on his Bib Bim Bap. Service was good."}
{"text":"Even before we finished dinner I decided to write a full five star review for this place. It's a really nice little corner with fantastic food. I must say this is the most authentic Korean food I've had in the greater Toronto area in a very very long time. The dishes come with multiple levels of spiciness to cater to your own taste. And the regular spicy is just spicy enough for me. 
My daughter loved the purple rice,  fermented beans and bean sprouts as well. She's a toddler."}
{"text":"I've been craving for some soon tofu for a week and decided to come here for dinner on a Sunday night at about 6pm. As soon as arriving there were three  groups waiting in front of me but the wait time wasn't bad at all, we waited 10mins max. 

The menu here is pretty simple and limited, which is good because I can be indecisive sometimes. I ordered the kimchi soon tofu while my partner ordered bulgogi with rice. The banchan came out first shortly after we ordered. They tasted fine but nothing special. 
Our meals came out pretty quick, about 5-7 minutes after we ordered. The presentation was pretty neat, especially with the purple rice in the stone pot. Our server also scooped rice into bowls for us and proceeded to pour some water into the stone pots. 

I really enjoyed the soon tofu. The kimchi definitely enhanced the flavour of the stew. There was a good amount of tofu and kimchi but very little pieces of beef and pork. My partners bulgogi tasted good but nothing special... I think it would be very hard to mess up bulgogi. 

Overall I like that this place is no frills and simple. The food tastes great and is quick. The entire time we were there, there was always a line up but people seem to be seated within 10 minutes of arriving. 

One more thing, I find the portion here to be on the smaller side. It would be better to come here for lunch than dinner."}
{"text":"ordered seafood tofu mixed hotpot. mostly tofu with 2 tiny shrimps, 1 mussel and 1 finger nails size oyster.....complained to the server, and she bought back the pot to the kitchen; but later she bought back the same pot with added one tiny piece of oyster. definitely not worth the money. won't recommend and go back again. 
this place won't last long for such business"}
{"text":"Its my second time being there. The wait was about 10 mins, every table was full, and most of the guests were of Korean descent. That's how one can make out its good, when the same descent eats there. I loved the soups, and the condiments that came with it. A must go."}
{"text":"Owner here is so f-ed up she only hires people who stay in Canada as a tourist (no legit working visa) and treated them like shit. Sometimes you will notice rude servers because they just got scolded by the owner right before they serve you. The food is good but the owner really needs to change her attitude."}
{"text":"So far, the best non-BBQ Korean food I've had in the city.  I don't hesitate in recommending it.

My partner and I live in San Francisco and so are no strangers to (pretty good) Korean food, not easily impressed, and had fairly low expectations for even such a well reviewed place.

Nevertheless, we were both delighted with this place.

They offer a small menu of tofu stews and they are all perfectly executed, including the all-important silky tofu.  You choose the spice level on a gradient running from \"Very spicy\" to \"White,\" implying, perhaps correctly, that white = bland :)  Unlike many places, you actually get the spiciness level you asked for, which, along with the speed at which they deliver it, further confirms how fresh and a la minute their stuff is.  Yum!

Since tofu is the star of tofu stew, even the meat-themed dishes are pleasantly light.  We augmented it with a share-plate of grilled beef.  Add a Hite or OB beer, and some pretty good panchan (small dishes of kim chi, sesame bean sprouts, etc.) and it makes for a great meal at just under $15 a person with tax and tip.  Service is quick, courteous, and unobtrusive - just the way I like it!

Ambiance?  If you've been around you should know there are only *two* varieties to be found in Toronto's Koreatown restaurants:

(1) The Korean equivalent of Swiss Chalet decor; or
(2) None.

This was (2), which suits me just fine, because I prefer it to (1), and as I must emphasize, there are only *two* choices.  That is all.

If I still lived in Toronto, this is without a doubt where I'd go to satisfy my frequent K-food cravings without resorting to one of the ubiquitous and mostly ho-hum Korean BBQ joints around the city.  I'm impressed with restaurants that focus their energies on doing a few dishes really, really well, and this place definitely fits the bill."}
{"text":"It was okay. My mom had ordered the bulgogi tang, and it was way too sweet. Literally, sweetened meat soup. The soon tofu was okay, but honestly, I prefer Tofu Village down the road."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place previously so I went in with an expectation that it would be good.   Not surprising,  the restaurant was very busy on a Friday evening.   The space was fairly small,  yet cozy.  

Dish -  I ordered the dumpling tofu soup which was delicious.  I played it safe and ordered the mild soup base but it probably tastes better with a bit of spiciness.  Disappointed with the selection of side dishes. 
Price -  Reasonable,  definitely on the cheaper side (around $10). 

All in all,  I had an enjoyable first experience and will consider trying again."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out this place because its one of the top rated Korean restaurants in Toronto and was featured on Blogto. I got the Soon Dubu and it was OK. Nothing special. The seafood almost tasted too fishy and the broth was ok.

Side dishes were ok, kimchi didn't taste that fermented. But the pickled radishes are good. 

It's cool how their rice comes in a stone bowl but i wish they would just keep it in the stone bowl rather than scooping it out for you.

Probably won't ever come back as there are plenty of other Korean restaurants in Ktown that taste better."}
{"text":"My first time having Korean, I had the Bibimbap.  It was amazing!  I sooo want some more right now!!

The place was packed, so I'm assuming it is a popular place. The service was amazingly fast and the servers were super friendly. I will update my review after I return next week.

Quick, Cheap, Excellent quality."}
{"text":"Im not a huge fan of Korean Food but, it was delicious, and I continually come back when I have a craving for the Soup!"}
{"text":"I'm a hugeeee fan and I mean a HUGEEEEE fan of tofu soup because it's like the GREATEST THING EVER! (Alright I'm exaggerating a bit but how can you go wrong with tofu, beef and tasty hot soup??). 

I've been here maybe 5-6 times over the years and have to say it's always been very enjoyable upon every visit. Occasionally I'll also get the kalbi with rice (which by the way is also a VERY excellent choice!). 

The menu is kept simple and you're not bombarded by millions of different options of meals to order from. 

The only downside I see from this place is the seating (can be very cramped) and that there are consistent lineups at this place during busy hours (sometimes you'll have to wait outside which isn't ideal in the extreme hot/cold).

Overall, an excellent place to stop by when you're up in K-Town!"}
{"text":"Lets start with the good in this restaurant. 
The prices are very fair. They serve your food in a very fancy stone pot( that they cooked in a normal rice cooker then placed on the hot stone. )
And that's it. 

Eek methinks not for this place
The limited variety of food. Only 9 things on the menu. One thing I can eat as a vegetarian. 

Quality of food- everything is okay. I personally think people come in solely for the fascination of the hot stone. 

Service- I come here often enough to really dislike the service. They really don't care about you. They rush me all the time. One time I saw them rushing a pregnant lady to leave. That's just wrong. And when they rush me, it would be korean flying from one wall to another. Then passed on in English back to me. 
 
Yeah, this is not the place for me. I only come here out of convenience and a craving for hot soup that tastes whatever."}
{"text":"The quantity is good and price is better lolll 
The taste of food is awesome!! Really love the rice they have!"}
{"text":"Good bowl of hot soup!!! Perfect for winter time in Toronto ... get super sweaty and warm in there with my spicy soup!

I love the purple rice (seems healthy) to go with my soup! usually i get the dumpling or seafood soup! both delicious!
I like that they do give the water+hardened rice at the end if the meal. Even though I'm so full-- i still end up eating some of the extra rice as well!"}
{"text":"Inside the door, I looked for someone but the young Men was occupied with his task at the counter so I sat myself in the corner with seats that remind me of Tango Palace Coffee.  Unexpected but at the moment those are the most comfy seats of any Soon Tofu place I've been.  Fyi, I haven't been to too many.  Notice the Air Conditioner at the doorway that is constantly at 20 degrees celsius.

The young male staff serving me was friendly and had a level of cuteness for \"THOSE\" that are curious.  That's probably the trend, instead of Men in Uniform it'll be Men in Aprons.  

Combination Soon Tofu + Dolsotbab(Beef, Shrimp, Mussel, $7.08) had a great broth as the base and what else took it over and above Tofu Village was that the Beef was not sniff-able sized but were edible bites and more pieces than Tofu Village.  The Purple Rice was nice and even had a single Green Pea to bring out the color contrast as a finishing touch.

On my own, I was given 4 Banchans and as I finished the Soon Tofu and Purple Rice, i still had the Banchans and Rice Porridge left over.  Leaving the water behind I dug out the wet Purple Rice and added the Banchans to come up with the \"Banchan Bibimbap Porridge\" as a closing course."}
{"text":"This is one of the Korean restaurants I visit most because of the decent, filling food for a great price. There's been a couple of times I couldn't finish everything, and believe me when I eat, I eat a lot usually. Everything is priced so that after taxes its a flat dollar amount (i.e $8 or 9 after tax).  I think there's less than 12 items on the menu. 
Its always busy here and I've usually had to wait at least 5 minutes, more if its the dinner rush. Service is usually pretty good when I visit. The last time however, the server forgot our drink order......Other than that I've been pretty happy with this place."}
{"text":"As a Korean who grew up eating at this place when I was a teenager, I came back to try it again. The place has completely become a place for for NON-Koreans, as a matter of fact on a weekend lunch I didn't see one other table of Koreans. 

The side dishes which come out first are complete disasters - they look Korean but they are not korean, the end. The kimchi is extremely sweet (red in color but so salty and sweet) and the radish is also drenched in sugar you could feel the sugar grains. If the owner and the workers don't eat their own food for lunch what does that say about this place? 

I'm quite sad to know that there are a lot of Torontonians who believe that this is what Korean tastes like."}
{"text":"this stuff is addictive..
simple menu, u just pick either the soup or the meat, or bibimbop...
and go from there.. but i tell u, whatever u choose u won't regret..
i had bibimbop and soft tofu soup with the seafood.. was fantastic.. i was so full but had to finish everything.. was that good..
usually packed so def recommend going off peak time.."}
{"text":"better than Soer ak san, for both bibimbap, bulgogi and soon du bu.

better taste, environment, depth of the flavor..

as korean born foodie, i def will be coming back here before seor ak san.."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, we decided to go to this Korean restaurant. The food was okay, I ordered the combo #9, once the first layer of meat was gone, I was in for a surprise, the amount of oil soaked the rest of my dish. The kimchi was good, so that's all I really wanted to eat. However, the friendly staff??? I know as an Asian, good service is the least of my problems when eating out but these ladies that run the restaurant... one seems like the owner and was extremely rude to our whole table from the start. We went around closing time(1 hour before close), so we just brushed it off because of that fact and attitude they were giving us. The first problem was when they came to take our order- I said, we're just waiting on one more before we order. Then,  the quick ok and eye roll *attitude* the second problem- cold watery tea, we asked for a new batch and they replied back with \"it's closing time, we aren't going to make anymore\" okay, I agree it would be a waste to make a whole batch but there's so many other options they can work towards to accommodate. Now, the third problem the side dishes. I know places that will replenish the side dishes for the table, especially when we order a lot. We ordered 4 \"combos\" that means we're entitled to 4 rounds. However, when we asked for our third one, she ignored us clearly heard us but she decided to do closing duties first as her priority and 5 minutes later- we got our request, she switched the regular sizes to the smaller side dish that holds the beans for our side dishes (look at the picture menu) At this point, we know they just want us to get out. However for a table of 4, 2 1/2 replenishes didn't suffice, so we asked for more from a young server (very nice, reason for 1 star) and the owner lady comes and says \"no you're not allowed, you had enough were going to charge you!\" it's a restaurant, we're not beggars we're customers expecting service. I felt so bad for the young server, he just stood there awkwardly as she is yelling at us and him for accommodating our table.  After she walked away, he went back to the kitchen and gave us the side dishes. Surprise, he gets scolded. I'm really reliant on yelp for great restaurants, this one is the only one that was terrible. Maybe because of the cheap prices, and basic 10 items, hard to mess up on orders- however there is many other options out there that are willing to accommodate and service you."}
{"text":"The place is great as they have a main focus on Soon Tofu, the menu is small and concise with a few different types of soon tofus, bibimbap, and bbq beef dishes. I always like it when restaurants have a small menu but does them exceptionally well.

My girlfriend will always get soon tofu 95% of time when we visit a Korean restaurant and she said this was the best Soon Tofu she's had (she had extra spicy). 

The service was great, table space might be a little crowded for a party of two, but don't be shy to ask for a bigger space!

The only thing that stopped me from giving this a 5 star is because I am not particularly into soon tofu."}
{"text":"The hierarchy of spice according to Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu:

Extra Spicy
Regular Spicy
Medium
Mild
White* (see photo http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/nHFJtud7jWZhM9dHQ1eIRA?select=rAYMQgidrDst-_tqrHJ9HA)

I decided to go one notch above the white man's spice level in order to really taste the broth, since it is my belief that a lot can be disguised by spice.

Anyway, this place is NO JOKE!!!  Tasty, filling, and ball-bustingly cheap!  You get a nice variety of kim chi, the soup, a huge portion of rice, and \"after rice\".  Legend has it, the \"after rice\" serves a digestive purpose.  To me, it tasted like they poured hot water in a dolsa bowl.  Sort of like a light tasteless (but toasty) congee.  I am going to be a regular here for sure.

Minus one star for the server boot-f*cking my camera."}
{"text":"It was my first time to come here. It's A nice, affordable ,tasty Korean restaurant. It's prefect to be a fast food. Can come here have a lunch or dinner as well."}
{"text":"It's not the worst, but not good enough for me to go back with all the other better options in Toronto.

I tried the classic Soondubu Jjigae, and it was spicy but otherwise flavorless. I got to taste a bit of the Ttukbaegi Bulgogi and it was waaaaay too sweet (very Westernized flavor).

Side dishes were good at least, the classic Gamja Jorim and Kimchi.

Service was meh, it wasn't particularly friendly in any way, although not hostile."}
{"text":"One of the best tofu hot pot spots in Toronto.  I tried to make reservations but unfortunately they don't take them.  Usually it is extremely busy especially during dinner time, but today I didn't have to wait.

We ordered the kimchi tofu hot pot and the bbq bulgogi as per my usual order.  They brought out the side dishes (beans, sprouts, kimchi and radish).  Our entrees were served shortly after.  They bring out the boiling hot pots and sizzling beef plate along with the stone pots of rice.

The kimchi tofu was awesome with the mix of beef, pork and kimchi and I got it regular spicy which had just enough kick.  I love putting the egg in and watching it cook in the hot pot and I just scoop the rice right in and enjoy.  Today the taste was just right and very flavourful and on a cold day it really does hit the spot.

The beef was good as usual marinated to perfection as my little ones gobbled it up quickly.  The best extra is the stone pots of rice and after they pour in the water it's just delicious.  I leave feeling happy and very very full.  Always a great meal to have when it's cold or if you feel under the weather.  Overall, it's great food and fast service."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from blogTO list of Toronto's best Korean restaurants. Apparently, there are two locations: this one and another one at Yonge Street. The menu here is very simple and you only have nine dishes to choose from. Prices are very affordable and it's $8.95+ CAD for a dish. BTW, the menu photos on Yelp are outdated.

I was satisfied with my seafood tofu soup. It was delicious and filling. The purple rice was cooked perfectly and not mushy. They served us four side dishes: pickled radish, soybeans (my fav), bean sprouts, and kimchi.

Overall, good food for it's value. Give this place a try. Your stomach will be full and happy."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I love their spicy bulgogi, and I have tried their spicy soup as well. I love their soup, but when it is hot and spicy is very hard for me to eat, so i have to wait until it is warmer to enjoy it. This place can get pretty busy."}
{"text":"**** 3.5 stars
I was visiting Toronto for the weekend from Washington DC. Of course being myself I wanted to check out KoreaTown and get some korean food. My boyfriends cousin said this place was bomb so we decided to try it out. We have soondubu in DC but I love it so I decided to try it out. We came here around 7pm on a Tuesday night and it was packed. The food was amazing. Unlike back home the tofu is so much softer and the spice level was spicy. I got the combination tofu with the spicest level. I also love how they have the purple rice because thats my favorite type of korean rice! For 9 bucks this is such a steal compared to the other korean food in toronto. Maybe im being bias because VA has such cheap korean food. The only reason why I gave it 3.5 is because the service. It was really hard to grab the attention of the servers. I wasnt too annoyed because they were busy but they kept forgetting to refill when I asked mulitple times. Overall if you craving soondubu I would totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place. Ordered the Combination Soon Tofu (Beef, shrimp, mussels) with medium spicy. The broth was great and the tofu was just enough this time (use to be overflowing). Asked for refill for the side dish (kimchi, pickled radish, bean sprout and some korean seed that I don't know what it's called). The korean multigrain rice was sweet. By the way, if you ever wonder why the waiter pour water in the rice stone after transferring the rice in the bowl, here's the reason: like most non-korean people, we would think that they pour the water to easily clean the stone, but in fact, you should be eating it. It's actually porridge/congee and it taste really sweet. A Korean friend taught me how to eat that and apparently Korean people don't waste food, so they eat everything on the table."}
{"text":"Still love this little restaurant.  You get the little appetizer plates first with the kimchi, sprouts, etc.   I again ordered kimchi soon tofu and got a big bowl of purple rice (which is apparently very healthy for you), soon tofu in a clay pot and a quail egg.  All of our tofu pots were tasty in their different ways (the vegetable tofu soup tasted like spicy vegetable broth, the soup for the combination tofu tasted like spicy seafood, and the kimchi soon tofu tasted well like kimchi). The tofu is super silky and delicious.  

As a word of caution, you are asked what level of spiciness you would like, and when my dad ordered non-spicy, it was still somewhat spicy.   The broth base clearly starts off with a certain level of spiciness, so non spicy just means less spicy.  I was happy with my medium spicy. 

The service is efficient and polite but not overly friendly and it is sometimes hard to understand them.  Also, the combination tofu is described as having beef, shrimp and mussel (sic) and as we joked, they were very accurate in their description.  There really was one mussel and one shrimp!  

Anyhow, love coming here and think the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Never has spicy comfort food felt so good until I ate here.

Literally, the food is magical! It's so simple and feels so homemade, but it's absolutely delicious! SO very comforting. The menu is relatively simple, it's pretty much just one page and features their main dish - the Soon Tofu. 

While I had the dumpling one before in mild, I think I prefer the combination one since it has a little bit of everything. Tip: NEVER get white, you HAVE to get mild or spicier. The spice gives the broth an extra kick that really lifts everything and comforts you, without the spice it's really boring and bland! 

They give you an egg with every Soon Tofu excluding the soybean one, make sure you drop it in while the broth is piping hot to perfectly poach it! I like to break the poached egg on my rice rather in the broth since I personally adore the yolk by itself. The tofu is really good here of course, it's silky smooth and drool worthy. I get incredibly sleepy off the soon tofu because it is so good and comforting, definitely a place to frequently revisit!

The interior is old, kind of reminds me of an asian food court. But, the food makes up greatly for it and it's a friendly atmosphere!

I'm already awaiting my next visit 8D!"}
{"text":"The soon tofu here is very authentic and the hot stone rice is absolutely delicious. The soup has the right amount of spice, and if you want it milder or spicier, you can always ask the waiter to adjust your order. The service here is also great; one of the best Korean spots in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Never had bibimbap before, but it's quite delicious! Packed with flavour, even when I ate the leftovers cold the next day. I got #7, hot stone pot, it's quite a deep dish-- lots of rice! Comes with a few side dishes of miso soup, egg, kimchi, bean sprouts, beans, chilli sauce, pickled vegs.

The dumplings from #4 was so flavourful! Plentiful filling and very thin wrapper.

The waiters are very kind and considerate, they present the food politely .

Decent food!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb! So good! I've been coming here for the last 2 years, and I always leave happy! I get the Kim Chi Soon Tofu every time."}
{"text":"Flavorful soup, silky tofu, seafood, perfectly cooked rice, freshly cracked eggs half cooked in the soup, plus the water soaking the flavor of burned rice bottom on the stone bowl, it's a perfect combination of flavors and texture. A very hearty and comforting meal, at a great price as well. This is a place that I keep going back! Definitely highly recommended."}
{"text":"It's always good for sure. The soup is extremely fantastic. It's good to try. However, it always need to wait for a long time. btw, the side dishes are good."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch and ordered the seafood pancake ($13.27) and the Pork Bone Soup ($11.51). The seafood pancake was nice and crisp and not greasy. However, for the price, they give very little seafood. The pork bone soup is similar in quality to other places but pricier. The only nice thing is that they serve purple rice in a hot bowl. The appetizer selection is also quite limited and not as great as other places. 

Servers are very friendly, but once you've ordered and got your food, they never come back. I had an empty tea cup which they never came to refill.

Overall, the food is decent, so good place to come for a quick lunch. But if I have more time, I would much rather go to Cho Sun Ok or Koryo."}
{"text":"My favourite for Soon Tofu. I love their food and options to choose spicy level. Make sure you come early to avoid line ups.

So good & great price!"}
{"text":"FOOD WAS DELICIOUS! I WOULD DEFINITELY GO BACK!!!!

Came to this place after reading the reviews on here.
I ordered the Seafood Soon, extra spicy. My friends ordered bulgulgi and bibimbop (mehh sorry if I misspelled). 
SEAFOOD SOON was delectable!!! It was awesomely extra spicy, but it was still flavorful. Rice was delicious and I love how they serve it in the clay pot so you could eat the crispy rice afterwards. Yum!
BULGULGI was also delectable!!! A lot of flavor.
BIBIMBOP was a little disappointing. We all thought it was a little bland. It wasn't spicy.

SERVICE was ok. A little slow inattentive because they were really busy.

PRICES was very affordable. One meal is easily $10 with tip. 

lol my friend though was getting stared at by the Korean guy next to us. It was funny at first, but then when we left and walked around, we saw him for a good couple blocks. It was a bit creepy lol."}
{"text":"As my last review pointed out, soon tofu is not my favorite thing. As a result, when I found out we were coming, I wasn't particularly excited. I mean, this restaurant doesn't serve much other than their house specialty. With so many other Korean restaurants in the area, can you really blame me? Oh well. I have found a way to cope with my having to come to this restaurant, and I think the next time I come (should I ever come again), I won't mind so much.

I had the bulgogi soup. I'm not quite sure whether that's what it's called on the menu or not, but that's pretty much what it is. It's hot pot beef, carrot and onion shreds, and sweet potato noodles cooked in a sweetened soy-ish sauce. It comes in a hot stone pot, and it's served with rice. Buk Chang Dong was quite generous with the beef portion in the soup, and it was very tasty. It's a few dollars more than the soon tofu dishes, but I don't mind shelling out the money. My dad and I shared one order of this, and I was quite full after. My dad went to play badminton, but he had half a bowl of rice too. We still had some leftovers to pack. Do note that this dish, unlike the soon tofu's, doesn't come with an egg. I took my aunt's and cracked it into our broth. Yum.

Oh. One more thing. Grandpa got the soybean soup. It too doesn't come with an egg.

Funny moment of the night. My cousin asked why the eggs were so small. Yes, they were chicken eggs. The reason? Presumably because small eggs are cheaper than larger eggs. 

Cheers to you, Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu. I don't love you, but I don't dislike you as much anymore. Good job. Please add some new menu items that don't involve soon tofu. Thanks."}
{"text":"Very authentic Korean food. I loved that there were only a few options on the menu. This keeps things quick and simple (or if you're indecisive like me, the limited options makes it even more difficult to choose because they all seem so good). The food was as expected. I felt the portion of rice was a bit too large, and despite always trying not to waste food, I ended up leaving about half the rice uneaten. One small 'gripe', if you will, is that the prawns (or shrimps, depending on where you're from) were not peeled, i.e. the shell was left on, and furthermore, seemed perhaps not thoroughly cleaned, as there was a clump of what looked like little eggs attached to it, which was disgusting enough to me to discard the prawn itself. 

All in all, super tasty and unlimited kimchi in true Korean fashion gives this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"If you like korean tofu pot, this is a great place to go. I had never tried it before coming here, so I admittedly don't know how authentic it is, but it sure is delicious. So good that I've come almost every month for the past couple of years. The service is also pretty good for a place with such low prices."}
{"text":"I don't particularly like Korean food but this is probably my favorite of the bunch.

4 stars for super cheap food, decent seating and steaming hot tofu lava stone pot.

This place is always busy but I find service always courteous.

My only gripe is the beef tofu stew never has much protein, you literally only get 1 oz I think."}
{"text":"Cheap, large portions, open late, and tasty! 

I'm no expert on Korean food but I like intense flavors and contrasts of texture, I've eaten bibimbap at 3 or 4 other restaurants in my time, and this place was some of the best. Their Tofu Bibimbap was awesome. the hot pot was so hot it sizzled nearly all of the rice to have a nice crispy crust. there were plenty of small dishes to go with it (more than I have been served elsewhere), and it all tasted fresh and good.

Can't wait to try the seafood and the other tofu stuff (being pescetarian I'll leave the meat reviews to others). Conveniently located too, and everyone was very smiley and efficient, but they didn't rush me either (though I was eating alone)."}
{"text":"Situated in a little \"hallway area\" of this large strip mall just south of 16 on Bayview with a Chinese supermarket.   FREE PARKING!  Unlikely the chaos you have at their other location at Yonge and Finch.   

We ordered the Combination Soon Tofu (one spicy-it was spicy and one mild-it was mild...funny comment but in many places this means nothing.

The fried dumpling was really good and not overly oily.

I enjoyed the stir fried pork but I would have really wanted a hot stone bibimbap;  However it only came in beef which I (and many people don't eat).  They should consider allowing customers, at the very least substitute the beef with pork.

Service was polite and relatively quick.  The servers were running around since they were very busy but they were always polite.

So glad we have a good Korean option in  Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch after discovering My Sushi was 14 dollars for lunch, and we were like screw that (and then we went back there for dinner) but thats another story.

The menu was small, and precise. Only 8 items.

I got the Dumpling Soon Tofu to lose my soon tofu-ginity.

I thought it was pretty good. The soup was really flavourful and lots and lots of tofu. But only two (amazingly delicious) dumplings.

The banchan were awesome. There was only 4. The daikon was spiced and yummy. The Bean Sprouts were phenom. And I usually hate bean sprouts. And the kimchi was kimchi-licous.

The servers were really nice. The came by to check and see how our food was. When has that ever happened at a Korean Resto???

4 stars because of service.

I'm not a big fan of soon tofu, I'd rather have PBS. But it was really good for what it was."}
{"text":"It is really good price to fill you up when you are tired and want some hot soup. The dish is simple : rice and tofu soup. I tried to other kinds on every different time but it just tastes so same. Spicy level was okay with me. I got afraid about Korea spicy level but they were not that spicy for medium level. But their service is just meh...the lady at the counter doesn't say anything back to me and my friends when I pay my bill at the counter and said thank you. I felt bit awkward when that lady totally ignored me but just counting the money I just gave her. And servers seems like they are not good at English. They were okay when we just ordered food, but got into confusing  when my friend asked for what ingredient is inside the soup. Overall, I will go back to this place when I feel cold and hungry in this area but not a place for having a pleasant dinner time with your friend."}
{"text":"My staple korean place for being a vegetarian the place's small menu doesn't bother me much. This is essentially a stone pot place which serves purple rice with some kind of soups that you could decide to add an egg to. They have around 9 options to choose from and the meal comes with 4 delicious side dishes. 

The place is incredibly cheap and offers really quick service."}
{"text":"Just tried it tonight!

I went with my friend after we finished lecture today, and were craving some hot food. I decided on this place from recommendations, and yay they were right!
It's a rather small place, but there's enough room for your food, without being too squished. 
I was surprised at the small menu! I've only heard of a few dishes on it, but decided to try the dumping soon tofu soup, and my friend got the bibambap. 
The waiter was a bit rushed, but he wasn't rude- I'd say he was quite efficient in doing his job. He even informed us of the free parking at the back for next time.
The sidedishes and main meal came super quick, and it was really good! It was JUST enough food- full, but not stuffed. It left me feeling warm inside, which is a plus, considering I'm quite sick right now.

Overall, not bad! Would come back if I was in the area already."}
{"text":"Visited this branch of the soon tofu FRANCHISE of Toronto. Same menu, set up and prices. We were the first ones in for brunch?!?!? At 11am... not sure that qualifies as brunch.  

The service was great and always love exchanging Korean phrases when I can.

Ordered the veggie variation of soon tofu since it was still early but then topped it off with an order of bulgogi soup with the glass noodles. The sweetness reminded me of the way it tastes on SK. 

The ingredients were plentiful as always and the service was not the most friendly but definitely not rude and efficient!

Love the seafood flavor of the spicy broth and all the side dishes. The watery crispy rice at the end is always a great way to end a spicy meal. 

Nothing different stands out about this location but it's as good as the other ones ;)"}
{"text":"Is a small restaurant in a small plaza north of dundas in hwy 10. About a dozen tables and 9 food items on their menu.  They do the 9 items well though.  One of the best places in mississauga for soon tofu.  Different levels of spicy to choose from and protein choices. 

Their extra spicy is perry good but lots of stomach burning after!  Their soon tofu soups come with hot pot rices (the purple Multigrain kind), although sometimes they use the stone put and then put it in a bowl for you instead of serving it.  I think they are short supplies for the busy times.

Sides dishes (banchan) are great and fresh.  Always ask for more if you want ;)

Service is polite and straight forward. Water and utensils always at the table. 

Solid!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to the Koreatown location of this place on a couple of occasions before heading to this location which is much more convenient for me.

Like the other location, the menu is not that extensive but the prices are reasonable and more importantly, the quality is the same.

This location is a bit bigger than their other and does have a few more tables that would accommodate parties greater than four but at peak times, you can still expect to wait.

Unlike places that boast that they have over 100 or even 300 items on their menu, the fact that this place is about 10, you know that each item will be their very best. What you won't find are some Japanese, Chinese or Thai items... just Korean."}
{"text":"False advertising. It costs more than a Buk to eat here.

They're famous for basically making Korean dishes with Tofu. It's what they do, it's all they do, and they're like evil geniuses in that they hope that \"Soon Tofu will take over the world.... mwahahahaha.\"

I have no problem with the concept, but I asked for the dish that was closest to my fave - Yuk Gae Jang - and I asked for it extra spicy. The price was pretty good (under 10) and the portion was huge, but there was way too much tofu in it (and little else) and the spice tasted a little weird. Like they had added something to make it spicy that didn't taste right or go with the dish. Still, if you love Tofu and innovation then you may want to stop here and give it a try. Definitely a 4-star place. If I hadn't got it extra spicy which led to a weird taste, I may have enjoyed it more.

What did the chicken say to the Tofu?

Buk buk buk buk bukkkk!"}
{"text":"When the weather is getting cold I always love to go here. 

Their soup comes in different spicy level so it is good for people like me that cannot eat spicy food. 
Even if you order mild or no spice, the soup is still very flavourful. 

All their set comes with purple rice and side dishes (kimchi, marinated beans, marinated white radish and sesame oil bean sprouts). 

They will give you an egg if you order the soup set, you can break it in and just let it cook for a while to get a soft pouched egg. If you don't prefer runny yolk you can scramble the egg before pouring it in. The soup is always bubbly hot when it gets to the table so the egg will get cooked. 

I have tried the bulgogi set as well. The bulgogi is on the sweeter side but I think it is very tasty. It also comes with a small bowl of miso soup. 

The rice is cooked in a metal pot so the rice at the bottom gets a little bit burnt and crispy. The waiter will pour water into the pot so that you can eat it if you want as well. I think it tastes like rice in roasted rice tea and I do not like it that much. But then usually I am too full after eating the rest of the food anyways"}
{"text":"I came here last year with 2 of my girl friends. I didn't like the food as I found it bland, but maybe it was the way I was eating my rice and the tofu. I came back a year after to give it another try and this time, I liked it! Last year they served the rice already in the bowl, but this time they brought the big rice stone pot and took out the rice into a bowl right in front of us.

I ordered the Combination Soon tofu (plain), and my 2 other friends ordered the Veggies Soon tofu (Medium spicy). To my surprise, I didn't find it as bland as I found it last year and just enjoyed the tofu \"soup\" and the rice along with the appetizers. However, the Combination Soon tofu came with only 2 shrimps (quite small) and 1 mussel, but it's still decent for its $8.95 price. 
I also saw the waitress asking the tables beside us if they would like more appetizers, but didn't ask us while ours were empty too.

If you've been there and didn't like it because you think it was bland, I recommend taking a spoon of rice (1/2-3/4 spoonful), dip it in the soup so that the spoon is full, and eat together.

Service: 4/5
Food: 4/5
Price: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"I've gone here twice for late night eats (up to 1030pm). They have free parking in the back which I keep forgetting to use and end up paying street parking. This place is famous for the spicy soups but I keep getting the #9 broiled beef with stone pot rice. I love it so much. Tastes great. 4 bonchon consisting of kimchi, bean sprouts, daikon, and some kind of bean or seeds. Everything is priced around $11 which is a pretty good deal. Beware cash only $15 and below."}
{"text":"The BEST soon tofu in town! I always get the seafood one and it's always delcious and leaves me satisfyingly stuffed. The broth is very flavourful and comes with an assortment of seafood such as mussels, shrimps, squid, and not to mention lots and lots of tofu. The soup comes with purple rice that's scraped from a clay bowl that gives it a nice crunchy consistency. They pour water in the clay bowl and leave it at your table so I've always wondered if you're supposed to do anything with that... The meal comes with a good selection of banchan that includes kim chi, bean sprouts and white radish to name a few. Service is always friendly and the food comes out quick so it's good if you're ever in a hurry but craving a good solid meal. All of this for $8, can't go wrong! 

PS. This place is always PACKED so I would advise to go during non-peak hours such as right after/before the lunch or dinner rush."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast Korean food, but the menu is quite limited.
Flavors are authentic and the purple rice that accompanies your meal is crispy on the edges. 
Service is quick. The restaurant is small and cozy. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing korean places specializing in Sundubu, they have 10 items all pretty much variation of their sundubu. The soup is very flavourful and authentic (even the spice level is authentic - the regular is quite spicy!). They serve all dishes with four side dishes: kimchi, picked radish, beansprout and some kind of sweet beans and they are all delicious. A piping hot stone bowl of purple rice is also given with your meal. 

The waiter will usually scrape the rice out and add water to the rice to make a sweet purse rice dessert but I always ask them to not add water and I end up adding the extra soup from the sundubu inside at the end, scrape and get some nice crunchy rice soaked in the spicy stew. 

The majority of their dishes come up to $10 incl tax and tips and they are very generous portions."}
{"text":"Well worth the price for the amount of food that you get, and it's delicious. I love the purple rice -- don't get freaked out when they pour water into the stone pot after they scoop the rice out, it makes for a nice watery-congee-like soup after your meal (if you like that). Really good, love that there are so many vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Pleased with my lunch experience, I brought my family here for dinner. So I've had the opportunity to taste the following, all served with purple rice:

1. Pork Bone Soup
Asked them to make it more spicy and it hit the spot. Delicious broth, large pieces of meat.

2. Seafood Pancake
Crispy and not overly greasy. Reasonable amounts of squid. Was still tasty even after it cooled.

3. Kimchi Soon Tofu (asked for Mild)
A Korean friend said this was her fav. My teenager (who is usually not very adventurous with food) ordered this and to my surprise, finished the whole thing. I managed to steal a bite and found it quite tasty.

4. Dumpling Soon Tofu (asked for Plain)
Other son doesn't eat much spicy food so he enjoyed this non-spicy dish.

5. Stir-fried pork on sizzling hot plate
Waiter said this was one of the restaurant's signature dishes. Pretty good but in typical hot plate style, they used a lot of oil.

6. Purple Rice was lovely. The waiter scooped it out of the stone bowl then  asked if we wanted to add water in the stone bowl. Seems it is the practice since you could scrape the rice off the bowl and mixed with the water, it became a sort of congee. (If you decline the water and wait to scrape the leftover rice near the end of your meal, it would be quite impossible to remove most of the rice.)

* Good customer service.
* No issues with parking both day and evening time. 
* Many booths, tables were not too close to one another = pleasant ambience.

Deducting 1 star becoz:
- No free WiFi
- Same Ban Chan for quite a while now, judging from pix from other Yelpers
- Restaurant felt cold
- Tea refill was inconsistent"}
{"text":"Filling meal at an affordable price (though I see the prices have increased based on old menu photos). Had the dumpling tofu soup which was good but a little bland. A touch of seasoning would've made it a much better meal. It came on a hot stone which kept the soup bubbling for a short while; just enough time to crack the small egg that came with the meal. The sides were your standard kim chi, bean sprouts, picked radish and a few other ones I can't recall.

The seating is tight. Seems like they want to cram as many tables in as possible in order to serve their high volume of guests. They were at max capacity plus had a short line on a Monday evening. This made the experience a little uncomfortable as I had to shimmy my way out between two tables to the point that my butt was basically resting on the table top as I slid my way out. 

The service was fine until about 30 minutes in and they clearly wanted you to leave as they stopped coming by to refill drinks and check on you. It was made crystal clear by them bringing you the bill when you hadn't yet asked for it.

This place is good if you want a quick and decent meal. 

Note: They have parking available in the back so don't do what we did and pay for street parking!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place. 

Price, quality of food and service is on point. HOWEVER, there was a time that we got there around 45 minutes before closing and the food was a bit underwhelming. It seemed as though they were rushing to get plates out. 

If it is your first time there, I do recommend the bulgogi (it's sizzling hot plate with beef with rice served on the side). Or the Dumpling soon tofu. It's a soup with large pieces of silken tofu, a freshly cracked egg, and beef dumplings!"}
{"text":"Still a very solid choice for a quick Korean meal. You just pick a combo and chow down. You get a solid set of sides, sprouts, fermented soybeans, Kim chi. And then the bubbling pot of tofu comes with an egg and a bowl of purple rice. Relatively well priced and no fuss. Definitely a good place to warm up over a hot bowl on cold days."}
{"text":"Delicious food. The menu list is very small and little bit side dishes not many options as the other ones I've been to. The food is great I've tried everything my favorite is the dumpling and soon tofu. I would love to give them 5 star rating but the seating area is very small and its always a packed house when I come here line ups too its a good thing for the business. But when sitting next to strangers its too close right in my personal space and out elbows touching when we eating becomes a problem for me. This place can get very rowdy. The service is really good and fast. Would hope to see them expand. They have more locations but this location food tastes better even tho same recipes ..."}
{"text":"What I love about this place:

1. 9 items - all great (even for my friends)
2. Price
3. Hot Stone Bibimbap
4. Location & Ambiance

What I don't love so much:
1. Variety"}
{"text":"Unpopular opinion, but I did not like this place. Food was way too salty, and I thought the purple rice hot stone bowl was a huge source of waste( so much of the rice was stuck in the stone pot!) 

My coworker and I spent the entire afternoon chugging down water to try and balance the amount of salt in the soup and kimchi

We got 2x combination 1($8.85), which had exactly 1 shrimp( mini one) and 1 mussel, and maybe 2 bites of beef 

The bibimbap($11.51)had no beef ( we had to send t back to the kitchen) 

Awful experience, good service though"}
{"text":"Soon tofu soup. 
Hands down the best Korean I've ever ate. 
I have dreams about it. 
Cracking that egg in my bubbling soup.   Oh the drool.
Day after hang over cure.
I tell anyone I know to go here if in Toronto. 
Do it.
You may have to wait in line.  Always worth it. 
Drink Hite."}
{"text":"We went there tonight and that was our first time to visit this restaurant. Honestly speaking, that was a great meal.  Service was fast and nice, food was tasty, side dishes were great. We'll go back, no doubt."}
{"text":"This is a seriously good bargain. Super tasty, spicy (if you order it that way, or you can order the \"white\" version), bubbling and filling, the seafood (oyster, mussel, shrimp) tofu soup was really fun to eat on top of tasting so good. I liked the whole process of eating it too: from cracking the egg in the soup, stirring it, waiting for it to cool, mixing it into the rice: it made for a good time.

Great kimchi and bean sprouts, too! For less than 10 bucks a head!"}
{"text":"Buk Chang, you are still good, but you are starting to cheap out on me.

Don't get me wrong. I've liked BC for a long time, but lately noticing some cheeaping out on quality. I mean where is my date in the purple rice. Lack of ingredients. What happened to your crispy seaweed banchan (ok, you took that away a long time ago, but I still remember it, and am sad you took it away.)

Yes, your prices are still low, but it's time you consider raising that price a tad, instead of taking out quality. That's a quick road to mediocrity, and you've always held a special place in Toronto. Don't squander it."}
{"text":"Love it! The jjigae are amazing and cheap. This is the very model of efficient service. The tofu (soon tofu or pronounced too-boo) jjigae is great value for the money and the purple rice in water is phenomenal. The only complaint would be that their kimchi is never really good but tha'ts a small quibble.  

One tip: if you are like me in terms of rapid body heat DO NOT eat here on a sweltery day. The dining quarters are pretty small and it's almost communal. But that's a small blip on an excellent place."}
{"text":"The restaurant is to some extended hidden in the plaza so you need to look for it. The menu is small but more than enough for my choices of Korean food. We tried the Bibimbap and the seafood pancake and both were really good. Bibimbap is my favorite Korean dish and i was not disappointed here. The staff is nice and friendly. We were there for a late lunch so we were only customers in the restaurant. I will be going here again as i often crave bibimbap. 


Food:4.5/5
Service and atmosphere: 4/5
Price: 4/5
Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Tried the bibimbap. Well priced quality food. Downside is on peak hours the waiting time is too long and line up is too long."}
{"text":"This place is just like any other Korean resto but the customer service could have been better. 

Came in on a Friday evening around 5:30 pm and I thought service was slow when it wasn't all that busy. Had to ask for water twice before actually getting it. Once the place filled up around 6:30 pm, service was even slower. You always had to call them over for typical tasks such refilling water or refilling side dishes. 

Pros: 
- With a very limited menu, the food here is good. I had the #9 - broiled bbq beef and my friend had #5 - soybean soon tofu soup I believe. No complaints from either of us. 

Cons: 
- Side dishes were a bit limiting, no potato and portions for 2 ppl were a bit small. You can ask for more but it takes a while cause again, service is slow."}
{"text":"We walked to this restaurant from home. Good thing I was looking up nearby restaurants in the neighbourhood and saw the one 5-star review from a fellow Yelper.

Service was excellent and all the servers are smiling and checking in regularly. 

The menu is pretty much one page. I love the simplicity of that. You have your selection of different soon tofu bowls along with Dolsot Bibimbap, Pork Bone soup, Bulgogi soup (with glass noodles) or broiled Bulgogi (hot plate). 

Our meals came with side dishes (kimchi, bean sprouts, those little sweet beans, and sliced radish strips). 

The purple rice came in hot stone bowls and you are welcome to scrape the rice out after. 

Overall this was a great experience and super close to home. This will be a regular spot especially on days when I work from home. 

Lastly, they accept debit, visa and MasterCard. :)

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is honestly the cutest little restaurant I've been to in a while. The staff members are adorable and very polite. They are highly recommended. This was my first trip to Toronto by myself, and this was the first meal I've had in Canada. Food was served within minutes and they had authentic purple rice served in the hot stone! The seafood soon tofu soup was delicious, and had the perfect amount for a single traveler. I also enjoyed the bon chon - the kimchi - was on point as well. I would definitely come again on my next travels!"}
{"text":"The absolute loveliest and friendliest people work here. The service here is superb. You get greeted when you first walk in and all the employees (yes, ALL of them. Granted there was only 2 waiters and 1 in the front but it was still nice.) say goodbye and thanks to you when you leave. The waiters check on you to ask if everything is okay and asks if you want refills on your side dishes. 

I ordered the Combination Soon Tofu ($8.85 + tax) which is said to contain beef, shrimp, and mussel. There really is just one shrimp and one mussel in the dish. Lots of tofu though. This order came with a stone pot full of purple rice  (yay for purple rice!) that they scoop into a bowl for you and then soak the rest of the pot in water so that you can eat the rice stuck on the pot after. 

In terms of serving size, this dish is more than enough to fill anybody up. And don't forget about the side dishes. This is a super cheap and filling meal for under  $10! 

The food tasted good and I liked how I was able to choose the spiciness level to my liking. 

There are 4 side dishes that comes out at the same time as your meal. The food comes out on a cart so that your entire table gets food at the same time which I liked. 

Overall service was excellent, the food didn't take long to come out, and it tasted great. 

I will definitely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Like MSG? This is the place to go! You'll end up feeling very thirsty after one of their soups. Tasty though but kind of a dive."}
{"text":"Love that soft tofu -- reminds me of the silky goodness we enjoyed in Beijing. The rice was dynamite. Serving size spot on. We enjoyed set#1, 4, 8.

We will again to try the other sets on the menu. Definitely a go to place when that fall \"want some soup\" weather comes by!"}
{"text":"Buk Chang Dong is a great eat for Korean cuisine, and here's why:
- everything on the menu is affordable 
- good portions
- cool, authentic atmosphere

HIGHLY recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and it definitely isn't a place I would recommend. Every time I decide to give it another try...I end up not wanting to come back.

Their soon tofu was bland the first and second time I tried it and during the most recent visit... It was too salty for my liking.
This recent time that I went, my friend's bulgogi soup came first and for some reason, my other friend and I's combination soon tofu was no where in sight. We had our rice scooped and ready in front of us but it took a good 10 mins for our 2 outstanding tofu soups to come out. By that time the bulgogi soup was not boiling hot anymore while our tofu soups were....I'd say it defeats the purpose of coming to this place since people come and expect a boiling hot pot.

The side dishes are good but I have had better around the area.
I even tried this place in Markham and it was ok..nothing spectacular. There is better sundubu jjigae out there..."}
{"text":"finch branch is much better.
(service and food both)

bibimbab is better than tofu soup."}
{"text":"Really authentic Korean clay soup dishes can be found here! I came here Friday night around 530pm and was greeted and seated immediately by the waiter. This place is supposedly known for its cheap tofu soups. Although the menu is really limited, you should probably know that this restaurant is only known for its single type of dish.

 I ordered the pork and tofu jigae and the dishes came out under 10 minutes. The presentation was really unique. I've never had my dish served on a wooden board before and rarely do I get purple rice. This is the first time I had the traditional crunchy rice soup which was a wonderful cleanse after eating the spicy soup. Shortly after I got my dish, the restaurant started to get packed and a line up was forming! I definitely made the right choice in coming early!

I only paid a total of $10 including tip which is super cheap for dinner! Will come again, especially in the winter!"}
{"text":"My kimchi was nice & sour and the bibimbop was bomb! And they had some sweet tea  Korea is alright in my book lol"}
{"text":"Adding this to my 'I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet!' -list. This BCD location is much better than the Bloor St location since it's cleaner, closer (for me), less busy and therefore, less warm from amassed body heat and service is 100x more efficient and friendly. 

My favourite dish here is the Vegetable Soon tofu, and at under $10 before taxes and tip, it makes a super cheap meal. I absolutely love cracking the lone raw egg given with the soon tofu into my piping hot bowl of love and watch it simmer. 

The genteel folk of BCD will be seeing a lot more of me in the coming winter months."}
{"text":"I prefer the Yonge Street location as opposed to this location specifically for the service, although I also noticed a little difference in the broth as well. I always get Vegetable Soon Tofu and to my displeasure it features mushrooms and a few other vegetables you wouldn't expect (or in my case, desire). Buk Chang Dong's service just doesn't compare to the hospitality offered from staff at Tofu Village.

$7"}
{"text":"Another Buk Chang, another delicious Soon Tofu. We ventured in here after a yoga class and request my usual vegetable soon tofu, spice level: Medium. Everything was delicious and as per BCD tradition, the banchan consisted of kimchi, bean sprouts, spices Asian radish and saucy soybeans.  

One of the waiters was much more perceptive and courteous than the other, but the overall experience was great. I still feel like House of Soon or Owl of Minerva whip up a better Soon Tofu as the BCD version is slightly too watery and maybe the tofu is not as silky smooth, but the vegetables in this one make me feel a little healthier."}
{"text":"Whether it's the yonge & finch location or the bloor & christie, my fiance and I always receive wonderful service here. Big smiles, quick to acknowledge their guests, and the food is consistently good. 

I always get the spiciest seafood soon tofu with no green onions and my fiance gets the regular dumpling soon tofu. You receive an egg for each soup. While the soup is still bubbling, crack the egg and dump 'er in then mix fast! Also, this restaurant generally serves purple rice instead of white. Don't knock it til you try it!

I'm full korean and he's from trinidad. We get unwelcome stares at most korean establishments and most people talk about us while assuming I don't speak or understand exactly what they're saying (until the very end when I ask them for the bill in korean).
I've never had an issue like that at either of their location. The staff works so hard to provide excellent service. They encourage my fiance when he wants to order for us in korean which is a huge point for me. During the winter, the line up can get a little crazy since this is the perfect soup for a cold snowy night and it's all anyone wants to eat when they're sick. But keep in mind that they offer take out and it tastes just as good at home after you reheat it. 


Bottom line:

service - great
food - great
ambiance - a little outdated but very homey
parking - just don't do it.. take the subway to bathurst or christie station (downtown) or finch station (uptown) and walk it or take an uber"}
{"text":"Extremely good service. Whoever is in charge of the hiring process at all these locations does a great job since I've been to 3 locations now and everybody's always on their A game.
The only thing I wish is that for very spicy, they'd be more consistent. Yonge/Christie makes it really spicy which I love, Yonge/Finch makes it ok, but this location made it almost like it's not spicy at all. I'm korean, guys. I can handle it. Make it spicy!"}
{"text":"[17/20]
This place is that small restaurant that you have to check out if your in the area. Its a great representation of a small Korean place often found in the nooks in Soeul.

(10/10) Food 
The food was really tasty and very traditional. The side dishes are great, the entrees are all reasonably priced (~9). Great food for any time of the day!

(4/5) Atmosphere 
The store is a little cramped but the decorations look good and it feels like a local Korean restaurant inside.

(3/5) Service 
The waiters were on the slow side and they seem to be always busy so there was quite a bit of waiting. They were otherwise nice and helpful."}
{"text":"One star for the rice. One star for a decent service. Rice was cooked perfectly! The rest were a let down. The side dishes were so sweet, I never tasted kimchi that was so SWEET in my life. This really irked me. Soft tofu was OK but I am so thirsty now. *coughMSGcough*

This is the last time I'm trusting yelp reviews for korean restaurants - I'm never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Very good bibimbap and bulgogi.
I have always found the staff to be quick, friendly, organized.
It's a bit pricey but if you enjoy Korean food, one of the better spots in the area."}
{"text":"I really wanted bim bim bap.  We decided to head to Korea town instead of going uptown.  Upon wandering into this place, I realized that I've been here before when I was just a young'un....like almost 20 years ago.  Crazy right?
I was really full.  I wish there was more of the side dishes, because I go through those like crazy.  The other options looked interesting too, but I just really wanted bimbimbap.

It was good, but I love checking out other places in Korea town too.  Yum!"}
{"text":"The best spicy tofu soup is served here. I always get the beef dumpling tofu soup as I find it makes for the tastiest broth. There is free parking in the back, so save your money from street parking if available. Beware of lineups... a good problem to have."}
{"text":"just as good as the one at yonge and finch

Large portions, best bang for the buck

Dumping soon tofu is good"}
{"text":"World's best kimchee soon du bu joint with the best ban chan. Dinner for two: $20 tax included. Nuf said."}
{"text":"Ummm.... 3 stars is a stretch. What is it about this place that's got everyone peeing in their pants??? I was less than impressed. The banchan were lacking - only 4? And mostly veggies - not impressed. I had the number 8 - i don't remember what it's called. It was MADE OF SUGAR!!! Why? I don't like sweet food, it had beef and glass noodles and my mouth was burning because it was so sweet. I literally felt nauseous after.... 

I will give points for the super cheap prices, I think I paid $10 for the meal plus a pop. I will also give points for good service. But I don't think I will ever come back here....maybe to try the kim chi soon tofu but someone else is gonna have to pay cuz i cannot justify this spending! 

Oh and by the way \"vegetable soon tofu from Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu contains 4,200 mg of sodium\" as per the Star. Talk about salty..."}
{"text":"This place has great food and if this review was based on food alone I would be close to giving it a 5. The place is always packed and their tables are so close together that I was constantly being run into by the servers as they passed by. I also didn't really like the servers butt being in my face every time he went to the tables next to ours. That really ruins the experience for me.  When we wanted to go it took forever to get the server to bring by a takeout container for my girls leftovers. 
That being said I would definitely recommend this place for take out because the food really is amazing but it's horrible for a dine in experience."}
{"text":"Service was fast and food was good. Place is tiny though, had little room to move. The side dishes were in plates that were too big so it made the table feel even more cramped. Affordable and good food, but very cramped."}
{"text":"I came here on a weeknight and really enjoyed the friendly, speedy service. We order two combination soondubos + 1 dumpling appetizer. We probably didn't need the appetizer, since they give 6 small dishes as well, but everything was just as delicious as the Yonge location! Recommended if you're looking for a hearty bowl of tofu uptown, with free parking :)"}
{"text":"Very nice bibimbap and tofu soup. Love the limited menu selection! Busy place for lunch, went at 12.15 and got in before the rush though.

Basic selection of sides but nothing special - could be more variety. No booze which is a shame - could use a Hite to wash things down.

Overall good food and service, but I did leave a bit hungry and had to get a 2nd lunch later on with a beer."}
{"text":"It was the worst Korean restaurant in Northyork... Seafood pot was in one shirimp and one mussel only... Also, as far as I heard, servers don't receive even minimum wage..."}
{"text":"i think ive found the perfect dining experience.  this restaurants heaven for on-the-fence orderers like me.  most of the time when i go out to eat it takes me the longest out of any guests at the table to decide where my gastric tendencies lie that day.  so when i arrive at a place that prides themselves on having a menu of novelistic proportions i shudder at the prospect of the gamble.  but here, at Buk's, THERE ARE ONLY 9 CHOICES. 

seven out of the nine (all of which are printed on the back of their business card - brilliant!) are soups which come to the table boiling.  now i dont mean boiling in the loose sense of talking about something that is hot.  i mean bubbling boiling.  

your meal comes with several plates of korean (oh, did i mention this was a korean restaurant!) condiments you might say, or tapas perhaps.  they are all meant to be eaten in conjunction with your main dish, though they come right away, and so if you arrive during a busy rush you can chomp on those while you wait...you know, kind of like, um, well, er...appetizers.

well one of those supporting players is a raw egg.  well when the soup arrived both my chinese friend and the korean waiter tried to convey to me (with a mild sense of urgency) that i might want to put the egg in the soup so it can be cooked by the broth.  so feeling a little pressure to get the whole experience right and trying to appreciate the timeliness of the task at hand (there was after all a rolling boil of delicious soup before me), i dropped the whole egg in, shell and all, and looked up for approval to which i was met with some polite giggles by my friend and the waiter.  my friend suggested that i should crack the egg open, he meant, and dump its contents into the soup.  while that was happening the smiling waiter delicately and wordlessly took the egg from my soup, cracked it with one hand and tossed the shell in a shell/bone dispensary beside me.

indeed the cracking of the egg was the better choice then my shoddy attempt at hard boiling it as it slowly cooked while i devoured the rest of the broth and its contents.  inside my soup (which was number 1 on the list and called the COMBINATION SOON TOFU), was, as you might surmise, a lot of tofu.  there were two or three fully clothed shrimps - legs, shells and eyes included, one mussel and a few pieces of beef.  i cant quite figure out what kind of broth this was - chicken, beef or veggie or pork maybe - but BOY WAS IT DELICIOUS - better than overpriced chicken soups in fancier takeout places.  the soup also came with a bowl of lavender coloured sticky rice, which by itself didnt taste like much, but when mixed with some of the accompanying appetizers (like kimchee, etc - this was standard korean fare) was much better.  this was true especially with a couple of dabs from the sauce that was served with my friends  BROILED BEEF + DOLSOTBAB, which is a dish cooked in a stone pot (which is brought to your table) with veggies and beef.  this sauce was some kind of red bean sauce maybe - it had a little kick and a distinct taste. in other words it wasnt one of those hot sauces that just burns your face off.   

the magic of this place is its small menu, its service which is fast and pleasant (the host had no problem giving us a four person table - though he said it was because it wasnt as busy), the food which is fantastic and filling, and finally my whole meal cost me 8 bucks.

plus the name itself is a great tongue twister.

{"text":"a boiling hot stone pot full of spicy soondooboo totally hit the spot on a blustery winter day in toronto. you also get banchan (complimentary side dishes) to munch on along with the tofu, plus an individual serving of rice also in a hot stone pot (which they fill with hot water after serving the rice, so that the leftover rice stuck on the sides of the pot makes a soup/porridge of sorts to be eaten after the meal), all for less than $10! don't forget to crack an egg into your sdb right after it arrives so it has time to cook. 

i was slightly disappointed because i wanted pork + mushroom sdb, which is not on the menu but available separately (pork sdb, mushroom sdb), but apparently they can't or won't deviate from their pre-set flavor combinations (although i've never had a problem getting custom flavors before at other sdb places). 
 
their bathroom is through a small door next to the cash register and down a steep flight of stairs and is not the cleanest but will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"We didn't make reservations and I found this place last minute on yelp. 

It has lots of seating, so the wait wasn't bad (5 minutes for 4 people) for a Friday night. But then again i'm use to San Francisco long lines. This was definitely a welcome change. 

Onto the food: 

- the meat and brisket they serve with the soup is delicious, however I found the broth a bit bland 

- purple rice is very very good. 

i had the seafood soon tofu. Could have used fresher seafood."}
{"text":"In addition to the tofu soups, they also offer a couple of other dishes, namely the bibimbap and a bulgogi, either in a soup or BBQ style. Tried that last one this time (along with the soondubu) and it was delicious. The meat had a lot of flavor and was pretty tender, even the layer that had been on the iron pan the longest. It was surprising, but do consider getting this even though this is a tofu house."}
{"text":"I love the soft tofu here!! It's super soft, as the name suggests :3 

You get great value. The side dishes aren't amazing but good enough. A dish comes with rice and water is added to the bowl the rice is originally served is making a congee-esque dish (not sure what it's called but it's tasty!). 

This is my go to place when I'm in the Yonge and Finch area which is saying a lot because there's so much choice around there. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"There are only tofu soups in the restaurant. I like it because of the cheap price and delicious side dishes. It served four dishes including sprout, kimchi, marinated soybeans and radish. I ordered combination tofu soup although there was only one shrimp and mussel inside. My friend had the dumpling soup and exactly there was only one dumpling. But it only charged for $9 include tax. What would you expect for? I would go back for another choice such as the extra spicy!!"}
{"text":"Service was okay. We were ignored a bit at the door but our waiter was nice.

Food itself was standard, medium spicy level and soup is nicely flavoured. It wasn't very special compared to other places that had the tofu soup, except the tofu texture is much softer. Okay value for the price. The menu has limited choices so you should definitely know that it doesn't offer all the typical Korean dishes."}
{"text":"Great tofu, soup was a bit on the salty side but the rice helped with that.
Normal spicy is mild for people who enjoy some heat.

Service was fast."}
{"text":"The thing I love most about this place is how nice and helpful the servers are. The tofu beef dumpling soup is a must have! They are also very reasonably price, especially for the portion size given. This place can get super busy at times, so go mid day. They also have free parking in the back"}
{"text":"Soon Tofu is a refreshing Korean dish away from the unauthentic North American taste for gamjatang. The other dishes here are limited (10?) but all are quality and tasty.  Compared to Owl of Minerva, the Soft tofu stew is not a whole lot better but the overall experience feels more genuine to the Korean experience and on this trip, we got 4 accompanying side dishes which included (kimchi...of course, bean sprouts, sweet beans and kimchi radish strips). Many of their dishes round to $10 including tax. The young men that served us were hospitable and helpful. There is also free parking in the back."}
{"text":"What we had: Kimchi soup, dumpling soup, and vegetable soup (all soups come with a bowl of purple rice and shared side dishes)

Taste: 6/10

They give you a little raw egg to crack into your soup, which is a nice touch. If you get the regular spicy level, it is quite flavourful. Steven thought his soup was a little bland; he got the mild spicy level kimchi soup. They put a lot of tofu in the soup, and I really like that. However, they totally load their soups with MSG, we could taste it (also why the soup tastes so good). 

My cousin was miserable with his vegetable soup and was wondering how we could be enjoying our soups, or at least able to bear our soups. It turned out that his soup wasn't salted at all! That bland soup was pretty bad lol. 

They don't have a large variety of side dishes; there was bean sprouts, tiny little beans, and two other dishes. The side dishes were meh.

Value: 8/10

$10 after tax and tip per soup, a good price though Steven feels they could be more generous with the meat bits they put into the soups. One soup will fill most people up.

Service/Convenience: 7/10

Faces Yonge St, and there is parking at the back. Fairly easy to find.

They are polite and fairly efficient. However, it may be difficult to get the server's attention because the place gets pretty busy. The seating is very clustered so there is very little space to move through when getting to your table and leaving.

Would go back? Maybe, if I'm in the area.

Would recommend to friend? If they like soon tofu or soups, yeah.

Similar places: Most Korean places serve soup though not sure if they especially serve soon tofu soup."}
{"text":"Came here with two other friends an hour before closing. As per usual, I chose the Pork Bone Soup. It was good and it came with a stone pot of rice. There was plenty of meat and the soup itself was similar in quality to other places (but pricier).  It comes with a stone pot of purple rice and they would scoop the rice out for you and then leave the pot on the side for you to finish later. The appetizer selection was limited and not as great as other places. 
Servers are very friendly but not as prompt- there were about 1-2 other tables and the staff were preparing to close. My friends enjoyed their Soon Tofu which is what the restaurant is known for. Overall, the experience was decent but I would not go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Always dependable! They're usually quite busy but not a long wait. Love their bibimbap and kimchi stew. The seafood stew I don't like as much (maybe it's just cuz i don't think the seafood taste goes well with the soup). It would be great if they had more options but it's good that their usual dishes are so consistently good! Great prices too."}
{"text":"Always great service whenever I come here. The food is made fresh, the appetizers are refreshing and the portions are big considering the meal is fairly cheap ($9.75 before tax). The quality of the service is very consistent and I'm never disappointed whenever I come eat here.

Some tips I wanted to point out:
- You can change the spice level, it ranges from plain to extra spicy
- Crack the egg and put it in your soup as soon as possible!
- They do not accept debit for transactions under $15. So if you're paying for yourself and you only got one meal, you'll have to pay in cash.
- This place gets busy very quickly"}
{"text":"I can't for the life of me remember what this place is called when I tell people about it but it is definitely my favourite Soon Tofu place in Toronto.  Seriously, as good as it gets!  When I go, I always get the beef & mushroom but since I am a vegetarian now, I'll have to see if there is anything for me next time i go.  

There is really nothing better than a hot pot of soon tofu in the middle of winter!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food pretty much, especially the BBQ beaf which was perfectly seasoned and served on a hot pot. The staff were friendly, helpful, and prompt. I'm not a big fan of soups in general, but this one was fun as we cracked an egg into it while it was boiling! The price is quite reasonable. Among all the Korean restaurants I've been in the area, I would say this one was the best so far given its quality, price, and service. I'll come back if I am around."}
{"text":"Best Korean tofu place in Mississauga. Broth is savory and flavorful, served to the table while soup is still boiling, tofu is silky and soft. Marinated cold side dishes provides a nice balance after each piping mouthful of hot broth. Best part, get soup rice and side dishes all for $10. Better tofu soup than what's served at Owl. Service is efficient, food appears on the table within 5 minutes if not 10 at most. Warm bliss on a cold day or any day you're looking for some soothing and warm food. 

Always my Korean go-to for tofu soup. Love love love."}
{"text":"This Buk Chang is equally as enchanting at the other location in Korea Town.

My only beef with Buk Chang is the limited menu....ugh. 

There are basically only 3 menu options - bibimbap, bulgogi and soon tofu (5 versions of soon tofu but still basically the same dish).

They also only serve the exact same 4 banchan (side dishes) each time. 

Food is great, ridiculously cheap and it's great if you are rather unadventurous and just want to eat the same thing every time. But I prefer Korean places with a more extensive menu."}
{"text":"Un déjeuner bien sympathique dans ce restaurant coréen au cur de... Koreatown ! Il n'y a que quelques choix sur la carte, principalement des déclinaisons du plat soon tofu que je ne connaissais pas, mais qui est apparemment une spécialité coréenne. 
On choisit le degré de piment - j'ai pris mild et c'était pas mal épicé donc attention ;)
J'adore la façon dont le plat arrive, très traditionnel, plein de side dishes (et on vous en ressert si vous en voulez plus !!), du riz dans un bol en pierre, et la marmite bouillante dans lequel vous cassez un uf. 
Pour résumer, c'était Très bon, suuuper copieux, et presque DONNÉ (7,53$ HT). 
Un midi en semaine (enfin août remarque), pas trop de monde et principalement des coréens !

Bref j'ADORE."}
{"text":"Great for soon tofu. Limited menu but everything is tasty! Side dishes are great, my favourite are the sweet soy beans. Overall a great place with regular consistent quality."}
{"text":"By far the best Buk Chang Dong place compared to other ones in Vancouver and GTA. Their side dishes taste better than those offered by one at Bloor or North York. If you like Soon Tofu, this may be the best Korean restaurant in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"A real good soon tofu option when in the finch and yonge area. The best of the lot downtown.

Their Banchan includes some awesome nuts."}
{"text":"my favourite spot in ktown (besides mom's korean food). prices are extremely reasonable. although the menu is limited, everything is done well. absolutely perfect for cold nights! the kimchi soon tofu always clears my sinuses. the only bad thing I can name about this place is that they don't take card for orders less than $20"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The food is cheap and very good. 
I usually order either their soon tofu or bibimbap. Can't go wrong with either.
Price wise, a meal will be less than $10. It's very filling too.
The restaurant atmosphere/cleanliness is average, but what can you expect from a $10 meal?"}
{"text":"I thought it was just so-so.  The main plus was the price.  For $9, you get pretty full from all the soup, rice, and banchai.  Beware the lineup though at rush times."}
{"text":"The food was good but I didn't find it amazing.  It was very noisy and very uncomfortable to sit.  You are sitting between other people and you can hear others' conversation and they can hear yours.  The waiter was very rude and just ask what you want and then throw the plates at you.  They take credit card but only if you go up to pay.  It was really awkward eating there.  Don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"I have no idea which good korean restaurant to go, but with the help of my yelp app and my korean girlfriend, we decided to try the talk-of-the-town Authentic Korean Restaurant. Surely we had a great choice..
Bright and clean restaurant, friendly waiters, a very busy restaurant. Food is authentic and great tasting! I  love it and going back here again!!"}
{"text":"I would never have discovered this place if it hadn't been for the yelp reviews, purely because it is located out of the way from me and frankly in a bit of a dodgy area in Mississauga. But I'm glad I tried this place because it is good, and proud to say, the first good experience I had with kimchi soups.

The menu is short and sweet, which is perfect for the indecisive. I ordered the Kimchi Tofu soup with the expectations that it would knock my pants off. Well, my pants stayed on, but admittedly, it was delicious. The tofu soup arrived with an egg, which was cracked into the soup. The flavour was just right and the smooth texture of the tofu was amazing. It would dissolve instantly in your mouth and the complementary purple rice was served with the perfect amount of sticky. That being said, I would not make a trip to this restaurant just for its soup, it hasn't quite reached that level for me. 

The strange part for me, was that after the purple rice was scooped from the stone bowl, the servers poured hot water into it and said to eat the left over hanging rice on the sides of the bowl. UM? First thought was, is this some clever way to get customers to clean their bowls? After having some of the rice that was soaked in hot water, I was speechless. It tastes exactly how you would expect it to taste - soggy rice. Not good, not bad, there's not even a word to describe it. I must not be the only one perplexed about it, do people enjoy eating this?"}
{"text":"Maybe it's the fact that it's so close to my house OR maybe it's just the fact that BCDST is just pure awesomeness! I might be biased but this location is somehow better than the one downtown. It is always packed with eager customers no matter what hour of the day or day of week.

It's cheap, it's hearty and it's satisfying. $8 for a soup, with your choice of filling + tofu, served with a stone-pot purple rice which also doubles up as a second soup to cleanse off your palette after chowing down the hot, tasty broth. I rarely give out five stars but you can't go wrong with the bubbling pots filled with soft, melt-in-your-mouth tofu, made to your order of spiciness, especially when winter comes. Some choices even come of an (albeit small) egg for your pleasure to crack into the soup.

And the side dishes rock. I love the soy beans and their kimchi. It's got the perfect kick and degree of pickled-deliciousness!

The only thing is if you don't eat beef (for whatever reason...like one of my friends) you only have one choice off the menu. But I mean, seriously, you go to Soon Tofu to eat tofu in boiling soup, not 5-star-hotel-style Korean buffet, so no one should complain about the lack of choices on the menu. It's kind of like McDonalds; you're supposed to know what you want before you even go in."}
{"text":"The same friend and I went back to the downtown location. She was willing to give it another go so why wouldn't I? She didn't get food poisoning this time and we were both very satisfied. My review for the North York location says it all."}
{"text":"Good food but when you pay with the visa you have to have at least $15 spend to use it. Was forced to give a $5 tip."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong w their soon tofu dishes. Other dishes are just so so. My FIL had the pork bone soup; I didn't taste it but he said he liked it. The staff are very nice and polite. Their side dishes could be a bit more given their prices. I'd come back for the tofu dish for sure."}
{"text":"Simple Menu. Delicious Food. Great Prices. Quick Service.

I have been putting off this review for far too long! I went back again and I can say that this is one of my favourite restaurants in the area. I was so hungry that I forgot to take pictures!

FOOD
Banchan - they had a great variety to choose from and had pickled radishes which I devoured. Of course... I asked for more.

Seafood Soon Tofu - I chose the regular spicy level (you can choose to have it not spicy) and found that it wasn't spicy enough this time. They served the soup and rice at the same time - the soup was still bubbling when the server placed it down on the table! I cracked the egg into the soup right away. The soup had mussels, shrimp, tofu, and cabbage. It was well seasoned - not overly salty! I couldn't finish the crispy rice from the other hot stone pot, I was filled to the brim and the meal was only $10. Money worth spending!

SERVICE
The servers spoke english which made ordering a breeze. The food came out in 10 minutes. The waiters were attentive and were easy to flag down if you needed anything.

VISIT AGAIN? - Hell yes."}
{"text":"First of All, I NEVER write yelp reviews. If I could I would give zero stars. I got take out from this place and was enjoying my meal when I felt something in my mouth. When I saw what it was (see picture), t was a metal piece in my food. I usually don't care too much, but I ended up calling them explaining that if there was a child or someone else who wasn't careful who had that, it would be really bad. He responded with \"okay. thank you.. goodbye.\" NEVER going to this place again."}
{"text":"best soon tofu ive ever had. side dishes are great too. kinda in a sketchy area but this place is amazing"}
{"text":"Truly outstanding, completely authentic Korean food.  This restaurant specializes in Soon Tofu [pronounced something like DuBu], which is a tofu soup with kimchi.  The menu is very basic, a number of these soon tofu dishes, bi bim bop, and maybe one or two other options.  You're here for the soon tofu!  The dish is huge, bubbling, and in a stone pot when brought out. They bring out a delicious mix of white and forbidden (purple) rice to eat with your soup.  There's also a rather strange practice of cracking an egg in the roiling soup. Stir it up quickly to avoid solid yolk as I had on my first experience.

The beer and soju selection is pretty minimal, but that's ok, you're here for the Soon Tofu.  The waiters are sort of shy and quiet, but the food is again the star ;)

Come and enjoy authenticity to the max."}
{"text":"Reasonable price, fast service, delicious food! I'm satisfied every time I go. Parking is available at the rear, just make sure to give them your plate number. My go-to is the Seafood tofu soup (Average spicy) and grilled bulgogi."}
{"text":"I've now made two trips here and both have been fantastic.  The menu is simple and straightforward.  The food comes out piping hot and the little side dishes are quite tasty.  For under $8 a person you are getting a great deal.  There is easily enough food for you to fill up.  

My only complaint is the way I was treated because I am not Asian (aka White).  When the server brought the eggs to the table he asked my wife and I if we knew what to do with them.  We said yes. When he brought our food he waited and almost forced us to crack the eggs into our dishes in his presence.  I feel as though if I had waited another split second he would have grabbed the egg and done it for me.  This could have been my 50th visit and I think I would have been treated the same way."}
{"text":"Awesome as usual.
It can be quite crowded, especially on a cold winter day. The menu isn't big, meaning they specialize in what they do. The service is rather fast, and all of the servers know what they are doing. They are attentive and the water always get refilled quite fast.

I ordered a Kimchi Soon Tofu (Medium). You do get to choose your spiciness, and the food will come with a few complimentary side dishes, along with a raw egg for you to crack into the boiling hot stone pot when your soup comes up. Absolutely amazing comfort food in the winter, and it is a quite cheap dinner for those on a budget.

Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"On a cold and windy day, it's nice to have some Korean hot stew to warm you up! 

I usually order the Kimchi Soon Tofu (kimchi, beef & pork) which comes with Dolsotbab (stone pot rice). You can choose the level of spiciness from white, mild, medium, regular (spicy - I get this) and extra spicy. The side dishes are always the same and include kimchi, seasoned soy bean sprouts, beans in sweet sauce, and radish kimchi. The Kimchi Soon Tofu is very rich and savory with the perfect amount of spice, and the silken tofu is so soft that it melts in your mouth. 

I've tried soon tofu at many different Korean restaurants in Toronto and nothing can compare to Buk Chang Dong. If you haven't tried this restaurant already, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"This place seems to have all of the hype / but I don't think it's that hype worthy. 

Their menu is fairly rigid  _ meaning there aren't a lot of options. 

You're basically going to order a bibimpop with soup or without. 

Not much of anything else. 

Service was fast and friendly but lost a lot of points on price (over priced), taste (too salty), quantity (ok at best) and selection (almost minimum). 

If you're looking for authentic Korean food, that offers selection to please the mom white audience / don't eat here. 

This place is a little tourist trap that serves the people that just don't know any better. 

White washed Korean food with a turnstyle exit at the door (figuratively)."}
{"text":"I've been to three of their locations: Mississauga, Bloor West and now Bayview and they are all consistently amazing. 

Beautiful ensemble of tofu in a delicious brother with beef and dumplings. 

We got there at 12:30pm and it was quite busy but we were sat right away. 

Food arrived, piping hot, bubbling goodness along with accompaniments. 

Flavours were spot on, spiciness was a bit off but whatever - everything was great besides that. 

All in all a great experience. Will try the Pork Bone Soup the next time as I'm hooked on the kamjatang at Owl of Minerva. 

Keep eating!"}
{"text":"Was in the area for work and was craving Korean (again), had some last night in Korea Town. 

Anyhoo - ordered the extra spicy soup served with Tofu, beef, shrimp and mussels. 

Food arrived after 7 mins of ordering along with some kimchi and other amazingly tasting sides. 

Soup was amazing. Piping hot, but not as spicy as I thought it would be. I ordered the extra spicy but got a below average spice that didn't make me sweat. When I'm in the mood for spicy, I want to be challenged and there was no challenge here. Maybe that's just a Korean thing. 

Service was super friendly and responsive. Was offered numerous top ups on my side dishes. Was instructed to crack the raw egg in my soup. Was offered water, tea and just generally amazing customer service that you'd expect at a 5* restaurant. 

All in all a great experience for a great price. Good tasting food, great service and even better prices. 

The place can be tricky to find on the GPS but if you end up in the wrong plaza, just park and it'll be less than a 1 minute walk."}
{"text":"Food in Toronto was like a religious experience and I've been swept up in the residual fervor ever since. The food at Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu is easily in the top things I've ever eaten. The trip as a whole changed the way I look at food and completely overhauled my eating habits.

The first thing that struck me about Korean in Toronto was how amazingly cheap it was and how everything could easily be shared with a second person, effectively cutting the bill to something like 6 dollars a person for absolutely amazing food. So, I ordered the #9 Bulgogi, which came with soup, black rice, and banchan. The banchan, if I still remember correctly, were kkakdugi (kimchi cubed radish), kongjang (sweet braised soybeans), your typical kimchi, and your typical seasoned bean sprouts. These were all phenomenal and some of the best banchan I've ever had. Sometimes I wish I could just order a meal of banchan!

When the food was delivered to the table the waiter promptly dished out the rice and poured water into the stonepot it came in to make sungnyung, which is a rice tisane flavored by the crispy rice at the bottom of the pot. This is very appreciated and helps give the whole meal a well-rounded nature with the billions of flavors presented on the table. I've since made this drink at home frequently. The meal is quite the bounty for only about 8 dollars. The bulgogi is easily the best I've ever had, with only one other restaurant (and my own) even approaching the deliciousness of this dish. The meat is so flavorful and they are very generous with their large onion slices with scallion and carrots. I've never thought beef could carry so much flavor. Prior to this I hardly ever cared to eat beef, but this dish changed my entire mind about the meat. The rice is also a shining aspect of this meal, and it isn't something you can just eat anywhere. The soup was also very tasty.

Splitting the meal was enough for it to be very fulfilling and I've been constantly craving it for the past year and a half since I  had it. Luckily, I'll be going to Toronto in a few weeks and I will definitely be here again without fail. I've very excited to try their other dishes, but can I possibly miss out on the bulgogi?"}
{"text":"$10 tax in for a delicious soon tofu soup! Lots of tofu, decent amount of meat. Rice came in a super hot stone bowl and the banchans were unlimited refills. Service was quick and efficient. Interior is a little dated in this hidden gem, but the food more than makes up for it. 

Recommend!"}
{"text":"My experience with Korean food has mostly been with Pork Bone soup or at Korean BBQ restaurants where you grill your own food. I wasn't very hungry when I got invited out for Korean food this evening but I figured I would have some pork bone soup.

Well, this place doesn't sell pork bone soup. In fact, I wasn't very familiar with most of the items on their limited menu. Nonetheless, I was willing to try something different so I ordered Kimchi Soon Tofu + Dolsotbab (kimchi, beef, pork). My dining companions ordered a similar dish but with beef, shrimp, and mussels. Our fourth diner ordered the Broiled BBQ + Dolsotbab.

I really didn't know what I was ordering but our server soon showed up with some familiar looking condiments - kimchi, pickled radish, bean sprouts, and some beans. He also brought some wooden boxes with a small (very hot) stone pot in it containing purple rice. After scooping out some of the rice into bowls, he poured hot water into the stone pot. Hmmm, interesting.

Next, we got our main courses in sizzling hot iron pots. Ahhh, we ordered Korean hot pot! Now I got it! Soup, tofu, raw egg (it cooks in the hot broth), kimchi, meat, rice and a few side dishes. A complete meal. The stone pot with the now crispy rice bits and hot water was like a little bonus dish. The Broiled BBQ dish was served sizzling on a hot plate.

All the diners, as far as I noticed, appeared to be Korean. I'm guessing that's a sign that the food must be authentic. Everything we had tasted pretty good.

The restaurant itself was very small and they must have had a very tiny budget for decor. Very plain and simple. Let's say quaint. We double-parked in a laneway behind the restaurant, walked down some stairs and entered through a door labeled Entrance, made our way through a narrow hallway, obviously in the basement, up another flight of stairs, past the kitchen, and into the dining room. Yes, quaint.

Our server made a note of our license plate numbers in case somebody needed to get out. They did. It was an interesting experience. Not bad. Come here for the food, not the decor or the parking. The food was good. And cheap!"}
{"text":"Great price point for very tasty soon tofu.

Everything is excellent on what is a very simple menu.

I can never remember the name, so I call it \"the orange place\" when meeting people there.

Bonus: If you're still hungry, you can tack on a couple cheap and delicious tacos across the street at Tacos El Asador."}
{"text":"One of the popular Korean food places around Yonge and Finch, Buk Chang has a very limited menu. They have 7 items, all of which in my opinion, they do well. My favourite is the Bulgogi soup which contains a yummy broth that has the right amount of sweetness and clear jap chae noodles that has an amazing texture, served with the usual obligatory Korean side dishes and purple rice. I usually do not like kim chi, but in Buk Chang, I usually don't have a bite without it. I have had their bulgogi and Kimchi Soon Tofu. Taste along with the price point, it is as good as it gets. My only complaint is the place itself can get crowded, but it does have free parking."}
{"text":"About two years ago, my friend introduced me to this place.  \"Soon tofu\" is a Korean tofu stew served in a stone pot -- something I had never tried.  Ever since I went to this restaurant, I can't get enough of it.

It's an excellent (and I believe, healthy) dish that is definitely satisfying during a cold winter's day.  Not only that, they serve it with this purple rice that is suppose to be healthy for you (according to my Korean friend).  

There are many different types of soon tofus available here.  I\"m a big fan of the veggie one -- but that's because I do enjoy my vegetables :)   Not only that, they also serve bulgogi and dolsot bibimbap.

Warning: It gets REALLY warm in there during the summer!"}
{"text":"We ordered the \"bulgogi soup (beef) + hot stone pot rice\" and \"Combination Soon Tofu + Hot Stone Pot Rice\". We are spicy lover, so we ordered extra spicy, and the experience was beyond satisfactory. The beef was tender and the soup tasted excellent. Every combo also serves with rice -- put a little portion of purple rice on your spoon; then a little touch of the soup -- you will never be disappointed!

And, most importantly, the price was very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Favourite place for bibimbap their rice to veggie ratio is perfect.
Their soups are tasty and its served with purple rice. 
They're also really quick so you can easily be in and out of there in an hour."}
{"text":"My favorite place.  Best soon tofu ever.  And they know how to make it spicy.  Yummm :-D"}
{"text":"The first time having this korean food was at Christie and this location jut isn't the same. It stills serves the same food and whatnot, but the soups and rice just don't taste as good.

As i have been to a fair share of Korean restaurants because my love for it, my usuals are Spicy Soon Tofu Soup and BulGoGi soup. This location makes a pretty good Tofu soup, but the amount given is rather inconsistent and sometimes i barely get any tofu. The BulGoGi soup is on the sweeter end and my boyfriend enjoys it immensely, but it is a bit much for me.

To be honest, the biggest attraction this chain restaurant has for me is their purple rice. I am normally a rather picky with calling any rice \"good\" as most people don't make it right. BUT, they make one of the best rice I have ever had, i almost always ask for extra rice and i don't know if the hot stone pot is the magic to it all, but the rice seems to compliment everything dish perfectly."}
{"text":"I still like their North York location better!  I'm so happy that they opened one in Richmond Hill so it's more accessible. But it was cold inside and it didn't smell too pleasant.  For some reason, I feel like they didn't the same as the one in North York, not as good. Slightly disappointed."}
{"text":"On my first trip to Toronto, my friends took me here to have *legit* soondubu. I ordered the bulgogi soup but wish I got the soondubu instead. But I still ate a good amount of the soondubu here (regular spice, dumpling one). Sooo good!! Ahhh the flavours were there and not as bland as what I've had before. Kicking myself for not going again on my second trip. I also love the purple rice that comes with your meal. Overall, delicious cheap eats."}
{"text":"The tofu soup (soondubu), bulgogi and dolsot bibimbap are good. The tofu is very silky and the soup has a nice kick to it if you order anything above mild spiciness. It's hard to do the soup right, and I think BCD does a good job. The beef is marinated well for the bulgogi. The bibimbap is really good, although I wish they would add more beef to it. The crispy rice at the bottom gives it a crunchy texture, and the semi raw egg on top tastes great when mixed in with the rice. The bibimbap comes with gochujang (otherwise you have to pay 50 cents extra for it), and it's the really thick kind that you have to smear onto your rice, rather that squeeze from a bottle.

At $13 (tax incl) though, the bibimbap is a little pricey. There are also only 4 kinds of banchan, and I've definitely had more kinds and better ones at other places.

Overall though, I'd say it's worth going."}
{"text":"New franchise of the BCD korean chain. Much more comfortable (more spacious, nicer seats, cute stuffed animals in the booth areas) and easier parking than the one on Yonge Street.

The menu is a little larger (4 more items, including one additional veggie based soondubu). The taste is also slightly different - the flavors are a little more dense and packed than the one on Yonge, but still good.

Great people who will welcome you here too, but we went late and it was hard to flag down someone to help us after we ordered."}
{"text":"#TOFU #YELP #KOREATOWN #TORONTO 

My friend suggested this place for dinner and we gave it a shot. Tofu and hot pot aren't my favorite items on the menu, but seeing this was something I've never tried before, I was game. 

WARNING: They don't speak a lot of English. 
SEATING: Tight.
CROWD: Mixed, surprisingly full on a Wednesday evening! 
MENU: 9 items. All have Tofu.
PRICE: $7-$10 + tax

Experience: 
You get to pick a level of spice for your tofu soup - from white to red hot spicy. I picked the white (can't handle spice) and my friend ordered herself some red hot. The soup is mostly broth and mushy tofu, with 2-3 other ingredients of your choice. For instance, mine had 2 little dumplings and very little beef (I ordered beef and dumpling soon tofu). The soup comes with a raw egg, that you crack into the soup. That's the coolest bit, and it actually adds a lot of flavor. Each dish comes with sides of little brown beans, bean sprouts, spicy kimchee, radish and sticky purple wild rice. I liked the purple wild rice and the little brown beans. 

I can see why people throng to this place. It isn't for me. Can't possibly eat that much tofu and their tofu to meat ratio is annoyingly skewed. Not coming back, but I highly recommend it for first timers! Go out there and try something new."}
{"text":"Only 9 items on the menu, but if you like spicy tofu soup, this is the place.  They don't have Pork Bone Soup (what Korean restaurant doesn't!!!????), but it's still worth it.

I give them 5 stars because the server was very attentive, and took the time to explain to us how to eat the nurungji - that's the scorched rice in the stone pot, after they have scooped out the rice for you.

Apparently it's like a dessert...they pour water into the stone bowl, and it slowly cools as you eat your meal.  At the end, the scorched rice peels off from the bowl, and it a bit chewy and nutty.  At that point, you just eat it with the water.  It cools you from the spicy tofu soup, and settles the stomach.  Some people then put kimchi into to give it flavour, but after the spicey tofu soup...this is a nice welcoming \"non-taste\" to finish off the meal.

A must try....I went twice in 1 week!"}
{"text":"Never had to wait for a seat here. Never disappointed with the food but the menu selection is small so not the best place if you have picky eaters in your group."}
{"text":"Delicious! I've been multiple times, and tried both the Combination Soon Tofu and the BBQ Grilled beef dishes. Both amazing and exploding with flavour, but I definitely prefer the combination soup the best. 

On top of mussels, beef, tofu, and other goodies, the combination comes with an egg that you crack and get to watch cook in your soup (and eat it too)! This is also comes with delicious purple rice, along with Kimchi, and other sides.

Be prepared to wait 15-30 minutes on weekends and on popular (Friday) nights, as the place is quite popular and doesn't take reservations (and as thus, is quite loud)."}
{"text":"I am new to Korean food.  I won't say I have a good frame of reference to judge authenticity.  I leave that job to other reviewers.  I will talk about my experience and impression.  Kindly note that my heat tolerance level is limited.  

I ordered a tofu soup at medium spiciness level per a suggestion of a fellow Yelper.  I noted on menu that \"medium\" spiciness was less spicy than \"regular\" spiciness.  Okay, shouldn't be too bad, I thought.  And it wasn't.  It was spicy beyond my comfort zone, but not torturingly so.  For reference, I can handle the \"Hot\" level wings at Wild Wings just fine, but authentic Northern Chinese spiciness is too spicy to me.  The medium spiciness at Buk Chang is in-between these two.  Spiciness aside, the tofu was very soft and smooth.  The texture was similar to the texture of tofu dessert.  Other than tofu, there were a lot of other ingredients.  One of them was a small shrimp (mentioned in menu) which was too small to eat.  All ingredients were fresh.  The soup tasted pretty good.  I liked the purple rice, too.  It was a big pot of soup.  It took me a while to finish it.  By the time I finished, I felt really full.  

The ambience was down to earth, non-pretentious.  I felt like I walked into a neighbourhood corner shop in Korea.  The services was polite and effective.  I will likely return to try a bibimbap, which is my favourite Korean entree."}
{"text":"Man, I am really in the minority here.   I didn't like this place.  

I love me some bibimbap and delicious soup.  This place delivered neither.  I was almost angry at how bad this place was (if I am being honest, I was likely more Hangry) Regardless, this place was a disappointment and I am shocked at the number of positive reviews. 

First, their menu is 9 options deep.   If you are only going to have 9 options, do them well.   We ordered two of those options- kimchi soup and a bibimbap.   The soup was fine although presented with no spoon or side plates bc our table had no cutlery box or napkin container.  Our egg to put in the soup materialized 5 minutes to late to be of any use and was plopped down on the table with no explanation.    If we had been new to this cuisine, we would have had no idea what to do with it    Given its lateness, there was nothing for us to do with the egg anyway and it just sat there.  Cost savings measure?

The bibimbap was terrible.   It was cold, the egg on top was overcooked to the point it resembled the eggs we had in our toy kitchens as children and was also cold, there was zero caramelization on any of the rice  and I can almost guarantee nothing on that plate had ever been introduced to a speck of salt.    I would have complained however that would have required getting the attention of one of the waiters.  

It is getting two stars, because, well, it is very affordable and family owned and others like this place so I feel as though I must be missing something.   Whatever that something is, I will never know because I definitely will not be coming back - there are way too many good Korean options within two blocks."}
{"text":"Awesome, CHEAP, Korean food! $7-$8 an entree. The seafood tofu stew and dolsot bibimbap were pretty delicious. The panchan we received were also very good. Clean space. Friendly owners. If I lived in the area, I would be a regular."}
{"text":"There's not much I can say about this place other that it's Simple clean fresh food - in a very simple location - unpretentious ambiance with hand written signage but authentically Korean - and that includes the curtains, kitchen  and bathrooms lol 

As far as a goto for fantastic stone bowls and standard Korean sides - ambiance aside - this place boasts excellent value and great taste for those seeking an authentic stone bowl experience - which pairs well with beef or pork/octopus bulgolgi

{"text":"We ordered a bibimbap and a dumpling tofu soup. 

Bibimbap - 
The bowl is much smaller sized than it appears in the photo, around my palm size? (I'm 5'3ish, so small palm)
I gave it 2/5.. way below my expectation given the the it is the most simply basic Korean dish. Everything is so plain and dry. Too less veggies, the egg tasted something wrong.. can't describe what it is.. 

Dumpling tofu soup was good 3.5/5 -
The tofu was soft. 
The soup has complex flavour, neither too rich nor too plain. 
The dumplings has definitely added some solid substance to the soup. 
My fav was the purple rice mixed rice. Very chewy but not hard or dry. 

Overall, I will probably go back just for the soup. (Will not try anything else though.)"}
{"text":"Food: 5/5
Service: 4/5
Location: 3/5 

My boyfriend is obsessed with this place - and now I know why! This place just has some really tasty, no-nonsense Korean food. Of course we both ordered their signature soon tofu dish and a beef bulgogi to share. The soon tofu arrived boiling in a hot stone bowl and I cracked the raw egg into it (the egg was definitely one of my favourite parts). The broth is SO flavourful and pairs really well with the rice and sweet bulgogi.

I like spicy foods but I wouldn't say that I have an incredible heat tolerance so I opted for regular spicy. Honestly I think I could've gone extra spicy, it's not as bad as the bubbling red soup may indicate. The banchan was underwhelming, but the main dish definitely made up for it. 

Buk Chang Dong was definitely one of the busiest places I saw in Korea town. The restaurant is on the smaller side and has a cozy mom-and-pop shop feel. Pro tip: avoid wearing white when consuming this meal - me and my lace dress had to learn this the hard way"}
{"text":"I had the seafood tofu soup.  The broth was delicious and flavorful, maybe it was the spicy level. If you can handle spicy, get the extra spicy one because the spicy is not enough. The only disappointment here was the amount of seafood:1 mussel and 2 tiny shrimps. 

This dish came with purple rice (yay color), tea, and 4 banchan sides. For 10 cad, this place is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I really like the food here. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like tofu or is a meat lover. Their tofu here is smooth, the food comes out nice and hot, it's a large portion and they have purple rice which comes in a pot! I don't know why, but I love purple rice. They leave the pot behind and put water in it so you can scrape off the rice and eat that as well. No food goes wasted. 

I've been here a couple times and my favourite so far is their Combination Soon Tofu which comes with beef, shrimp and mussel. The service here is great, they're nice and friendly. There's a short wait time for food and there's a large variety of banchan. The soup comes out boiling hot and you get a raw egg to crack into the soup yourself. Everything comes to $10, after taxes. It makes for a cheap and affordable meal."}
{"text":"I have been to the North York location and enjoyed it, so I am comparing my experience here with that one.

The menu is identical (just as small). The good news is that the quality seems to be the same for the most part. The tofu stew is tasty and just like the other place. The one unfortunate thing was that it looked like they skimped out on the purple rice during my 2nd visit to this location. It looked to be considerably more white and did not taste as good. I don't know what the reason for this is, but it was disappointing (did not happen the first time I was there).

If I ever find myself in the area, I'll stop by to give them another chance. The service is friendly and pleasant, especially given the price."}
{"text":"My Order: Beef Bulgolgi 

PROs:
+ SELECTION: the way my dish was prepared was most definitely not of the norm. Either that or I've been going to inauthentic korean restaurants my whole life. They gave me a raw egg (to which I had no idea I was supposed to put it in my dish before it was too late). They also soaked the clay pots in water. I had no idea we could eat from the watered down bowl after the rice had softened...you learn something new everyday. 
+ POPULARITY: the line up was pretty insane. I'm lucky that my friend came ahead of time. I guess it can speak to the popularity/likeability of the restaurant. 

CONs: 
-DECOR: Way too squishy. I could barely get out of my seat, my chair moved 5 cm max before it hit the chair behind me (to another table)
-W/C: Because space is hard to come by in Toronto, it's no surprise that the washroom is down a narrow staircase with two small washrooms at the back. Use the w/c beforehand if you're claustrophobic."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get some tofu stew. Although their side dishes are a little lacking. They only have kimchi, bean sprouts, radishes and soy beans as side dishes. Would have loved some potatoes in there. But hey, it's cheap and you can definitely get full on it.

I ordered the seafood tofu stew which tasted ok but really didn't have much seafood. There was legit 2 small shrimps, 1 clam and 1 muscle in there with plenty of tofu. Again, it's cheap so I can't complain too much.

Overall, if you're looking to grab a quick bite, I'd recommend it. It's not the best Korean restaurant but not the worse either. Worth it for the price."}
{"text":"For food, see my review of the downtown location.  The food seemed to me to be identical in preparation and quality here.

Atmosphere here is more modern and spacious, but at lunch today the service sucked.  While the guys at the downtown location seem to hustle to put things on the table, the two dorks who were working here today seemed like they just graduated from the Seoul school for zombies.  They stood around twiddling their thumbs while customers were waiting for set-ups and did not even notice when tables were not set up.  The bad service knocks this branch down a star or so from downtown."}
{"text":"Great bargain - every one of the nine menu combination items is less the $8.50 and soda is only $.88.  Portions are just the right size.  Relishes my be a tad bland for some but are very tasty. 

Simple, fast, very friendly and they do it right."}
{"text":"We came here as it was recommended by our friends.  When we first walk in..I can smell the pork bones because many people had ordered the pork bone soup.  We end up ordering dumpling soup and beef bogougi soup with rice.  I was expecting the beef to be tender.  However that's not the case.  The beef was very stiff.  It's not like the Korean beef I was expecting.  It could be they are using low quality of meat.  However the soup base was good.  The dumpling soup we ordered was good but overall we did not see any wow factor in it.  The price is reasonable but not cheap. I was expecting more from it since many people had talked about this restaurant before we came to try."}
{"text":"It's really different experiment for us.  Being vegetarians it was an adventure to go to Korean restaurant,but it was great. Food was good and the hot stone bowl were pretty awesome.  The staff was corteous and we had good time."}
{"text":"This is absolutely, positively, hands down, without question my favourite restaurant in the city. 

I always order the #3 (Kimchi and Tofu Soup). O, that delicious (regular, not extra) spicy broth, those pillowy lumps of soon tofu, that crunchy pickled daikon... it is a magical elixir for the soul. And only $8??

The only thing I don't like is the \"rice water dessert\". But I understand that it's keepin' it real for Koreans so I'm happy to let it sit on the edge of my table."}
{"text":"After searching Yelp in vain for something with more than 3 stars and more than one review near my hotel, I decided to branch out and try something new. Boy, am I happy that I did. 

This place has the perfect Korean dinner, complete with all of the side dishes. I had the BBQ beef and was very impressed. It was totally worth the crazy drive through slow and weird Toronto traffic to get there."}
{"text":"I yelped this place and the food was amazing!! I am from India and it was my first time eating authentic Korean and I loved it enough to give it 5 stars. 
My Korean who is visiting here from Seoul food helped me decide what to eat. & even she said the food was REALLY GOOD and very authentic. Korean Grill house is very Canadian-ised  I can see the difference now. 

Anyway. this place has limited stuff but TASTY food with really fast service! 

Good job guys."}
{"text":"Not much else needs to be said about this place. It deserves the praise it gets, and its chigae is top drawer.

For something different though, order the doenjang chigae (\"Soybean Soon Tofu\" on the menu). The broth base is made from a fermented soybean paste (tastes better than it sounds), and I think the flavours have more depth and complexity compared to the other soon tofu options."}
{"text":"What I love about this North York locale is it's simplicity.
You choose from a handful of bubbling stone soups served with purple rice and every meal comes with a variety of banchan (an array of appetizers)
It's always bustling to the point that the windows are steamy, conversation buzzes and the food tastes great!
My mainstay is the Kimchi Soon Tofu but hold the beef, 'cause I do mine veggie style!

Applause, Applause, Applause!"}
{"text":"Place is delicious and super fast food delivery.

For under 10 dollars you have a choice of the whole menu. 

I suggest coming early for lunch or a little after around 2pm, the place gets ridiculously busy."}
{"text":"Like many of the other reviewers here, I came here with some friends based on the previous Yelp reviews. Sure to be packed and with a long line, but it moves pretty quickly, and that's usually a good sign anyway.

The highlight is the chance to try authentic Korean food, entirely different from what you've had before. If you're wondering what to do with that egg they placed on your table, you're to crack it open and pour it into your soup/stew, then stir it around. Sounds strange, but tastes amazing, and you'll have similar adventures with the other dishes you've never heard of.

If you're like me, you look to the reviews for recommendations on what to order, but honestly, everything is delicious. I got the Soon Tofu combo, but my friends each ordered the popular dishes as well and loved their meals as well.

And don't forget the price! You can easily walk out of here spending less than $10 per person, the whole menu is cheap. Great value, great food, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Have been here many times and most of the time it's really great but can be inconsistent sometimes. Expect wait times cuz it's always busy!"}
{"text":"It's too bad this place is really going downhill with every visit.  This time I came with my toddler (3 yrs) and my sister for lunch.  We each ordered miso soon du bu extra spicy, seafood soon du bu regular spicy and a bulgogi pot for my daughter.  

Although their rice is consistently good, their side dishes are getting worse and worse.  Kimchi was super bland, radish side was too sour, their braised black bean was just too hard.  When our order arrived, they had mixed up our order and made the seafood soon du bu extra spicy and the miso soon du bu regular spicy.  When we called our server to address the issue, he just blank faced lied and said that wasn't the case.  Anyone could see that the seafood soon du bu was the alarmingly red indicating the spicy level.  The miso soon du bu on the other hand, looked just pale.  It is just not good customer service when you think that you can pull a wool over their eyes.  

My daughter's bulgogi soup pot thing was too sweet and she ate one bite and no more.  She is normally a good eater and this was unusual.  So I tried her food and yuk!  She was right.  I was surprised that this was even on their menu.  My daughter finished off her rice as she enjoyed the pot rice so I guess it wasn't a complete loss.  

But now I won't have a reason to come back here since they don't have the decency to admit when they've made a mistake and served the wrong dish."}
{"text":"Good food and cheap. I love their small dishes for a lunch and how we have to boil the egg ourselves in the soup. Small menu."}
{"text":"Yummm. So good! No complaints.. just excellent.

The waiter's accent interested me a lot strangely. But that aside, seafood soon dubu was really delicious with soldotbap. Yayyy!!

All for a ridiculously cheap price of $8 after tax."}
{"text":"So I came here with my friend really expecting a sundubu that would resurrect Jesus again so it was a little natural that we were mildly underwhelmed.

We both ordered different sundubu I ordered the classic sundubu and she ordered the miso one. There is a lot of tofu in it and the broth is nice and savory goes perfect with the rice. However it did taste a lot like any old sundubu that you can get in a Korean restaurant and jesus stayed very much dead. 

The service was alright nothing special and the restaurant is small and quaint the prices are good but the sundubu is just average."}
{"text":"Just as good as the first time
The best part is the side dishes (soy beans, bean sprouts, radish and kimchii)
They have my favorite side dishes and no problem asking for seconds or even thirds if you're not too embarrassed to ask that is"}
{"text":"This was our favorite meal in Toronto! First off, it' super affordable.  Their menu is really simple, you pick 1-7 soups or bimbimbap or bulgogi.  We got 1 seafood soup and 1 bulgogi.

The soup is so flavorful! The tofu is so soft, best kim chi soup I've had.

The bulbogi was solid, comes out on a sizzling plate so you get the crispy beef.  

Service is on point and you get everything fast.  Sides are basic, but the kim chi is solid and that's all that matters."}
{"text":"Back in undergrad, I would come here after every milestone.  Passing a course, not doing so well on a test...many milestones were celebrated here.  The food is filling and the price is reasonable.  I always order their hot stone bulgogi, and it's my comfort food. 

Sometimes when you go to a Korean restaurant, it's so hard to pick a meal, because everything looks so good.  Luckily, there are only nine choices to choose from.  If you order the soon tofu dishes, you can choose the level of spiciness. 

Craving some beer to go with your meal? Domestic is S3.54 + tax, and import is $4.43 + tax."}
{"text":"Delicious Korean Tofu soup. You can choose your own level of spice. My favorite is the seafood tofo soup with purple rice and seafood pancake. Free refill appetizers. Very welcoming and friendly service. It is my second time here. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"This place was a good choice for us for Korean food. We chose this spot as we were walking around from queens west west enjoying Toronto downtown shopping during the July 2013 heat wave. The goal was to take a pit stop from walking around to eat in china town. I was about to have a heat stroke and had like 5 minutes left of walking in no AC before severe intervention was necessary. We were walking around feeling for the best AC breeze to waft out of a restaurant at us. I looked down, eyes blurred with sweat and double vision, knees buckling, and saw this sign taped to the door \"food better than your momma made, if your momma was Korean\" and I said \"here. We eat now.\" we were sat immediately, and given glasses and a carafe of ice water. The carafe was gone before my boyfriend had a chance to look at the menu. Menu was easy to read, and pictures on the wall looked exactly like what you got so for a Korean food newb this would be a good place. We ordered a hot pot for me (ironic, seeing as I was recovering from heat exhaustion at the time) and my BF got beef bibibmap. The Sid dishes were good, a nice fresh Kim chi, a bean that I could not identify, hard and chewy, something pickled, and maybe pickled onion. We munched on this as my organs were reversing their shut down sequence in the blissfull air conditioning. I have only had Korean foods in Bethel, Alaska, where there is a surprisingly strong Korean community and something that I missed was friend anchovies as a sided dish, which this place sadly did not have. Once my head started to clear from being overheated, I noticed they were playing a song on continuous replay, it was a pop/dance song that may have been in Korean. Not a bad song, but it was on repeat, so not that cool. Our food came in hot pots which were bubbling and spattering all over the place filled with delicious food. Stayed hot for a while, heavy duty stoneware heated to at least 8000 degrees (in my humble estimate). In conclusion, good food, nice staff, no anchovies."}
{"text":"I'm giving one star mainly for service.

The WHOLE place was empty when we arrived at 11:00 am. We sat side by side at two tables put together and this girl asks us to sit across from one another instead. Clearly this was so they didn't have to wipe down two tables that takes 3 seconds. Whatever. She was just rude about it.

We come here pretty often, but not anymore! 

Place is always full during dinner time and weekends, but turnover is high. Food is delicious but full of MSG. There aren't a lot of choices so it's easy to choose. They give a lot more tofu than beef, shrimp and mussels; it's like left over bits of beef. For $9, it's not worth it. Great for a winter day but the value isn't there. We used to come here when it was $7.

Free limited parking at the back."}
{"text":"There are three Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu in Toronto.
Although when I went to the one in Chinatown it was empty, the taste of the food is very good. 
Definitely get seafood soon tofu, it's very tasty.
There were two of us and the total price was $15 in total. Very cheap!"}
{"text":"Had the Kimchi jjiigae in the Yonge and Finch one awhile back, so knew I was going to have a good meal here. What else to get here but the famous Sundubu? (soft tofu)

Got the seafood one here at regular spice levels. To be honest, having the whole shirmp in there made it difficult to eat. Otherwise, it was fiery goodness, just like in Korea. The sundubu is understandably great. Only 4 banchans though, which may not be as many as other Koreatown restaurants. But the whole meal is quite filling for its ~$8 price, with the famed dol-sot (stone pot) purple rice. Only 9 choices for meals though. A little tight on space, but this is downtown after all."}
{"text":"Very delicious korean food right in K-town. Also this is one of the most popular spots to come for authentic and tasty korean food. 

Their menu isn't a large selection of items but they have the typical bibimbap, tofu soup, grilled bulgogi and some others that you typically find at other places but what I think this place stands out from the rest is their quick/speed service and the quality of their food. 

Most of the time probably how different can a bibimbap or bulgogi taste from other places? Well my answer is, it's very different! The marinate and meat used are far superior than the others. Its more tender, and whoever the chef is they do a good job in cooking it to perfection. 

Also the seasoning and marinate of the meat is also very good as well. Not too salty. Which is good so your not  afterwards downing 3-5 cups of water. Not like this at all. 

The servers are very quick, nice and attenative. The place isn't very big and gets packed at peak time between 6-9. I thought I was beating the rush when I came in at 6 but even then it was quite full. The place gets a bit crowded as it isn't a very large restaurant therefore I do not really recommend this place if you have a larger group, more than 5 people. 

All in all, good food, good service. Definitely would come back again one day."}
{"text":"Best place for soon tofu in Mississauga! The quality is consistent with that of the other locations. 

The menu is concise and simple. I always gravitate to either the Combination Soon Tofu or the Dumpling Soon Tofu option. I have been meaning to try the bibimbap or the hot plate dishes yet - but can never give up that yummy tofu.

Ambiance-wise, the place is pretty nondescript. It has ample seating and parking available at the plaza. I won't hesitate to come here either in the cold of winter, or in the summer evenings.

Try this place if you haven't had a chance to yet!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with a friend and it was pretty packed, we managed to get a corner table next to the window without waiting. The service was friendly and pretty fast. 

The side dishes were average, I still prefer Joons or Oh Geul Boh Geuls side dishes but moving on, the menu was fairly simple it had variations of soon tofu, bulgogi and bibimbap. I got the Seafood Soon Tofu and my friend got the Dumpling Soon Tofu. What I liked about this place is you can choose the level of spiciness which you cannot do for other places. I chose spicy because I love spicy foods.

The food was pretty good, not salty at all which is wonderful for me compared to other places I have gone to. The rice that comes with the meal is purple and I love the authenticity of the overall meal. I would go again if I were craving soon tofu but I would like to try out the bulgogi there as well."}
{"text":"This place has crazy good reviews, so maybe I was biased walking in, but I was not impressed. It seems like a popular student spot (no doubt for the price, speed, and probably the non-intimidation factor/general hype). Service is fast, and it's not a place you sit and talk/prolong a meal. 

As someone who grew up with this food, I will say that it wasn't bad, albeit WAY TOO SALTY (so if salt is not your jam, and you don't really eat rice, this is not the place for you). The hot stone pots that they bring are a nice touch that is becoming more and more popular, but still awesome. If you aren't super pressed for time, Koreatown up north in Markham is really the best Korean food and you can visit so many amazing Soon Tofu houses! 

Service is really where they take the hit. Now, I am not a crazy person, and I know that sketchy service is not uncommon for many of the cheaper Asian eateries in the city (or anywhere for that matter), but this was a whole new level of bad. The guy taking our order forgot/got confused/had an aneurysm and didn't take food orders from two of the people at our table (and everyone else had ordered a soup, so it wasn't as if they could be sharing). Most notable though, they spilled hot soup, not once, not twice, but five times on one of our group members. This was done the first time because they tried to carry too many flaming hot bowls of soup, and kept happening as they brought over more food (I get that fast service is part of the appeal, but this was such poor judgement), and then when they tried to stack a million bowls into each other whey they were cleaning up (which ended up spilling onto one of our group members). One mistake is human, but this was just SOOOOOOOOOOOO BAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD! 

Cheap or not, I don't think I will be coming back"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad, but everything felt like it could've used a rinse.

Staff: Some of the staff speak English better than others but overall they were very nice and very kind. The food came quickly too.

Ambience: Nothing special about the place. But I will say that the utensils were wet and some still had soap residue.

Food: I had the Dumpling Soon Tofu. There was only two dumplings but they were very good. It all went well with the rice. It wasn't a bad meal but I could've used more.

Overall, it was alright. They price everything by hand so it gets a little confusing when time for the bill because I think tips were included but wasn't stated."}
{"text":"Came on a cold, rainy day. The service was excellent and portions were great. Ordered the dumpling tofu soup and seafood tofu soup. Both had very flavourful broths! Each came with purple rice, and an egg. Left full and wanting to come back for more."}
{"text":"Yum!  On a cold winter's day, I'm always looking for some warm soup-y goodness and with everyone raving about this place, I had to try it for myself!  I went during a lunch hour.  

The place was relatively busy even on a weekday but service was extremely fast.  We ordered the mild spicy with beef, pork, and kimchi.  The soup came with a bowl of purple rice, which they scoop for you.  They then put water in the bowl for you to scoop up the rest of the rice.  The latter weirded me out a bit because I'm not a fan of eating mushy rice...

The kimchi soon tofu was actually quite good even in mild.  I was a bit too chicken to order a medium the other day but I actually think, in retrospect, that's what I should have done as it was definitely not spicy enough.  

We also ordered the much talked about beef bulgogi soup and it was absolutely phenomenal.  I almost liked this one more than the other one because of that savoury taste that you get in every bite.  It was this perfect combination of sweet and salty.  

Side dishes were plentiful and if you wanted, you could get refills.  However, the portion size was quite plentiful and we were much too full to get refills afterwards.  

Overall, a neat place that I would definitely go to again."}
{"text":"\"Here is your raw egg.\"

Huh?

The gentleman hands me what looks like a raw egg.

\"What the hell do I do with this?\"  I ask him, in those words.    

\"YOU PUT IT IN THE BOILING HOT SOUP!!!\"  He screams back, shoving a large bowl of  boiling hot soup onto the table in front of me.

I do as he says.   After all,  I have no idea what the hell is going on here.    But I know that I did order something called Dolsimbab.     And I know that it looks mysteriously amazing.

Everyone loves this place, and now I know why."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my food here and will definitely return, but I tend to prefer variety in restaurants, especially when it comes to Korean food.

The 9 selections in this restaurant is easily the most limited I've ever seen. If you're coming here expecting table cooking or ramyun, you're gonna be extremely disappointed as they have none of those. However, what they do have is a wonderful selection of soon tofu, which all include stone pot rice; not bad at all!

I had the combination soon tofu and my friend had the kimchi soon tofu. Both of us were very satisfied with our food (the tofu was some of the best we've both had), including the soybeans, bean sprouts, kimchi, and purple rice (with some black beans may I add). In the future the soybean soon tofu intrigued me quite a bit, and I want to try that.

We were ignored for the first 10 or so minutes before I had to wave my hand in someone's way in order to get my order. Also, at the end, the cashier forgot what we ordered, so we had to recite the order to her. Aside from these two incidents service wasn't too terrible."}
{"text":"Great classic Korean food. All our dishes were yummy. The purple rice was great, the side dishes really good too. Very reasonably priced with good, fast service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The room decor is small but cozy and nice. Just like most Korean restaurants, there are many traditional restaurant things going for it. The menu is good, plenty of options for meat and vegans. I chose one of the top choices presented, and was not disappointed.

Overall, I can recommend going with a group for more better experience."}
{"text":"What a super-awesome place!

My friend and I came on a rainy afternoon, and we were pleasantly surprised to find the restaurant rather empty. The tables quickly piled up with people later on in the evening, and Korean words were heard from most of the tables. Personally when I see someone who is of Korean-descent eating in a Korean restaurant, I feel as though the restaurant is more authentic. (This is true for all other restaurants as well.)

The food arrived very quickly, accompanied with a pot of purple rice, fresh eggs, a water bottle and side dishes. The soup wasn't terribly spicy, and mixing it with the rice was delicious! The portions were well-sized and really filled us up. I had the dumpling soon-tofu soup, and it contained 2 dumplings, which is a rather tiny portion. The menu is very minimal, but that just means that this restaurant is especially focussed on soondubu!

It's not pricey at all and if I lived in Koreatown I would come here more often! I have no complaints about Buk Chang Dong."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!

This is a great place for Korean soups! Their menu is small but that just means they are specialized in a certain number of dishes. I usually order the bulgogi soup and my friend has ordered the tofu spicy soup several times. According to my friend, the spice level is sometimes inconsistent.

Atmosphere is loud, busy, and quite crowded but most Korean places are similar. It's definitely not a place to have a long, quiet conversation. 

There is parking at the back of the restaurant and the servers will ask you if you've parked there because they need to ensure that the spots are taken by customers.

This is definitely a convenient spot for those live in the area."}
{"text":"Food was great, love hot pot korean style food and those little plate of salty and spicy garnishes. those beans too. Had the bulgogi beef. Was a picture of beauty when it arrived. Crunchy rice at the bottom I loved it.

I sent the pic to my girlfriend who is trying to end our relationship and it made me cry. I miss our meals together this hurts 
I drank a beer felt terrible than left. ;("}
{"text":"The menu is really really small. But everything I ordered was great. Except once the rice is slightly burnt but that's probably the korean way of rice...lol..."}
{"text":"We came by on a Monday night as a group of 16.  At first we were a little disappointed the menu was so small.  However, we soon realized why!  The choices offered were cooked to perfection and we were so happy with the food!  We got the seafood pancake for starters.  It was the perfect thickness and level of crunchiness.  Everything we ordered was delicious and satisfied our tummies.  The service was great despite a few mistakes in our order, it was quickly resolved.  We would totally go back when we're in town again."}
{"text":"Actually a 3.5/5.

Another night of dining with Sandra T, we found our way to this corner restaurant in Korea town. There was a lineup but it didn't take very long to seat our party of 10.

The menu is pretty simple and everything is under $9. They also have pictures on the walls if you're new to Korean food and don't know what to get (which was me and my sister). 

I ordered the hot pot and my sister got the seafood soon tofu that Sandra T recommended. I didn't like the sauce that you're supposed to put into the hot pot so it was pretty plain without it. However, I really enjoyed the seafood soon tofu! Next time when I go back I'm totally getting that instead.

Thanks for dinner, Sandra T!"}
{"text":"I love the hot pots, they are so tasty and the colour is so rich. Do not fear the colour, they are not as spicy one might assume. Also they have a scale of spiciness which is rated as white, mild, medium, spicy and extra spicy. I wish they had a chicken dish. I usually get the vegetarian or the seafood, but I usually don't eat the shrimps in the seafood because they are whole shrimps including eyes still on them, which I am not a fan of. I love the purple rice it comes with and the side kimchi dishes. For $8 it is ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT! The tofu they use is the softest tofu I have ever had, my favorite type of tofu. Perfect winter meal, especially because it arrives boiling hot, with bubble and you crack in the raw egg for an extra experience. 

However, I read on the yelp forum that tip themselves, which I think is a good idea but wish I knew this before I tipped them double. The place does get packed, we waited for about ten minutes which is not a bad wait time. Must try place on my list!"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for sides! My ideal meal would consist of a medium portion entree and lots of sides. That is why \"Yay! I'm a fan!\" I like this place for the variety of kimchi and bean sprouts they serve with your hot pot, and the purple rice in a stone and their hot pot. I think you are suppose to add the sprouts and the kimchi to your hot pot, but I  just love eating it on its own. My question is how is the rice purple? I like the look and the taste of the purple rice. It doesn't really have huge taste difference from sticky rice but I simply like it!

I always go for the seafood hotpot! What I love is that it doesn't taste or smell fishy, and good amount of  tofu and served with a raw egg! The tofu is soft and accompanies the thin spicy broth very. I tried the extra spicy level last time and boy was it spicy but still good. I will tone it down a level next time. I love the colour of the hot pot it is a strong bold red, and arrives boiling! Cracking a raw egg and watching it almost instantly cook in the boiling hot pot is certainly very entertaining! Next time I plan on tried the vegetarian hot pot.  

Overall value: Good experience, decent food, and a very fair price! This place offers a true Korean experience. 

A block or so away from Christie subway station!"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend after our gym session around a week ago. Being the soon-tofu fan as I am. I fell deep in love with this place! 

There are many options for soon tofu (beef/meat, seafood, kimchi, etc). And I asked the server for their recommended or customer favorite, and he said it was the seafood or meat soon tofu that was most ordered. I went with the seafood option. You are able to pick between the spiciness levels (white, mild, medium, spicy, very spicy). I picked very spicy, but I find it to be just right (thank god!). Aside from that, their price is good and affordable. Domestic beer is $4! The servers responded well and were polite. We asked for more side dishes and they were given to us immediately (unlike other places).

Overall, I definitely would come back here. I feel like I might be giving out a 5-star rating too easily, but I think this place hit all the spots on my list."}
{"text":"My go-to restaurant whenever I'm craving for soup, my friends and I go here frequently and I enjoy it every time. 
I usually get the dumpling or kimchi soon tofu with my spicy level at mild, they have good side dishes and you can't go wrong with purple rice."}
{"text":"I still have lots of Korean restos to check out, but this is my \"go to\" in Sauga for hameul soondaebu. Always satisfying and consistently good! Lots of flavours that Korean food is known for. Go for extra spicy (it isnt as spicy as it sounds). Small menu but everything is tasty. Makes me miss Korea."}
{"text":"I guess I'll be the second (only?) to toss my hat in the bad review pile. I too, went to this place with high expectations from all the fanatically high praise. My verdict: meh.

I had the stone pot. That's the hot pot with the rice, noodles, vegetables and about 1 gram of some kind of flavourless shredded beef. and an egg on top. This dish had a very disappointing amount of flavour. I found myself adding just about every appetizer thing into the mix just to make it taste like something. The bean appetizer was a little too chewy, and everything else was pretty standard in terms of little dishes they bring you at korean restaurants (none of which ever blow me away). I will admit I did like how the rice gets golden and crunchy on the bottom of the pot for some reason.

I'm pretty open to just about every kind of food, and I find something to like in just about every cuisine, but I can't say any korean places i've been (there have been enough) have ever really impressed me all that much. Maybe I'm missing something, but probably not.

All in all. not worth returning. What is everyone smoking??"}
{"text":"Another must go place if you like Korean food but you live in North York. They only have several kinds of soft tofu soup, most of them are a bit spicy. Cold snowy days like today, Soft tofu soup warms me up. They are very busy. It is a small restaurant with tables put very tight one next to another. If you are looking for a place to talk over food, or having a working dinner, this is not a place for you. You feel being rushed to eat and leave because people are make a line up to get a table. Also if you cannot handle spicy, make sure you choose the right spicy level. Korean's mild can be spicy for non Koreans!"}
{"text":"I love this Korean tofu soup chain after trying it out at Mississauga and at Finch station. So I was extremely excited when this place opened up close to home! However, the quality of their tofu soup is definitely not the same as the other two locations. I've been here twice, ordered the kimchi version and noticed they were inconsistent with the taste! 

Still - they make better tofu soup than other Korean restaurants in the Richmond Hill area. Also, I like their hot stone pot of rice that comes alone with it and the side dishes (I'm a sucker for those :p). So if you're craving for Korean tofu soup, it's worth a try! 

Another good thing about this location is that there are no line ups/wait! (I know about the long wait at the Finch location.)"}
{"text":"I popped in to this spot after having read a few reviews. After hearing great things I walked in with an open mind, and an empty belly hoping for the best. I was not disappointed. I ordered the number two, refular spicy,  seafood soon tofu, oysters, mussels and shrimp. Although the quatity of seafood for me was a bit lacking, the flavour was really nice. A nice, spicy, subtlely seafood flavoured broth with copious amounts of fresh, soft tofu. The soon tofu is also served with purple rice (lots of it !) and assorted banchan. The kimchi was nicely fermented, the spicy daikon was better and the bean sprouts were really delicious. I would have like a tiny bit of more seasoning, read salt, but overall, a very satisfying lunch, tax, tip, all in for $10.As with  a lot of Asian restaurants the service is attentive but not obtrusive. I would recommend BCD for a cheap satisyfying lunch, but not a knock your socks off and call your Mom to tell her what you ate kind of place."}
{"text":"To start off with one of the most authentic Korean food I have ever had in my life. The Kim chi was excellent and the tofu soup was so filling and really hot I could tell it was fresh they had 30 mins left to close they still had excellent customer service. The price was excellent. The dumpling appetizers was excellent and they had a unique dish just purple rice with water I think it is a traditional  in Korea I could tell this is a Korean restaurant just by walking in any restaurnat kain thing attracts me is customer service and this place exceeded my expectations I am definitely coming back"}
{"text":"First, this place was jam-packed on a Saturday evening and the restaurant was seriously understaffed for 16 full tables. When the waiter told us to sit down, we had to wait like 10 minutes to get the menu, tea and napkins. We also saw a lot of new tables having the same issue as us. 

The menu is super limited due to the restaurant specializing in soon tofu, which is not a big deal. Price point is reasonable for this type of Korean food. But the soup bowls were on the smaller side and it seems like they cheaped out on the ingredients inside the soup (for ex. meat). We ordered Dumpling Soon Tofu and Kimchi Soon Tofu. We also got to pick the spicy levels from not spicy to extra spicy. The soups are okay but nothing special. For ban chans, we got kimchi, beans, bean sprouts and radishes, which is nothing out of the ordinary. 

The food also took forever to come out.. at least 30 mins or more. During this time of waiting, other tables were still not being served either. The waiters also never came around to refill tea either. I mean I would've wished they would leave a pot of tea on the tables like how some other Korean restaurants do it. 

Anyway, the service overall was extremely slow and it really made the experience not as enjoyable. Since the food was nothing special, I don't think I'll come here to eat again."}
{"text":"A very simple and basic Korean restaurant serving only 8 items on the menu.  This is not a knock because they are all ~$8 and that's the biggest plus here.  You can get everything you would expect from your traditional Korean meal - the banchan, miso soup, bulgogi or soondubu or bibimbap, rice (+ the water to pick up the remaining rice stuck to the stone pot) for all under $10 = highway robbery."}
{"text":"It's a chain. Now, ask yourself, when was the last time you go to a chain for top-notch authentic cuisine experience.
The flavors are there, but the variety in banchan and soondubu selection is pathetic. The bibimbap was awful; mushy rice with the most meager morsels of ground beef with a dollop of the kochujang sauce on a side dish. (When they ask if ground beef is ok, SAY NO!). 
You'd think quality and some semblance of quantity would be there to compensate for such a lean menu. The beef in my kimchi soondubu was flavorless and tough.
Disappointing time and time again. 
For generous portion, authentic flavor, and variety, I'd much rather go to Sunrise House down the block."}
{"text":"I love this place!

- service is fast (unless there's a lineup but that doesnt happen often)
- cheap
- filling
- delicious
- relatively healthy
- has vegetarian options"}
{"text":"2nd visit this week, it must mean something!

Their menu is simple, but delicious! I don't ever have to worry about the taste because it's the same at all their locations."}
{"text":"It's always a good idea, but even better on cold, rainy nights!

My friend ordered the kimchi soon tofu and I got the seafood soon tofu. What's good is that you can customize the level of spice from mild to extra spicy. Your order comes with a raw egg that you can add to your soup, if desired and comes with 4 standard banchans (kimchi, spicy radish, peanuts and bean sprouts).

Tip: even if you can handle very spicy food, don't get the extra spicy - it makes your food salty!

I like the simplicity of their menu and the service of their staff."}
{"text":"This place wins out for taste, consistency, and value! A hearty, filling meal for $7?! It's unheard of -- you would pay more at most fast food/self-catering places. 

The menu is small and you come here for the soon (soft tofu stew). I usually get the beef one or the vegetarian one (comes with nice pieces of broccoli and zucchini), which comes with a nice selection of banchan (bean sprouts in a sesame oil sauce is my fave) and purple rice. You can select your spiciness level from white (no spice) to extra spicy. They also have bibimbap, but I've never tried it here. 

The service is efficient and fast from taking your order, bringing out plates, and paying at the front desk. I always come here when I'm in the mood for something quick and satisfying in Koreatown."}
{"text":"Food 4/5
Service 2/5

The food is good, if you're looking to try good Korean soups this is a nice place. I ordered the kimchi/tofu soup and it was nice but I've definitely had better.

The service was lackluster. They were not attentive and had a difficult time understanding what I was trying to ask of them."}
{"text":"Kind of tucked away in a basement in Dundas. The decor is very plain but they're a very cute little place.

Ordered the mixed tofu stew with beef, mussels and shrimp. I ordered it spicy and it had an awesome kick to it. Everything felt small: the egg was small, shrimp were tinyyyyy and I could barely see any pieces of beef, and the tofu was a little too firm.  However, the broth was delicious and the pickled daikon banchan was very good.

Staff is very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Every time I go to known I always go to this restaurant. Amazing service and very friendly waiters. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It is what it is. A short simple menu of soon tofu, with typical Korean side dishes and rice. Not so exceptional that I'd drive out of my way to eat here, but consistent enough that I know what I'm in for. And if I'm in the mood for tofu soup, and in the neighbourhood, this is as good a choice as any. I'd rate it at 3.5 if I could. 

Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food:
[*] Disappointing. Just...no. 
[**] Not very good. Will not return. 
[***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality. 
[****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints. 
[*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"A huge fan of the soon tofu with beef and dumplings. The tofu in the soup that they make here is super smooth, silky, and not too firm. There are various levels of spiciness that you can choose from. I typically have a very low to medium spice tolerance so I would say mild is just right.

The flavour really kicks at first near the beginning of your meal but after about 15 minutes once the soup cools down you will no longer taste the spiciness as much. The soup is also served with purple rice which is great. I feel warm each time eating here and it's a great place to come during these cold winter months. The seats can be a bit crammed, but nonetheless cozy

Their meals come with side dishes as well which include kimchi, maple dunked potatoes, sweet beans that are hard, and pickled vegetabies.

The bulgogi beef rice set is good as well but I still admire the tofu much more

If you are looking for variety I would say the menu options are more limited with a menu options that span only two pages. Unfortunately the prices have increased as well since last year, but food is still great nonetheless"}
{"text":"Comfort food!!! It was my first time coming to this BCD location given that I frequent the North York Location. This place was packed when we arrived and we were greeted by the friendly old lady that runs the place. She is adorable. Side dishes included my favourite (bean sprouts) along with kimchi, beans and pickled radish. I'm not the biggest fan of kimchi but I must say the kimchi here I liked and per suggestion of my friend, I added it to my soon tofu to add a bit more flavour. I ordered the dumpling soon tofu in mild but next time I think I'd add a bit more heat given I found it to be not enough flavour. I also found it not as hot as I wanted when it arrived.  For those of you who like crispy rice stuck to the stone pot, this is your place! The purple rice here is scooped out for you in the beginning when the soon tofu comes and the rice stuck on bottom of the pot is left for those who are fans. Overall, perfect place for some korean comfort food which offers good value for the price. However,  I still think the North York location is better ... 3.5/5!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with a party of 5. The food was great! I had the dumpling soup extra spicy. The tofu in the soup was plenty and the meal left me fulfilled. The servers seemed cranky though."}
{"text":"Over the years my wife and I have dined many times at the other locations (mississauga and north york)
Her fav restaurant.. She was quite pleased when i told her there was a location much closer to home...

No thinking when we are here.. Always combo#1 extra spicy for both of us..
Staff here is always friendly... im pretty sure even the chef in the back recognize us when we walk in..

Restaurant is clean and spacious.. Definitely more space to stretch out compared to the other locations..

Food is pretty much on par/duplicate as the other locations down to the side dishes..
Five stars since the food makes my wife happy .. which makes me happy.."}
{"text":"Love the combination tofu soup! Not expensive Korean restaurant. Wish could a dd more food choices! Like BBQ"}
{"text":"Love it. the food is really light, so you don't feel full after.. and people are very nice."}
{"text":"Disgusting mush. More tofu than soup. Miniature prawns were inedible. Grainy soup. People who enjoy must be delusional."}
{"text":"Consistently good Korean hot pot soups and bibimbap. Very authentic vibe. The appetisers that comes with bibimbap is excellent kimchee, daikon, sesame sprouts and a delicious bean dish. Very reasonably priced and courteous service."}
{"text":"Even though this place is cheap, you still don't get what you pay for. What a terrible location for this franchise. 

Seafood Soon Tofu- the only seafood in my bowl was an oyster the size of a nickel, a shrimp (with a very dark grey head) that was smaller than the spoon, and a small mussel. All of the seafood tasted unfresh or freezer burned- I didn't eat any of it. The rest of this bowl was just tofu and soup.  

We also ordered the Dumpling Soon Tofu, which came with dumplings and also meat in the bowl- it was just okay. The kimchi here tastes too sour because it's been kept for too long. Yes, kimchi is fermented but the kimchi here is way past it's best before- it tasted spoiled to me. The other two banchan were not very memorable and we did not want refills. 

I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone, very disappointing- I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I'm obsessed with Soon Tofu soup, I literally try to hit every korean spot that gets referred to me in hopes to find THE BEST Soon Tofu soup. When I walked into the restaurant, I kind of expected the place to be a bit bigger but it did look like a lot of korean restaurants that I've been to so it wasn't a big deal. We were settled at a table that was next to a huge menu placed on the wall, I thought the menu was more of a decoration because I didn't anticipate such a small menu but to my surprise it was the actual menu. They had a few soon tofu soup options and a couple of meat platter dishes. Of course I ordered the Dumpling Soon Tofu soup and when my food arrived, they gave me my soup with an egg and purple rice in the pot. The waitress scooped the rice out of the pot and into a bowl then proceeded to add water into the hot stone pot. I carefully cracked my egg into the soup and it thickened a bit and I dug in, and boy was I not disappointed. The soup was SO flavorful and it had the right amount of spiciness that made me pant for air to cool off my tongue. The dumpling fillings were outside of it's doughy shell but I was okay with it. I ate every last spoon of my soup without a single drop to spare so I've concluded that as of right now, this is my absolute favorite Soon Tofu place in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Cons:
1st impression was so-so... cheap or nonexistent décor/atmosphere.
Menu is tiny, only 9 food items, very limited # of drinks... was looking for Korean BBQ ribs, none on the menu so I had the broiled BBQ beef which was good, served with a few side dishes, loved the dark little bean type item, not sure what it is though???
My partner had the beef dumpling soon tofu which was the only item he could have since he has to avoid any type of shellfish, pork or mushrooms... probably won't be returning because of this... 
Not sure why they poured water into the rice pot... after reading another review, should have asked them not to!
Pros:
Affordable, convenient location, food did taste good, free parking behind the resto (I think). We had already paid for parking on the street..."}
{"text":"As a tofu soup lover who has a low tolerance for heat, this place is my favourite tofu soup spot! They have a wide range of spiciness and a limited menu that mainly comprises of tofu soup combinations.
I recently had the combination soup which has beef, shrimp and mussels. The soup is great - very flavourful and tasty soup for the plain option, something that resembles a well cooked bone soup (couldn't tell if its beef or pork). In it are your toppings plus silken smooth tofu. (If you don't enjoy seafood, you aren't left with much options). They give you rice, an egg and side dishes along with it.
I wasn't particularly impressed this visit since there were many bits of the shrimp shell that came off into the soup and it was very unpleasant. The bottom of the plastic dish tasted soapy, so the sides were not very nice when you got to the end of it.
I would still come back, since this is the kind of comfort food you crave every now and then. It's cheap and simple, but I would really appreciate some improvements."}
{"text":"Went in here on a whim while my partner and I were out enjoying the weather recently. We went in looking to see if you could order and carry out and instead were whisked away to a table before we could object, so we just went with it! 

We got shoved into a back alcove extremely close to a table of four, it was super claustrophobic and honestly awkward, and we waited quite a while until someone remembered to come take our order, but the waiter was super sweet and apologetic and we had tea to tide us over, so no worries! 

I ordered the bulgogi soup, and it was soooooo good, oh my god. Been dreaming of it ever since. It's definitely very sweet, so if you don't like that, probably avoid it. My partner got a tofu soup-can't quite remember which one, but they liked it a lot and said the tofu was super silky. 

Small selection of side dishes-soy beans, kimchi, pickled radish and sprouts. Not as much of these as I've had at other Korean places, esp for two people, but I ended up so full from the soup and purple rice it didn't matter. 

The waiters leave you alone while you're eating, which is a plus for me. Washrooms were fine, didn't have any of the issues other ppl have described. Good price. It's bustling and busy, and feels like it would be a great place to spend a winter night. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome Korean food restaurant! Good portion size yummy side dishes and quick service. Prices were pretty good as well given the portion and quality of the dishes - I got the seafood soon tofu which came to roughly $10. Only thing I'd say negative was that there wasn't enough seafood in the stew but the soup base itself was delicious. FYI there are various spice levels you can get for your food - I think there were five levels between basic and spicy. I got spicy and it was decently hot where I could still enjoy my food, definitely enhanced the flavours in the stew. Would come back!"}
{"text":"Been to the other location near Finch with a good experience there and decided to head here for lunch. Ordered the kimchi soon tofu and on a cold day it really hit the spot. The soup wasn't too salty and spice level was good too. The rice and side dishes were all tasty, and menu items all priced reasonably. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Similar food to the BCD Soon Tofu in North York on Yonge St... just not as busy. 

Consistent quality and price as the North York experience."}
{"text":"Drove up from Scarborough to go on Easter Sunday. Fantastic food. The bulgogi soup is so great. Good side dishes too. Might even be better than the Christie location!"}
{"text":"Simplicity is the best. Even with only 8 items in their menu, they have line ups every single time i go. That must tell u something..."}
{"text":"Whenever I am sick I go for Soon Tofu ! The spiciness clears out your sinuses and soup is just always good for you :P plus its cheap and its good food. Remember to bring cash."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something warm during the winter. This place is the best. It offers different kind of tofu soups or bulgogi set in a reasonable price. 

All their set comes with purple rice (except the bibimbap) and also some side dishes. An egg for the soup set so that you can pour it into the hot soup once it arrived. 

They offer different range of spiciness, from no spice, mild,Medium, Regular to Extra spicy. i would encouraged people to try the medium in the first place, in case anyone who can not handle the spiciness needs extra kleenex while having their meals."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Food not particularly spectacular but is up to standard for authentic korean cuisine. Side dishes use some room for improvement. My boy friend and I together ordered the bulgogi on sizzling plate with rice, vegetable soon tofu, and shared a seafood pancake. All came to a total of $40 with tips and tax. Reasonably priced for relatively good food! Sadly we forgot to take pictures in the presence of good food...next time!"}
{"text":"For the longest time, I wasn't a huge fan of korean. I spent a term living right beside Koreatown and rarely ever visited the restaurants on the strip. However, since visiting the Owl of Minerva in Waterloo, I suddenly developed a love for kimchi tofu soup. Although my affection was invigorated at the Owl, this restaurant really served the best soup I've had (albeit I've only been to a handful of Korean places). 
I'm not certain what makes the soup here different, but I have a hunch that they start with excellent pork broth for their kimchi soup, whereas other places may not dedicate as much time to the broth, or they may even use water. Unlike the other restaurants I've been to, Buk chang also provides an egg to crack into the soup, and I fricking love runny eggs. 
On another note, I got the extra spicy here. I usually get the spiciest level of spice at Korean restaurants, as Korean food is on the milder side. Unfortunately, I wish I only got spicy. The soup was delicious, so delicious that I wish I wasn't only feeling the heat! My fault for overestimating my abilities, of course. 
I also enjoyed the banchan here, with my favourites being the daikon (of course), as well as their soybeans. They serve something like a dry natto - tons of umami flavour, but not slimy or.. funky-smelling. If anyone knows what this is called or where I can buy it, I'd love to know. 
All in all, great place to get a delicious, filling meal for $10."}
{"text":"Wow - I can't believe it took me so long to visit!  This place was jam-packed at noon on Sunday and with good reason. The food is excellent and the price is more than reasonable. Definitely going to return here very soon....prompt, friendly waiters don't hurt either ;-)"}
{"text":"I'm Korean and this is my favourite place to come for Korean stews!  It consistently makes my mouth water and reminds me of Korea."}
{"text":"Their menu is simple - 9 total items listed. Even so I had a hard time deciding between their sizzling bibimbap and piping hot soon tofu! 

I went with their medium spicy veggie soon tofu - a bit of a kick but I would say I can take on their extra spicy with no problem. Our dishes were served limited banchans but two of were already my usual favorites - bean sprouts and black beans. They were a bit understaffed especially since this place was beyond packed. But they still did an amazing job refilling our banchans and water + tea. 

Averaging only $10 dollar per person, cheap and delicious meal - a definite return!"}
{"text":"I'm having second thoughts of this place being a \"healthy\" place to dine-in at!  Especially if you order Beef + Pork soon tofu, the broth can be greasy - mine was.  And the pieces of pork that were in the broth were quite fatty as well.

In addition, the soon tofu was overly salty, whereas the bulgolgi dish was a bit too sweet.  So take note of the additional salt/sugar that can be added to these dishes."}
{"text":"Love their soondoobu! Taste excellent! Also love their bulgogi dish and bibimbap. Taste amazing."}
{"text":"\"Food is okay but service is so so so awful. No respect on customers\"

I have been a loyal customer who visits at least once a week, even after they have raised the price by 10% since this September.

Today, I went to this restaurant as normal however the service was really disappointing. There were small flys in the store, flying over the  dishes.

Meanwhile, the waiters didn't provide good service since the store is busy during the dinner time. I talked to 2 waiters for my first one-time side dish refill, but it never came after I waited for over 10 mins. As a result, I didn't finish up the rice as usual and when I checked the bill, I told the cashier (I believe she is also the store owner) that I wouldn't leave tips as usual since the service is terrible today. 


She looked very disappointed and told me everyone here was happy( in other words, you should leave a tip). I explained that I had been waiting for the side dish refill for 10 minutes, speaking to the waiters two times and it never came. Then, she got impatient. She explained that you can only refill side dish once ( I believe there is some misunderstanding here, maybe she thought I asked for two refills but actually I just spoke with 2 waiters and asked for one refill since my first refill never came). I tried to explained more cleanly, however, she just waved her hand impolitely and shouted:\" You can just go\".

I think the store is busy so they don't care about customers. How can they be so impolite to a customer who shows his disappointment and actively gives feedbacks! What they should really care is not the $3 (15%) tips but the reason why the customer was reluctant to give the tip. They should learn to respect customers who give feedbacks since disappointed customers can just leave without saying a word.

Anyway, I swear I would never go to this restaurant again. I will definitely choose other Korean restaurants( e.g. Lim Ga Ne and Nak Won) as substitutes.

But to tell the truth, if you don't care about how you are treated, this place could be a choice sine the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"I was suprise that they didnt have gamjatang. Hence, the score of 3. Food was just good. I'm actually looking forward to try the squid. Will comeback and update the review later on."}
{"text":"Absolutely favorite Korean place to eat! Services are always amazing and the place is good enough that it's not crowded at all. They have one of the best side dishes especially that radish and bean sprout! Always purple rice which makes you feel more special since it's not your typical white rice. I love their bulgogi with rice because the meat is so tender and the sauce is just the right flavoring! My friends have tried their soup and all gave amazing reviews as well! Overall 10/10 would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my wife's favorites in town, best soon tofu we have in GTA. Price is very good. Items in their menu is limited, showing that they only focus on what they are good at - soon tofu. Besides tofu, you may also want to try their bulgogi beef."}
{"text":"This place was so good. It almost didn't matter that I was in Toronto during a heat wave and had no business ordering a spicy hot soup when I only had an hour between screenings.... I reasoned that the hot soup would somehow raise my body temp and that would prepare me for the freezing cold Visa screening room.

I love Korean food, and with the strong asian influence in Hawaii, I've grown up with it. But I've only recently discovered the spicy soupy goodness of tofu soup. When I realized that the Bloor Hot Docs theater was on the edge of Koreatown, I made it my life's mission to eat at one of the restaurants in Koreatown before the end of the festival. In order to get to this restaurant I had to walk past several other ok-rated Korean restaurants and I was half regretting my choice to walk so far since I was dangerously close to running out of time. But this place was totally worth it. The only thing that could've made this better was if there had been more rice. But since I was short on time, it helped me keep my lunch short. The soup was spicy and flavorful and had a healthy serving of seafood and the sides were also very good.

If I go back to TIFF, I'm definitely going to find my way back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth going out of your way for. I had the dumpling soondubu and my mom had the kimchi soondubu both of which were excellent. The tofu tasted very fresh and the broth was tasty. I ordered extra spicy which will make your nose run, but was quite manageable. Not very many banchan (sides), but all were very good, especially the radish. Very reasonable prices (~$10 each after taxes and tip), and you definitely won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Writeoff: Just go to Hmart or Gallaria and buy the pre-made soups.  This place uses so much salt in their food you will have no idea on taste but I can assure the quality is not good."}
{"text":"Hands down favourite Korean restaurant in Toronto!!! The price is amazing and the food is delicious. Food is served in a hot stone pot, that comes with rice (and an egg that you crack into your pot for certain dishes). After they carve out the rice, they pour water into the bowl to create a congee-like soup for you to drink/eat afterwards. I'm always stuffed after coming here!
Not an ideal place for a large group of people, i think I only saw 2 round tables that fit up to around 6 people. Go early during the weekends for dinner since there's always a line up after 6pm!
They also have free parking at the back!"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Toronto. I could genuinely eat here every single day and not get tired of it. The extra spicy tofu vegetable soup is some of the best, and I'm shocked it's so inexpensive. A must-eat in the city."}
{"text":"My go-to Korean joint with my girlfriend whenever we want our fix, almost nothing but positive things to say about the restaurant! 

If you love soup, there are a few to choose from, and if soup's not your thing, the broiled bbq is an option along with the bibimbap. I personally get the BBQ 98% of the time (I've had soup probably twice to three times though!) and it never fails to satisfy! Flavourful and loaded with lots of meat and veggies at the price point, I definitely have no complaints. 

We also always ask for seconds of banchan - especially the kimchi and bean sprouts - and sometimes even go for thirds! 

The service is also great - they all speak english which is nice and they try and get your banchan to your table as soon as you finished ordering, so you have something to hold you over while your food is prepared. Some of them even recognize us by face now too! 

The restaurant interior isn't anything amazing, but seats are comfy, tables are appropriately sized, and there are bigger group tables available should you be bringing a group of 5 or more. 

One thing to note: if you're thinking of coming by during the colder months be prepared to wait! Line ups are frequent for their amazing soups and it's not hard to see why.

Definitely one of my favourite restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"This place is great and super cheap. Approximately $10 a person. Very satisfying on a cold day. This is a place that you're really only here for the food. This place looks like shit inside."}
{"text":"Like many fellow reviewers, the soon tofu is delicious.  I also quite like the bulgogi which is served on a sizzling plate.  The restaurant seating is a bit tight though, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Yum! Cheap, friendly restaurant with generously-sized, delicious platters. The kimchi soup is fiery but delectable. It's hard to go wrong with $3 beer."}
{"text":"This place really delivers on value for your money. The meals here are cheap and have huge portions. I was debating whether to give 3 or 4 stars as I didn't necessarily enjoy what I was eating but thought it was a good experience nonetheless. I ordered the beef soon tofu off the limited menu and could not even come close to finishing the tofu and rice. I wasn't even sure what \"soon tofu\" was upon ordering was but my dining companion could not stop raving about it so I took the chance. 
Service was efficient and not overbearing. The soon tofu meals are basically identical here with the exception of protein changes or vegetable additions. They all come as a set with fermented vegetables. The kimchi here was definitely not the best I've ever had unfortunately. 
The main gripe I had with my food was that there was too much tofu. Ok, I know what you're thinking...duh, of course there's going to be a large amount of tofu! However, let me state that there was so little beef and other veggies, it felt like eating a big bowl of tofu soup. At the end of the meal, I realized I'm not the biggest fan of Korean food but the meal wasn't remotely horrible as my dining companion enjoyed theirs and there was a huge line out the door."}
{"text":"Most reviews cite Buk Chang Don Soon Tofu as one of the leaders in casual Korean food.  Kind of like a movie everybody says it great..you show up with high expectations and hope for best.

There is no doubt that this place has received many accolades as the result of offering good food at good prices.

I found the banchan a little measly compared to some other places I've been to. Equally cheap was the fact that I had two shrimp and one mussel in a large bowl of tofu soup. 

That said, the tofu was amazing. It had perfect texture and along with it's slight sweetness, complemented the broth nicely.  

I guess this place is like going to a decent movie with a good plot and a weak supporting cast on a Tuesday night. It's a good experience at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The one time we went to visit, the soup was tasteless and far below our expectation compared to the buckchang tofu in downtown Korean Town..."}
{"text":"This seemed like a tucked away hidden place. When we got into the restaurant, it was already full. However, we didn't have to wait long before getting a table.

We ordered a seafood tofu soup and a dumpling tofu soup. Our food came with 4 side huge portioned dishes - kimchi, pickled radishes, honey soy beans and another dish. The purple rice came in a heated bowl. The food was good, price was cheap and the service was great.

This definitely warms the body up on a cold day. Definitely come check this place out!"}
{"text":"The food is filling & tasty, the tofu is soft and silky, service is great, and there are $3 domestic beers.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I am Korean and I love Korean food and this restaurant (both Bloor location and this location) is by far my fav. Korean restaurant to go to. I always get extra spicy kimchi soon tofu and it's like good ol' home cooked meal. Crack your egg as soon as your soup comes out as that will help cook the egg and it's a surprise bonus near the end of your meal.

If you are not a big fan of hot soup, that's okay because their bi bim bap (rice w/ veggies, egg, beef, mix w/ Korean hot sauce served in hot stone bowl) and bul go gi (marinated beef on sizzling plate) is amazing too. 

You also get a bowl of hot sticky rice. They scoop the cooked rice to a bowl for you to enjoy with your tofu soup or bulgogi and pour the water in the hot stone bowl where there are still remainders of rice that's stuck to the bottom of the hot stone bowl. You can eat this after you finish your bowl of rice and it's soooo good and heart-warming.
Note: you don't get this hot sticky rice bowl when you order bi bim bap.

You also get free water/tea and ban chan (side dishes) and these are amazing too. Usually ban chan are complimentary side dishes that always given with your meal at Korean restaurants. You don't have to eat them if you don's want, or you can ask for more for free of charge.

One more tip for bi bim bap for those who are not Korean as I see this very often. When bi bim bap comes out, use your SPOON to mix in your Korean hot sauce and really mix your whole bowl thoroughly before you start eating. You want all of your 'stuffing' to be mixed well to truely enjoy this food! I sometimes see foreigners using chopstick and they start eating without mixing it, but unless you like it like that for some reason, the dish is supposed to be enjoyed mixed. Hence called bi bim bap (Mixed Rice).

Food is Cheap here and Service is great. On weekends, there may be line ups and you may have to wait, but it's worth every penny!

Enjoy."}
{"text":"One of my favourite place to go to when I'm feeling unwell and want some good warm soup! For $10.62 +tax, you can't go wrong at all. I got the Combination Soon Tofu, full of tofu and beef, one shrimp and one mussel. I got it plain (without spice) and it was still flavourful."}
{"text":"All of the food places my boyfriend and I ate in Toronto were on the go or something quick and etc.  

He decided on this night he wanted to actually go somewhere, where we can sit, order and take our time.  As with the all the other places we tried, yelp led us here.  

This place offers a simple menu compared to the Korean places they have in Los Angeles.  If I recall correctly, I think they only have 4 or 5 choices.  Also, this place compared to places in Los Angeles gives A LOT less sides.  They only had 4 - kim chi, bean sprouts, spicy pickled radish, and some weird bean thing.  I looooved the 3 of 4, minus the weird bean thing.  

Oh, they also served the best tasting multi-grain rice I have ever tried!!!!"}
{"text":"Consistent.  This place is always the same.  Good.  Does not appear to have MSG in the food which is always a good thing.  Had the dwen-jang sundubu chigae, with tons of gochu - and of course the dolsot bap --- mmmmm.  Korean comfort food.  Tubu fresh and silky.

Spouse had the hwae mool sundubu which was gorgeous - nice New Zealand mussel in both our chigaes.

Panchan is lacklustre.  But I don't go here for the panchan.  Also - staff are always friendly and polite.  Solid place."}
{"text":"This is where I tried my very first Soon Tofu dish, and the best one I have ever tried. The broth is perfect, not too garlicky and they allow you to choose the level of spiciness. 

I've been to several Buk Chang Doon Soon Tofu locations and they all taste the same. The size of restaurant is quite small, and you may encounter some waiting time during peak hours. But the line does moves quickly and smoothly. The menu is very plain and simple, there are a few variations of Soon Tofu- seafood, vegetables, kimchi, etc. And 3 other dishes, one being bibimbap. The soon tofu comes with a bowl of purple rice, and an uncooked egg. Once the broth arrives, beware it's very hot and bubbling, crack the egg into the broth and let it cook. And so it begins, this is how I eat it: scoop a spoonful of rice, dip the spoonful of rice into the Soon Tofu broth and straight into your mouth. Mmmmmmmmm so good! This is perfect on a cold winter day to warm up your body."}
{"text":"I ordered the Kimchi Soon Tofu soup (medium spiciness) and it was pretty good, with lots of flavor and heat. The banchan side dishes were pretty fresh and tasty, and the soup had a good amount of meat and very silky, rich tofu. I would recommend getting medium or higher spiciness for more flavor and authenticity. The food was well priced ($9 for a bowl) and I will definitely come back here when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This place has a very small menu; I think there's only about 9 dishes. Love their soup here. They offer different range of spiciness. It ranges from no spice, mild, medium, regular to extra spicy. I usually get Kimchi soon tofu in mild because too spicy ain't my thing. Their soups are very flavourful. They come with a bowl of rice and a bunch of side dishes. Their soup is price at a reasonable price and you can easily get a yummy and filling meal for under $10

The reason why i didn't give this place a five star is because I don't like how the bowls the side dishes come in smell like really strong dish detergent..."}
{"text":"Likely one of my favs in the area for Korean food. Been here on several occasions. The service is good and food arrives quickly after ordering. 

The menu isn't extensive but they know how to get it all done efficiently. Ordered the Tofu spicy soup which came w/ the purple rice. It was bubbling hot and the spice level was perfect (you get to pick from none, mild, medium, etc.) Dinner was so filling. It also came with some side dishes. Price was excellent as well.

Pay at the cash and don't come w/ a big group at dinner time or expect to wait a while for a table. The restaurant is very popular in the area."}
{"text":"A place that specializes in one thing only, and does it so well - Soon Tofu. I'm glad they subscribe to that philosophy. 

I've been coming here for a little while now they've got me hooked. The only reason you come here is because you're craving the soup. It's just so damn good. 

Over the past little while, I've noticed things getting a little smaller, service getting just a touch shabbier, but in all honesty, it's still a phenomenal place. 

It's got the home feeling that adds to the authenticity. It's a magical place that you stop by and realize you're much happier by the time you're done. Hope this place never changes!"}
{"text":"Not much to look at inside, but the soon tofu soups are flavorful and fulfilling. Small menu so they specialize and have their stuff together. I tried them out as a Korean newbie and it turned me onto Korean food so much that I sought it out when I came home. I tried a soon tofu soup at a local spot near home and their's weren't nearly as good. I crave for their soup!! The accompanying vegetables were also good! I bought a side of kimchi to go. Delicious! They have a 15$ credit card minimum. Highly recommend and I'll be back for sure! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I believe this place started my long lasting love affair with soon tofu. 

Well not this exact one, it was the original one in k-town downtown Toronto, but they have the same menu. Many years ago one of my korean friend took me there, and I have since developed constant cravings for soon tofu (and get frustrated when I can't have access to good ones).

Their menu is small, only 2 pages with one page full of a variety of tofu stews and some other traditional korean dishes. 

Soon tofu is served with raw egg and purple rice, in a boiling hot stone stew pot. Tofu is so smooth and and the flavour is so rich, it has the magical power to make me happy for many hours after. 

Warning, you can choose the level of spiciness of your stew. The most spicy one is REALLY hot, eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"Feel like authentic Korean food in which the staff and the patrons are Korean too?! Then this is the place. It's small with small tables and whatever you order will fill the entire table. There only about 9 different meals you can get and they range from a meat dish to a tofu soup dish. They all come with the typical Korean sides. Food prices are $8 to $12 before tax and tip. Sides are refillable without charge. I think you gotta try this place if you are into Korean food in anyway as the soups are extremely flavourful and the meat is tender and cooked perfectly. There is available parking in the rear.

Go for: Korean food!!!!

Don't go for: a late night hang out spot with drinks or daily specials with nice decor, it's all business here, you eat and then you leave cuz there's a line up outside"}
{"text":"At Buk Chang Dong, for $8 you can stuff yourself with delicious spicy tofu soup, rice, and all those crazy Korean side dishes. Even if you're not a fan of this style of soup you have to recognize that they do things right here.

I had a regular spicy vegetarian soup ($7.08) which comes with mushroom, zucchini, broccoli, and onion. Apart from the broccoli, the only vegetable to maintain its texture after boiling, the vegetables don't really do much; it's all about the silky smooth tofu and spicy broth. I love the purple rice this came with and I wish I got a second bowl. And, of course, you also get 4 different sides. My favourites are the spicy pickled vegetables and the bean sprouts which have a nice smoky flavour; I'm not a kimchi guy.

Apart from the food the experience is also fun. I love the ritual of cracking the egg into the bubbling soup and transferring the rice from the stone bowl.

I brought a bunch of people from work, some of whom aren't very adventurous with food, and everyone went away happy with the food, the experience, and the price."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto for a weekend, and as a Korean, of course I wanted to check out Koreatown and do some shopping/eating. I saw a ton of great reviews for this place, and I love soon tofu, so I was really looking forward to trying it. Unfortunately, it didn't wow me. 

There was nothing particularly wrong with the food, but it just didn't taste as good as other soon tofu I've had. The worst thing about my dining experience was the customer service. Although there were only a few other tables there when we sat down, the waiters failed to come and take our order for a long time and were just standing in a corner talking among themselves. The manager/owner that was at the cashier desk was also a bit rude to us when we were paying. 

The price was reasonable though, and the food came out quickly. However, I definitely won't be returning here."}
{"text":"I loved every bit of it. Simple menu, honest stick to your bones food without any of the fancy additions. 

The kimchi was by far the best I've had so far in the city, wonderfully spicy and perfectly pickled!

The broth and meat were flavourful and soft, the kind of broth that says it's been simmering for a day or two.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"$8 for a pretty decent Korean meal. Good comfort food - they mainly serve Korean tofu soup , comes with either seafood, dumplings, beef etc. They also provide you with a raw egg which you crack in, and side dishes of course.

Unique thing that sets it apart is the multii-grain purple rice rather than the traditional white rice. You can also set your spiciness level.

Other than that, I'm not sure why this place is so packed when I can get something like this at other Korean places as well."}
{"text":"I knew things were going bad when the waiter started moving our table without saying a word. I was resting my arm on the table when out of no where the waiter starts pulling my table away. Things got worse when another waiter started clearing another table and instead of putting the other table's things on a cart, he proceeded to put another table's bottles and cups on our table! WTF! When we were ready to finally order I wanted to get a dish a little spicier (which they've done before) he told me that they don't do that any more. WTF! I only came to this place a second time because my friend wanted to try it but I'm never coming back here again. The food was ok but the service sucked!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of 'soon tofu' in general. The 'soon tofu' here is authentic, and it's pretty tasty, and the price is cheap and it's quick & fast. I used to go here very often until I found out through a friend that they re-use the leftover side dishes!! (ie, kimchi, beans, radish ...) I stopped going as soon as I heard that.

There are only a few menu's here,
beef, mixed, seafood, bean paste 'soon tofu', comes with stone bowl rice and 'noo roong ji' afterwards.
bi bim bap, bul gogi and some others which most of them are pretty good.


The service you get here is probably one of the worst you can get in Toronto. Don't be surprised if they forget to take your order or forget to refill your side dishes as they are super busy. Once I saw one of the employees having a loud argument with one of the customers about something, I was sitting far away and couldn't really tell what they were arguing about, but in any circumstance I would never yell at any customer if I was the server. I'm surprised the owner didn't say anything as she was watching this at the counter. It's just unacceptable.

Overall, tofu is good, side dishes are poor and not sure if it's hygienic, service is very poor, I'm disappointed.

I go out of my way to go to the downtown location as they are owned separately and they seem to have better service."}

{"text":"I was shocked with their simple menu! There aren't many items on the menu, and the price is...very cheap!!!  

I ordered Kimchi Soon Tofu with Meat (both pork and beef). The good thing about this place is they let you choose the spiciness level. For those who love spicy, don't forget to choose Extra Spicy. The Regular Spicy level isn't spicy at all. It comes with purple rice, and 1 egg to put in the soup. The tofu was soft and silky but the amount of meat is not a lot. The broth is flavourful tho. It was my first time trying the purple rice. It has great texture and I heard it's very healthy.

They don't have many side dishes to eat while waiting for your order tho: kimchi, pickled turnip, soy bean, and bean sprouts. However, the food comes out pretty quick. The rice was brought to me in a stone pot. The waiter scooped the rice for me right at my table and I think the layer of rice they left in the pot is the burned layer. I felt awkward at first and asked my friend if I can do it myself, but I ended up watching the waiter scooped the rice lol. 

My friend ordered the Seafood, even though the broth was good, I only saw 1 mussel and 1 oyster in his soup. Oh well, it's reasonable and decent for the price we paid I guess. We didn't order anything extra so the bill came to $10 for each of us.

The place is quite small but clean and organize. The staffs weren't very friendly but they were thoughtful enough to leave 1 menu for us because they knew we have another friend coming. They were also fast and efficient!!

3 stars because I don't like their washroom ! Just very small and the pipe was leaking and water was everywhere. 

I wish I didn't \"visit\" their washroom so I can give them back 1 more star.:(

I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Been here before but most recently I came here on a Sunday night and it was not crowded but we were seated at a tiny table in the back which gave us very little space to eat considering all the dishes involved. Before your meal they bring out tasty small dishes of kimchi, bean sprouts and other items to share. After we ordered, the food came within 5 minutes so if you need to food to mouth resuscitation quick, this is a great place to come.

I had the kimchi soon tofu which comes with a side bowl of rice. There was plenty of meat in the soup - definitely great value. The server was not able to communicate very well but he did provide very quick service so that was a plus.

For years this place has been consistently serving satisfying Korean food that won't break your wallet. A good choice if you want a simple warm meal to hold you through the night."}
{"text":"Speedy service and good food at a good price. There are only 9 or 10 things on the menu and they do all of them well (or so I assume...because I always get the veg one). But everyone I bring there is happy. 

There is a bit of a ritual here. That water they bring in the jug before your food comes, its not for drinking. The server will pour it in your stone bowl after they scrape the rice out so it doesn't stick. And that raw egg they bring you before you meal comes, well make sure you crack it right away in your hot soup and stir it up so it cooks. Thats all you need to know. Enjoy.

Excellent value.  Hello unlimited kimchi...yum!!!"}
{"text":"Simple menu, but good food. The have the menu on point. Pick and choose certain items but do very well with it. I love that you can order the soggy stone bowl rice on the side. It's like a congee."}
{"text":"Food for the soul, truly and honestly speaking.

Buk Chang is not a place with 100 things on the menu, literally I think there is like 10-15 things on the menu.
I absolutely loved the combo 1 with the seafood and beef soup, with the meduim spicy and an order of bulgogi on a sizzling plate.

I am now convinced that the soon tofu soups are so much more before the regular and famous pork bone soup.

The atmosphere is small and lowkey, but super cute for a nice authentic feel. It definitely felt homey.

This is a staple restaurant that I would love to bring a small group of friends, or even with some family."}
{"text":"Menu is simple and straight forward.  The store is clean, the waiters are efficient.  It is cool how they serve this healthy purple rice in the hot stone pot that seperates them from the rest of the Korean restaurant.  Definitely a great place to go to get some good soft tofu hotpot!"}
{"text":"I liked the seafood soondubu but my friend found the bi bim bap mediocre. My sister ordered a beef dish that came out on a sizzling plate. You can't really go wrong with that! 

We really liked the side dishes and when we asked for more, our server said the kitchen is closed. Uh, what exactly are you cooking? The side dishes are prepared already. Secondly, the menu indicates that each entree order comes with its own sides. We ordered three entrees and only got 4 sides to share.

Never again."}
{"text":"This place is alright. Nothing to write home about. I came here for some kimchi jigae on a cold day in April with my best friend. This place was packed, but the food just wasn't that great. Coming from Duluth, GA, I was expecting the Korean food in Koreantown to be on par if not better. Boy was I let down...the banchan selection is limited. I think we got like four items (kimchi, some sprouts, radishes, and beans). Disappointing. I'm used to 7-8 banchans with my soondubu. The soup wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be. The egg they give you is TINY. Mediocre food + mediocre cost=not worth it in my book. Makes me appreciate Korean food at home so much more. I'll save my Korean food for the States."}
{"text":"i can't even remember how many times i've been here.

don't expect friendly banter.  the service is fast and efficient.  the decor is sufficient to enjoy the food.

best soon tofu in town, imho."}
{"text":"Great little place if you want something  tasty and cheap. I ordered the spicy seafood soup and it was good. I would have preferred more seafood in it but at the price I paid I can't complain. The combos pretty much looked just like the pictures on their menu and walls!"}

- inexpensive but filling 
- Vegetarian options
- Boyfriend loves the bulgogi 
- The rice comes in a hot stone bowl to your table and is served by staff"}
{"text":"A very limited (&inexpensive) menu which makes it very easy to choose and not go wrong! all of their soon tofu dishes are great; so just pick one with some toppings you think you will enjoy more.

Also, For those who don't like spicy soup, this places soon tofu will taste great even with 0 spicyness (it wont be bland, which is what I've found in some other soon tofu restaurants)."}
{"text":"I went to back to this place after coming here about a year ago. I wanted to give it another try. 

The prices have increased since I came here and it was still very busy. We ordered the Bibimbap , beef tofu soup, and grilled bulgogi. 

The grilled bulgogi was smaller than before and did not have much flavor also the beef tofu soup was watered down.

We only came here for a craving and that was it. Needless to say we won't be revisiting this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great soup amazing price and friendly people.  

My fiancé always gets the bulgogi, I mix it up always but every soup is good :) I love their purple rice!!!! 

They always ask about parking though lol.  It's funny.  Still wonderful place.  

Would always recommend and  would come back."}
{"text":"This place is always a 5 star.  Great service. Fast service. Food always comes out quick to fill our stomachs.  Love this place especially during winter. Great place to warm up. Always get the beef dumpling tofu soup. Soo good"}
{"text":"Best place for tofu stew/soup!!! This place gets quite busy during prime hours so plan accordingly! 

The price is cheap and there's enough food to keep you full. The soup comes in a hot stone and you can pick the spice level. In addition to the soup, it comes with 4 different sides and purple rice. I

The waiters are friendly."}
{"text":"First time here, had the kimchi soondubu and it was good. The service was okay, the servers weren't very attentive. They were doing each other's hair and so I went to fill our own water, but then eventually the one server brought us a jug of water for our table. Overall, was pleased with the food."}
{"text":"This place is just Yummy! The service is great and staff is helpful! They are willing to answer questions and make suggestions if can't make a decision because everything on the menu looks go hood. 

The bone broth taste so good , very light and not too salty. so I would recommend trying it."}
{"text":"- ENGLISH - 

The best Sundubu jjigae at Toronto, don't miss that place. It was recommended to me by a Korean Friend who never miss to go there when she feel homesick.

Delicious side dishes and really fast service! I recommend the Kimchi soon tofu!

Je recommande le Kimchi soon tofu!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick lunch in Korean town.  This resto has a very simple menu with great food.   There about 15 combos all comes with a main, purple rice cooked in a clay pot and side dishes. 

If you order a soup for main, you are also given an egg as a side, crack it into the soup. We didn't know and had to ask.  When you rice arrive, the server scoops it into you bowl and then immediately pours hot water into the clay pot and left it on the table.  Again, we had to ask why it's left there and he explained, people like eating it with the hot water.  Interesting. We felt like a noobs but glad we dined here.  Very good bugogi and soon tofu!"}
{"text":"I was craving for Korean soon tofu and a quick search on yelp took me to Buk Chang Dong.  I ordered the beef and mussels tofu, it is served with purple rice and some appies.  The meal itself took a while to come despite there were only two other patrons in the restaurant other than me.  When it finally arrived and I eagerly dug my spoon into the soup, I was very disappointed at the lack of ingredients other than tofu. There was literally only 2 small pieces of beef and some dried up mussels.  Totally not what I expected. 

I didn't try anything else on the menu but I sure will not be back for the soon tofu here."}
{"text":"Legit Korean place in the heart of Koreatown in Toronto. If you're looking for ambiance, or customer service, or really anything other than good Korean food, don't bother - you'll only get that at Americanized restaurants.  As other reviews have said, limited menu, but has on it everything you need - the soon dubu jigae (kimchee tofu soup) was some of the best I've had in Korea or in North America.  Limited beer menu (they were out of Hite when I went) but will definitely be going back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Easily my favourite Korean place in a neighbourhood where there is no lack of Korean restaurants! Never been disappointed and have always left full, happy, and warm. Perfect for all the cold weather days we've been having lately! My friends and I never seem to remember the name of this place so we always refer to it as \"the big orange place across from El Asador\" :P

The menu isn't complicated and doesn't have too many items but lists all of the fine favourites like soon tofu, seafood pancake appetizer, bibimbap in a stone bowl, sizzling plates, etc. The food comes relatively quickly and piping hot in big bowls. If your meal comes with rice (awesome purple rice that has a great texture and is very healthy, apparently), the waiter will scoop it for you at the table, expertly avoiding the burnt crispy layer that is stuck to the bowl...although I must admit that I kind of like the burnt crispy bits. I'm not too sure why, but they pour water into the now-empty rice bowl after scooping...perhaps to soften the hard, crispy rice? Perhaps to cool down the bowl? Let me know if you know, I haven't figured it out yet!

You can also choose your level of spiciness, from \"white\" (no spice) to extra spicy which is great for a wimpy wuss like me. I usually go for \"regular\" which is right in the middle of the spice spectrum and it's just right for me. Everything I've had there is exceptional but my favourite is the soon tofu with mussels and mushrooms. It's wonderfully soft, silky, and and is so yummy in the flavourful broth. My only complaint is that you only get one measly mussel in your soup...I'd be happy with even just one more! The meal comes to about $10 if you don't order anything extra, but if you share an appetizer with a friend, it's still super affordable and you'll both be stuffed!

I've tried many other Korean places in the neighbourhood and elsewhere but this stands as one of my favourites in the city."}
{"text":"The best Korean food in Toronto, in my opinion! Side dishes are plentiful and all delicious.. the rice is just like I remember it from Korea (purple rice!) and the Sundubu jjigae and bulgogi are super-authentic. Prices are great too.  Be prepared to wait in line on a cold day, but it hits the spot."}
{"text":"Close to subway station, convenient location and fast service.  Menu is only two pages, mostly for tofu stews with different level of spiciness to choose from. I tried a mild spicy Combination Soon Tofu (beef, shrimp, mussel), which came with four side dishes and purple multigrain rice in a stone bowl.  There was one mussel and maybe two pieces of tiny shrimps in the stew, beef is sliced up in small pieces. The ratio of the content and soup feels a little sad. The taste of the ingredients is pretty bland, and relies on the soup to add a bit of flavour to it.  With tax and tip, it was a $13 meal that would just fill and warm your belly on a cold day, but would not satisfy your taste buds."}
{"text":"I can understand the appeal of this place (cheap, comforting soup in the cold Toronto winter) but I have to say it's gone downhill in the few years that I hadn't visited. 

The thing that appalled me was the amount of small fruit flies buzzing around our table. At first it was just one, trying to land on our side dishes, then more and more came, to the point were we had to stop our conversation or eating to wave them away. By the end of the meal, those little flies were basically walking around in the kimchi sauce, and I was too fed up to continue to defend my food. Seriously, how can this be a thing?? 

Second flaw was that my ideal image of soon tofu is when they rush it over to your table, the soup is hot and bubbling over the stone bowl. The egg that you crack on the soup would instantly cook itself and the gooey yolk would blend into the spicy goodness. The soup that came was not bubbling, it was still somewhat hot but it did not do a good job cooking the egg, I had to pretty violently stir it into the soup. 

Thirdly, i got the seafood soon tofu, and there were two dried out shrimp too hard to get off the shell, one mussel and a couple of small shrunken oysters. Go to Galleria for their soup, there are squids and shrimps and mini cucumbers etc., sometimes there is almost an overload of seafood. Oh and the bubbling thing? Yes it does that. 

The rice was also cold, and questionably pale for so called purple rice. The menu selection was not great since my friend who wanted noodles could not find anything of the kind. But whatever that would just be nitpicky. 

Overall super not impressed. Will not come again until we actually have a food shortage and humans begin to eat bugs, at least I'll know where to find them easily."}
{"text":"This tofu is hot, hot, hot! I finally made my way out to Buk Chang Dong to experience their much hyped soon tofu and it was everything I had not known to have hoped for. My assorted veggie tofu and my friends' kimchi tofu and stone bowl rice were all vibrant to the eye and flavourful on the tongue. 

Seeing as that we were all pretty much first-timers to this type of Korean fare, we were unfamiliar with some of the etiquette. Instead of laughing (aloud) at us, our server was most helpful in confirming that the raw egg gets cracked and stirred into the soup (and not the rice as they do in Japan) and that whether you eat the tofu soup and rice dishes separately or mix them together is up you.  

The four sides of sticky beans, spicy kimchi, fresh beansprouts, and crunchy marinated veg were all refreshing accompaniments to the piping hot mains.

The quick and efficient service provided by the bright orange uniform clad servers was friendly. The glass storefront that is great for people and weather watching is bound to make you extra appreciative of the warmth of the indoors and fullness of your belly on cold winter nights."}
{"text":"Delicious! 

My experience with Buk Chang was great. It seemed like we came in at the perfect time - everyone was clearing out, and a new line had yet to form (6:15pm on a weeknight, FYI). 

I love the minimal menu - I don't have to waste my time looking through pages and pages, instead I have 8 options, all of which I know are going to be good! (and under $10!!)

I had the Dumpling Soon Tofu \"medium spicy\", and it was absolutely delicious - the banchan was also very good. I highly recommend \"medium spicy\" if you're not too into spicy food - apparently \"white\" just has zero flavor, since a lot of the flavor comes from those additional spices. I think I even could have handled one level higher, but medium was great! 

A line did form while we were eating, and I noticed that even still they didn't rush us out (which, at that point, I would have...), so I can imagine that waiting in line could be quite frustrating here. 

The lucky thing about this being a busy place is if you don't feel like waiting, you're surrounded by Korean restaurants and can still have a delicious dinner!"}
{"text":"You will NEVER find bibimbap for $7.08 here in San Francisco. I don't think you can even make it for $7.08. But in Toronto, the next best thing to Poutine is bibimbap at Buk Chang Soon Tofu. Nothing like a warm bowl of sizzling rice with egg and bulgolgi beef to warm you up and make you feel cozy all over!

Thanks to Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu, my bf and I found ourselves returning to Koreatown all three nights of our stay in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love this place! Menu is not overly complicated, and they focus on what they do best. Their stews are off the chart good and very authentic in my humble opinion! A lot of love goes in the broth and the banchan is endless.Usually order the Dumpling Soon Tofu as my \"go-to\", but the bulgogi stew is very good too. If your kickin' around Bloor and Christie, this should be your next K-spot."}
{"text":"The tofu soup was very fresh and delicious. 
Price was amazing.
Service was fast. 
Will come back again."}
{"text":"There's nothing not to love here! $10 per dish for the most hearty and fulfilling stew on a cold afternoon. 

I got one Mandu Soon Dubu and one Kimchi Soon Dubu, both were delicious but the dumplings were my favourite! 

The interior is unsophisticated, bare bones; the service is fast and friendly; the food is totally satisfying!"}
{"text":"I don't know the fuss about this place. Everybody likes it, but the small portions kinda repel me from getting back there. Taste is good though. The restaurant is almost always packed, which to many people is a sign of good food."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Toronto. The silky tofu, the spicy broth, the purple rice...they all blend together perfectly. The hot stone pot bibambop is excellent as well. The best part? Two adult can leave the restaurant satisfied for under $20."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with my family. I ordered the Seafood Soon Tofu. There was one piece of oyster, shrimp, and mussel. The oyster was the size of my pinky nail and the shrimp very small. Both of which tasted freezer burned and dead. The mussel was the only normal looking and tasting item. Rice in a pot was nothing special."}
{"text":"Loved it! (Although I am still not sure if I was given Medium or Mild; either way, it was a little too spicy for me to fully enjoy--more rice please?) I think the best part (aside from the Soon du Boo) is the appetizer assortment and the fact that they will bring you refills of any of the dishes if you ask. Oh and water jugs on the table? For a restaurant that functions on spicy soup, that's practically genius."}
{"text":"Visited North York again with a friend. After having such a great experience at the Bloor branch, I definitely had to see if this branch lived up to my expectations. Needless to say, I was not disappointed at all!

Food: Again, food is delicious and inexpensive. I ordered kimchi soon tofu once again whereas my friend ordered seafood tofu. Maybe it's because it's my second time eating here but I feel like the tofu I had at Bloor tasted a little bit better than here. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my meal and came out reaaaally full esp. with all the side dishes. I felt guilty not being able to finish everything. ):

Service: Service here is also good. Food came out quickly and we were also seated quickly on a Tuesday evening. It seems this place is quite popular as it is fairly crowded. Servers seem friendly. 

Decor: From the exterior, looks not as nice as the downtown branch. Inside it is okay; no giant pics of menus on the wall. When they open the blinds though, it brings in a lot more light making the whole place happier/brighter (?). 

Will come back next time when I'm feeling for tofu. As for now, I'd like to try other korean restaurants in the area. ^^"}
{"text":"Went for lunch when meeting up with friends downtown in Korea Town. 

Food: Ordered kimchi soon tofu and my friend ordered bibimbap. First off, it's SO GOOD. The tofu is softer than a baby's bottom! You can pick your spiciness level which is a plus since some of my friends don't like it spicy but I do. The menu is small however if you're going to a restaurant specializing in tofu, I don't know what else you want other than tofu. Everything came with lots of side dishes. Food's fresh, hot, filling, tasty, and affordable (pretty much everything is under $10). Best of the best traditional korean food I've ever had!

Service: Cute Korean waiters hoho... and quick food service! Employees understand Korean and English (which is a plus for non-Korean speaking customers such as myself). No problem with their service at all. 

Decor: Nice, clean environment. They have large signs of their menu's on the wall and pictures of food. Washrooms, however, are located downstairs (as I have noticed with many other restaurants on this street) and it looks kinda dark and sketchy.

Definetly will come back if I'm in the area! Too bad it's an hour and a half commute from me..."}
{"text":"Of all my years living in Richmond hill did I know that this little Korean restaurant existed within my neighbourhood. It's a great place to come to if you're craving Korean food close by. 

The environment is a small yet spacious restaurant that can fit small groups of 4-6. The food portions are decent and well made. I ordered the bimbimbap and boy was it good! Very decently priced and bang for your buck if you wanna be full. 

When I came it wasn't that packed so you're bound to get quick service!"}
{"text":"love this place! friendly environment, reasonable price and delicious soup!  the only thing they could work on is perhaps on the decorations inside the restaurant, but when the food is so good and fast, who cares if the walls are bare."}
{"text":"the food is just as delicious as their yonge and finch location. however, i was pissed off by the old man (i think he was the owner) at the cash register. i didn't carry enough cash and i was forced to use my credit card. considering he was rude to me, i didn't feel like tipping. his response was to  straight out ask me to tip him even though he wasn't even the server.... speaking of having thick skin."}
{"text":"At $7, you really get an amazing meal!  And this place definitely delivers on what they are offering!  The menu is small and they specialize in soon dubus aka soon tofu aka spicy tofu soup or really, just some very delicious spicy soup!  Ordered the seafood soup and while I found the seafood bits lacking, it didin't really matter since the broth was extremely tasty and flavorful!  It's a generous portion of food for the price as I had soup and it came with purple rice and 4 different banchans.  Plenty to leave full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy Yummy soon tofu! I have tried all their combinations and just love everyone of them. The tofu is silky and is complimented by different meats, seafood and veggies. You can choose how spicy you want your soon tofu and the side dishes are very tasty. It is a must try for just 8$pp. Too bad they are only open till 10:30pm."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm feeling in the mood for a stew, I come to this place. They don't have many items on the menu, but as you would have guessed from the name, their specialty is soondubu jjigae. You get to choose the spice level, so that's always a plus for someone who can't take much spice. I love the rice in the stone bowl at the end, but I wish they would pour tea inside instead of water. Either way, the service is friendly and the price is quite decent compared to other places. I do suggest getting at least a medium spicy because the less spicy stews are a tad salty. If you're looking for other food items, don't come here. They literally have 6 or 7 items on their menu. Also, it can get a little busy at times so go early if you're with a group."}
{"text":"If you craving for some hot stew on a cold day, this is the spot to go to!! I ordered the seafood stew and it came with purple rice and various types of appetizers. The spicy gives it a good kick so if you are a spicy lover go for the highest level of spicy."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of trying something new for lunch or dinner, especially if the price is right. Having said that i am not really accustom to Korean food, i have heard of the standard Bibimbap (Sp) and one scortchingly hot day i decided with my young daughter and wife to pop in. WARNING; the mall itself is a touch on the rough side, however you can enter the restaurant from the road. Once in there you will notice there are about 10 choices on the menu at  most, I chose Bibimbap my wife chose the grilled beef. DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELISH. total for two (all the side dishes included) was like 10$."}
{"text":"Was craving korean but didn't want to drive all the way to YnF. Only found out this opened up because of the reviews!! So glad!

Yes this place is definitely hard to find. Thanks to the others noting this, I was extra careful in trying to find it. It's in the same Plaza as the dim sum restaurant and electronics store. Hidden in the alley way, in the corner spot! 

Food is still great like YnF location. Super friendly staff. More spacious store! 

Price is good! 8.85+ tax for their soon tofu options. Definitely prefer this over the other tofu specialist restaurant in fmp!

Hope they will do well like the other locations! :)"}
{"text":"Cheaper than any place in NY. 
Taste the same as BCD in Queens.
Really good pork and squid hot plate
Really good bulgogi hot plate.
Nice and toasty inside. 
Pretty good service -- family owned and homey inside."}
{"text":"A great place for Korean soups! Reasonable and inexpensive prices! Most soups included beefs. There weren't many choices in the menu beside beef. Only one seafood and vegetarian soup. It would be good if they offer meat alternative option at no charge."}
{"text":"Tofu tofu tofu. The other thing that would make me consider turning vegetarian. SoonDuBu is a favourite of mine, especially as hangover recovery. The service is quick and friendly, the food is great, and the prices are very favourable. 

I typically get any of the soon tofu dishes and add spiciness to it to get my preferred spice level. They all come with hot stone pot rice and side dishes. The food is very filling and more than satisfied the taste buds. 

I strongly recommend this place to anybody looking for a quick Korean fix at a reasonable price point. 

I know there is some controversy on the sodium levels of the food, but I think moderation is key."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about this place, so I decided to check it out. The food did not disappoint. I had a Bibimbap, which was good, but nothing spectacular. It was alright. A little dry IMHO. I've tried equally good and sometimes better Bibimbaps in the same area and in Little Korea on Bloor West. The Owl of Minerva's Bibimbap is just as good and it's within walking distance from Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu.

I'm not sure about other dishes, but judging by the good quality of their Bibimbap this place deserves a solid 4-star rating. However, to be fair, there's nothing special about this place. Other Korean restaurants in the area serve equally good Bibimbap if not better.

Note that they typically do not take credit or debit cards if your final bill is less than $15. Since we're on the topic of price, I've tried cheaper Bibimbaps in the area that were just as good.

The staff impressed me, I should say. They were all very friendly and attentive, even though some of them spoke poor English."}
{"text":"I need to update this (it was my first review), essentially because this is hands down my FAVOURITE and most frequented place to eat and I didn't give it enough praise in the first (too short) edition of my review.

This place is right next to my house, part of the reason I go here on a weekly basis.

I always order the BIBIMBAP. At $7.08 plus tax ($8 even) it's SO much food and it's incredibly tasty. It's always served piping hot and that rice along the bottom gets nice and crispy brown. The side dishes here are brought out in more substantial quantities than most other Korean restaurants and they often refill my side dishes without me requesting it. When it's very busy you can flag a waiter down and they bring more. 

I usually go here once a week, the staff and owner are all incredibly friendly. I can't believe anyone had a bad experience with the staff here! Sometimes they are busy but they've always been very polite to me. And yes, I'm a honky cracker white girl, so their politeness DOES extend to caucasians :)

My favourite server, the one with black framed glasses, always remembers my face and that I want #7 bibmbap! The owner is usually working the cash register and he always wears a smile.

I can barely comprehend how they make much money serving copious amounts of tasty food for $8. I LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Food tastes good but it was difficult to order, menu was a bit confusing and I had some difficulties. They gave us eggs but didn't tell us when to use it. They give you boiling water at the end and also with no instructions. We tried asking them but their explanation was no help. It's almost like if you don't know how to eat their menu then it's too bad. We will give this place one more chance..."}
{"text":"My Favourite Korena restaurant in mississuaga. I love how they have a soon tofu option with dumpings inside. It's soo good & boiling hot. 

Friendly owners and yummy appetizers they give you. Never have to wait for a table and it's pretty cheap. I always leave stuffed so full and happy. 

 Only downside is location because of entering and exiting on such a consistently busy street."}
{"text":"A friends reads a sign on the wall that says 'Soon Tofu' and says \"I guess they will be adding it to the menu soon\". 
She doesn't realize that Soon Tofu is the name of the establishment, but I don't correct her as I'm too busy trying to choose which of the 6-7 bowls of food I should be attacking next! 

Soon Tofu has a rather limited menu, but they do a damn good job of keeping things consistent. The broiled BBQ beef that comes along with a small bowl of soup, purple rice, and a variety of pickled goods is a steal for under $10. The bibimbap is another solid option and can be ordered with ground beef or as a veggie dish. Service is quick and efficient despite the restaurant being busy at any given time. 

Overall, BCDST is one of the best Korean joints I've tried in the city, and would be a great spot for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"This my favourite tofu soup place by far within the vicinity. They serve simple dishes that are piping hot and delicious."}
{"text":"I did this all wrong. So vexxing. This was my first non BBQ korean and I messed up. After reading the numerous reviews saying how tasty their broth is I couldn't wait to try it. My dish came and they scooped my rice from the pot to the dish and then poured some fluid into the empty pot. For the record I ordered #9 which is a fried beef dish. Not having done this before I thought that the hot pot with water might be the broth but it didn't seem right. Turns out that of the 9 dishes they have on their menu, only 7, which my wife had, and 9 which is what I had are the only two dishes that don't have broth with them. We were both wondering why our dishes were not like others. With how freaking busy it was and not wanting to ask what the heck all this means we gambled and lost. I have to come back to this place to try this broth that has everyone hooked.

I still enjoyed our meals but probably not as much as we could have. I will have to give this place another shot. 

I feel bad giving this place 3 stars since it was my fault in what I orderd, but I'll rerate after I come back a second time."}
{"text":"First time here.  Close to finch subway station  easy to find . Food not bad,  easy simple menu.  Special in tofu soup.  Lots to choose from compare with other tofu house.  Soup base can choose from white,  mild,  regular spicy,  med spicy or hot.  Fast service,  lots of servers.  Free parking at the back.  I went there around 6pm , its already big line up to seat in.  I ll go back again for tofu soup"}
{"text":"I came here on a whim as I walked by with a friend. I actually wanted to try the taco place across the street but my friend said this place was really good. She wasn't kidding! A small, single page menu with a few options that they really nail. I ended up reading all of the yelp tips as I was waiting for our waiter and ordered the kimchi soon tofu and it was absolutely delicious, freaking piping scary hot, huge, and less than 10 bucks. Big, delicious, and cheap, my trifecta of awesomeness. I'm a big fan now."}
{"text":"Order: 
- Bulgogi soup + Hot Stone Pot Rice
- Seafood Soon Tofu + Hot Stone Rice


Not my first choice of restaurant when I'm craving for soon tofu. I find the menu is limited and the food tasted average. Choice of side dishes were not the greatest either. 

The bulgogi soup looked and smelled wonderful, giving you the impression that it would be lightly sweetened with a bit of saltiness. The first few sips it tasted really good, but after a few more sips you start to get that annoying flavour like there's too much sweetness. Too flavourful. It wasn't as lightly sweetened as we thought it would be. 

The seafood soon tofu soup was good. I personally don't like too much tofu so the seafood balanced it out pretty well. I would have preferred pork bone soup :(

Service & staff are friendly and fast, price is right, but I think I'm going to continue my journey to search for an even better place."}
{"text":"When I lived at Yonge and Finch I used to go to the Yonge street location. Now that I live in Burlington I was ecstatic to learned that they opened up a location in Mississauga. This is one of those places that have only 10 items on the menu and it all delicious. When they first opened up it was $7 a meal but they have since they increased the prices but it's still affordable and well worth the money!  I went with my daughters and they had the broil bulgogi and I had the kin chi tofu soon. Both dish very tasty. I love the purple rice in the stone pot. The starter Korean dishes were very tasty and your can ask for more when you finish. This is my favourite place. Very authentic and the wait staff are so nice. Amazing service. The owner always gives my girls candies at the end so cute.  This is such a great hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Follow-up:  A fellow Yelper enlightened me on two items:

1. Purple rice may not taste different, but is considered healthier.
2. Adding water to a rice stone bowl is the traditional way to serve Korean rice.

So, I chose to update my review.  I still chose a moderate 3/5 stars for the other reasons mentioned in my previous review.  At the end of the day, there are lots of very fine alternatives for Korean restaurants on this stretch of Yonge street."}
{"text":"Writing down your list of restaurants for the winter season? Go ahead and put Buk Chang's Soon Tofu restaurant on your list. When you think of Korean food, Soon Tofu isn't the first thing that comes to mind. Eating here though may change that.

If you opt to order one of their soon tofu soups, you get the option to choose what spice level you want. Extra spicy, regular spicy, less spicy, or none (or \"white\" which is actually the colour of the broth, not the skin colour, for those of you who read that absurd article...)

I got the regular spicy Dumpling Soon Tofu soup - two pieces of dumplings, beef, soft soon tofu, topped with a small egg which you crack and plop right on top. Very hearty and flavourful. As you make a dent in your soup, you can start to mix in the purple rice and finish it off.

Afterwards, you are offered the stone bowl of leftover purple rice and water to cleanse your palate. The soup itself is a bit on the oily side, so having this is perfect.

If you're not feeling soup, I recommend the spicy pork.  It has some heat to it, but the pork is really tender and juicy. The sauce it's covered in makes the dish so good.

Definitely a must try if you pass by one, either downtown or in Richmond Hill! A refreshing take on Korean cuisine :)"}
{"text":"The seafood soon tofu was a joke. If they don't want to put seafood in there then don't call it seafood. The pot came with tofu, two teeny tiny shrimps that doesn't not have any meat, one mussel, and one ultra tiny oyster in the size of a nail of a lady's last finger. The cost of this pot is probably less than $1 and they charge $8.99."}
{"text":"Usually okay service, food is great. If you come on busy nights you can expect to wait 35+ minutes for your food to arrive. Also, when you pay by card, they don't give you the choice to customize the percentage for the tip. Certainly did not deserve the 15%+ tip they made me pay."}
{"text":"I ordered the Soy Bean tofu soup and thought it was pretty good.  Hence, the 4 stars.  

However, my boyfriend had the vegetarian tofu soup and we thought it was pretty bland and watery...It tasted like spicy water.  So, we thought that maybe the soybean make it thicker?

I don't know but I guess I would only recommend the Soy Bean tofu and not the other tofu soup flavors."}
{"text":"Been here several times now, because lots of people I know seem to love it here. For me though, this place is decent but not mind-blowing. 

Though I've had the \"Bibimbap\", I usually go with the \"Broiled/Fried Bulgogi\" - both these dishes were pretty standard, compared to other Korean places. The Bulgogi was a bit on the dry side though. There's less complimentary apps served here compared to places like Nak Won, though the servers are pretty quick to refill them when finished. 

Overall, the service is fairly quick given how busy this place is...and they are always very busy, so expect at least a 10 minute wait if dining on the weekend."}
{"text":"great hotpot, cheap, fresh, decide how spicy you like it, a bit limited choice of menu - but great for the hotpots. friendly staff. place for locals"}
{"text":"Horrible restaurant, from service to food. 
I from Montreal and I love Korean food. I always heard about Korean town in Toronto, how it have a lot of authentic foods. I have hype ha e looking for worth to try this restaurant. Their bimbimpap is popular.
But oh boy !!!! It taste horrible. I order their seafood tofu stew ( I think ) and it taste like waters, literally water with tofu. My friend order a bulgogi (pardon me for my spelling). It is really sweet, too sweet, like a dessert. A plus for it is the volume of meet. It really good for its price. And their rice is off the hook.

About the service, almost employers are horrible towards my friend and I. We never got a refill water. They didn't even make eye contact with me when I ask about the menu. Their answers are rude and cold. Even the bus boy, he scup our rice and dump it in our bowl. Horrible horrible experience for me. It is not even a rush hour.
I always take few days after to review a restaurant, to have a fair and real review. It is not worth time to go. 

If you like and a regular customer, pls continue to go back. But it will be my second and last."}
{"text":"Definition of comfort food. Fairly fast too. I personally would prefer the hot water not poured on the stone pot but the crispy rice kept till the end to mix with the remaining stew (if any lol). Bill was $9, def worth it!"}
{"text":"Simple yet delicious soft tofu soup and bibimbap.  The prices are very affordable and friendly staff.  The menu is super small as well so you know they specialize in their signature dish SOON TOFU soups."}
{"text":"Came her one night when I had a late night. It was a good place to catch up with friends and their soontofu is definitely their signature. I like their simple menu because sometimes that s a good indicator that they sell very well.  The restaurant wasn't too loud and the location was convenient to get to."}
{"text":"My favourite tofu soup in the yonge and finch area!

It's the best place to come in the winter time when you are craving a hot bowl of soup :) *(and still ok in the summer! they keep the AC nice and cool~)

I alternate the kind of soup I get each time - all are delicious. The purple rice is great, and each bowl of soup comes with a fresh egg! Their bulgogi is also really tender and tasty.

Hint* We always tell them to not pour the water in our empty rice bowls so that the leftover rice crisps on the sides of the bowl and we can scrape it off and eat the crispy rice in our soup - delicious!

Reason for the score of 4 is that it is pretty high in sodium and you are crazy thirsty for a few hours afterwards...but still worth it ~

Would I return? - Yes, definitely!
Parking? - Street parking and a paid lot behind Twister Karaoke across the street
Value for $? - Good
Space? - Medium sized/limited waiting area
Ventilation? - Poor (aka you will stink after)
Service? - Good"}
{"text":"Not a wide selection for food which makes it easier to decide.  The soups and bibimbap are amazing. They serve purple rice with the soups and you can choose the level of spice. Overall,  nice and comfortable place to be!"}
{"text":"Really cheap and tasty comfort food. The name is a mouthful so I conveniently refer to it as the 'Green Place' or 'Buk'. The service is lightning fast and friendly. The banchan consisting of bean sprouts, kimchi, white radish and soybeans is bangon. Good thing it's replenished throughout the meal! Options are limited to a few dishes but bibimbap will always stand out for me. 

The bibimbap comes out in a sizzling stone bowl with a variety of sauteed vegetables on top of sticky rice. I would have prefered a little more meat but I really can't be too demanding at that price. It took me some time to get comfortable with the metal chopsticks but it makes so much sense to use them considering the environmental impact of the disposable variety. I even tried a couple of Hites here. I would describe them as the Korean version of Coors Light."}
{"text":"This place brings me back to Korea. From the Doenjjang to the purple rice and the bibimbap and the soju posters on the wall... i love it here. Cheap, delicious Korean food... what more could you ask for? The bulgogi is also SUPER tasty and great quality meat (unlike Korea, where if it wasn't Korean beef it usually wasn't the best quality).

Go here... you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Cheap korean soon tofu place in ktown.  There isn't much substance in the soup besides the tofu but that's probably why the price is so low. Their side dishes are ok nothing amazing. If you're craving hot spicy tofu soup, this place is it!"}
{"text":"This place filled up with in an hour of opening. if you come during peak hours expect to wait in line. amazing stew i always order the Kimchi one cause it's great you dont want to try anything else. Sindubu use to be just an okay dish for me but the more times i have it the more i always come back for it. 

The stew comes in different 3 levels of hot (none, medium or regular). I always get the really hot one but it's not suicide hot so def. can still enjoy it."}
{"text":"sundubu jjigae is perfect for that cold canadian winter night where you need something to warm you up. I particularly like the Kimchi one at this joint in Mississauga. when it comes to stews and soups i need it to be scortching hot that's the only way i like it. This place always makes it that way. it's a nice little spot on highway 10 run by a family. The service is really good and they have cheap soju and beer. im a regular here and so should you!"}
{"text":"Food, not bad and pretty standard, but service is really why this restaurant deserves (less than) one star. 

Came here for my friend's birthday. We were a party of 10 and food took 45 minutes to an hour to arrive. We understood it was a larger group, but did not expect that long of a wait, especially since the restaurant was not full at all -- only 3 to 4 other tables were filled with smaller parties (like parties of 2s and 3s). Two of our friends ordered the bulgogi meal and one was given a larger portion than the other. We asked the waiter about it and was told that the chef cooked them together and split them unevenly, and that they will not be fixing the portion size. The waiter did offer us a discount because of this issue so we moved on from it, despite waiting almost an hour for food. 

We brought a cake with us for the birthday girl and when we mentioned it to the waitress that we were ready for it to be served, she brought the cake still in the box to the uncleared table and roughly handed it to one person at the table. We asked if we could get the table cleared first and have the cake cut, to which the waitress responded with \"we are so busy,\" and walked away, without clearing anything from the table or any further explanation/solution. Throughout the entire night (we were there from approximately 7pm to 9:15pm), the restaurant only had 3-4 tables of 2 or 3 to serve. The two people working the floor did not seem to have a good handle on things, but it was really the waitress's attitude that made all of us decide we will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"As a Korean, I felt wary about going to Korean restaurants for a looong time, because I thought that nothing could compare to mama's home cooking. Then the day came when all I wanted was a bowl of rice with a hot, spicy stew, and I decided to try the one place everyone seems to rave about -- Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu. I've since been back three times! 

Walking in, you are immediately greeted by the restaurant matron, who sits at the front and bosses all the boys around. Even though it usually looks quite busy from the outside, I've never had to wait for a table, and service is always fast and efficient. 

Of the 8 item menu, the spicy veggie soon tofu is my order of choice (anything less than medium spicy just isn't right!). The idea is that as soon as your soon tofu comes out, you crack your egg into it and mix it up, then just let it bubble for a bit. Eat your rice with your soup, then once you're done, gobble up the delicious rice that has been left to soak in your stone bowl. The banchan is pretty standard, with the kimchi being a bit hit or miss for me, but the soon tofu really is the star. The best part is that two people can gorge on delicious Korean food for $20 even -- I foresee many visits here on a chilly winter day..."}
{"text":"What I ordered: Combination Soon Tofu ($10.62), Bulgogi Soup & Hot Stone Pot Rice ($13.28)

Pros:
- Came to this restaurant because they are known for their homemade tofu. It was very soft and served in a flavourful soup. There was also a raw egg to put in the soup, which added to the flavour. 
- The Bulgogi soup was something I've never tried before, as I've only had bulgogi served on hot plate. I would say I still preferred the hot plate version better as the flavour can get diluted a bit more in the soup form. I also wasn't too sure if I should drink the soup as it was quite salty. 
- Portions were quite big, I shared one stone bowl rice with another person. For the price, this was a lot of food. 

Cons:
- When the stone bowl rice came out, the waiter proceeded to scoop it out in one smaller bowl and then poured water into the stone bowl- understandably so that the rice doesn't stick. However, I don't think he realized this was being shared between 2 people and though there was enough rice for another person, he added too much water to the rice that I had to remove some the water so that I could eat the rice, at least in porridge form. 
- Compared to other places, there were fewer options for side dishes. Some places give 6, but this place gives 4. 
-depending on your preference, if you're looking for a place with a large menu selection, there isn't a lot here- probably 9-10 items are on the menu."}
{"text":"Why do I even bother reviewing Korean restaurants on Yelp? Five stars! Five stars for everyone!!

I was only in Toronto for one week visiting a friend, and I somehow managed to eat here twice. Delicious tofu soup + yummy side dishes + generous portions = me, happy as a clam. I also think it says a lot this place was bursting at the seams--with a line coming out the door and everything--during both the dinner and lunch services I ate at."}
{"text":"A little Korean restaurant tucked away in a not so busy plaza. I find that it's a decent place for Korean comfort food. Limited menu but if you know what you want, then it you're good to go. I tried the bibimbap in the hot stone pot and I enjoyed it but I felt that they could have put more beef. They also give you the staple banchan (sprouts, radish, kimchi and beans). The staff were friendly and checked in on us often to re-fill our tea and banchan. Pricing is average for a Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Korean food! Love it! The clear noodles were awesome! and the food is always fresh!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because I love soon tofu and not having to go to North York for it. Ok let's get the positives out of the way first, because there were some - the purple rice and tofu were both good, and you can select your spice level. Now onto why I was disappointed - first of all, the service was unreasonably slow on a night where the restaurant was half empty. I ordered the seafood soon tofu which literally had one mussel and two small mushy inedible shrimps. Most places are stingy on the seafood when it comes to seafood soon tofu, so I'm already not expecting much, but what I got was just ridiculous. I was basically eating just tofu and rice. Maybe it was just a bad night or a dish to avoid, but it would take a lot for me to come back and give them another chance."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here,  I'm not expecting vip service but a little customer service would be nice.  My friend and I were waiting for one more person to join us so we asked for the appetizer to come first before we order so we could finish up first for the people waiting outside. The waitress brought it over,  placed it on our table,  then we heard a lady screaming at the waiter in Korean jibbersish.  The waiter then took our appetizer away after placing it on table.  Then she hurried us to order because of the 5 people that was in line.

  I like the soft tofu here,  but that's really all you get.  If you order the seafood,  the ingredient list is oyster,  mussel, and shrimp.  Don't have your hopes up because you really only get one peice of each.  It's not really seafood soup.  It's just tofu and water,  charging my $9 after tax. Every one raves about the cheap prices but it cost me t to nothing to make it.  

When the lady rushed us to order the 2nd time she asked us to order 3 soups when there is only 2 of us.  She then asked us to wait for the next table when there's already a bigger table already free. When we were unhappy and said '' whatever,  doesn't matter''
 I understand the sloppy service you get in an Asian restaurant but this is beyond ridiculous"}
{"text":"Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu opens up in North York Korean Town is great! I no longer need to venture down to Downtown when I need to have my Soon Tofu fix.

The thing I like about Buk Chang is the consistency... You will guarantee to have a great experience no matter when you visit. 

- service is fast and no nonsense! bang bang bang you will get your food on the table in less than 10 minutes
- Pipping hot, bubbling tofu soup in a hot pot!! And you can pick your spiciness.. Extra Spicy for me please!
- Rice!! love the rice here!! As not all Soon Tofu restaurant served the purple rice...
- price is great!! You can be stuffed and feel totally satisfied for $10 includes tips
- they accepts Visa and Mastercard

After having a spicy pipping hot Soon Tofu Soup, I am ready for anything!! Even the freezing cold, snowy, windy winter!!"}
{"text":"With all the yelpers praising Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu, I finally went to experience it on a Saturday evening!

I ordered Extra Spicy with beef, pork and kimichi.  The extra spicy is good.. spicy enough for me but not overwhelming. I were stuffed full and could not even finish everything! I really enjoy the purple rice with the beans in it. 

The price is reasonable and the food is delicious. That is always a winning combination!

They accepts Visa, Mastercard and Interac."}
{"text":"Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu has always been my to go place for Soon Tofu. I had been to both their Downtown and North York Locations.

I would say Buk Chang has the most silky and soft tofu soup I have in Toronto area. There is just something so special about their tofu and this is probably the only item you should order. But if you want something more filling, there is also pork bone soup and other options.

This Buk Chang location is so hidden and you won't even notice it if you just drive by. This maybe the reason I did not even know that it had been opened for months. Menu is really simple and similar to other locations. The best thing is the restaurant is spacious and service is nice and friendly. Our waiter checked on us and asked if we want some banchan refilled!

I do like the option of choice of spiciness by level, so you can really custom order what you want.

Highly recommended if you want something homey and comforting!"}
{"text":"Nice Korean tofu place. We have ordered the seafood tofu soup and the Signature tofu soup combo. We really love the tofu, very soft and tasteful. don't mention the purple rice. Love this restaurant, the menu only offers certain stuff and you don't need to worry about choosing the right item."}
{"text":"This place is always packed for reason. The minute you walk in you can smell that deliciousness is on hand. I have been there 3 times in my first 2 weeks in Toronto and the bulgogi soup does not disappoint!  

The servers all tend to be Korean males, mainly due to the need to carry out the hot rice plates (or so I'd like to believe!) - happened to be low on energy (mobile phone) and they kindly moved us to a table that had an outlet - superb service!"}
{"text":"First time getting authentic Korean, big fan. Simple menu, get number 9. Service was pretty good despite it being busy. They came by to refill our sides once too which was nice."}
{"text":"Decent service, AMAZING food, always consistent. The atmosphere isn't amazing, but the food and quality of service makes up for it. I go here at least once a week, and always get the same thing - vegetable soon tofu (and I ask for extra broccoli). Would always recommend!! Best place by far in the Yonge and Finch area."}
{"text":"Gives you what it promises. Delicious spicy tofu at a very low price. Don't forget to crack your egg into the soup right when you get it, although it still cooks if you forget and do it halfway through the meal like me."}
{"text":"So I haven't had this Korean soup before but I've done the hole in a wall warm bowl of something delicious many times, and this ranks up there.  Seating was scarce at lunch but service was cray fast.  Soup is served literally boiling over and their side dishes were maybe not as plentiful in variety but very tasty.  There were fermented soybeans with some texture that I loved, sprouts, kimchi and pickled daikon..all very tasty.  Portions aren't large but perfect for lunch so and prices are so reasonable that if say you are still hungry, order a second!"}
{"text":"Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu is the best Korean restaurant in town. I go at least once a week, and I've never been disappointed. This is one of the few places I miss when I'm not in Toronto. You cannot find food this great anywhere else! Delicious food, great prices, what more could you want?

Be prepared to wait to get in because the place is always packed. You can avoid the line by going later at night. By 9m, the line is usually gone."}
{"text":"I came to BCD with high expectations in the hopes of fulfilling my craving for Asian food, but the quality of the soondooboo was disappointing. Although I loved the purple rice and banchan, the soup itself was way too watery. It seemed like they skimped a little on the tofu, and the amount of seafood in my seafood soup was minimal. Overall, it left a lot to be desired, and I immediately wanted to go explore other Korean restaurants in the area to fill my desire for tofu soup."}
{"text":"I had #3, the regular spicy kimchi soon tofu set, and I swear that angels sang when I took my first amazing mouthful. The soup was deliciously savoury and spicy and chock full of tofu, kimchi, beef, pork, mushrooms, and onions, and they give you a raw egg that you can add and cook yourself. It comes with a serving of (yay!) purple-rice dolsotbap and assorted banchan (I got kimchi, daikon kimchi, soybeans ina soy sauce, and bean sprouts).

The place is clean and cheerful, and had a clean washroom! XD The service, while brisk, is quick and friendly.

Also, have I mentioned how CHEAP this place is?! The meal cost $7, and only came to about $9.50 even after ax and tip. 

So come right in, ladies and gents, and prepare to be deliciously stuffed for less than $10."}
{"text":"I've loved this restaurant in Toronto's koreantown since I was in my university years. And it expanded to North York and Mississauga. It's obviously doing well with about 10 dishes to choose from. They specialize in tofu soup with purple rice in a very hot stone bowl. 

Happy:  I'm happy to indulge in 4 small dishes, and my favourite is the spicy sweet radish one. They used to have it with another type of root veggie that was chewy and to die for. The soon tofu is always bubbling hot, so is the rice. A perfect meal when it's freezing outside. Your tummy will love you!! 

Not happy:  The bulgogi dish needs more veggies and could be a bit bigger. The orange decor can be modernized. Sometimes, the staff don't really speak English. 

Verdict:  I love Korean food and this one is one of my favourite!! The price is great too!! Back then, $10 is all you need for a meal, taxes and tip in. It's a bit higher now that it is 2015, but all is good. I've returned so many times. Tried all three locations too!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place was open for a while but finally gave it a shot because of the good reviews. 

I've always liked the location at Finch and hoped this place would be similar but that's not the case! We ordered the soft tofu soups and they tasted really watered down. Side dishes were mediocre and the crispy pot rice at the end of the meal wasn't the same as the Finch location. 

I probably wouldn't come here again. The food is cheap but there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"Mmh - didn't know about this place until I found the other locations in Toronto and North York! Not sure how they compare with those locations, but what a beauty of a find in Mississauga!

I've always been a fan of specialized/small menus because that generally means that the service will be fast and the food will be good (considering that it's mainly all they serve!). Example: Jim Chai Kee Noodle House up in Markham.

Besides the fact that I'm not Korean, and therefore giggle everytime I say the name of this restaurant, I'm definitely a fan and would come back again!

Went on a Tuesday night at around 7pm. Ordered the Vegetarian Soon Tofu and my companion ordered the Soybean Soon Tofu.

Pros:
- fast service
- yummy banchans (side dishes: kimchi, pickled radish, bean sprouts and sweetened soy beans)
- soon tofu comes with purple rice; the rice is cooked or heated anyways individually in their own dolsots (stone pots), and then scooped out when your food comes so everything is hot!
- Vegetarian Soon Tofu comes with a raw egg that you have to crack in right away and stir around
- Good, above average taste - the soybean soon tofu has more of a 'rich' flavour; the regular soon tofus are above average. Not too salty, not too bland!
- price is right! Around $7.08 for most meals; they only have about 10 items on their menu

Cons:
- small menu (but I think this is a pro!)
- environment: it's clean, but it's not a '1st/2nd/3rd date place'; more of a 'we're in a relationship, let's eat good food regardless of location' place
- it's a bit hard to find as it's located in a strip mall in a 'dirtier' part of Mississauga

Overall, good price, good food - definitely would come again!"}
{"text":"I came at lunchtime for my usual favorite: kimchi soon tofu. 
The kimchi soon tofu they served me today has half-fermented kimchi, with some other leafy vegetable that isn't bok choy...
Not sure if this is a one time occurrence!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on a Tuesday night. A friend had really wanted to go and I was like what the heck, I'll check it out.

At first impression it was busy-af. Especially for a Tuesday night. There seemed to be a lot of Korean patrons, so for a Korean restaurant it must be pretty legit.

While in line I scrolled through some of the Yelp photos just to check out what they had. It really just seemed to be the same photos of the same thing... I was like ok well that's no help.

Took only about 5 mins to seat. Once seated we were given teas and menus. There I came to the realization that the menu was actually quite a dense menu (meaning not a lot of menu items). There was perhaps about 10 things to choose from. No wonder the Yelp page seemed to feature photos of the same dish.

I appreciate dense menus. It means they're jot trying to do too much, and just sticking to what they're good at.

I ordered the combo 1, which is the beef, shrimp, and mussel soup. You can choose from levels of spiciness. I chose medium.

The soup was actually really good! Not too spicy but tasty. If you're looking for a hefty dinner, this isn't it though.

You are served a soup, with your chosen ingredients, and a bowl of purple rice and a raw egg to crack in your soup. Have a look at the photos, that description doesn't do it justice. The soup is quite tasty.

Service is quick, efficient and really to the point. Nothing too exuberant. Great for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why this place is always packed. The food is mediocre, the atmosphere plain jane and the service non-existent. I got one of the tofu dishes and I've got to say it tastes like every other tofu dish that I've had at every other korean restaurant. Not impressed. The prices and portions are decent at least."}
{"text":"Atmosphere isn't the greatest but the food makes up for it. The tofu stew is absolutely delicious and I usually find them to be medicore. They give you some purple rice too with it. The bimbimbap is decent."}
{"text":"If you've never been to BCD, look for the orange building with the lime green sign. It also helps to keep your eyes peeled for the restaurant full of happy diners, gorging themselves on hot and spicy soups. I've never been to BCD when it wasn't completely rammed and the other night was no exception. 

Because of the crowd (and the nearly ten people waiting at the door) our service was a bit harried. But once we flagged down our out-of-breath server (it helps to bring dining companions that speak Korean) everything was copacetic. They even accomodated us when our group transformed to six from four, by twisting our tables 90 degrees to make them wider. This is brilliant. Why have I never experienced this elsewhere before?

Look to the wall, and you will find the ten or so items they offer here. There is seafood soon tofu, kimchi soon tofu, etc. I'm well used to the Soon Tofu here, so I decided to branch out with the dolsot bibimbap and see how it stacked up against Seor Ak San's. The verdict: good, but not as good. And about $1.35 more expensive. Advantage: SAS.

But if you're coming here for soon tofu, you really can't go wrong. If you like spice, I recommend you get no less than 4/5 chilis. I feel like they hold back on the non-Asians in the house.

Obligatory Title Pun: Visit here SOONer rather than later.

Menu Readability: Asian typefaces always have that very characteristic thin Roman lettering for the Latin set. What up with that?

Need to mention: Everything on the menu is less than $9.

What this place teaches me about myself: I wouldn't last four minutes in the tongue-scaling land of South Korea."}
{"text":"The tofu stews here are great.  Salty and flavourful!

Bulgogi (beef) is all right. The tofu stew is better!

It's pretty busy here, so you might need to wait.

Nice family-style place.  Efficient service.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Tasty korean authentic cuisine with good value for your money but seriously need better organized serving plan"}
{"text":"Taste was great, staff were polite, facilities were clean... Couldn't have asked for a better restaurant experience!"}
{"text":"Found this place through yelp.ca and am glad I did. The reviews were found to be fairly accurate, making the experience déjà vu like. The food was very good and well priced. This establishment is fairly noisy and extremely busy as a testament to its success."}

{"text":"Best value for your money!
The food is yummy and filling and the service is quick!

This place gets busy and it's crowded but that's part of the appeal! My favourite resto in Koreatown by far."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

Their soon tofu!!! Known across Toronto as one of the best Korean places for soon tofu, you definitely don't want to miss out on this!

Tofu is soft and you can get to choose your spiciness level too! Usually the soup comes out piping hot and served with purple rice! The prices at this place is relatively inexpensive, around $11 per combo. The soup also comes with a raw egg that you can crack into your soup too. 

The prices did go out because of inflation and minimum wage hikes. It's no longer $8 soon tofu soups :( I have to warn you though, their seafood soups usually come with one mussel, one oyster and two shrimps :( but you get abundance of tofu though :D

LAST TIP?? 

If you can't handle the heat, mild would be good. Medium will get your nose runny and hot would really be spicy for your mouth if you can't handle the heat!!! Rmb to get some refills on the side dishes if you really like them and I recommend you to use some of your soup to scrape off the remaining rice in your rice pot instead of the water. Makes the last rice remaining tastier mm mmm mmm."}
{"text":"Stuff&owner are very friendly people,fast service,price are very cheap,foods are not good as the others things,unfortunately."}
{"text":"This is my go to place in the winter when i want something warm, filling, delicious and cheap.  This no frills, mom and pop run place specializes in tofu stew (as if you couldn't tell by the name.  For those uninitiated in this meal, it's not as granola/vegetarian as you might think, or at all really, I've turned many doubters into lovers of this.  It's a stew/soup that consists of a spicy broth and silken tofu, mixed with the fillings listed below) - i know, i know, doesn't sound appetizing but JUST TRY IT!
The menu is a short list of about 6 types of tofu stew (kimchi, dumpling, seafood, vegggie ( to name some), and 3 other dishes (inc bi bim bap and a bulgogi soup) which you can order with varying degrees of spiciness (if you get it without spice - be prepared for bland-city).  It comes with an egg (just crack it in) and purple rice which they scoop into a bowl for you, the rest gets hot water poured into it to make a kind of soupy rice.  Yes, it's bland, if you didn't grow up eating it, you probably won't like it.

They only give you a few side dishes but they are fresh and tasty (bean sprouts, soy beans in a sweet sauce, pickled radish and kimchi).

Just a warning that there are often line ups around dinner hour but it tends to move pretty fast, this is not a place that you linger after your meal to chat and if you do, the line up of people giving you cut eye might just hurry you up!
Service can be forgetful when its busy too, asking for a tea refill might take a few times but for under $10 you can stuff yourself full - who wouldn't love this place!"}
{"text":"Yummy food! The BBQ pork is a little spicy but if you can handle it, go for it!
Delicious beef BBQ. My mom ordered the tofu and she loves it. The rice tastes great. It's purple stone rice and compliments the meat amazingly."}
{"text":"My cousin's husband, who is Korean, suggested that we come here for some tofu.  I ordered the seafood soon tofu, and was not disappointed.  The tofu was silky soft. the spiciness just right, and it came with some purple pot rice.  The only thing I would improve is the seafood - the shrimps seemed a bit disappointing.  But for $8.95 (or a price point close to that) how can you complain?!  

Also had some soju too.  Still not sure what I think!  

Otherwise - the abundance of side dishes was fantastic - I am someone that could inhale large quantities of kim chee, so I was in heaven.  

Though crowded, and staff are brusque, it is fairly quick to get a seat (no reservations.)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in Korean town. Their menu is quite small and simple. I think there are about 10 items on the menu. 
I had #3 which is kimchi tofu soup with pork and beef. Soup was flavourful; tofu tasted fresh. You can customize the level of spiciness for your soup. I had mine medium.
My friend had #9 broiled bbq. Both dishes served with purple rice in stone pots. We thought the main dishes were okay. Neither great nor bad. 
Prior to bringing out your main dishes, they provided 3 complimentary dishes (Kimchi, ? Pickled white radish, and bean sprouts). It's nice to have complementary things to snack on while waiting for your food, however, the side dishes could have been better. I have been to other Korean restaurants with much better complementary side dishes. 

Overall, if you like kimchi, tofu, and soup then you will most likely enjoy their food as this is what they specialize in. If you don't like any of these 3 items, it may be best to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"My favourite food is tofu .

I enjoy my meal here every time I visit this place.  
I like it spicy and purple rice is a great pairing.
There is a lot of salt per serving, so my date with this place is once a year.

Highly recommended and I will return."}

Several parking and good location within a plaza.

OVERALL

{"text":"Visited here just yesterday to introduced a friend to Korean food. She loved it and we'll definitely be back here for more!

Service was pretty good, right when we stepped in the door, we were attended to and only had to wait a couple of minutes to be seated during the dinner rush. We were seated in the corner however, which was a bit hard to get to for waiters constantly going back and forth and we couldn't get any fill-ups on our water, sadly. Waiters came immediately when waved down, which is typical, I find for more East Asian restaurants, and promptly brought us anything we asked for.

We ordered the bulgogi dish, and bulgogi stew, both of which were incredibly delicious. The key to eating these is always to grab a piece of kimchi, a spoonful of rice, and some gochujang paste and eat it altogether. Was slightly disappointed that there was a charge of $0.50 for the 'hot sauce', although it wasn't much. Was also let down by the fact that there were only 3 side-dishes; bean sprouts, traditional kimchi, and the sliced radish kimchi. We were brought a tiny dish of soybeans in sauce later, but they were hard to chew and neither of us really ate them.

What somewhat astounded us was the fact that we were supposed to eat the mixture of hot water and purple rice....that just tasted exactly like plain hot water and rice? It was kind of a sad porridge, I guess. We let it sit as we ate our entire meal, and then I asked a waiter to make sure that you eat it plain, and not mix it with anything. He said yes, it was to be eaten alone, and so we tried some. It was incredibly bland and we ended up taking the rice and putting it in our bowls, draining the water and then mixing in whatever side dishes we had left as well as bulgogi broth and it tasted delicious! It was like a second meal and we left feeling very full, but not bloated, surprisingly.

tl;dr: Super great Korean food! The bulgogi stew is well worth the money, and if you're ever in the area, or in Koreatown down by Christie, both locations are worth a drop-in."}
{"text":"Packed, noisy and the service is inattentive but the food is unbelievably good for a price that makes no sense at all.  I'll be honest, I have no idea what most of it is but the purple rice with a hot pot filled with delicious seafood amazing.  It also came with countless little dishes of different vegetables that had been pickled or flavored that went really well with the meal.  All of this for about $8 each - hard to beat."}
{"text":"On a continued day filled with many food adventures, we made a stop at Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu's Yonge and Finch location.  It was a cold day so what better way to warm up than stopping at Buk Chang Dang.  Also this was highly recommended by a fellow yelper *cough* Beatrice. =P

We order a simple soybean soon tofu (white)  and a combination (extra spicy).  The food didn't take long to come at all (maybe 10 mins) and the service was quite attentive.  We got our teas the minute we stepped in and this helped us warm up until the main event.  The decor inside was simplistic and was more than adequate.  But there is an aroma as you step in, but trust me it wasn't a bad aroma at all.

Each dish comes with purple rice which is quite good that will compliment your Soon Tofu soup.  As well, each order comes with small side dishes like bean sprouts and kimchi.  After eating and sharing the food with friends it was almost safe to say the combination was the better choice of the two.  It's a tough verdict as I believe the soybean soon tofu would have been a good choice, but the girlfriend can't handle anything really spicy.  So I think if anyone ordered a minimum of medium they would get a nice kick that will go well with the soup base.  The white level spiciness makes things a little too bland in my opinion.  But a good choice if you're not feeling the greatest as it'll be what Cantonese people call, \"ching\"; a clean and simple choice to describe food.

As we ate, I added some of the side dishes into the rice with the soon tofu.  I personally liked this as I'm kinda big eater so this was a win win move.  When they bring out the rice, it comes in its own hot pot.  They'll scoop the rice out for you and then pour water into the hot pot for easy clean up after.  If you end up needing more rice, you can always eat the rice remains from there.  A little soup base into that rice, add some sides and you're good for another round."}
{"text":"It's been several years since I tried this place, and today I tried it again for lunch.  

Ordered the Bibimbap, with no beef and no egg.

I liked the Korean appetizers that came with it.  Especially the spiced pickled white radish, soy sauce/sweetly flavoured soybeans, and esp. the bean sprouts (with the big yellow heads) that came with a nice and light sesame oil flavour.  Came with a half cup of miso.

All 9 of the main dish offerings came in a HOT stone bowl.  

Prices: Were all under $10.  :)

Quality was ok.  But neither myself or my companion wanted to finish our main dish.

Service: Seated immediately.  Cups and bottle of tap water served immediately.  *Understaffed, we made eye contact a couple of times with servers, but it still took them a while to come take our order.  
Servers did not smile, they seemed very rushed and few on words.  We did not feel that welcome.

Would I go back: It's Korea Town.  Lots of other restaurants to check out, and find good service in.  Bibimbap is a pretty standard Korean dish.
I'd certainly be willing to pay more than 7-8 bucks for this dish, elsewhere with hopefully better service.

Other: It took a while to figure out this restaurant's name.  We were always passing by it quickly - the trick to seeing its name, is to go on foot, and lower your eyes to the small sign towards the bottom of the restaurant window."}
{"text":"Good food, great price, but...

The wait is very long! There are very limited seats, and the line up drags all the way out of the door at dinner time."}
{"text":"You really don't need that many items on your menu if you do all of them well. I came here with my aunt on Sunday for lunch and we shared the seafood soondubu, bibimbap and broiled bulgogi. There definitely was not enough room on our tiny table for three mains and banchan! The food came out very fast, so we were scrambling to eat quickly while playing tetris with our dishes to fit everything on the table haha...

The soondubu was delicious, but the amount of seafood in it was pretty sad. I think there was only one of each (mussel, shrimp and oyster)? Bibimbap and bulgogi were great too, and still tasted good when I had leftovers the next day for lunch! The banchan was also quite yummy and they're generous with refills. Such a satisfying and affordable meal.

Service was very efficient and friendly. This place is pretty popular, so you might have to wait before you're seated (we waited for five minutes). But turnover is quick, and the food is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Being a meat person I was skeptical coming to this place eating just tofu and rice, however this place is delicious!  The tofu and soup base is tasty!  Their purple price tastes good and is different compared to the white rice commonly served in restaurants.  If you cannot take spiciness I'd go for regular, I went for mild thinking it wasn't too spicy and I couldn't finish it because it was too spicy."}
{"text":"Love the soon tofu soup! They have location downtown and around yonge and finch area. Just happy that have a location further uptown! Best soon tofu in town!"}
{"text":"Tofu stews are awesome. It's even better when it's being accompanied with black bean rice over plain rice. The menu is simple - I had thought from previous places that I went to in Boston/SF Bay Area that you could only have a choice of a single meat in your tofu stew. Luckily for me, the waiter corrected me saying that it was all included - even better! The broth was very rich. 

Banchan assortment may be a bit lacking for those that usually see more than just the bare essentials - but whatever was served was good anyway - so I can't really complain about that. 

Price was great too - I'm used to paying 50% more for the same thing in the states after HST. It only costed $10 after HST here."}
{"text":"My go to soup here is the dumpling soup and I also love their stone pot bimbimbap. The tofu is their main seller and it is so silky and smooth. You can adjust spice levels for their soup which is perfect if you can't take that korean spicy kick. 

There's also parking at the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the tofu soup here. You can customize your spice level for the soup and they give you many complimentary banchan/side dishes"}

they only enjoy authentic korean food and i have yet to find them a japanese restaurant that they will actually enjoy and call authentic from their childhood. 
 Servers are so kind and very talented; holding the boiling stone bowls (etc) with only one hand. 
 Always a go to place for my family and food is served quickly at a low price; as high as $14, reg is about $11-12
 They serve for vegetarians 2options;the yaché soon-dooboo soup and yaché bibimbap (menu might just say bibimbap so make sure to ask for vegetarian, no meat) (yaché meaning vegetable/vegetarian) you can also make the veg. bibimbap vegan by asking for no egg with it, the yaché soondooboo comes with an egg to the side so you dont need to ask for no egg in it 
Anyways, very much recommended place, great food ;b"}
{"text":"Used to come here a lot with friends , I ordered the extra spicy dumpling soon tofu and it was a disappointment. The soup starts off with a refreshing beef taste and then the taste slowly deteriorated. As you chow down the soup and rice the soup gets saltier and saltier almost bitter. The side dishes were still amazing as always the radish bean sprouts and kimchi was very tasty.

Maybe I came here on a bad day but it was an disappointment."}
{"text":"They have a limited menu but the side dishes and the portions are all good. The side dish with beans is awesome and make this place different with other Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I came here with highish hopes and was utterly disappointed. 

I'd never had soon dobu jjigae before so maybe the dish is just not my jam. 

I have to agree with the previous Yelper who said that the broth here tasted like boiled water. It was very, very bland. It had no distinct taste to it at all. I actually ended up throwing the kimchi in my banchan into the pot because it was just so bland. I ordered the combo stew (#1) and there was no beef flavour and no seafood flavour. The mussel was larger than expected but the shrimp was pretty awful - hardly any meat left after the shell was peeled off and the meat was mushy. But given the prices, I guess I can't complain!

I kept hoping that it was broth they poured into the rice so that it might have some flavour but alas, it was not. It was plain water. Water-boiled rice soaked in hot water just tastes like bland sadness. :( 

Just not yummy all around!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great!

The food was delicious! I had the kimchi soon tofu soup and I loved it! The best is that it comes with bean rice something most Korean restaurants don't serve! The side dishes were also absolutely great! 

We went for lunch on a Saturday and they had no problem seating all 5 of us. I also have to note for those with nut allergies. Feel free to come here! They DO NOT cook with any nuts according to the waiter and my friend had no problem eating here! 

For the price, the quality and quantity of food is absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"I'm lucky I checked in here on Yelp, I can never remember the name of this place. 

Buk Chang brings the heat on the cheap. I'm definitely a fan, even if it isn't my very favourite hot pot and pho stop. 

Most recently I partook in their spicy veg soup and the dumpling hot pot, and both were tasty. The dumplings break apart in the hot broth. It's oddly comforting, like hamburger soup. The pho comes with a raw egg you get to crack and stir in yourself and a mountain of sticky purple rice. I have a high respect for Korean cuisine, I love playing with my food at the table. 

Also apparently pho is pronounced Fa. Who knew!? 

PEPPER POINTS for serving $3 beers!

PEPPER'S PISSED: How come I can't get a side of dumplings if you make them and cook them in the soup?"}
{"text":"My cousin took me to this restaurant. I order bulogi soup and dumpling. They were OK. It wasn't the best but it was just ok.  Probably try other place next time"}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant - overall, we liked it. Ordered #1 combination tofu soup and #7 bibimbap. #1 was excellent, very tasty and tofu was silky smooth. #7 was just ok. Had better bibimbap with more meat at other places. Glad we tried this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy Korean comfort food. You will not get better value for your money if you want something healthy(ish) warm and delicious in your belly. I have been to a few locations and have never been disappointed. Portions are good, servers are nice (tho many don't speak English very well). They have a simple and distilled menu which is perfect for me. If you like soupy yummy spicy goodness, you have to come!
I have, and will continue to be back!"}
{"text":"What can i say, this place is probably one of my go-to place. 
They have a very small menu but each item on the menu is made to perfection. The seafood tofu tastes delicious, is cheap, and filling. 

I once went to this place twice in a week and for consecutive weeks in 2 months."}
{"text":"I'm always back and forth on this place.  The place has a great product and it's tasty.  The place is tight, loud, and messy.  I would give the place 5 on one day and a 2 the next.  Jekyll and Hyde!
I was living in the area when they opened up this location.  It became an instant success with the \"student\" crowd - you know...low on cash, high on appetite.  It was 10 bucks and you get a great meal with some decent fixings.
Normal order for me is the HaeMur-Soon-Tofu.  It has a great taste of seafood and not the harsh over salted flavour of the KimChi one.
Each order is served with the \"healthy\" purple rice, in a stone bowl, with the bahn-chahn (usually bean sprouts, kimchi, shredded radish, and soy beans in soy sauce.  After all is said and done, you can have the burnt rice in hot water - congee'ish.  That's the 5 stars.
The two star performance is that the place is busy and cleanliness goes out the door.  A lot of the times, the food from the table is flung on to the floor and sometimes further.  It's not unusual to unknowingly wear food debris out of the restaurant or perhaps sit on some.
Asians all know that nothing good comes from sitting on pieces of steam rice!  Ugh!
A plus!  There is 4 parking spots in the back that can be parked tandem.  That's 8 spots of free parking!  Mind you, you might be bugged to move your car if you blocked someone in.
Anyway, let's call this a 3 and enjoy some spicy food!"}
{"text":"When people say Korean food, what do you think?  KimChi?  Galbi?  Rice?  Really hot food?

Well, something I feel is that Korean's are the king of amazing stews and soup - or JiGaes, Tangs, and Guks.  We have KimChiJiGae, GalbiTang, SulLungTang, MeYahkGuk, DdukGuk, GamJaTang (yes this is the Pork Bone Soup), and the list goes on forever!  For those who don't know what I listed off - read some reviews and go try them!

Besides Pork Bone Soup, which is funny because Koreans call it Potato Stew, the other popular stew is the SoonDubuJiGae.  The spicy tofu stew.

BCDST is a very well known place for the tofu stew.  They are also known for their DorSotBiBimBap (mixed veg/meat with rice in a hot stone bowl), but the stew is king here.

There are a few locations sprinkled around in Toronto and the GTA.  I usually frequent the one at Yonge and Finch but today, I found myself in Hurricane Hazel's backyard.  Wanting some stew, decided to give this location a try.

The storefront of the place is on Hurontario, however, the parking is north of the restaurant.  Unlike Yonge and Finch, the parking is free - bonus!

Upon entry to the establishment, we are promptly greeted and offered various seating choices.  The one detraction is having messy tables while seating people nearby.  Nobody wants to sit next to someone's garbage.  The menu is the same, but I think the prices are a bit higher than North York - around a buck per dish.  Not earth shattering.

I have to say, I like the food here better than North York.  I ordered the HaeMul (Seafood) SoonDubu.  The broth is so important.  It was richer and heartier than their central location.  Usually, half way through the meal, the stew starts to cool and the soup loses it's consistency and flavour.  Not here though.  Really enjoyed it.

Finished up with the NooRoonBap (the burnt rice that is softened with water in the stone bowl.). Yum!  A good meal was had by all - even though I burnt the mouth again!  Oh well.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Good stuff. The tofu soup was yummy. The shrimp were a little underdone or perhaps thats the way it is supposed to be. To me best food is best taste, so evolve if need be, once again thats just me. The sides were tasty too. Nice start with my Korean gastronomic journey."}
{"text":"The best place in Mississauga for korean food! Great service and great food at fair prices with a small selection of menu items, but each made perfectly. Though hot plate dishes are above average, the tofu is definitely better than any other I've had in the GTA area.

It's one of those places that I can come once every week and not get sick of having their great tofu soup. Only con is that the portions might be too little for the any big eaters."}
{"text":"Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu has only a handful of options to choose from, but they know what they're doing and do it well! 
I'm a slave to dol soht bibimbap so that's pretty much what I've ordered every time I've come here.  It comes in a stone bowl, super hot and I actually really love nurunji (the crispy rice that forms along the bowl) so I ask them to leave it on the flame a lil longer.  Lots of veggies and their rice is speckled with some black rice so it turns it a purplish color ^^  My friends who have ordered their other soup dishes all like their meal so this place gets a big thumbs up from me."}
