{"text":"Found this place really by accident, and boy were we glad we found it! We walked in staff was super friendly and engaging. We shared the Vivo Salad & the Prosciutto Pizza. If I'm being honest I was a little disappointed the beets seemed to be from a jar and thinly sliced. Nice quarters of roasted beets in this salad would have taken it to another level but we did still enjoy the Vivo Salad. The pizza! Mamma Mia!! I haven't had pizza this good in a long time. We loved it so much we ordered another to go. Everything about this pizza was delicious, the sauce the fresh fior di latte cheese, the quality of the prosciutto even the pizza dough itself was so light and delicious! We can't wait to go back and try more yummy food from this place. We ended our meal with a Tiramisu, as a self proclaimed connoisseur of tiramisu and owner of awarding winning recipe lol Vivo's was ok. No offence chef! We'll definitely be back, this is now my new pizza go to when in Maple!!"}
{"text":"Elizabeth  C.         Worst pizza I ever had in my life .Burnt crust  soggy dough and  tasteless .Will not be going back.This was  Vivo pasta and pizza in Vaughan ."}
{"text":"Service was horrible! Not family friendly. No high chair for us, the 2 they have were being occupied. No substitutions on food, which I can appreciate. I just asked if they could boil different pasta but clearly that was to much of a hassle. The food itself is pretty good, but when the service isn't good everything else seems bland. Brought one person their dinner while the rest of the table waited, he was done by the time the rest of the table received their food. Unorganized."}
{"text":"If \"0\" were possible this is what they would get!!
Horrible place for service!!!
We made reservations 2 days previous for 7 pm for 5
When we arrived table not ready and told to wait
Meanwhile a friend of the owner with party of 4 waltzed in and he gave her our table while we continued to wait
When confronted he told us he was getting us another table without apologizing for the blatant disrespect of the customer 
Had others in my party not insisted on staying I would have left and made a huge embarrassing scene for the rest of the patrons to hear!!
How's that for free advertising!!??
Oh and BTW food SO NOT WORTH IT!! mediocre at best!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the service is awesome. The menu is simple and everything I've had tasted great. Will be back again."}
{"text":"The decor is really an eyesore in my opinion except the bar area- but other than that.... We came on a day where the restaurant was completely empty. Everything looked very clean when we sat down. Service was quick. The pizza was phenomenal- exactly what you expect from Vivo and just the right size. There were people in the back yelling in Italian which my partner found unprofessional. Still, would come back/recommend. The smell inside is so good like fresh dough and tomato sauce."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if I could. 

Waited over 40 mins for a table for 3. When we initially went in they said wait is about 10-15mins, 10-15 mins goes by and they say another 10-15mins. 

When we finally got seated our table wasn't wiped down and fully of dirty dishes. We wait another few minutes for them to clean it up. We sit at an unset table for another 10-15 mins. No one bothered to even brings us a menu we had to get up ourselves and get it, a waiter watched us get our own menus and didn't bother to help or say anything. The waiter was setting up a table beside us when no one was seated while we are still sitting at and unset table. They finally come to take our order and I had to ask for them to set the table.

We wait some more, 15 mins go by and tables after us have already gotten their food. I asked a waiter to check on our food, he returns and said 1 minute it's coming. So we wait another 5 mins and nothing came, no one bothered to check up on us either. Tables came after us are at their second round of food. At this point we are fed up, and asked for our order to be cancelled and left. 

Service was horrible, or should I say lack of. Never returning!"}
{"text":"Penne with meat sauce was delicious....and the blueberry cheesecake was also great.
Well done...been here a few times and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"My friend wanted to come here for her birthday so four of us came here for dinner. We came on a Tuesday night so it wasn't busy. 

We ordered Calamari, pasta with rapini, pasta in tomato sauce with sausage, and a pizza to share. The food came out pretty quick. Everything tasted good, the pasta was cooked al dente. The only thing I wasn't expecting was the spiciness of the pasta with sausage. My friends thought it was pretty spicy and struggled a little bit. They have a higher tolerance than I do, so I was literally crying when I tried it lol. There was red chilli flakes in the rapini pasta but it was enjoyable. The show stopping dish I must say is the Calamari. It was breaded and fried to perfection. I also really liked how it was oily at all. 

The servers and management were very nice. We paid the bill and got caught up in our conversations so we ended up stayed past the closing time. They didn't rush us or informed us that they are closed and let us continue at our own pace (sorry!) which was really nice of them. 

Ill definitely come back for the Calamari and to try other pasta dishes."}
{"text":"6/10 for their food
7/10 for their service

I've always wanted to try this place out but usually end up at Tosto or Levetto. To be honest, I am glad I stuck with those choices. I tried their penne pasta with spicy tomato sauce and leeks and sausage. It was okay nothing to special, the pasta was not as good as Tosto and Levetto, kind of tasted like store bought pasta. Sauce was good, but sausage oddly tasted like the Italian sausage you can get at Costco. My boyfriend ordered the funghi pizza, it did not looking appetizing what's so over. The onions and mushrooms were barley saut√©ed and seasoned and the cheese was super bland. On a more positive note, service was good. Food came fast and servers were pleasant. I don't think I'm coming back though. My pasta and pizza soul belong elsewhere."}
{"text":"Another fine addition to the area, Vivo Pizza+Pasta really blew our socks off upon the first visit.

As soon as you walk in it's hard not to be impressed by the interior of the place, with the bright whites and cool metals giving you the feeling of a welcome kitchen. It's hard not to notice the awesome looking GIANT wood oven being fed a steady stream of delicious-looking pizzas.

We didn't stay long as we were getting an order to-go, which was already packed up and waiting for us, exactly 20 minutes after ordering via phone, just as they had promised.

We tried a few of their pastas and they were divine. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the sauce and proteins just popped with flavor and quality, although they went REALLY heavy on the spice in the Spicy Penne Arribiata. Like it was hard to finish it was so spicy. I like spice a lot and Penne Arribiata is always a go-to order for me when trying new pasta joints, so I know what I'm talking about and this was too spicy.

But if you like that much spice, man oh man, you'll love that dish. It was super flavorful, so much so I fought through the spice because I wanted so much more.

The vodka penne was just perfect, however. PERFECT.

I'm excited to go back and try everything else on the menu, which looks fantastic, I hope they can keep up this level of quality in all their dishes."}
{"text":"Having gone to this restaurant and faced with long line ups, we decided to make a reservation (as there were 6 of us) for a Friday night at 7:45pm. When we arrived, it was clear that our reservation (called in by myself) was lost (I don't speak Italian but 3 in our group did...and they said the staff (speaking in Italian) talked amongst themselves on how there was no reservation to be found). Staff scrambled to find seating and eventually we were seated at a table for 4, and when the table for 2 next to us left, the staff switched the round table and brought out a square one and pushed it up against ours. Thankfully this worked, as 2 ppl didn't arrive until around 8pm. and by the time they got there, they only had to wait about 5 minutes before they sat down. 

Based on our experience, this is what's  positive and what's not:

The good:
1) every staff member we encountered were fantastic. The waitstaff checked on us frequently and engaged us at every opportunity. 
2) food is priced accordingly. From ordering to it being in front of us was around 15-20 minutes and quality and quantity are high.
3) we were offered two-bite chocolate covered ice cream by our waiter....they were excellent...and he comped them. 
4) one person in our group didn't like any of the meat options...asked If he could get a veal chop rather than the daily lamb chop special. He was accommodated without any hesitation. 


The bad:
1) we were seated near the door...and whenever it was opened, a very cold wind blew in on us and our food. Those seated further in the restaurant wouldn't  experience this issue.
2) there was a fairly young teenager (we all pinned him at around 12-14yrs old) who brought out our food. The owners should be very leery about allowing this to continue, as its a major violation of Liquour Laws (which could result in loss of their liquour licence). The kid was friendly and all...just far too young to be running food in this type of establishment. 
3) the place is small and busy...forget having a private conversation.

Some of us loved their meals, others said there were better Italian restaurants in the area. I had a pizza (with spicy sausage) which was excellent. The Penne Vodka was meh...not the best I've had, but far from the worst I've had as well. The staff were very generous with Parmesan cheese and it was cooked al-dente.....the sauce is what dropped it a notch for me. 

Of the 6 of us, 5 would return, 1 would not."}
{"text":"There are much better pizzas out there..

Service was sporadic.  A bit slow but the staff was super nice and friendly.  No complaints with the people.  The quality of the food.. Meh... Skimped on the fiore di latte on one of the three pizzas we ordered.. Like they ran out and forced the pizza instead of waiting for more to come from the cooler.. Pizza was a bit bland and smallish.. Atmosphere not real cozy.. Felt caffetteria style but it is in a strip plaza.  Just way too bright for dinner.   Possibly a good lunch spot.  I won't be back.  There are much better places."}
{"text":"I gave this place a one star because I was disappointed the entire time. When I got there the seats were filthy dirty with grease and crumbs and I had to ask the waiter to clean it. Second, my wine glass was dirty and when I told the waiter they poured it into another cup and rinsed it with water while I watched the whole thing. Same happened with my moms wine glass. Third, we ordered the beet salad to start. The taste was good but the arugula was wilted and almost rotted. We also ordered the calamari which was excellent and I highly recommend. I ordered the capriccosa pizza and it was just meh. Not as tasty as I thought and was so soggy. The problem with this place is their pizzas are too thin that anything on top ends up being a soggy mess. My mom ordered the salsicca and was good but soggy issue again. My husband ordered the funghi pizza and the same situation. Overall 3 major strikes and you're out!! Don't waste your time. You want better pizza?...go to Marcellos."}
{"text":"Had the VIVO salad and added chicken for a lighter lunch. The salad came with beets and goat cheese on arugula. The chicken was additional $4 which was well worth it, a good portion of real chicken breast! 

It was delicious, the place looked nice and clean, friendly staff. Definitely would check out other stuff on the menu since my order was kinda soft. I swear pasta and pizza is my life :P"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. Not impressed with the service. Wanted to try this place for a while, finally went on a Saturday night. Was quite busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table. Not very many tables and they are too close together for comfort. Anyway, the waiter said to sit anywhere and we did. Looked at the menu for a bit, then the waiter cane to check on us very quickly after and we needed more time to decide. He didn't come back for a while after that. Very hard to flag him down in this small place. 

The atmosphere was very modern, all white and green. It could have been a little larger because it's such a busy place. They probably have line ups some days because there isn't enough seating. 

We ordered the capricciosa pizza. It had Fior di latte cheese, prosciutto cotto, black olives, artichokes and mushrooms. Really thin crust, not impressed. So thin you couldn't even hold it up and eat it. It was easier to cut with a knife and fork. The flavour was very good though!"}
