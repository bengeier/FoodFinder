{"text":"I love jumbo buffet every time I go their I come back with a stomach full and it's pretty cheap if you ask me, maybe because I use a coupon.But keep in mind that if the buffet is empty don't go because if they don't have a at least 5 tables filled, they don't give a crap about the food. The French fries, chicken, garlic bread etc. were all stale."}
{"text":"love this place its CLEAN! and the owners and staff always say hello to my parents wich is a great feeling for them,they get there 10% senior discount and there happy..the food is always great and the grill is the BOMB!...there SUNDAY prices are high,,,so we just do the Lunch..also if you live in laveen theres a coupon in the mail saves alot of money"}
{"text":"Nasty nasty I got really sick after I ate there I strongly  recommend not going there."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the service and everyone that works here is very nice to you when you walk in. Other than that,  all the Chinese food was cold when we took it to our table. Everything tasted bland to me. Honestly the best thing here is their pizza and the ice cream. Oh and the sushi was pretty good too. But probably won't ever come here again."}
{"text":"si hubiera ninguna estrella pusiera... fui ayer 09/19/14 por primera vez, y jamas vuelvo a ir a ese lugar.. el arroz aceitoso y sin sabor, las noodles masosas y malisimas, los cangrejos sabian poco raros.. el peor buffet que he visitado en mi vida.. no gasten su dinero creo que se arrepentiran... absolutamente nada tenia sabor..  solo la cuenta tubo sabor amargo despues de haber comido esa comida tan fea... ya les dejo este comentario para que bo digan.que.no.les advirtieron... okay!!!;)"}
{"text":"I'm Asian, I walk in, there's already another table of Asians, the owners are super nice, I sit down, then more Asians walk in.  This buffet is top notch.  there's fresh squid, sushi, typical broccoli beef, freshest seaweed salad.  Yum."}
{"text":"Reasonably  priced they have sit down buffet and small Togo boxes. There is a ayce in Mesa that has to go boxes in 2 sizes price includes tax.The staff isn't friendly and the selection although typical of ayce.Run out of chicken on a stick or its dry the last few visits.The star's reflect my opinion."}
{"text":"Nastiest food ever .. all food looked really bad, orange chicken was over cooked. Will never step foot in there again. 

The restroom looked nicer than their food.

If I could I would rate this restaurant 0 stars."}
{"text":"Enough variety for me. Only reason I go to buffet - Shrimp, Oysters, Sushi and Salmon. They had all of these, so I'm happy. If you are looking for a quality buffet, skip this one . It didn't look clean and I had my waitress sit on our side table facing us while we eat. Annoyed, but I don't care much. Total bill without drinks, with tax - $22.64. 

I will come back here again over Lin's. I won't bring guests here though!"}
{"text":"Man told me 3.99 a pound then switch price to 4.99 a pound before we were going to get food left a bad taste in my mouth don't ever go there they after money not customer service"}
{"text":"As an Old Laveener, (even though i'm only 24 - I'm still old!) it's crazy to see fields develop into something different. For the longest there used to be field worker selling their surplus crops and now - there is a strip mall where a field used to be... and on the North East corner of said field is new and huge Jumbo Buffet.

I first went to Jumbo Buffet during their grand opening. We entered into their brand spanking new place and saw a very clean and kinda tacky dining room. I gotta admit - I think it's kinda cute... but just kinda. But what I do like is their GIGANTIC plasma hung high in their dining room. It's on, but it's muted and you don't notice it unless you're looking for it, despite it's size. They have uniformed and friendly enough staff. But many things get lost in translation.

I thought they had decent food - nothing great, but decent. They have a HUGE variet of food that attempts to be better than the run of the mill chinese buffet however - because there's so many dishes the cooks really can't concentrate on the dishes they do put out. So subpar all around. It was crazy busy which is to be expected however - we were frustrated with our server who had trouble understanding us and getting our drinks refilled was an uphill battle. 

One funny thing is that the buffet features a very well maintained Mongolian BBQ and someone asked for a hot dog! yes, a hot dog!! What was even MORE odd was that they had it!! lol! Pretty soon everyone was devouring hot dogs! 

Recently, I ventured back to Jumbo Buffet. I was disappointed to see that they raised their prices to $11 a person. and their American food was slipping. No longer were their roasted potatos and onions were these light crispy chunks of goodness - now they were oily and oniony hunks of mashiness - blech. The sushi is just as mediorcure as it was the first time I went. However, their salmon maki was decent. Their soups - I wouldn't trust their soups 'nuff said. The sweet & sour chicken was the biggest disappointment - the first time I went it was fresh and yummy, this last time - it was dense and hard! and it hurt my teeth to bite into it! ouch! 

What did stay good were their many seafood selections, the octupus still scared the crap out of lil kids, their fried shrimp was still good as were their crispy egg rolls. The Mongolian BBQ is still well maintained and thankfully everything was at a nice cold temperature! Their orange chicken was yummy! and or COURSE, the hot dogs still stole the show!! 

I would like to suggest to the owners of Jumbo Buffet that they close the smaller dining room that is obviously a different \"store\" within the strip mall and rennovate it into a hotdog place... and if they were to bring back the old Potato & Onions dish, in place of fries - that would kick ASS!!"}
{"text":"Just an anerage Asain Buffet"}
{"text":"I stopped buy here yesterday with a coupe friends for lunch. The sushi looked fresh and was pretty good, better than average for one of these places but not as good as my favorite Pacific. The steak was good and so was the usual assortment of Chinese food. Hot and sour soup was the normal quality you see at one of these places, not great but good. Overall a good inexpensive lunch and i will be back again when I'm in the area. They kept my drink full so I'd say service was good for a buffet."}
{"text":"Jumbo Disappointment is more like it. Lyn's Buffet on baseline is far better. Don't bother with Jumbo buffet.  This place probably won't stay open too much longer.

Where to start.  The buffet food was like warm at best. I stayed away from many of my usual favorites because the food was not hot. Selection is mediocre - especially compared to Lyn's.

They have a BBQ area but apparently it's just for looks. We asked 3 separate times to get help at the BBQ station and couldn't get anyone to serve us (the place was pretty empty and cooks were just sort of walking around stirring the sitting food - so not really sure why they couldn't come over to the BBQ station and help us).

Won't be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Was tempted to give 2 stars but went with 3 based on the grill offering. The regular buffet area was somewhat lacking, food was lukewarm, looked greasy, or looked like it had been out there a while. However, the gem was the cooked to offer grille items. All vegetables looked fresh and plentiful and even the chicken and beef turned out well and pretty tender. For $7.49/person for lunch it's not bad."}
{"text":"Now in the culinary wasteland that is Laveen, we decided to give the Jumbo Buffet a try. Never again. Very few food items were up to temperature, which explains my digestive distress later on. The sushi was sketchy looking and tasted old. The meat was either dried out or fatty. The steak on the Mongolian BBQ looked as if it had been there a week. The ice milk was hard and the other desserts were all pre-packaged and virtually flavorless. This buffet is an epic fail in my opinion."}
{"text":"Nice clean buffet. Half the food was cold and the service was almost non existent. For the money I would drive the extra way to Lins."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went here today shortly after they opened thinking we'd get the freshest food of the day. Very wrong. Food was old and cold, like it was leftovers from previous days. Very gross. We went to Hibachi Grill instead and though it wasn't fabulous, the sushi guy saved the day with freshness and creativity!"}
{"text":"got a baby cockroach on a noodle tonight, I have a photo of it, but can't see where to share it. been eating there at least once a month for well over a year. don't hink I can eat there again. everything was stale tonight too."}
{"text":"My wife and I have different diet needs and by going to jumbos we are able to eat without cooking all sorts of special needs. What is good also is that for a little more than a burger shops meals we can have meals with such diversity. She can have her food with fewer carbs and I can find special cooked grill food with fresh veg. love the green beans, chinese veggies,cream cheese wantons, some sort of filled sea shell, coconut shrimp. I could go on as so much to eat from. Burgers, all you got is cheese L&T. So the choice isn't hard. JUMBOS is the place to go for a fast good selection of food for ones personal diet."}
{"text":"Food in the hot area was hot. Food in cold area was cold. Gill had fresh vegetables and came of the grill hot. Ice cream was cold and did not have the freezer taste. Please were nice and everything looked clean."}
{"text":"My husband and I usually eat at another buffet close by but decided to give this one a try. When we arrived at the restaurant a man, who obviously was the manager, and a man and woman were standing right in front of the restaurant arguing about the couple's meal. It was very uncomfortable. We decided we would get our food to go.  The young lady gave us our containers without saying a word. She was obviously upset, didn't say a word, kept watching what was happening outside. Needless to say we hurried getting our food, paid and left. The manager and the couple were still arguing near the entrance.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"If I'm forced to go here by friends I get icecream that's it. place is terrible. last time I came in with flats on and got bites on my feet that itched something fierce. Dr said they were flea bites, after that I've never stepped foot in this place and I don't recommend you do."}
{"text":"Came here last night crab legs all you can eat and I just told by the owner that I can't eat crab legs only That I must eat other foods from the buffet or to go some where else to eat crab legs and pay $30 else where cause I can't just eat crab legs!!!!! I was really ofended cause I love crab legs and I would go eat to the buffet crab legs and I feel that he was pushing me out of the buffet.... I wil never come back here I can go to the Ford Mcdowell casino and pay 14.99 all I can eat crab legs Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"I've been there a couple of times. Last time I went it was worse than the first time. The food  really didn't taste that good."}
{"text":"The food is disgusting. It's overcooked and/or badly seasoned.  Even the ice cream tasted funky. For $33 for 2 people, I would have rather had the dollar menu at a fast food joint. Don't waste your time, money, or the well-being of your stomach."}
{"text":"Came by for dinner buffet last Friday- paid $11 plus tax.  Beware, if you order anything else but water to drink, you will be charged at least $1.50 for it!  I arrived sometime around 4p, so I wasn't sure I'd be charged for lunch or dinner.  I'd already visited the buffet line twice when I noticed there weren't any crabs to be found; I was told that they were still cooking.  I'm guessing that the crabs were placed in the buffet line around 4:45p.

LOVED the frog legs!  These will be one of the first I will sweep up on my next visit!  I also enjoyed the baked mussels, salmon, roasted cinnamon sweet potatoes, Chinese-bbq'ed pork (from the grill), and five-spiced crab.  I also spotted crab legs, but thought I'd save those for my next visit.  I also adored the steamed buns (the differing textures of the buns were perfect!) with red mung bean inside, and especially the lilyleaf-wrapped sticky rice and red beans (for my sweet-tooth)!!  There weren't many when I saw them (there were only two, actually), and despite my inquiring for more, none were brought out.

Liked the omelet-topped sushi.  Coudn't try the others as they contained allergens.  Tried the sashimi, even though they still looked and felt frozen.  I ended up trashing these.  I took a few pieces of octopus to the table and liked the two bites I had before sitting down.  However, after having a few bites of the other food samples, I went back to the octopus pcs. and it felt like I was chewing on leather, and the taste wasn't that far-off from leather, either.  Even though I had my fill of sweets with the red mungbean buns and sticky rice, I had to try the soft-serve ice cream.  JB needs to enlarge their toppings area- I ran out of oreo cookie bits!  I didn't try it, but I spotted a great-looking strawberry-rhubarb pie..."}
{"text":"It's a typical chinese buffet, only that whenever I go, I seem to notice fresher food than other buffet locations. There is a great selection and even a mongolian grill where they will cook up your creation! 

It's always been clean, never had to wait for service, and moderately priced. Especially since it's within walking distance- it's a quick dinner fix & I am a fan."}
{"text":"I'm always apprehensive about Chinese food buffets, because they almost always seem to serve second-rate food...

This joint just backs every prejudice I have against Chinese food buffets.  The food is mediocre, though well-priced, and the service leaves a lot to be desired.  

The veggies in the springrolls were overcooked, so they took on a semi-mushy texture, they should NEVER attempt to make sushi again, and their noodles were so underseasoned that even soy sauce couldn't help them.

I did enjoy the crab legs, but even that could have been served a little warmer.

Bottom line: I was SO not impressed."}
{"text":"Meh, not so great in my opinion. I think that if it were inexpensive and I were a teenager with a huge appetite, I'd be all for Jumbo Buffet. But seriously, there's just too much going on here, and the food generally seems a little too rich for my tastes -- even the veggies, soaked in a salty, buttery sauce.  If they were to focus on one cuisine, maybe, it would be better overall, but this is entirely a plethora of well-presented yet mediocre food.  And now that I've written this, I see a picture on the profile with a hot dog and sushi that pretty much says it all....."}
{"text":"Food was ok. You could tell the orange chicken was artificial. Icecream was so so. Salad was good. Hard to get the attention of the workers. Over all ok. I don't know if I will be back."}
{"text":"This place used to be alright but now the charge for refills on soft drinks and food quality has dropped. I would actually believe you if you told me they were using horse meat instead of beef because the meat is just so tough."}
{"text":"This place is decent. I like the variety. Not a huge fan of the price but it is what it is. $11 per person. Cheaper if you go for lunch. Clams are good. Beef and broccoli was good. Deserts are good. Sushi is good. 

Minor complaints:
The meat pieces in some of the dishes are too big. I always try to put the smallest pieces on my plate so I can eat the food together.

I wish they had cones for the ice cream. You have to eat it in a bowl.

On our last visit, our server was a good guy but I feel he gave us the bill too early. He also didn't ask us if we needed refills. He did clear our plates.

Overall, we will return. I do prefer one other buffet but they do not have clams. Haha."}
{"text":"Being the highest rated Chinese Buffet in Phoenix and being new to the area we went to Jumbo last night for dinner.  The food was okay, their green beans and steamed veggies get two thumbs up in my opinion.  The place was clean and the staff very attentive to taking away used dishes and we didn't have to wait on our check.

My only complaint was they didn't seem to restock, it could have been that there were hardly any people eating or it was later in the night.  

All in all nothing AMAZING by any means but it was alright buffet food and they had an okay range of dishes and selections."}
{"text":"Horrible selection of food, the food they do have has been sitting in the warmers all day. Went to lunch with my daughter and the chicken nuggets and pizza has hard as rocks. The other Chinese food was hard too. I got a scoop of peppered chicken and it was like trying to chew rocks."}
