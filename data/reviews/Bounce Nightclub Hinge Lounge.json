{"text":"Definitely of the newer, sleeker, \"hipper\" breed of Gay bars. It's got pricier drinks than the other joints in town, but it's a fun place. Definitely a heavy emphasis on Drag shows, so that attracts crowds for those events, which happen regularly. Can get packed on big events, as the dance/performance area is on the smaller side.

The area up front hosts a variety of events, including \"code\" nights, for The Youths(tm) that's usually a dress code, most notably Pup Night, which features Leather and the kinkier side of things. It's also got the long bar, with responsive bar tenders. Even serves brunch Sunday mornings. Plus I've seen a few fancy cheese plates passed around during the evenings, so that's an option as well.

Crowd is mixed, you do have those straight sorority girls who like to show up. But as there are no Lesbian bars left in Cleveland, the crowd does actually contain Queer women as well, along with fellow fuzzy-scuzzy gender nonspecific types like me."}

Update- overcharge was not temp authorization"}
{"text":"So, if you told me that I was to see one of the best comedy shows in Cleveland, AND have some of the best food I've ever tasted AND all this would be be happening at a newly renovated gay nightclub, I would have said \"Huh?\"
However, I DID JUST THAT, and it was all amazing. 
Bounce has been newly renovated, and according to one owner, they've really tried to make the place a showplace and comfortable; they did an amazing job. 

Lounge chairs, areas where friends can sit and talk and a LEGENDARY bar (with Joe, a legendary kilted bartender,) make the place feel friendly and a place where folks can dance, talk and just enjoy the atmosphere. 

And let me tell you about...THE FOOD! Patty and I went and got the hamburger of the day, a monolithic burger of such size and taste that I do believe, honestly, it's the best I've ever had. Add to this garlic fries that are just amazing (all served on slate plates by the way, none of that standard crockery here!) After that, we laughed at a great comedy show and had an amazing evening. 

This place is not only classy, tasty and enjoyable, but it is multifaceted. There are weekly shows, ranging from dance to drag to actual live music and, of course, the coursing beat of house music with screens all over showing scenes from the club's past. 

Oh, and again, the food? Taco flights, and if you're \"Fry Curious\" (Thanks Tim C.) they have a mountainous plate of THREE different kinds of fries (garlic, standard and SWEET POTATO WAFFLE) that will put you in a TATER COMA!! 

So, if you want to experience food, fun and dance yourself silly, bounce on down to BOUNCE, and I think you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Food- The menu has been redone and they hit the nail in the head with the food, The grilled salad was great along with the wings and the putine fries. 
Everything had flavor it was not bar food it was good amazing food .. Drinks are soooo much better now and i love the beer selection. 

Cover before they take credit cards and have an atm in the building. 
DJ is on point too! 

Service was friendly quick at the bar but you can get a table!
they do get busy after 11"}
{"text":"Clean and well kept bathrooms. The drag show was impressive and the bartenders were attentive."}
{"text":"I like bounce. But seriously. Sometimes.... You just want to dance. Bounce is not that space. Never ending drag shows all the time."}
{"text":"I literally \"got my life\" at Bounce Nightclub Hinge Lounge tonight. Happy hour is everything. I had a $3 signature sandwich....pretzel bun and 3x cheese...plus fries. Amazing. In fact I ordered a 2nd sandwich before happy hour ended. $4 long islands. $3 great Lakes drafts. Just stop in!"}
{"text":"There's a reason this bar is going out of business. Charging covers when there are 10 people in the bar. Bartenders that don't know how to make certain drinks and then expect the patron to google how to make it. Drag shows that consist of people not dancing or knowing the lyrics to the songs they're performing. Ca mon bounce. You're better than this"}
{"text":"One thing I cannot stand is cover charges, if there's a line of people waiting I can tolerate it.  To charge a $10 cover when there is only 15-20 people in this HUGE space is asinine. Angry guy yelling from one end of the bar to the other at I'm guessing the DJ? Perhaps the drag queens? Either way take them in the back and yell to your hearts content."}
