{"text":"I was fortunate to find this restaurant while looking for a new place to have breakfast. I was pleasantly surprised with the great service and food. Mariela and her mother are lovely people that cook with flavorful ingredients and lots of love. It truly comes across in their food, presentation and genuine need to make each guest happy. Every person at the table was happy with their food and portions. It's wonderful to find hidden gems. Please understand that the food is fresh and made to order, so some items may take longer, but it's well worth the wait. I had the cafe con leche and El Cubiche (I was only able to eat half). The others had the pineapple upside down pancakes and the cinnamon roll pancakes which were delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I flew in and needed to grab a bite near the airport. This place is quaint yet cozy. The servers were nice and made small talk. I ordered the chicken tortas and a cup of coffee. Tortas was delicious. Chicken was tender. The sauce they used was amazing. It was so good I ended up ordering another one to go. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I just had lunch here with a few of my friends. The food was super fresh and authentic. The service was top notch and friendly. Make sure you save room for the churros- you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Love this Cafe' and the welcoming experience each time I stop by for a Cafe con Leche (the best ever, creamy smooth cuban latte) and whatever the special is for the day. I actually can't tell you the names of what I've ordered because I am comfortable enough to say I'm hungry, what's good here!! I have never been disappointed. The atmosphere is happy and you can't beat that either."}
{"text":"The best empanada I've ever had!  Small family run restaurant with excellent service.  The food is amazing!  We got the tostones and tropichop.  Had the guava-chipotle sauce to add to everything.  The owner is incredibly sweet-she is also an artist-you can see her work in the restaurant.  She came out to see how everything was and treated us to complimentary tres leches! Will definitely go back when I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"the inside is decorated beautifully and is clean and organized. The latte was spot on. empanadas are made fresh and chicken tortilla soup is bright and refreshing. The mother and daughter duo make a great team."}
{"text":"My family came here for the first time. We got there a little early but that didn't matter: they let us in to sit down while they were still getting things ready. We ordered several different beverages to start...all were delicious. The food was beautiful and tasty. The owner was very kind and generous, topping off the latte after the meal and heating it up. Great prices, great food, great service. Come and see for yourself, supporting local business!"}
{"text":"The owner could possibly be the sweetest woman I have ever met. She makes you feel like a family member and does whatever she can to make sure that you're satisfied. She paints all the pictures hanging throughout the restaurant, which are absolutely gorgeous. If you have not checked this place out yet, you're missing out! Wish I could give it ten stars"}
{"text":"Super cute interior and great looking food options! Waitress was very nice and took time to explain items to us."}
{"text":"Wow. They will outgrow their space fast if the food and service is as consistently good as it's been the last 18 times I've been . ¡Que riquísima!"}
{"text":"I'm biased towards this type of food, as my favorite place to eat in my hometown is a restaurant called Sol Food, which serves the most delicious \"Puerto Rican soul food\". So I appreciated the plantains served by Sabor Miami--although I'm still searching for a Cleveland restaurant that makes them as garlicky, crispy, and addicting as Sol Food--and the tropichop was decent (definitely enough for two meals). The women running the place were both very sweet and friendly. The location is a little sketchy, but if you're passing by, I'd recommend stopping."}
{"text":"Great Cuban sandwich and cafe con leche. Nice little spot with trendy decor and very awesome owners."}
{"text":"Great Cuban restaurant in inner city Cleveland. Authentic restaurant with character. Must experience."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this gem of a restaurant and are very happy to have found it! The food is amazing and we cannot wait to come back to try different items. We tried the Tropi-chop , a beef empanada, the cuban toast and the coconut lemonade . The tropi-chop had lovely flavor- the fresh cilantro, onions, curry sauce, chicken, black beans and rice all blended together extremely well. The beef empendada was on point - with large pieces of beef and potatoes inside. The cuban toast, we would like to have it for breakfast every day; the coconut lemonade was delicious and very refreshing.  we highly recommend the food.   The digs are super cute too- with paintings (artist is owner and/or works there), and adorable art, jewelry, tea cups and other misc items for sale. Good comfortable ambiance!"}
{"text":"You're going to pull up to this place and have doubts.  It's not that it looks bad, it's just not your typical looking restaurant--you'll see what I mean.  Anyway, don't have doubts.  The place is fantastic!  When you walk in, there is a LOT of stuff, but I found it to be a pretty cool decor, overall, even if it's a bit eclectic.  The restaurant is a bit chilly in winter, but space heaters abound, so we weren't uncomfortable.  We had a couple of chorizo/potato/queso empenadas, and they were freaking amazing.  After that, we moved onto the cuban breakfast sandwhiches (one bacon, one ham), and both were quite good.  The bread is the real star of those things.  I'm looking forward to going back and further exploring the menu.  It's a bonus that this place is just within lunchtime range of my office! :-)"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today. My husband & I had Cuban Cafe Con Leche. It was thick, creamy, rich & amazing. Normally I sugar coffee to death, none was needed. My husband had the pineapple upside down pancakes. Absolutely fantastic! Soft & crispy on the edges, it paired perfectly with bacon. The bacon was also perfectly done & crisp, which I find is rare for most restaurants. I had the La Frijolera with sausage, egg, cheese, refried beans, avocado, & sour cream. As far as breakfast sandwiches go, it was an amazing combination of flavors. The bun it was on was sweet & sturdy. The gallery also had some neat pieces. If you've never been to Old Brooklyn, it's a neat little oasis in Cleveland. Highly recommend this place, it's a gem in a great neighborhood."}
{"text":"Friends of Yelp, please add this place to your \"go visit\" list!  Sort of hidden away in a strip mall, this place is little but packs a big punch!  The Cuban coloda, super strong, sweet, espresso, cannot be missed. Then head for the breakfast/brunch vittles.   Pancakes are bomb; my friends got the key west pancakes and the cinnamon roll pancakes, which were amazing.   I got something similar to huevos rancheros, (pardon my spelling errors here) which were cooked to perfection! Fresh tortillas, with pico, generous amounts of cheese, ham, topped with an over easy egg makes me one happy camper.   Their Cuban bread/ toast is also noteworthy. You could easily tell how fresh it was.... totally stellar.   Service was also on point! The owner came over and talked to us for a bit as well; she was so kind!   Will definitely be heading back here soon!"}
{"text":"Sooo, I was in the area at lunchtime, running errands.  I had originally planned to go to another restaurant in area which was supposed to open at 11:00, but at noon, after 2 attempts, was still not open:-(.  I quickly referred to my Yelp app and remembered that I had bookmarked Sabor Miami Cafe.  I approached apprehensively, only because I couldn't really tell that the restaurant was open, even though there was an open sign in the front window.  As I started to park, I could see customers inside.  I entered and was a bit surprised, not what I expected, at all.  I felt as though I was entering someone's very cramped living room and dining room.  There was SO much stuff (sensory overload), furniture, flowers, plants, artwork, merchandise.  I was warmly greeted, by the owner (?) and seated by a space heater.  It was very chilly in the restaurant.  I perused the menu, there are limited options, breakfast on 1 side (key lime pancakes....yum) and lunch on the other.  I opted for lunch, 1 beef empanada, 1 cuban sandwich and a side of sweet plantains.  I'm pretty sure that the owner was not only the host, but the cook as well.  She brought each item out separately, the empanada first.  It was warm and tasty.  The crust was flaky and the filling was dense (in a good way) and flavorful.  The plantain arrived next, I saved it for last, but it was tasty too!  The sandwich, was huge, lots of shredded pork ham, cheese, pickles and a sandwich spread.  The Cuban was good, not great.  the pork was a little bit dry and not a whole lot of flavor.  I only ate half, but would have loved a side dish, maybe some mixed, dressed greens, a few fries or tostones and pico would have been nice, especially because the sandwich was $8+,  I will return to Sabor to try some of the other dishes, especially those key lime pancakes!"}
{"text":"Eclectic? Totally. Hidden? Yup. Tasty? Damn straight.   What a hidden gem. This hole in the wall place has a true Caribbean flavor. Small, friendly, and flavorful. The menu is limited but offers enough choices to make you second guess yourself as soon as you order. Everything we ordered was delicious and we will certainly visit again."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! As a native Floridian from the home of the Cuban sandwich (Tampa) I had been looking high and low for a real, authentic Cuban. When I walked in I immediately felt like I was home. The decor, the music, everything screams Miami and Cuba...Love.  The owner and the other lady working with her were wonderful. Delightful to talk to and very customer service oriented.   Of course I had the Cuban and the owner forewarned me that it might be different than I was used to. Thing is, when I travel, in most places I don't expect to find REAL Cuban bread which if you don't know, makes a Cuban sandwich.   The sandwich was amazing, exactly what I had hoped for. Perfectly marinated pork, just the right amount of topping and cheese and perfectly pressed. She also brought out a chipotle style dip that she made to go with the sandwich that gives it a little extra something. I dipped into it a few different times and it was awesome but for the most part I stuck with the original because that's what makes me feel at home.   One more thing....the owner is by trade a graphic designer and has lots of cool art and jewelry for sale as well.   MUST TRY spot in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Empanadas, coconut lemonade, plantains.  Table water infused w/ mint and strawberries (offer us some to go!).  Owner treated us like family.  Art, atmosphere GREAT!  We went too late in the day for coffee...will have to return earlier!  Recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"There's no question in my mind that this is one of the best restaurants in Cleveland (and my personal favorite). A true hidden gem. Everything about this place is just A+. The staff (it's honestly unfair to call them \"staff\" because they treat you like family) seem genuinely happy to have you visit and have never produced a subpar meal for me or any of the numerous friends I've introduced to Sabor Miami.  Their coffee (especially the Cuban Colada) will knock your socks off, and the Tropichop with chicken is my personal favorite. Portions are huge and price is small and taste can't be beat.   I'll visit here any chance I get and I doubt I'll ever come away dissatisfied. HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"I totally love this place! The Coco Beach Iced Latte is so delicious with those flakes of coconut and whipped cream, and the tortillas rancheras are a great change for breakfast. The Cuban sandwich is perfect, the pork flavorful and the cheese is perfectly melted. I especially love the Honduran coffee blend (definitely worth grabbing a bag) and the ambiance is tropical and calm. The cook is so sweet and she tries her best to give you the best food and the best experience."}
{"text":"Okay, so after living in Miami for two years I became addicted to Cuban food and coffee and when I graduated from my master's program I NEEDED pastelitos at my brunch themed party. Somehow by the grace of God, I stumbled upon the Facebook page for Sabor Miami Café. I called the phone number listed for them and was given the warmest greeting by the owner who confirmed that they were able to provide the pastries for my party. A couple weeks before my party I went to the café to officially place my order and get my Cuban food fix. The café is very small and quaint decorated with artwork painted by the owner. The owner (and her mother) are the sweetest people on the planet! They were super friendly and treated my mom, sister and I like part of the family. My mom was going through chemo at the time and wasn't feeling well and it just so happens that the owner's mother is a survivor; she gave my mom a huge hug, told her how beautiful she was and said a prayer for her. While there, I ordered the Cocoa Beach Latte which I heard a lot about from reviews and their Facebook page, and let me tell you it definitely lives up to the hype! SOOOOO delicious. The empanadas and yellow rice were delish! They don't sell the pastries on a regular basis so I wasn't able to taste them before the party but I was guaranteed that I wouldn't be disappointed. She was right!! The pastelitos were a hit for me and my guests (many whom had never had pastelitos and thought they were just \"turnovers\"...not). I haven't made it back yet I will definitely be returning! Please go check this place out :)"}
{"text":"We read the rave reviews and they were all true: this place is a gem!!  We were a little confused when we pulled up in the drive because the open sign or the Christmas lights weren't lit, but we pushed on motivated by prior reviews.  Sure enough open and a few people in.  Huge portions at extremely reasonable prices!  I ordered the Sandwich Cubans and hubby got the Cubiche burrito and cafe con leche , and we had to try the beef and cheese empanadas (way too much but they look amazing!) - but these decisions were not easily made!  The menu is smaller but filled with delicious meals.  A great excuse to come back and try more of this wonderful food!  And talk about nice, they go above and beyond in customer service, educating us on different dishes and fla  (According to the people sitting next to our table, there was a recent review of this place in the newspaper.)  My only sadness is that this place closes relatively early at 5:00, but they also have breakfast, so trade off."}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED - I LOVE this place!!  We were here for the first time today and we left feeling like old friends. Tortillas Rancheros = amazing! The coffee = jolt! The server was great, owner was super nice and you should go meet them.  I will definitely be returning here for breakfast and one of the painting nights. Check it out on Facebook."}
{"text":"This was on my Staycation Foodie List since I've read so many great things about this place. After almost passing it I walked in & INSTANTLY felt like I had traveled far away & walked into someone's house. The atmosphere was just that good, From the artwork on the walls to all the authentic items in the 'living room' area & the music being played. The server was very polite kind & helpful. The food was AWESOME. I ordered the Iced Mayan Mocha which was chocolatey & sweet with a flavorful whipped cream topping.  Cubano Sandwich with a spicy sauce the owner recommended. The bread was crunchy soft with perfectly cooked flavorful pork & thin ham. Last thing u ordered was the Key West Breakfast Empanada. This was my 2st time eating a fresh empanada & the crust was great but the egg on the inside was something special in its scrambled seasoned texture. My only regrets were that I forgot to drink that last few sips of mocha in which the whipped cream had melted into the Iced chocolate goodness. Also forgot the sauce for my leftover Cubano sandwich. LOVED this place ^ will be returning often."}
{"text":"It was awesome fresh and vibrant food! A bright and color filled family atmosphere, filled with paintings by the owner. Definitely will be a regular delicious place to go!"}
{"text":"Small place with big flavor! We stumbled across this Cuban gem and will definitely be back. We had chicken and beef empanadas, which were to die for. And when another dish we wanted was sold out, we were provided a generous sample of their Spanish paella special for free. It was fabulous! We topped it all of with a couple of tasty Mayan mochas.  The only thing better than their food has to be the atmosphere. A family owned and operated business, we were greeted warmly and fussed over when they learned it was our first time. The mother-daughter duo was just as friendly and helpful to a group of obvious regulars, such a great community feel. We felt like we were among friends. The authentic Cuban decor completes the scene, with art from the owner throughout.  Definitely give this place a chance to impress you! We look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly staff. I had the key lime pancakes which were outstanding. The Cuban sandwich was delicious and big enough to share. While we waited on our meal we enjoyed viewing the beautiful artwork on display around the cafe (the owner is the artist). Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very charming Cuban spot with good coffee and great empanadas. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is incredible! Everything is fresh and made to order. Worth waiting for! The women who run it are so kind and attentive. If you like eclectic art work you will get a kick out of the decor. I'm going back soon!"}
{"text":"So, i thought i had reviewed this local Cleveland gem... But It apparently it was when they were at their old location. The new location is even better, it's adorable and colorful, and features tropical like decor and the owner's very own artwork. I absolutely adore this place. The food is authentic and extremely fresh...not greasy at all!  They have something for everyone. I highly recommend the Huevos with tortillas with pico and refried beans. The tostones (fried plantains) are to die for...and you can get them smothered in cheese! I also love the vegetarian rice bowl with sweet plantains and avocado...they dont always have it but when they do it's perfect! They also have a variety of empanadas, including a yummy breakfast one. My boyfriend who is Cuban-American loves their Cuban Sandwich...and that is saying alot about the authenticity. Oh, and they love dogs! So in the summer bring your pooch and sit outside! My only recommendation is to add more vegetarian dishes, but otherwise you can't miss this local gem!!"}
{"text":"friendly and good vibes as you enter. Staff takes the time to answer any questions. Very good Cubano sandwich. (seemed to be light on pickles and mustard though) Correct bread and quality roasted pork inside. Menu is a bit disorganized, you keep finding stuff you missed the first time around. Empadas were perfect, with no grease, flakey crust and flavorful. The coffees are not to be missed. I'm looking forward to trying more from this place, especially breakfast. Tricky to find... look for the vertical painted stripes out front."}
{"text":"Purely a hidden gem! Amazing food(pineapple upside down pancakes melted in my mouth) empanadas were great! Breakfast in general was amazing! Great cuban latte and smoothies!! Ill be back here weekly"}
{"text":"Yes, this place is tiny, but when you walk in, you feel transported to Cuba with the music in the background and the wonderful paintings hanging on the walls or sitting on a display case. It does feel cozy and it also feels yiu are in your Cuban grandma's house.  Started with the mocha coffee  and it didn't disappoint.  Great taste and they accommodated my request to substitute milk for almond milk. I think there's an upcharge of $.75. Happy to pay it. I opted for the breakfast menu, \"Revol Tillo breakfast\",  scrambled eggs with ham, home fries and Cuban toast. Hubby ordered the La Cubans and Chori Queso empanadas. We opted to split the  \"new Caribbean love\" pancakes, which were delish and very nicely plated.  Seems like an artist put together the scrumptious pancakes.  So, breakfast was good, but,  on hindsight,  I would have opted for another menu item. The scrambled eggs with ham was ok. The home fries,  were ok as well. Nothing special..i like crisp home fries,  but these were not,  even though I asked for crispy.  Hubby was happy with the empanadas.  I tasted the La Cubana one, and it was delicious.  I  would recommend this place. Def. Will come back to sample other menu items."}
{"text":"Sabor is a true treasure in Cleveland and an excellent cafe. We are so lucky to have it!  The owner, Mariela, is the sweetest person ever. She has crafted a truly unbelievable business bursting with personality. Not only is the food delicious and exciting, but the physical space itself is inviting and inspired. Mariela creates interesting, vibrant art that is for sale (hence, the \"gallery\" part of its name), and the entire space is photo worthy. It's super cozy and cool!  We ate here for lunch and their Cubano was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. It was huge and flavorful and felt like a comfort food I never knew I needed. It also made incredible leftovers. I have low expectations for leftover sandwiches, but I literally said to Rosie D today, \"How does this taste better the next day?\" I also had the mojito latte, which had awesome cinnamon and mint flavors. I recommend both! I was so torn on what to order, but I don't think there's a bad decision.  You cannot go wrong with anything on their huge and amazing menu. This is one of my new favorite places and I can't wait to return over and over! I'll keep the Yelpisphere posted as I try new things from the menu."}
{"text":"Just amazing. Found it on Yelp and it won't disappoint. Quaint little place with authentic cuisine and food. The staff was very friendly and spoke to us. Everything on the menu looks good. We were told the food was never frozen and made from scratch. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Had our first meal here today and it was great!  The cinnamon roll pancakes were terrific as was the cubano sandwich.  The staff is beyond friendly and really do go out of there way to serve you on your visit (especially your first one).  I will say the location is somewhat unassuming which can add to the charm but also makes it a little harder to spot from the road (and when it is busy parking would seem to be at a premium).  Finally I would say that one of the best parts is you just feel like you're eating at a new friend's home, it has a very cozy vibe."}
{"text":"This was one of those heartfelt business experiences where you left feeling like family and wanting to tell all of your friends about the experience. From the artwork on the wall painted by the owner herself to the friendly staff and delicious and impressive menu, Sabor left a special place in my heart during my brief Cleveland visit.   The highlights on the menu include very creative café drinks like a mojito coffee drink, Mayan mocha, homemade horchata and several other options along those lines. I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken and potato empanada that was filled with flavor and perfectly crisp. I also really enjoyed the tostones topped with refried beans, cheese and fresh pico de gallo. The space itself is very cozy and don't let the exterior scare you away before stepping inside. You will find colorful walls, lots of  artwork, several tables with colorful menus and an overall smell that will leave you wanting to order everything on the menu. Had I not been feeling under the weather, I would've ordered several empanadas for the road. The business is located in the Old Brooklyn neighborhood and would easily be overlooked with it's strip mall location if you were not looking for it. Do yourself a favor and pop into this business and get to know the sweet owners. I guarantee you'll be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful find. It's unique, clad in paintings and other random trinkets. The food is phenomenal, fresh with amazing flavors. The woman who owns it will be there to great you, and take your order. She is very kind, and loves what she does. Support your local businesses, and definitely treat yourself to this wonderful cafe."}
{"text":"Can you have a crush on a restaurant? Because I have a crush on this place..."}
{"text":"So yummy! My co-workers and I love trying new places. And this spot is amazing! So authentic. We definitely will be trying this place again! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place, we've been waiting for a decent breakfast place with Latin flavors to open up around this area, . The staff were very nice and everything about this place was on point. The café con Leche  was exactly what we had experienced in Miami. This place is a welcome addition to the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"I first met the culinary wiz behind this restaurant when she temporarily took over another restaurant just a tad further north on Broadview. I LOVED what she did there and couldn't wait to get here. Sorry to say it took us MUCH too long. But, last week we made up for it by visiting twice, the first time with my wife and the second time with her and our niece.   All of us loved everything about the experience, from the incredible Cafe Con Leche (how DOES she make that so good?) to our Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes, Key Lime Pancakes, eggs, bacon...potatoes...you name it, and it was fresher than fresh, perfectly made and presented, and \"ohhhhs\" and \"ahhhhhs\" were heard around the table.   Look, in all seriousness, places like this SO deserve your time and attention--unless, of course, you're a Denny's or Bob Evans fan. Now, those restaurants do fill a niche, but if you want something fresh (and I don't mean just the food, which is VERY fresh), and creative, and delish times 100000, please try Sabor Miami Cafe & Gallery. Mariela not only cooks up a storm but she paints up a storm! She's a wonderful artist who has combined her two loves into something amazingly unique and wonderful. And, bonus, the art is for sale!   We cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"Seriously as good as it gets.... we had the Tropichop (pork), queso and chorizo empanadas, Tortillas rancheros and tried the Rose Coffee. Everything was so delicious and had so much flavor!! My tortilla racheros had ham and cheese in it, topped with fried eff, cheese and pico.... so fantastic. Highly recommend this place- not to mention the decor is adorable!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Sabor Miami has a new regular because I was thrilled with the atmosphere, food, you name it. If I could rate above five stars, I would.   To start, I ordered the Mayan Mocha and it was too good to put down.  A bit of chocolate, coffee, caramel(?) and 100% delicious. I also ordered a chori-queso empanada and it was to die for. For the main course, I got the good ol' cubans sandwich. I don't think I'd ever had one before, so I knew it was the way to go. The sandwich was as big as my head and delicious. I was only able to eat half of the sandwich when I was there, but my leftovers were still super yummy when I had them later. I also tried the Mayan tostones. I think next time I visit, that's going to be what I order.   I loved my experience at Sabor Miami. This little cafe and gallery is so special. You can tell the food and the art are made with love.   I can't wait to find an excuse to visit this spot again!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to take the family! Casual friendly enjoyable restaurant and food is delicious! This is like my 3rd time here I keep forgetting to leave my yelp review!thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! I had the Mayan mocha, beef empanada and the steak breakfast (bistec al caballo) the Mayan mocha is hot, sweet and the perfect balance of coffee/chocolate the whip cream on top is the perfect touch. The beef empanadas are savory and flavorful,  the meat is seasoned perfectly. The steak breakfast  is fit for a king!  That steak  is one of the best I've had.  I highly recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Amazing cuban food, bright and cheerful space, lovely people!  We ordered the Cuban sandwich and the Tropi Chop, which were both delicious.  I enjoyed the cafe con leche, and the friendly owner also gave us a free oreo mocha.  They have some great coffee drinks and there are tons of things on the menu we want to try.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The ladies are extremely nice and helpful. Food tastes like home cooking and very good! I had the steak sandwich which was fantastic. Try the cinnamon roll pancakes also!"}
{"text":"Sabor is owned by the same beautiful family that once took over for the weirdo Larry who ran Miami Cafe. I enjoyed the Cuban cuisine and tropical vibes at Miami when they took over. Sabor now occupies the former Pupuseria Katerina building on Broadview. The food is delicious. The owners are wonderful and warm like the climate of the food they serve. Escape the Polar Vortices of the winter and transport yourself to a bright and cheery environment."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Friendly people. Fabulous authentic  foods. The best Cuban sandwich I've ever had, and I had many.   I will return, and I will bring friends and family, as they too deserve to experience this little gem of a restaurant"}
{"text":"The food is Miami inspired. The owner is lovely. The atmosphere is delightful, casual, and welcoming. Highly recommend the cheese and potato empanada, if you aren't a fan of meat dishes."}
{"text":"Food was all so delicious and you can tell the chef cares about her creations! It's like your mother magically knows how to make these amazing Cuban dishes and cooks for you while you use her wifi. Cozy little sitting area surrounded by great pieces of art work. I basically don't want tons of people to know about it so it's my secret chill spot. And the food is all yummy"}
{"text":"I went to Sabor Miami today with my best friend, and what a pleasant surprise it was. We came on a Saturday afternoon and the place was packed. The interior of the restaurant was very warm and inviting. The walls are decorated with the owners artwork, which I really appreciated. I ordered the cortadito, it was very good. For my meal I ordered the  Cuban sandwich, I particularly enjoyed the pork which had a lot of flavor. My best friend ordered a vegetarian meal, the owner came out and introduced herself and made suggestions how to make her meal even better. The owner was very nice and the service was superb.  Overall, I  had a great experience definitely will be back to try the curros and empanadas. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Great little diner. Most friendly staff and the food was great. Steak sandwich and the Cuban espresso was strong. Carlos jones came in and sang feliz Navidad. A neighborhood gem you need to check out."}
