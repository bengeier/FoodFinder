{"text":"Went here on a Friday night with friends from work. The whole night was excellent. The decoration, ambience and all the small touches (silent buzzer for getting the staff's attention, even leaving reading glasses in the bar area for people to read the menu ) made us all feel very special. 
The service was excellent, the food was fabulous all home made fresh pasta, breads and desserts. 
Would thoroughly recommend this restaurant, can't find anything to fault. Must be the best place to eat in Scarborough it was a great evening and can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday night and must say our experience was very good indeed our food was cooked perfectly, the staff were attentive without being over bearing. The atmosphere is welcoming and unstuffy in all a very pleasant evening! We shall come here again!!"}
{"text":"We went to Cogonis last Friday night, with a group on 3 friends, the food was exceptional and everything was very clean and tidy, we were made so welcome by all the staff and nothing was too much trouble. We were given a slice of homemade bread whilst we were waiting for our starter, that was a nice touch.


 You must leave room for a desert though as they are all home made and are lovely.


 I would recommend it to anyone, I will be going back very soon - can't wait - this has got to be by far one of the best places in the town to eat. 10/10"}
{"text":"Two of us went on a busy Saturday night just before nine (I have since learned it was their busiest night since opening), we sat at the bar whilst our table was prepared. The general ambiance of the place is relaxed but classy. Everything was clean and spotless. The three floor staff did a tremendous job of meet and greet, taking orders, clearing tables and bringing food. Quite how they managed it is beyond me.
Our starter was a mixed shellfish platter. This was simply steamed and consisted of razor clam (outstandingly good), cockles, prawns and I believe a crevette all in a simple sauce that in no way smothered the flavour as some do. To accompany we had some delicious oregano bread to dip into the lovely juices.
Our main course was lamb in a rosemary,thyme and garlic jus. The lamb was rightly served pink and fell off the bone.We were also asked before hand if we wanted it pink which I thought was a nice touch. Presentation was lovely and the accompanying veg included wonderful potatoes roasted in goose fat.
To drink we had a bottle of the house red at 10.95 a bottle which is very good and I believe too cheap !
We really enjoyed our meal and I would recommend it to anyone. I never heard anyone else complaining and in fact everyone who left looked really happy and complimented staff as they left.
What particularly impressed me was the professionalism of the staff. It was manic at times yet they remained calm throughout and saw it through. It is obvious to me that the staff both front and back of house care very much about what they do here and the attention to detail is obvious. It is also obvious that they are improving and are striving to get better. I came here on their first night and the meal was not as good but on speaking to both chefs they were aware of their mistakes and have made it better.
If you consider that they have both come from a family run, fast paced Italian restaurant which catered to the masses, what they have achieved here is even more incredible. They have set their sights and standards high and I can see nothing but success in their future here. They could do with another staff member at busier times but that in no way is a criticism of what was a great team effort, a memorable experience and something I shall definitely do again.
I have read some of the other reviews here and some of the negative comments about the staff I find very hard to believe. I have never seen a more professional front of house team and I heartily commend both them and this restaurant."}
