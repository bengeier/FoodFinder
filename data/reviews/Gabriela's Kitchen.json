{"text":"Homestyle dishes!  Very good, ate lunch and dinner, wonderful!  Gabrielle makes you feel like your home with her smile and kindness!  Nice to escape the chain restaurants and enjoy a Mom and Pop venue!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had to wait for my son's haircut appointment so we stopped in.  So happy we did.  Gabriela and her son were super friendly.  We had soup and sandwiches.  The soup was fresh, obviously homemade and very very delicious.  Perfect for a cool day.  The bread on the sandwich was perfect.  Soft but with a delicate crust piled high with (in my case) soft mozzarella, fresh basil and tomatoes.  The prices were very fair and I am DEFINITLEY stopping back for Tia's Daily Dinner!!"}
{"text":"Best orange natural juice ever place is cute clean and burrito carne asada is really good love it"}
{"text":"Super cute place, feels like you're really in Gabriela's kitchen!! Service was great. Well rounded menu, with fresh juices, soups and Mexican food.  Delicious cookies that look too pretty to eat! Food was high quality.. great place. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I order take out dinners for my family regularly, food and service is excellent!  I love that they have their daily dinner menu online.  Frequently around 3pm I realize I won't have time to make a healthy dinner for my hubby and kiddos so I call Gabriela's and presto, an amazing dinner at a reasonable price is ready for pick up!  Love this place :)"}
{"text":"Cutest little new place! I met the chef (I think Gabriella) and you can tell she has a passion for cooking good food. I ordered the turkey burger and a salad with the house cilantro vinaigrette. She's an amazing cook and the food is so fresh! I'll be back with my family and friends!"}
{"text":"This place is tiny and the menu is small.  But a small menu sometimes means that much care is taken to give you fresh and delicious food.  She roasts the turkey breasts herself.  It's not deli turkey.  If you want a cold turkey sandwich like you have after Thanksgiving Day, this is the place.  If you want to keep this gem of a place open, give them your business and spread the word.  One person who reviewed wondered whether to go to the counter or sit down.  The preference is that you go to the counter, but if you sit down, they will wait on you and not make you feel funny about it.  Both waitresses I've had were super sweet, friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! As a young, working adult, I find little time to cook as much as I would like.  Gabriela's helps take care of that.  If you like authentic, homestyle comfort food, this is your place.  Gabriela and the staff are so friendly.  My orders and personal stories are remembered when I returned, which gives the extra touch anyone can appreciate.  You can subscribe to a weekly menu to preview or schedule future orders.  I had the beef and green chile stew with rice and beans tonight.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the service was great and the morning glory muffins were delicious.  I also had a very tasty mango smoothie.  The price was good for the portions of food served."}
{"text":"I went there about 2 weeks ago. The service was great! the food was superb and healthy, the place was very clean! I highly recommend this place.  A+++"}
{"text":"Had our first lunch here. Food and service was outstanding! I had the turkey burger, husband had the roasted turkey sandwich.  Both extremely fresh and delicious.  Gabriella is very sweet!  Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Awesome. First visit: Had a Chicken Asada Burrito... with both red and green sauce. It was great!  Finished with a \"Morning-glory\" muffin -- also delicious. We'll be making this a regular visit."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful breakfast burrito and smoothie with my wife.  They have homemade sandwiches and muffins and tasty desserts like peach cobbler.  This is a very clean and friendly atmosphere and the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Intimate little eatery. We usually stop here on really busy days. And like to come here for soups and juice especially.  Quick fresh food.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"The chicken chilaquiles are quite possibly the best thing I've ever eaten. This is our favorite breakfast spot on Saturday and lunch spot during the week. I can't understand why this place isn't packed, but it's always easy to get a table. The food is great and the staff is super friendly. The salsas are also great, red and green. I have also had the ham and mushroom omelette. The ham was off-the-bone and the mushrooms were fresh and both were great."}
{"text":"took by niece here for a quick bite based on the reviews here. The staff was very friendly. The food was fresh but nothing special. Would expect a little more and something to make the food a little more special. Instead of just an ordinary sandwich"}
{"text":"Unfortunately was not able to eat here. The locals seemed to think it was a nice place. I had to leave because she would not let me plug my computer in the plug next to the table, and I needed to charge it."}
{"text":"I tried this place out on a whim at lunch time. The staff was beyond friendly. The menu was so varied it took me a moment to decide. I didn't expect such a variety when the sign shows Smoothies and Cafe Deli. I had a quesadilla and albondigas soup. One of the best quesadilla's and home made salsa ever. I will certainly return to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place seeing all the good reviews. However when I walked in with my family, we weren't greeted at all we were told to sit down and given menus and nobody came back to take our order. Until I got up and went to the register and told someone, which seemed to be the owner... that I was confused as to why nobody was tending to our table. Her reply to me was  I'll get to you, (very harsly) I'm a little busy but I'll get to you hold on.   I was surprised that she didn't greet me or ask me if I had any questions about the restaurant for gave me any sort of additional information she just was very short and rude to me immediately. I couldn't tell if I had to order up at the cashier or if somebody was going to come take care of us at our table.  she finally came to our table to take our order after we waited for 10 mins! Without any drinks or acknowledgment. Istead of greeting us happily, welcoming  like an owner would do if you were there for the first time. Which we were typically expecting... she talked down to us, as if we didn't know anything and was telling me what I needed to order for my children. And made me feel rushed and gave me a negative vibe. Not to mention there were 2 other tables waiting on her as well, in the same predicament. We decided to leave after encountering how rude she was towards us. We will Not be returning!!"}
{"text":"The service was great , the food had flavor and tastes like a home cooked meal !! Definitely worth stopping in ,I can't wait to try more things on menu (take out dinners)"}
{"text":"Saw this place on yelp and wanted to come in and try the chilaquiles. SO delicious! This a quiet little place but I felt very at home. The staff is so nice. I can not wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this cute little place and LOVED the Green Chile Pork Stew! SO much pork in there! It was deliciously spicy and I will be back soon to try some more! I would recommend better tortillas however. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Nice place and very courteous and friendly service  I enjoyed the eggs and chorizo! Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"The food is really good and fairly priced. The owner is really nice. It's like going into someone's home for a meal. We will be returning soon. I've tried the red chili which was really good. The meat loaf was good too, and the sandwiches are not either."}
{"text":"This is a really cute lunch spot, they have great green chile pork stew and daily lunch specials that are really good atmosphere is small and quiet customer service is excellent prices are very reasonable and portions are good the only critique I have is that they use plastic ware instead of silverware and paper plates instead of ceramic plates but everything else is spot on."}
{"text":"Very nice family run restaurant.  Food is good and prices are reasonable; run by a very nice lady.  Make sure to try the sugar cookies!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is fantastic. Excellent food, great service, really quick and super delicious. I work nearby and will definitely become a regular."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick fix because I was starving my brains out but didn't have much time. The service was very friendly and informative. I ordered a mixed juice with mango and orange. It was very refreshing and tasty! I overheard others complimenting the food and thorough service explaining what they had to offer. I would be happy to come back to try other items."}
{"text":"This place came recommended by a friend and it was lovely. The people are welcoming, thoughtful and helpful (we have small children). The food and juice is super tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. Looking at all these good 5 star reviews. I'm actually honest about mine. Maybe I just came on a bad day or whatever. Anyways, for a first timer here the wait time took longer than it should normally be even though I was the only one. I ordered 2 sandwiches, 2 smoothies, and 2 cookies. It came out to around $30+ with a 15% tip. A little pricey if you ask me for some basic 6\" sandwiches. Other than that the food was good and fresh. Smoothies were delicious and full of flavor. I heard the breakfast is good. It doesn't hurt to try new things."}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwich didn't last half a mile! That fresh baked roll was a pillow sent from heaven. Anxious to try more"}
{"text":"Very friendly service and great breakfast! Pancakes where perfect. The bacon was perfectly cooked for all preferences. Not to crispy, but not chewy raw. I need to come back for lunch."}
{"text":"The food was so tasty. The shredded beef breakfast burrito was great and the chicken chilaquiles amazing. I left stuffed and happy! I live in west Phoenix but might make the drive to come try lunch or dinner.    Update: dr from Phoenix to Gilbert because we were craving the breakfast we remember from this place. Food was not what we remember. The burritos were skimpy and the server was very pushy. The coffee was weaker than I remembered. Maybe it was an off day? Who knows."}
{"text":"I just ate THE BEST turkey sandwich I've had since we moved to Arizona. Fresh baked yeast roll with carved turkey and some delicious dressing. Spoke with Gabriela while there and learned that everything is made in the store from scratch. I don't know of too many places in Gilbert where you can find that. Eat something delicious and support a small business. We will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"NOTHING special about this place.  No ambience, small portions served on paper plates with plastic ware.  Never going back."}
{"text":"I happened upon this cafe. I'm so glad I did. The food was FANTASTIC!! Will recommend to all."}
{"text":"Nice cute kitchen with a home grown small town feel where they treat every customer like a friend. Food is great. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this joint going to the dollar store next-door, boy am I glad that I did!  They were advertising juices for a very affordable price, half of what nekter charges.  The juice itself was very sweet and delicious! I ordered the carrot juice!  Originally that's all I was going to get but then I saw the roast beef sandwich that one of the workers was eating and I ordered that as well! It was so good they roast it themselves and make all ingredients by hand! The recipe was from the owners mother!  I then ordered a cupcake and iced coffee, still everything very reasonably priced!   Very tasty! Again, the cupcake was home made!  This place is five stars! Hand made ingredients makes you feel like you're eating in a traditional home!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast today. I have passed by this place before, but didn't think it was a restaurant. Definitely a hidden gem! My wife and I walked in and were greeted by a lady. We later found out it was Gabriella, the owner. We really didn't know what to expect, but we were definitely not disappointed. First thing that caught my eye were the prices$$$. 2 entrees, a cup of soup and a smoothie for $20!!! Gabriella is a very nice lady, and the food was delicious! We will become regulars from this day forward."}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to anything from a bakery. I loved loved loved everything  about this place! The juices are great, the bread is homemade and the Texas sheet cake is the best I've had outside my own mothers kitchen. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed and pleasantly surprised by Gabriela's Kitchen!!! It's not a particularly fancy place and doesn't have exotic options, but the quality of the food is REALLY GOOD! A friend and I stepped in around 11:30 on a Sunday and there were maybe 2 other parties enjoying their meals. Given the homeyness of the cafe, we asked for recommendations and ended up going with a fresh squeezed pineapple-orange juice & the shredded beef burrito & turkey sandwich.   Normally, I'm not too partial to ordering burritos/sandwiches because I feel like I can make my own, but something about the quality and flavors of each carefully selected ingredient just worked so well (I'm thinking of the mustard/mayo aioli situation happening on the turkey sandwich)!! And seriously, the price can NOT be beat. Burrito - $5.50 and very good portion. HALF sandwich (which was still pretty big - $4. WHAT! That's amazing! The juice was a little pricey at $4.50 for a 12 oz, but this ain't South America - expensive juice is to be expected here.  Overall, I'm glad this place is close by. I see myself stopping by to grab a sandwich when I just really don't feel like cooking. I'd recommend checking it out for some reliable and delicious food!"}
{"text":"I have seen a lot of food business come and go in this building but this place seems like a winner. The staff were very friendly and being a first timer there explained the way it works. I had the breakfast plate of eggs bacon and potatoes. It came will fruit or beans.. went with the fruit.. little weird it came out on a plastic plate with plastic fork but didnt take away from the good taste of the food. The price is what I think is spot on for what your getting. I do plan to return to try some other things on the menu. Don't forget to support local businesses"}
{"text":"We we're looking for a place that cooked a good home cooked meal at a decent price and we found Gabriel's kitchen. We had meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and veggies. Everything was really good."}
{"text":"Great service the owner came out to check on us and she was very sweet. The chorizo burrito was just the amount of kick I needed not too hot. We had the beef green chili stew and it was out of this world, very good, very different and they have really good Mexican food. The flan was very moist and tasty their prices are extremely reasonable $5 for a burrito and beans."}
{"text":"Cutest little mom and pop stop. Gabriella is so sweet, gave us great recommendations for lunch. She and her staff were all very nice and on top of our order. We ordered the turkey burger and a ham omelet that came with salsa that was delicious! All their meats are cooked there on site and they definitely taste like they have been made well. Morning glory muffin was one of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Terrific pork pozole!!  Friendly staff and the juice is fresh! Smells great when you walk in! Hidden little jewel."}
{"text":"Wow! The owner and staff are so pleasant. They offered great customer service. The music is delightful, the FOOD is delicious! I got the Chicken Salad Sandwich with a side of pasta salad and it was great! :) thanks for the great service will be back!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!! Very tasty, had the bacon eggs and potato in a burrito option. The fresh green and red salsa was great.  Fresh fruit was terrific too.  Ordered a couple oatmeal cookies and morning glory muffins to go. Those were great too! Highly recommend , you won't be disappointed. This place cooks up real food, not the fake stuff you get at McDonald's or those other fast food places We'll be back for sure! Thanks Gabriela!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot. My wife and I came in for breakfast and had a chorizo burrito and a sausage burrito. We both had beans as a side. Everything we had was very apparently cooked with care and attention, they built great layers of flavor into their meat and beans.   The coffee was top notch and my wife really enjoyed her iced tea.   Very affordable as well, $17 for breakfast for the 2 of us, plus a tip because their service was excellent.   We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Excellent.... Turkey burger was great, they allowed me to create my own smoothie - carrot, orange, pineapple... my new fave.. can't wait to come back here... service was very friendly."}
{"text":"I concur with the other 5 star reviews. Service is great, they really enjoy having you eat there. Everything that I've had was great. I'm looking forward to having breakfast there this weekend. It's the closest to home cooking that I've experienced at a restaurant. Gabriela and staff are to be commended for making, what is to me, a welcoming place to eat."}
{"text":"We got the daily special of a carne asada burrito and the turkey burger. The burrito was good and fresh, but way too small for being $8.50. The turkey burger was not anything special. I'd bet the patty was less than a quarter pound, and it didn't have much taste. I couldn't even see it beneath the cheese. Leaving hungry. Kind of disappointed and probably won't come back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious, said the girl that has only been once and tried one thing...but seriously it was really good! I couldn't even wait to take a picture of a full plate! The people are super friendly and attentive. The things that threw me off: when you come in I had no idea if I was supposed to sit myself and have someone come up to me for an order or if I was supposed to go up to the counter...I ended up doing both :/ my confusion was never cleared up because the next two customers sat themselves and someone came to them and the next group went straight to the counter. But all in all its delicious and I will return"}
{"text":"Food was great had the chorizo burrito and chilaqeqas for breakfast. Prices were great, service was acceptable.  Very limited breakfast menu, tried to order the street tacos but the waitress said they didn't serve lunch meals till 11am; bummer. That said as I was paying I overheard the folks who just sat down order the street tacos from Gabriela herself and there was no issue with it. That's the only reason I went four stars. Overall, we would go back."}
{"text":"Gabriella is so sweet & the employees are so kind and really care. It's a really great family atmosphere. They make a mean carne asada burrito."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a happy chance. Score! this little hole in the wall was a winner. A small store front café in a strip mall, the interior is tastefully decorated, there is alfresco dining outside under the canopy. We sat down at a 4 top table. Gabriele herself waited on us. She told us about the day's special which was a meatball sandwich with a side of pasta salad included. After a few minutes we decided on 3 specials. The order was up within minutes.The sandwiches were very good. Gabriela told me they make their meatballs and sauce. The pasta salad was good also. I will be back to try some of the breakfast menu"}
{"text":"Such a cute place. Very clean. The best corn chowder we have had. Ham sandwich was very delicious. Owner, Gabriela, is very knowledgeable in making recipes healthier. We will be back."}
{"text":"I have seen this place on Yelp and the good reviews, so we decided to try it for lunch. The service was fantastic. The owners niece helped us, and she explained that everything is homemade, and it is meant to taste like grandma made it. She was right. I had the soup of the day which was chicken noodle. It was the most delicious chicken noodle soup I have ever had! It was so flavorful! I will definitely be craving it until I can make it back again! The cookies are also good!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend were in the area and decided to try something new. Best way to do that is looking on yelp. Came across Gabriella's which had five stars. It was breakfast time so I ordered the sausage burrito with a side of beans and pancakes. The burrito was a good size and good flavor. The beans could have used something in it because they were plain. The pancakes were really good. What made this a good meal is the fact that all the food was hot! Small cafe but really worth the try! I enjoyed the quick service as well!"}
