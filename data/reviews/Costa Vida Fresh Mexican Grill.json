{"text":"I went here with a friend tonight for a quick dinner, and neither of us had eaten all day.

Let me tell you, we were not disappointed. Their sweet pork quesadillas are incredible, and they are exactly the way I imagined them to be. The servings are a big larger than I am used to, so I couldn't finish all of it, but the containers we were given easily fit lids to make them quick carry-outs. Definitely going to be eating here again, yum!

Watch it made right in front of you, friendly atmosphere, spacious area inside and out to eat."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good & fresh. Staff friendly & service prompt. Wish the line moved quicker when there at a busy times. 
Prices are great for amount of food you get"}
{"text":"Decided to try this new place today.  I ordered the sweet pork enchiladas since it was the daily special.  They came with rice, choice of beans and a small salad portion.  Usually with these assembly line type places the food is only luke-warm.  And.. this place was no different.  The beans had very little flavor and the sweet pork tasted like it was covered in sugar.  It is almost a carbon-copy of Cafe Rio including the bright colored chairs."}
{"text":"Love costa Vida for a quick dinner date or with the family! Delicious and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love Costa Vida! The workers are attentive and friendly. Quite often, the line in store is lengthy (for good reason) and I tend to visit during my lunch break, so I simply call in my order so that I have more time to enjoy it. I am excited that they now have online ordering! That will make ordering for the office much simpler"}
{"text":"If you go here you have to get the sweet pork burrito make sure they throw some guac on the inside and smother it in enchilada sauce and cheese."}
{"text":"Love this place and really good food. Always call head, will save you time in line."}
{"text":"Good place, and good food. I always get the sweet pork, and I love it! However if you go there after 8pm, the food will not test as good as it tastes before that. Unfortunately I have had that experience."}
{"text":"This is a much better alternative than mucho Buritto. Tastes homemade vs. fast food. Very authentic flavor with fresh ingredients. I had the shredded beef Buritto with the habinero sauce and it was delicious. I will definitely come back. Nice festive atmosphere, very clean."}
{"text":"I would give them a 10 STAR if it were possible!  Food is delish!  No surprises, once you go a few times you can easily pick your favorite meals...we would often go here as a family after a long day working at Showhome furniture (our business) IT WAS OUR KIDS FAVORITE CHOICE!  The meals are pretty big and my kids could never eat one meal by themselves...I seriously love COSTA VIDA!!!"}

{"text":"Amazing place to go to for Mexican food!
Ingredients are fresh, and the flavors are superb. You cannot go wrong with anything you would order."}
{"text":"I'm in love with the sweet pork. Not so in love with the prices and the lack of seating. I go here now and then to treat myself. This place really needs to expand. I know I can't be the only one annoyed because of having to time going there just right to get a seat. Something else that needs to be fixed is when you get a receipt for a free dessert. They fail to note on there that the free dessert is just the cinnamon tortilla. So sadly no free flan or tres leches cake."}
{"text":"All I got was bad service and an even worse attitude from the \"Manager\". I put my \"free\" meal in the trash as he dictated how and what I would be eating. Tried it in January and have never been back!"}
{"text":"I just got back from one of the worst experiences at Costa Vida. Let me walk you through it.

I arrive at Costa Vida and the whole team is just standing around. The guy at the front of the line who was supposed to start the orders was too busy making his own tacos first. I hope I didn't inconvenience him too much by coming in to get food.

After the employee finished making his tacos, I had the pleasure of beginning our interaction. The man, eyelids half closed like he just smoked a bowl before work, asked me what I wanted. I asked for a burrito. Let the fun begin.

The employee started making my burrito without asking me what I wanted on it, because he knows me better than I know myself. He started putting black beans on the burrito, even though I wanted pinto beans. Next, I asked for chicken and steak on the burrito. Somehow that translated to sweet pork, because that is what the employee started adding. He then wrapped up the burrito and put it in the oven before asking if I wanted it smothered, which I did. Something tells me this guy was really more concerned about eating the tacos he just made (Please refer to my bowl smoking comment above)

After the burrito was finally ready, the good people at Costa Vida proceeded to put 2-4 small pieces of lettuce next to the burrito (because I always crave plain lettuce with my burritos). I then added guacamole and queso, and the portions were anything but generous.

The best part is that this burrito cost me $12. I didn't order anything besides a burrito. Costa Vida stacks costs like nowhere else I have seen. ($7.49 for the burrito, $1 extra to be smothered, $1 for queso, $1 for guacamole, +tax on all of that).

The food tasted pretty good - I'll give them that. However, the experience was terrible. There are plenty of places I could go for good food. If I am going to keep coming back to a place, I need better incentive. A Chipotle burrito is about $7, they have great service, and the food is amazing. Why pay $12 for a good (but way overpriced) burrito and terrible service?

I hate leaving bad reviews. In fact, I had to make a Yelp account just for this. However, this was a terrible experience."}
{"text":"I love the sweet pork quesadillas. Service is good. Finish things off with a sweet desert. My favorite is the tres-leche. It can get pretty busy so I try to go in around 9 at night or early in the day to avoid long lines."}
{"text":"We love eating here on Tuesdays (tacos are discounted). The sweet pork tacos are the BEST and kids 4 and under get a free cheese quesadilla. Delicious and affordable."}
{"text":"Great healthy fresh food,and always lovely, energetic employees! Dine here often for Mexican! I love the enchiladas and house sauce! Mmm delicious!"}
{"text":"The quality of the ingredients is very high. Everything is fresh, especially the tortillas which taste homemade and not dry or pasty (a rarity for Calgary).  The reward program is also quite impressive. I obtained a reward card during one visit, and when I returned, I was able to save $1 on my order.

However, there are two main points which are disappointing:

- there is an over-abundance of sweet meat on the menu, which is not my preference and doesn't seem to go with the style of the food.

- there is no spice/heat to any of the dishes. I am a major lightweight when it comes to heat, and the \"hot\" sauce tasted mild and bland to me.  

Additionally, note that they don't open until 12 pm on Sunday, which is a bit odd since it's not uncommon to be grabbing lunch at 11 or 11:30."}
{"text":"This spot is a weekly regular!  Mouthwatering food for a decent price!  I crave the sweet pork salad here.  And everyone who gets it can't stop ordering it!   So fresh and made right there when you order."}
{"text":"My husband and I always visit this place because I do believe it's better than mucho burrito. The food is really good. The meat is juicy and they do cook it in front of you. However sometimes they give me two pieces of chicken and I feel like I'm just eating bread. They need to weigh their chicken and make sure they are actually giving enough meat. I also want to mention for any salads or any burritos make sure you get them to drain your beans or you will end up with soggy food."}
{"text":"I normally love costa vida however, my sweet pork enchiladas had virtually no meat in it. I was basically eating a crepe. Really disappointed in this location. Will definitely be sticking to the Costa Vida on baseline from now on."}
{"text":"The sweet pork salad here is really good but the reason I gave this place less stars is for a couple of reasons. One of the reason Costa Vida's score is lower was because the staff is not very friendly. Also the cleaniness factor kind of grossed me out as well. The employee would clean the counter with his gloves on & instead of changing before serving my food he handled my food right after with same gloves he used to clean the counter. Kind of gross."}
{"text":"My Favorite part about Costa Vida is that when I finish my meal, I don't feel weighed down like one typically feels after eating Mexican Food.  It is not only Fresh, but CLEAN.  Thank You Costa Vida for keeping your cooking process Clean and ingredients Fresh.  We can tell a difference.  Great Flavors.   My only critique would be the long lines."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Costa Vida since it came to Arizona. The food, while not really Mexican at all, used to be good and the staff really went the extra mile. Over the last two years though, the quality of the food has slipped tremendously. Every encounter that we have had has been rushed, sloppy, and there is a general lack of care that permeates the atmosphere. The most recent experience involved a to-go order, two enchilada style burritos, that showed up as rice burritos (literally- nothing but tortillas and rice). A quick call down to the restaurant to correct the mistake resulted in a 50% off coupon for the next meal. No offer to fix the order, no refund, no apology... just a coupon for the next meal (which will most likely not be used). I really want to like Costa Vida, but the lack of care and quality make it too easy to choose Cafe Rio to appease my wife's cravings."}
{"text":"Yes the wait is long, for a very good reason. The food is awesome. We have always loved Costa Vida and always will"}
{"text":"Best fast-food Mexican place around. Casual atmosphere, painted with bright colours. Delicious and fresh food. They have a daily special which helps a bit with the price"}
{"text":"Well we decided to give Costa Vida another try (had a coupon). The portion size of the enchilada meal has reduced since the opening. The sweet pork could have been a bit more. The corn tortilla was tough. The Refried beans were like gravy. The lettuce and salsa were minimal. The food was tasty but the quality and quantity is not where it should be. The funny thing is they show a video on their in store tv's and the meal you get doesn't look like what you get."}
{"text":"Excellent service! We came in 2 minutes after close but he didn't turn us away. Instead we were welcomed and served with a big smile! This has been the service we receive consistently, always very positive (all staff). 
The last couple times we've been here we have been given very generous portions. 
It's true what other reviewers have said about it not being authentic... But honestly hardly anything available that claims to be Mexican is (especially in this price range). Seems to be hardly a reason to give a bad review... This is Calgary... 
Overall, I would say to go for the great atmosphere the staff create! And give that guy David a raise ;)"}
{"text":"mmmm mmmm mmmmm... good lunch place if your in a hurry"}
{"text":"Meh
A bit pricier than Chipotle
Longer wait in line
80% of workers teenagers
Beans over seasoned and old 
Rice dry and flavorless
Chicken in tacos dry
I could seriously make fresher Mexican food at home. Tried it won't be back."}
{"text":"I love the food...?packed with flavor without all the salt!!  Their chips and queso is the best I've had."}
{"text":"I've been twice to this location already and both times the food was excellent.  The drive-thru took about 10 minutes, but that's what I expected from a drive-thru that serves fresh food... instead of fries and chicken nuggets.  The line staff was very interactive and engaged me while completing my families meals. The only negative I would say is the surrounding construction taking place of the neighboring buildings."}
{"text":"This is the most exciting thing to happen to Southland Crossing Mall in a looooong time. Costa Vida is a very large and clean fast food Mexican restaurant, which hails originally from the US. 
Walking in,  the place was busy, even on a Wednesday night but were quickly greeted by friendly staff who asked us if we were newcomers. They guessed correctly, so they explained how the menu worked and I was pleasantly surprised when they asked if there were any food allergies we may have. 
The breads are warmed and baked fresh when you order and while the menu isn't extensive, what they do offer is very fresh and filling. For ten bucks, I got 2 fish tacos with beans and rice. The rice and beans were perfectly cooked, not gummy or dry like they tend to be in some other fast food joints. All the veggies like cabbage and cilantro were crispy and you can tell the  tomatoes and lettuce are cut by hand, not the pre cut bagged business. 
Each day they have a different item of the  menu on special. The best part is the Costa Vida card. each time you make a purchase, a percentage of your dollar amount spent goes back on your card. This eventually adds up to free $$ to spend on a meal. 
I am elated have a quick, healthy (ish) fast food option in my hood for those lazy nights I can't be bothered to cook. . . I'll be redeeming my card for free food in no time."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but the take out is horrible. I called to place an order and was put on hold for almost 5 minutes. I finally hung up and called back. They answered and took my order immediately so I'm pretty sure they'd completely forgotten about me the first time. Then the girl on the phone couldn't answer my very basic question and had to ask someone else. When I got there, they hadn't even started making my food. After several minutes, I had to grab someone's attention to remind them I was standing there waiting for my order. And even then, it took a few minutes for someone to start on my order. What's the point of take out? I could have just come in and waited in line and it would've been less hassle."}
{"text":"I love Costa Vida, and love the convenience that the drive thru would offer, IF they ever got my order right. Since this location opened I've used the drive thru about a dozen times and they have yet to get my order right...whether it's not giving me the dressing for my salad or messing up the details of the items ordered. I don't check my order before I pull away because I feel bad holding up the line any longer than is necessary (that's my bad). Again, love the food, wish I could get my food as ordered. I keep going back...but I think it's time to cut it off."}
{"text":"I'll list this place in the very rare \"one star\" category. My reviews are usually about food; however, this one is about service and food. 

First off, the food is a B-. I was advised to order the sweet pork burrito, which was uhhh very sweet? plus, it was pricey. The pork was so sweet that I may have been diagnosed with Diabetes. 

Second, the service was poor. I am a huge fan of Chipotle and their setup of burrito construction - fast, polite workers, ability to see your options. This place is a little off because I couldn't see any of the extras you put in the burrito. Anyways, what did it for me was the man behind the counter. He was so rude when I asked to put lettuce in my burrito. His response was, \"It wouldn't taste good that way.\" He then wrapped the burrito with only the pork and I moved on to a girl, who put my lettuce, pico on top. So weird....

I will never go back, because of the rudeness. The cliche: \"the customer is always right\" may apply in this case? Oh well... back to Chipotle"}
{"text":"Meh. Food was mediocre. What I don't understand was their pricing. I ordered a the vegetarian while my boyfriend ordered the chicken. I noticed it was a dollar more but figured their were some fresh veggies or something. Nope. Everything That's on the chicken, without the chicken, but priced more? It was only beans, cheese, sour cream and tortilla. There's too much competition in the south west to settle for this crap."}
{"text":"I have been to this Costa Vida around 8 times now and I have to say I love it. I would highly recommend the sweet pork burrito especially on a Saturday as it is on special. The amount of food you get for $8.79 is amazing I can barely finish it and it is so good. Two things that make this a four star review and not 5, the ordering process is slow and unorganized and the drink situation is unorganized. Instead of an ice machine there is a bucket on the counter filled with ice. Not a huge deal just wish the people behind the counter would be more organized. Other than that I would recommend this place to anyone I love it."}
{"text":"Just ate there or should I say tried. My daughter loves their sweet pork so I figured why not try it. It was horrible. The chicken was dry and the \"fresh\" tortilla was rubbery.  The rice was crunchy and the enchilada sauce was gross.  Threw most of it in the garbage. So much for dinner. This will be my last time here. It's back to Cafe Rio for me!"}
{"text":"What can I say that I haven't already said?! Today I ordered the sweet pork salad and it was as good as the sweet pork taco. I recommend getting the costa vida club card if you plan on frequenting CV on a regular or semi-regular basis."}
{"text":"This is our goto semi quick Mexican food.  The fresh tortillas being made right in front of you are awesome. I like the setup of the restaurant (or as you go and take back to table with you). The wife loves their sweet pork taco salad and I can't stop ordering the basic cheese enchiladas.  It's usually busy which helps to turn over the food faster.  There us plenty of seating and outdoor seating also.  They usually have surf flicks playing on the big screen."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal Costa Vida customer for a long time but that just changed. The Tempe location started out pretty good but I just had the worst sweet pork salad I've ever eaten. Everything about it tasted horrible and I'm pretty sure some of the contents were spoiled. I was only able to eat a quarter of it before deciding it was time to throw it away so I wouldn't get sick. I won't be coming back to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"Costa vida is an American chain, where I first encountered it. It is simply amazing. It's definitely not authentic mexican, but they don't pretend to be, so just relax. This might sound weird, but get the Sweet Pork Salad. It's large enough for two people. They have a lime/cilantro/ranch dressing which tastes like melted joy drizzled on your dream-girl's tummy topped with a river of self-assuring high fives. Trust me. It's good."}
{"text":"I don't mind this place, keep in mind it is not \"authentic\" in any way. I would compare their food to mucho burritos but I would much rather choose mucho. 

Costa Vida are extremely stingy on their serving sizes and practically count each individual piece of chicken or beef they give you. They are also relatively over-priced, gouging for every penny they can get out of you. They even charge extra for salsa or sour cream, which is usually always included at every other Mexican place I have been to.

I would eat here again but not very often to save my wallet and especially when I'm not that hungry."}
{"text":"$21 for a quesadilla and water. Thats all I have to say, doesn't matter if it was good or not."}
{"text":"If I could give their sweet pork more than 5 stars I would. I'd give 100 - seriously the best meat on the planet. My staple order is the sweet pork salad - a perfect and heavenly blend of sweet pork, rice, beans (I usually skip 'em), and delicious salad fixings like cotija cheese, pico, guac, cilantro and little chip things. Top it off with the tomatillo ranch and you're ready to experience amazingness. Seriously - hook me up to an IV of that stuff. I've ventured out to sweet pork burritos, tacos, and the quesadilla, but always come back to my old favorite. If you're looking for traditional Mexian food - this ain't it. But if you want a fresh delicious treat, give it a go."}
{"text":"I am crazy about Costa Vida! The food is spectacular, the atmosphere is inviting and the location is wonderful. 

The Sweet Pork is a must try if you haven't. I can't get enough of the tomatillo ranch and the chips and queso are ridiculously good. I could see it being a really great place for a student to call ahead and get their food on the way to class. It's nice to have a really fresh Mexican restaurant with a lot of flavor finally in my neighborhood. 

My experience has been that the staff and management are very accommodating if I bring something to their attention."}
{"text":"Love this place amazing food!! I got the shredded beef tacos and chips with Guac and yummmmyy!!!"}
{"text":"Costa Vida is by far my favorite restaurant. Their sweet pork is to die for - whenever I take any of my friends there we always end up getting the same thing - sweet pork! The atmosphere is cool and casual and whether you are staying for 10 minutes or 2 hours, you never feel rushed by the servers or bus staff."}
{"text":"I usually love this place, even though they have issues with customer service and being nice to customers in general. They have great food. i usually get their steak salad. Their pork is also to DIE FOR but i visited today March 7th 2017 and i am questioning ever going to eat here again. Usually i get my boyfriend tacos to go and they always separate everything into containers so your food doesn't get soggy and gross. So as i go to order my food the worker was absolutely rude. I told her about 3 times i needed them to go, wouldn't let me finish saying what i wanted on my order. Immediately she would just keep saying, \"are you guys getting anything else!?!\" She was so eager  to get us out of her way when there was no one else behind us in line. Then proceeded to be angry about the fact that my mother ordered gluten free tacos? Once we got to the cashier, she very nice, i told her i wanted everything separated for the tacos and the girl who was rude, got defensive and yelled, \"i wrote it in there!!! that's what i'm doing!!!\" By the end of my line experience i was left with soggy tacos and feeling angry. Debating on ever eating here again."}
{"text":"Similar to Chipotle in the States, this is a fast food style place. You walk along the line and choose your dish. But, unlike Chipotle this place is great. 

The food is fresh and doesn't taste fast food like at all. If you are looking for something quick, yummy and filling, this is the place to be. 

The nachos were huge but I just wish there was more sides with it; can never have too much guacamole."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food! I always take my family here when they come out to visit. I got the raspberry chipotle chicken and it was SO GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Good burritos...be prepared to wait in line if you go at rush hour but likely worth it. Sweet pork burritos are unique and good....also try the chipolte chicken burrito (not on menu)..it's tasty. The nachos were not good. It would be great if they offered ground beef as well as shredded beef as an option."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and customer service. So glad they there is a location in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Not good.  Would not go here again.  The quality of mexican was very dissapointing (worse than fast food taco bell)."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place randomly, while we were waiting for our cars to be detailed - and it was a pleasant surprise.

Ordering was quick, and there is a great selection of mexican-ish quick bites to choose from - from enchiladas to burritos and salads. The meats and vegetables tasted fresh, and it looks like they make their own tortillas and such in house.

Otherwise, the bathrooms are nice and clean, and parking is pretty easy to find.

Overall, a great quick bite! Worth a visit."}
{"text":"This place isn't really a mexican restaurant. It's closer to pita jungle in my book. If my wife didn't love this place, I probably would never eat here.

We usually go for taco tuesdays because otherwise we couldn't justify the high cost. It's almost always a 20-30min wait to get through the line. The tacos are soggy, the tortillas are undercooked, all the meats are too sweet. The workers are inconsistent with the amount of meat they put on the tacos.

On the bright side, the lime ranch is really good. The workers are generally friendly.

Gentlemen, I applaud your sacrifice and willingness to eat here for your wife's sake."}
{"text":"It's a Chipotle, but not as good.  Steak is not Carne Asada... by no means is this a Mexican place. Neither is Chipolte, but at least it's good. The thing that bumped it from one star though is fresh made tortillas and Coke in a bottle."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time and enjoyed the Taco Tuesday specials. It's good value for fast food. What made this place really stand out was the customer service. I asked for a special preparation and they cheerfully exceeded expectations! I got fantastic custom service just before closing time. We'll be eating here more often."}
{"text":"So Disappointing. Although the serving size was large, the food itself was very bland. The \"green chilli\" sauce was sweet and sugary and ruined the enchilada entree. My boyfriend tried the burrito with red sauce, and it also lacked any kind of flavor. It was semi-tolerable after being smothered in cholula sauce. All in all, we will not be reutnring or spending anymore money at Costa Vida."}
{"text":"Wouldn't fry my burrito to make it chimichanga style... All you have to do is throw it in the fryer... Not hard the food blew . Never comin back"}
{"text":"The tortillas are made FRESH!  The Sweet Pork give your sheer bites of heaven.  I just wish we could get Costa Vida at Major League Sporting Events!  Between our family members.. We LOVE it all!  Yum!!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Baja food. Brings me back to the beach. 
Awesome home made tortillas.The tortilla maker is upfront, so you can see them make and heat the tortillas."}
{"text":"Usually good food but I went with the beef enchilada rather than my usual burrito. The enchilada is one third the size and almost the same price. Stick with the burritos."}
{"text":"The customer service here is awesome!! Everyone is so friendly. There's always a good amount of people here because the food is so good! I am so glad they opened in this area because I've had nothing but bad experiences with the similar place Cafe Rio next door. Great job to the hiring team! Very well runned ship for being brand new. Can you tell I am a food service manager. (Customers come first then the people will keep Coming)"}
{"text":"Been here 8-10 times, it was much better and the food was fresher when it first opened. Quality has gone way down"}
{"text":"We came to Costa Vida because the food looked similar to Cafe Rio, however when we ordered we find out the portions are quite small especially for the cost.  Mediocre food for high price."}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone else is eating here, but I have eaten here 2 times and no one in my family liked the food, and I couldn't even eat it. I assume they think of themselves in the Baja Fresh/Rubios/Chipotle style of restaurant, but this place has a really weird vibe.  I am very forgiving when it comes to food, and I love those other burrito places and generally am happy to eat any mexican food, but this place crossed the line of decency.  The first time I was here I got a sort of chicken burrito, it was gross, could not taste the chicken through the sauces and junk on it and did not finish (I always finish).  My kids got taco and nachos and didn't eat much, I tried them and understood why.  2nd visit I got a sort of steak burritto, and kept it fairly plan.  Again, it was not very good.  The meat was sweet and just not good.  The family also not impressed again.  The towards the end of the meal a worker came by with a mop and was mopping the floor of the room we were in, while we were in it (cornering us).  The mop water was so foul smelling that we just had to leave.  Bad experiences.  This place has a very weird vibe.  Nothing lively about their food,  Although the smell did remind me of the coast, but not the coast I like to visit."}
{"text":"I love cafe rio and heard Costa vida is also very good. I decided to try the new location and go through their drive-thru. I've been sitting in the drive thru so long that I decided to write this review. There are only 4 cars in front of me and it took 15+ min to get my food. This line is one of the slowest drive-thru I have ever sat in! And then I get my food, get home, and realize they didn't even give me dressing for my salad. They really lacked on the chicken and toppings for the salad too. Extremely disappointed and I will not be coming back. I guess I'm sticking with cafe rio from now on where I actually get what I pay for."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite places. Love the sweet pork salads from there. I go there a couple times a month for the sweet pork salad. You should try them out."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Costa Vida and it was pretty good.  The have daily specials and the line was very efficient - set up like Chipotle.  The queso was good - tacos and salads were good as well.  Not fantastic but a great place close to ASU to grab a bite."}
{"text":"I took my wife here on our first date and I believe that is the reason she married me. I heard of this place in 2006 and tried the sweet pork burrito enchilada style with mild sauce. It was so delicious, fresh, and amazing that it has been impossible for me to order anything else. The pork sauce is sweet and savory. Whenever I go back to AZ I always go here!"}
{"text":"Figured I would try this place as I love Mexican food and have been waiting for it to open. Turns out I have been here twice on the same day... MY FIRST AND LAST TIME!

The staff seemed uninterested in helping me out. Then I noticed that the bean buckets were caked with a cement like substance that looked like VERY old product. I ordered the fish tacos, and when they were finally done, the price seemed to be almost 50% more than I anticipated. The tacos were much smaller than the burrito's that are half the price. I had to leave without taking the product, or paying for it. It just seemed too sketchy and way too expensive for what was made. A fresh grill, it is not.

Mucho Burrito, I'm sorry I ever doubted you. I will be back soon, and often. This place, on the other hand, needs to up their game considerably or face the dire consequences that other low quality, high priced operators face..."}
{"text":"What an absolute disaster...where to begin.

I ordered a \"Vegetarian Quesadilla\" tonight at 6 pm thinking it should be top quality given its dinner time on a Saturday night.  Umm...not.  First, there was no choice of the shell, regardless of the options given on the sign as they only had one available.  Minor issue, shrugged it off.

They gave my wife's burrito to the guy in front of us.  Instead of chasing him down as he left (since he ordered a Quesadilla), they just made my wife another burrito.  Weird poor service and order tracking.  Questioning why I came here at this point but it gets better...

So I watch as the cook flips my quesadilla over with no ingredients inside except cheese.  She comes over and asks if I want beans and rice on the side?  I indicate that I ordered a vegetarian quesadilla, not a cheese one.  Her response was \"it only has cheese, we don't have any vegetables here\".  What?  She then asks if I want some and I say yes.  She adds diced tomatoes and refried beans, both which were soaking in sauce.  I pay, we leave and I know its going to be sogging pile of mush, which it was.  But it gets better...

So the only thing I hate worse than bad food is wasting food so I try to eat some.  The rice on the side was dry and hard but about 10 bites I find something harder.  I pull it out and it appears to be a bone chip.  Could be a rock as well..not sure looking at it but whatever it is I could have broken a tooth.  And if it is bone, where the heck did it come from with only beans and rice?

We went here because my wife had a nice experience previously...must of gotten lucky.  I've never done a yelp review (selfishly used other yelpers to help our choices though) but felt compelled to write this as soon as I dumped the food in the trash.  There wasn't just a problem with the food quality, or ordering process, or the menu but pretty much everything went bad.  This was one of the worst food experiences I've ever had and at this price, $9.99 for a cheese quesadilla with dry rice and bland beans on the side, I expected one of the best.  Good luck eating there, if you dare."}
{"text":"Costa Vida is TEN times better than dumb Cafe Rio, which people seem to like. Costa's portions are better, their sauces are fresher and better, their sweet pork is more flavorful, and you can actually order small OR large sizes instead of being stuck with a $9 salad, like you do at Rio. Let's put it this way - I just ate dinner and I'll probably STILL hit Costa Vida tonight! I like their loyalty program too - I've already had a free meal and I'm almost on my 2nd free one. Costa rocks!!"}
{"text":"If you havent been here yet YOU ARE MISSING THE BOAT.  This place has some of the best food I have every eaten.  The salads are simply AMAZING and the spicy ranch dressing is so good."}
{"text":"The food was tasty, however, the 'hot' sweet pork was more like kinda luke warm. We got there right as they opened at 11. I had to tell three different people what I ordered, the daily special. Something near the soda fountain area was awful smelling. I think it was the drain just below the teas, wow was it awful. I attempted to get the Gold Peak Sweet Tea that was on the container, turns out it was not that at all. When I asked the young lady at the register she said it was Mango-Passion Fruit tea and when I asked if they didn't label it as such I got literally a blank stare. So when I mentioned the smell near the fountain, yup, same blank stare. :-\   

With so many options in and around Dana Park you can be sure that I will not be here again."}
{"text":"YUM! Seriously Sweet pork salad is ALWAYS fantastic, fresh and quick to grab when in a hurry!"}
{"text":"First time in. Won't be the last. Food is fantastic, fresh and flavorful. Had the steak burrito. Price was reasonable, I'm full for 12 dollars. Way better than the other places."}
{"text":"Save yourself the $14. Got the steak fajita quesadilla that cost $11. Which consisted of q little amount on steak and half a cup of some sad looking peppers. And I don't necessarily need service with a smile but the employees looked downright miserable. I felt bad for them. Salsa sucked too."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp. Was very satisfied. Food was awesome; very tasty. Ingredients were fresh. Service was quick and polite. 

Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is like an expensive (which doesn't mean it is very much) Chipotle style restaurant.  The food was good, but not great.  I won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Was a great place to come being the family you can see them making the food right in front of you! I love the sweet pork salad! The staff is nice and friendly. I also have had the sweet pork tacos on taco Tuesday not as good as the salad they get soggy. All in all great place to eat."}
{"text":"We're regulars there. Have tried different items on the menu and it is consistently good and filling. Very affordable too. Pleasant staff."}
{"text":"So good. Freshly made tortillas right in front of you as you order. All fresh ingredients. Finally some good Mexican food in Calgary with big American sized portions! Would love it if they opened one downtown."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars but a couple  things need improvement, the long lines /wait and getting the order right. 
I 've been to this restaurant about 20 times or more , I love  the mango chicken salad.
    Take out is what I do because the line is always too long.
  For the last three times they got my order wrong. Each time they gave  me a  dinner for free on the next visit. I'm not looking for a free dinner , I just want what I ordered.  I will definitely be double checking and I will  have the  person taking the order repeat it back to me.

If I didn't call my order in I would be line for a very long time ,I wish they would speed things up and get the order right because I really like this place."}
{"text":"super good, \"authentic-ER\" Mexican food. always fresh and i like that they make it right in front of you. their cilantro rice is my favorite. so flavourful and tasty. these guys give you good portions and are always polite and friendly. the look of the restaurant is nice as well."}
{"text":"Difficult review to write - here is my advice - know what you are walking into, and you will have a good experience. Is this 'authentic' Mexican food?  No!  I don't expect to get a truly 'authentic' meal where I can try something totally different every time I go. I go to Costa Vida because it's quick and when I want to have something that I know what it will taste like.  With that said - in my opinion it's a tad bit pricy for the quality you get. I had been going back quite often because I had a coupon that I would use which would take about $3 off (per person).  They have now discontinued the use of that coupon. For 2 people who get a burrito and a drink (not including chips and salsa or dessert), you'll end up somewhere around $22- $23.  Again - not outrageous (and there aren't a ton of alternatives that are cheaper). But without that coupon, there are alternatives (Cafe Rio, Boca Taqueria, etc) that I will alternate to mix things up."}
{"text":"This place is in Royal Oak.  Good Mexican food, an alternative to Mucho Burrito.  I ordered the Chicken Burrito, and got it smothered.  It was extremely tasty and filling.  A bit pricy though, but there was a deal as it as a combo, and for $9.99, not too bad.  The service was friendly and the staff seemed to be talkative on this one Friday evening."}
{"text":"Yelp was instrumental in our finding this little gem in Southland Crossing. We were happy to have a new Mexican place to frequent but when we saw the prices we were ecstatic. 
I do not remember seeing anything priced over $11.99 and by that I mean a full meal. There is a different special each day and judging by the one I tried, they are an excellent bargain. I had Sweet Pork burritos with rice, re fried beans, guacamole, and pico gallo. It was a very good sized meal and cost about $8.50. She had the Mango Chicken taco salad and she can not stop talking about how fresh, crisp and tasty it was. 
All dishes are served in tin foil take-out tins, the kind you normally seal on top with a thin cardboard lid. This is curious to eat from when dining in. I guess it saves on dishes and doubles as your take home container if you can't finish it all. Smart people won't even try to finish it all. Someday I plan to be smart.
We are going back for more very soon."}
{"text":"Gotta have my sweet pork salad! So yummy!"}
{"text":"To start off with the menu is confusing and seemingly dishonest with prices. I had no clue how much what I was ordering cost even with the attendant helping me. When asking about what kind of oil was used in the \"grilled veggies\" the person who was taking our order didn't even know and another worker said it was \"salad oil\" no idea what that is.. Looking over the counter at the food sitting in pools of various dark liquids about ruined my appetite."}
{"text":"I love this place. Amazing fresh food and a great crew. They just opened so there are always little issues to work out but overall they are amazing. The pork burrito with green Chile sauce is a perfect cambo. So glad they are growing within the valley."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty fun Mexicana joint.  

Their decor is surfer inspired and looks like a page out of Coastal California.  

There is a ton of seating inside and also a great patio outside.  

The salads are great and huge portions.  A small is enough for a meal as it comes with rice too. I recommend the pulled pork for the salad with black beans and refried beans. If you like cilantro try the cilantro lime dressing, if not try the salsa ranch. 

There is a fountain of Horchada (or something like that) which is a milky cinnamon drink. and is delicious!"}
{"text":"Seriously do you like super sweet Mexican food? Then this is the place for you. More white than Cafe Rio. The sweet pork is good but don't get anything \"smothered\" in red sauce because it's like the taste of cinnamon toast crunch all over your food. The nachos offers a more balanced flavor. Also I've tried the chicken quesadilla. I think their chicken tastes weird, almost sour-tasting, so I didn't finish it. They basically have the same four basic ingredients in different forms, not a lot of variety except in the meat. Oh and no fajita seasonings, like onions, green and red bell peppers, etc. I know they don't offer fajitas but I think their menu is lacking options bedsides the meat choices."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular at the Costa Vida on Val Vista when I worked in that area, and I looked forward to having one close by in Tempe.  On our visit there with friends tonight, the staff was friendly, but the food at this new location was a huge disappointment.

The house-made tortillas looked soft and wonderful when we were ordering at the counter, but the enchilada fillings and sauces for those tortillas all turned out to be overly sugared.  When I ordered the green chili sauce for my enchiladas, I was expecting something that would be mostly green.  Instead, the sauce was brown and thick, and any chilis in it were hard to spot.   Then when the entree was heated after it was assembled, the bottom part of the enchiladas was practically fused to the bottom of the aluminum tray, and it was hard to cut with the plastic cutlery. 

I won't be going back, but if circumstances put me there again I'd start with one of those beautiful tortillas and be very careful about what I ordered to put inside or on top of it."}
{"text":"Have had only take out. Sometimes the dishes are a bit cold by the time we got them, but that may just be due to our large order (for the whole office) and transport time. I really like the tacos, although they've never been very spicy."}
{"text":"Too sweet and too salty. Very expensive. Look elswhere for real mexican food. For the price, we could have gone to Casa Reynoso."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place.  My husband and I just had lunch here.  I ordered the sweet pork enchiladas with the red and green sauce.  The pork tasted like it was candied pork (tons of brown sugar)- not my thing and made my belly hurt from it being SO sugary.  My husband ordered the burrito bowl with chicken.  Chicken was just ok.  Their salsas were so watery, there was about 1-2 inches of liquid at the bottom of his bowl.  It was more like lukewarm soup with no flavor.  Everything was kind of lukewarm.... Habanero salsa was ok... just not very spicy.  Beans and rice were just ok...not a whole lot of flavor.  If you like sweet food, this place may be up your alley.  Thought about coming back and trying something else, but too many other good places to eat...It's similar to Qdoba or Chipotle, except not good.  I'd even prefer Taco Bell over this place.  Sad and disappointed about the visit.  What a waste of calories..... :("}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh, fresh!  I love the drive thru when you want a fast, fresh, healthy lunch or dinner.  Their food is made fresh and I love the sweet pork salad that comes in 2 sizes.  Their portions are ample and I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my experience here tonight. I've been here about 7-8 times and finally took my husband and he's officially been scared off from ever trying it.  For  starters the staff weren't wearing gloves and were touching all the tortillas and from one order to another. I should have said something right then. 

I got sweet pork enchiladas. The corn tortillas were harder than usual and didn't seem fresh. The refried beans were so watery I would have needed a spoon, except then I found a black hair in my food and saw the guy who prepared my food picking his nails and completely lost my appetite. Which was fine by me because despite going through the heater oven, my meal was quite cold, especially the beans and rice.

I should have complained at the store but I was irritated and left. I am going to call though. This used to be my favorite place and now I'm not sure... I still feel sick and my stomach is sore."}
{"text":"Visiting from Minnesota and looking for some good Mexican food. This place definitely hit the spot!  Taco salad with steak and Tomatillo Ranch dressing was delish!  Loved the Chicken Tortilla soup too!! Would have given them 5 stars but they were out of shrimp."}
{"text":"tHiS rEsTaUrAnT Is OvErRaTtEd AnD oVeR pRiCeD dO nOt EaT hErE!1!1!1 so i got a nasty chicken burrito and the chicken was too burnt and dry also my burrito was really soggy if you want decent mexican food go to taco bell or something like this crap nasty"}
{"text":"Came in for Taco Tuesday--which seems like the most economical way to eat tacos here! $1.50 per taco instead of close to $5 per taco. There are also daily specials.
Tried the grilled chicken, sweet pork, and raspberry chipotle chicken tacos. All very testy, but my fave was the sweet pork. Very tasty! 
Beware, lines start about 6:15pm and are dozens of people deep! Lines move quickly for the ordering, but backs up at the registers. 
The woman behind me ordered a salad, which started with a homemade tortilla on the bottom, all the other fixings, then lettuce on top. 
Will likely be headed back to try the salad and nachos, they both looked delish!"}
{"text":"The sweet pork with sweet green chile sauce is the bomb!! Fresh tortilla made right in front of you can't be beat. Get it smothered with cheese on top!!! Wow!  Best burrito ever!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I love it. The staff was really nice and the food is fresh. I got the special, Sweet Pork Salad and the meat was really tender. I think the sweet sauce is a little too sweet and BBQ like but still delicious."}
{"text":"I am in Calgary on business and stopped here for a quick bite. DELICIOUS!!!  Can't wait until they open one at home"}
{"text":"I have pretty simple taste, but the food here really is amazing. I'm particularly big on the chicken burrito- smothered of course.

The wait is RIDICULOUS though. I figured out a long time ago that you can order your food by phone and get it quicker than waiting in line- even if you order it when you arrive! I would probably give it 5 stars if it weren't for the wait."}
{"text":"Love this place! Healthy options, great quality and they have never gotten an order wrong through the drive-thru!!"}
{"text":"Costa vida can be good the problem is that it's not constantly good. Also the pricing is confusing and if you ask the employes (ex. Does a side of sour cream cost anything?) all of them will give you a different answer. I like the pork but a lot of the time it is hardly shredded at all."}
{"text":"We are regulars at the Mesa Val Vista location.  The line moved quickly and we took the food home.  I ordered the Taco Tuesday Sweet Pork option and I was very pleased with the flavor and portion size.  We have eaten here several times before and have never had a bad experience except the line gets long sometime.... which goes to show that it's popular and in high demand. 

The medium sauce lit me up a little bit and the heart burn kicked in around midnight, but it was all worth it.  We will frequent this location again soon."}
{"text":"Food: just ok.  Not bad but not good enough to make me switch from my regular spots.

Service:  drive thru experience bad.  Waited in line for WAY too long while employees tried to sort orders.

Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My employer always caters from this place and the food is always deconstructed so we can put our own bowls together. This was my first time dining in and it was a different experience. It's an open kitchen just like your neighborhood chipotle where you can choose your meats, carbs and additions. I went for the chicken bowl with a side of chips to dip into the tomatillo ranch. The tomatillo ranch is out of this world, I haven't tasted anything like it anywhere else. Imagine a ranch dressing with a hint of cilantro and bitterness from a tomatillo, so bomb!! I ordered a rice bowl with black beans and my meats were chicken and sweet pork. The pork was ok and the chicken was pretty standard for grilled Mexican chicken. I added pico and sour cream on top and than slathered that tomatillo ranch over, sounds nasty but tastes so good. My wife had the quesadilla which was pretty standard and just ok. I think a 3 star rating is fare for a commercial eatery like this place."}
{"text":"Best Mexican grill there is and always will be. Get the sweet pork!! If you don't, you will regret it"}
{"text":"Used to go to the Dana Park location and loved it. This one can be awesome, but it is very inconsistent. Sometimes the sweet pork can taste extremely bland and one time it even tasted like something was wrong with the meat. Overall a great value, though (when the meat is on par)."}
{"text":"Brought my husband here today because I ate here a few days ago and it was really good.  While I very much enjoyed the food quality today,  they definitely did not have their poop in the group today.  We were there a few minutes before 11 when they open and patiently waited outside,  it was a beautiful day...  5 min past 11 I decided to try the door in case I missed them unlocking it (BTW,  there are probably 7-8 other people waiting as well)...nope still locked. Around 10 after they opened the door to the hungry mob.  It was clear that they didn't have every one on the line,  and it took so long to get our food.  It wasn't quite right either.  I ordered the quesadilla meal which comes with rice and beans,  but they sort of forgot about my food and by the time we were paying they asked me if I wanted the rice and beans.  I didn't want to wait anymore so I just said no thank you.

I know stuff happens,  so hopefully this was an isolated incident.  I really like their food and would like to give them another chance.   My husband enjoyed his Chile Verde burrito and their salsa was great."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and the food is great. The bathrooms on the other hand are a whole other story. Toilet paper all over the floors, railing, and walls. Unflushed toilets with poop in them. Pee all over the seats. You name it, I saw it in there. I had to hover my poor daughter over the seat because everything was so disgusting. If they can't manage to keep their bathrooms clean, how on earth do they keep they keep their kitchen clean??"}
{"text":"We live in the mecca of amazing Mexican food then there is this place. When did Mexican food become so sweet it hurts my teeth? I was so disappointed it was horrid. However I will say young people seemed to love this. Me I prefer  food that's called Mexican to actually be Mexican. Even my child hated this and she hates spicy. Ehh gross. However the staff.at the register was friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered take out for me and 2 people and it took 30 minutes before it was ready. It is really delicious though so besides the wait I was very happy! Very fresh tasting."}
{"text":"Not very authentic Mexican food BUT it's my favorite spot! Their wet burritos are a must."}
{"text":"Wow am I hooked. I get the raspberry chicken burrito. It's so delicious!!!!! It's also very large. I am able to eat it for lunch then finish it up for dinner so technically two meals for around ten dollars is a great bargain. I can't explain just how delicious it is. My son always has the steak burrito with rice and black beans smothered in medium sauce which is his preference. He can't finish it in one sitting but he doesn't have two meals from it like I do. It's clean, staff is friendly and the food is delicious and the price is very good for what you receive"}
{"text":"I had never been here  but seen it for years. It is one of my boyfriends favorites and I am now hooked. He loves the sweet pork and while I like it, it is a little sweet for me so I usually get one of the other great meats. I love their nachos, they put a ton of stuff on them and they are very tasty. Reasonable food, always tastes fresh, and the whole family loves it. Clean nice atmosphere. Quick service."}
{"text":"The sweet cinnamon tortilla is a tasty desert."}
{"text":"Today I ordered a small shredded beef nacho with the fixings. I come here about once a week because I love the food and service. I would have given five stars but my shredded beef was full of fatty blobs and the onions in the pico de Gallo were so huge. Other than that, they always make make fresh a whole wheat tortilla for my husbands salad."}
{"text":"Love the food! Service is terrible. This location is always so poorly understaffed. We do a lot of to go orders and every time it's an additional 10-20 minutes on top of the 20 minutes they quote on the phone. I don't understand why they can't figure their concept out and make it run more efficiently. Chipotle does it. 

If you're not in a hurry and not hungry order a sweet pork salad. Otherwise head over to Cafe Zuppas where the service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Good food, but they charge $1.08 for a cup of salsa now... I always get extra salsa with my burrito and so I won't be coming here anymore"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch at around 1 no wait at all. Ordered the salad with chicken .  I liked how they first line the tray with a fresh tortilla and then pile the ingredients on top .  Salad came with lettuce , pico, guacamole, beans, rice, and tortilla strips.  Large size portion and I ordered the small( only ate about half my plate and was full).  Everything looks fresh and tasted fresh as well!  Will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Good and quick Mexican food.  I ordered a burrito type of lunch combo. It  had a bit of everything (burrito, beans, veggies and guacamole on the side)  The service was friendly and the staff provided some recommendations since I had no idea what to order? 

They also provided me with some sort of Costa Vida card to use next time. Food tasted good and fresh. Will be back again to try something else out."}
{"text":"Love Costa Vida!! I always get there steak salads! I'm obsessed! Employees are friendly and the place is always clean. 

Sucks there closed on Sunday's but other then that it's my favorite place! I wish they had a location in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years! My daughter loves the food here too.
Decided to try the taco Tuesday special $1.75 for chicken , beef or pork. The pork is a sweet pork (yummy)
Today I asked for corn tortillas. OMG! They made them fresh for me! Superb! Perfectly cooked and not crumbly!!

YOU GOTTA TRY THE CORN TORTILLAS!!!

We also had the Flan and Key Lime pie. JUST DO IT!!!"}
{"text":"Gringo mexican food. Bland food, small portions, and their hottest salsa is a mango habanero. Hot doesn't mean sweet... for the same money I am going to Chipotle next time"}
{"text":"I had a few tacos here, and it was ok, but by no means great.  Other places have a variety of salsas, and don't charge extra for that.  Costa Vida lets you pick one, and it wasn't even that good.  Carne asada was basically flavorless, and the tacos fell apart.

Lots of people rave about the \"sweet pork\", and it was fine.  It's pulled pork in a sweet BBQ sauce, I'm more a fan of grilled meat, which Costa Vida doesn't seem to do well.  Still, it's not a 2-star place, I'd stop by again if I was there and had to grab something quick."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and the food is a great deal. Yum for the raspberry chicken salad..added steak! guacamole and Pico. .soo good with cilantro ranch"}
{"text":"Friendly employees. bean and rice burrito w guac is my go-to. But for the meat lovers out there I'd highly recommend the raspberry chipotle chicken"}
{"text":"One of my favorites. Sweet pork burrito is always a winner. Would have given five stars if only the dude that makes the burrito could manage a smile now and then - he always looks bored and like he's doing you a favor. Otherwise, it's all good."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Got the Monday special which was pork burrito with green chile super good! The staff is so nice!"}
{"text":"How do you call yourself a Mexican grill and not use chili!s or spices. Sure a good size burrito, decent ratio inside, but no spice. The food should pop with flavor and after eating thier \"hot\", nothing but a plain sauce.  Very disappointing.  If you do not like flavorful Mexican food, or eaten actual Mexican food, you will love this place."}
{"text":"I am a heavily tattooed person which in 2016 shouldn't be an issue to people (in my opinion). Yet last time I came here I was made so uncomfortable by an Employee of the store asking me why I would put tattoos all over my body and proceeded to stare at me during my whole dining experience. Really? At a location practically on college campus in a progressive place like Tempe? I would expect it from the public, but from someone who is supposed to be on the clock working and serving customers...? Needless to say i did not get to finish my burrito because it made me uncomfortable getting gawked at from across the dining room and I feel like if I say something it would be completely misconstrued. So i quietly tossed my plate and waited outside in the heat for the rest of my party to finish so i didn't have to sit enduring stares. Don't get me wrong, I could care less what people think of the way I look but when I'm trying to enjoy a meal with friends and it even affecting their experience then it crosses a line. Go check out Qdoba or Chipotle."}
{"text":"really great food. When I am craving mexican food, this is one of my favorite places to eat at. Food is delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I ordered take-out for lunch. We ordered tacos and enchiladas. Her shrimp taco tasted like cheap frozen shrimp that you can buy at the store and hear in the oven. My steak taco looked like it had been sitting out for 3 hours (and it only had romaine lettuce on it--no other toppings). The green chile enchilada sauce, rice and beans was disgusting! It tasted like it was doused in sugar! We didn't even finish the food, it was so gross! Should've gone to Filiberto's......"}
{"text":"This place gets busy but only because it's so good! I tried this place for the first time and fell in love. They hand make the tortillas right in front of you and you can customize your burrito. The sweet pork is my favorite! You can smother your burrito in sauce and queso cheese! Also, they offer unlimited refills of horchata which is surprising and it's really good! I definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Tried several items during two visits last week with mostly good results, but as I know, the second visit is never as good as the first time. The chicken burrito which is assembled before your eyes was right on target on visit 1 with the grilled chicken cooked up nice on the grill and no fatty pieces either. It was simple with rice, beans,meat and cheese and guac was extra of course if needed. They douse the top of the burrito in more sauce of your choice and it was a great lunch at 8 bucks. The next day was taco Tuesday and although the prices for tacos are great at $1.75 each, the tacos are not as well made as the burro's. First off, a fatty piece of chicken was discovered and each taco contained a very wet mixture of lettuce, pico and sour cream resulting in a huge build up a taco juice at the bottom of the tortilla holding the items. You literally had to drain the tacos before eating, so unless you just get meat in your taco, skip these and the shredded beef did not seem the best quality either. I did use the receipt for a free chips and salsa, so that helped, but the first time was the charm here at this giant chain that only has three AZ locations."}
{"text":"I think my dog food would be better. 12$ for a disgusting burrito is a little much. Service was fine but dang get your act together when charging that much. Meat was cold, rice was under cooked, and the beans were like soup. Good luck guys."}
{"text":"My only complaint is that they are closed on Sunday. The customer service is excellent and even though they're always busy they manage to keep the line going quickly. The food is always excellent and made correctly."}
{"text":"During lunch, be prepared to wait in line for at least 10min. You order your food as they prepare it ....kind of like Subway.  I ordered the \"carne asada\" taco but I didn't really like the taste of the meat...it tasted really gamey.  I usually get their Friday special for  $4 -  it comes with a cheese enchilada, beans & rice. It's pretty good for the price but again, be prepared to wait in line."}
{"text":"Omg the extra enchiladas are fabulous, at least I think that's what they're called. They put extra stuff over the outside and the inside, the meats are a good selection, nice flavour and taste great. They've got loads of different salsa & veggies to try but not being a bread/tortilla/gluten fan I have to say I'm addicted to their enchilada & borrito wraps. The servings are huge, it's our favourite take out. We've never eaten in but this place is always clean and buzzing with people. I love that they can make it really spicy for me too.

Please never leave, we love you!!"}
{"text":"I love Costa Vida. Their salads are delicious, it must be the fresh tortillas that are layered on the bottom.Customer service is great and the food is consistently good. My only issue with this restaurant is when you are nickel and dimed for things like sour cream, extra dressing, etc...I'm not a fan of that. But the pros outweigh the cons and I will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Finally. A great mexican place.  Drink the Horchata! Delicious 

Enchiladas smother in salsa and cheese are a must!  Disfrutalo!  O algo asi !  ;)"}
{"text":"I'm addicted!
Drink the Horchata. Delicioso!  Que rico!  Ay ay ay! ;)


Enchiladas. Salsa verde. Chicken. Chesse. 
Mexican heaven !! ;)"}
{"text":"The food was alright. I would rather go to Cafe Rio. They don't even have fresh brewed iced tea! Their chips, salsa and queso were pretty good."}
{"text":"We were out playing Pokemon Go one night and saw this place, thought we give it a try next time we're in the area. 

The first thing we noticed when we walked in were the lack of misters for the outside sitting area. The inside wasn't much better. They looked like they had been in the middle of remodeling the place. There were uneven tiles on the floor, some even missing. The tile missing at the drink fountain area could cause someone to twist their ankle or worse, all they had over it was a non slip carpet for wet floors. 

We did ask our self if we still wanted to eat here, and sadly we did. 

The food was meh. I've had better tasting food from a microwave burrito. I had the grilled chicken, and my wife had the grilled steak, both with pinto beans  and smothered, mine I added the grilled veggies for extra filler.

The temperature of the food was the same as the restaurant, it felt as if the only reason it was even that warm was because they put it through a small oven to melt the cheese on top of the burrito. The food was far from filling. I ended up eating my burrito and half of my wife's because she wouldn't eat the more or less cold food, and was still left wanting more and I'm a small guy.

The restaurant was not well maintained at all. They had what felt like no AC, yes it was cooler then the 112 it was outside, but its not much better inside. The tables when we came in were mostly dirty with only 3 others in the place when we got there. 30 mins after we got there someone finally came out and cleaned 3 tables and left again, they didn't even bother doing the rest.

I would say this place looks nice on the outside, but leave it there. Go to Chipotle not half a mile on the other side of the shopping area. There you can at least get hot food, and have AC.

EDIT: I looked through the pictures to see what everyone else had for their burritos and I've noticed that everyone has a side with theirs... The person serving us didn't say we wouldn't have any kind of side or even ask if we wanted anything, so what's the deal? It really doesn't seem right to spend $10 on a burrito like this without a side."}
{"text":"Love Costa Vida!! Great food, Good portion sizes without breaking the bank!! love the sweet pork the best. I love that I can drive thru as well. They always have great deals in the app too!!! 
Great job guys !!"}
{"text":"Nice place with a clean and refreshing look. The food is definitely not authentic Mexican nor Mexican style, it's sweet meats enclosed in tortillas, quite awful really. Nice looking eatery, good service, bad food. 2 Stars."}
{"text":"Barely giving 3 stars for a very simple reason that after 4 attempts of trying to order a plain bean and cheese burrito you finally understood what that meant after the 4th time. All we would ask for was bean and cheese but that task proved too difficult because you continued to add rice or Lettuce or something else in the burrito when all we ever wanted was Beans and Cheese! Has to be the easiest order ever yet you can't ever manage to get that straight! Otherwise the food is decent and the burrito was great once you finally got it right and I could finally enjoy it."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I've loved Costa Vida for years. I crave it constantly and my favorite item to order is the steak salad. I've been to a few different locations and the food has always been consistent. Last night I stopped in at this location and was incredibly disappointed. The steak in the salad was so overcooked, dry, and over salted that it tasted almost like an awful jerky...or maybe petrified wood. The lettuce was also limp and didn't taste fresh. I took a few bites and deemed it inedible. What a shame!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Wonderful customer service. It annoyse so much when people complain about a restaurant in CALGARY not being 'authentic'. Lol seriously go to Mexico if thats your issue. 
But love the food here. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places around Gilbert!

I try not to go here when I'm dieting, unless I want a splurge meal... You can get salads that are very low calorie but they won't taste nearly as good as anything with the (decently high calorie) delicious sweet pork! Honestly, I think that going here and not getting the pork is a waste because it's the brightest highlight of this restaurant chain. I typically get the sweet pork burrito, which last I checked is their most popular entree. Get it smothered with cheese and the medium sauce and it becomes a dish to die for! 

If burritos aren't your thing, the nachos are also amazing! The chips themselves are just sub par but once they're smothered in meat, queso, and pico they get much better.

The sister company to Costa Vida, Cafe Rio, is different in very few ways. Basically the differences lie in the ambiance and feel of the restaurant (Costa is more beach-like in vibe, while Rio is more Mexican-feeling) and that the pork is significantly sweeter at Costa than it is at Rio. For me, there's no competition and I much prefer Costa Vida - though I've heard that you end up loyal to whichever one you visit first."}
{"text":"I hate that I even have to give 1 star. I kept hearing how great this place was from a friend and the reviews were good. Since I was nearby I decided to check it out. Never again. I got one of the lunch specials which was a chicken enchilada, rice and beans. Lets start off with the enchilada....I asked for green sauce (chili). I don't know what that was but it definitely wasn't green chili. The cilantro lime rice?  Tasted like dried up white rice with some color added to it. You get a choice of black beans or pinto beans. I went with the pinto. Another...I don't know what was IN the beans but it was disgusting. My food was cold as well.  Anyone that knows me knows that I never throw food out. However, today I did just that. I wasn't able to even eat it!  I ended up throwing it away and I don't remember the last time I did that. I was so disgusted that I would not be able to even give it a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"I really did expect a little bit more out of this place after reading some of the reviews. My experience her wasn't bad but just avrege. ithink that my favorit thing about this place was there salsa. they had many diferent kinds but i injoyed them all."}
{"text":"I do like this place because I feel like the portions are enough and yummy and make me feel like I ate pretty light but still full.

However, there are plenty of competitive Mexican restaurants around who have way better prices and are more authentic(taste wise). Also they could make their green salsa way hotter! It's pretty sweet and they only offer student discounts for the daily special

Costa vida is good and everything is always hot when you get it but they seriously need to lower there prices compared to other great Mexican places."}
{"text":"I will never cheat on Chipotle again. They tax you for everything. I paid and extra 2 bucks for fajitas. Guacamole was cool  but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My BF and I got a Groupon for this place so make sure to check for one before you go! 

The servers where incredibly nice/knowledgable and the prices where fair (you get $1 off for veggie options). I got a vegetarian burrito and my BF got the day's special, a sweet pork burrito. We also got a regular sized (which really is a large) guac chips, reg sized queso chips, a soda and a cookie because we had to use up the entire value of our coupon at once. Everything is put on super sturdy metal dished so it's great for takeout! 

The dips for the chips where massive! I love guac, so for me that was heaven. They have one of those cool soda mashies where you can create any type of drink you want so we had the decaf-diet-orange-Coke. 

Only cons where that my whole wheat wrap was strangely sweet and that there where no truly spicy sauces. This place is great for what it is, a fast food joint. However, it's not a genuine Mexican place (not that we expected it to be) of which there are many in Tempe."}
{"text":"This review is for Costa Vida. No idea why it is listed simply as Royal Oak as that is not what was originally entered for this new business.

I have seen huge line ups here on the long weekend and wondered what all the fuss was about! Well, it is a new NW Restaurant (whoohoo!) and it is Mexican!
It boasts itself as a 'Fresh Mexican Grill'.
Is it like Mucho Burrito? Yep! Just with more seating. And not as friendly.
Came in at 3pm on a weekday. Not busy. Staff were just kind of standing around which is not acceptable really as I could see as I went along here so many things my staff would be doing if this were my place. IE almost no forks in the self serve area, the bin for cilantro for topping selections was out which bummed me out as I love it! The tables needed to be wiped down, floors, that kind of thing. 
There are daily specials which I liked and so I got the Tues special - 2 sweet pork enchiladas. Extra of course for guac but for sour cream too? C'mon!!!! Gouge!
There are the usual tacos, salads, enchiladas and a whole bunch of sides. I was disappointed that there were no specialty drinks at all, only pop to choose from.
The hottest enchilada sauce (red) is NOT at all hot but there is Tobasco right around the corner to help yourself to.
The only thing served warm on my plate were the black beans, unfortunately. And they needed seasoning.
You can tell they try to cut costs as they are stingy with absolutely everything they put on the plate. I asked for a wedge of lime and staff had to ask someone else there behind the counter if I could have one!? 
My meal with drink was $9. Check out the Specials to save cash for sure. The guy ahead of me ordered a nice looking salad which I would consider for next time. This time, I went for my fave Mexican dish though. It was just ok, nothing special about it but I did like the whole wheat tortilla option.
I would not make a special trip here if you live across town or if there is a huge line I would say skip it.
Mucho Burrito has warmer food that will fill you up more for the same price and the ingredients are just as fresh. And their sour cream is included there."}
{"text":"Delicious and a much more friendly staff than the competitors!  I always get to the front of the line and cannot decide what I want. The salads are delicious, I usually go with the steak or sweet pork. The burritos are very good as well. I recently tried the smothered sweet pork and it was life changing."}
{"text":"Costa Vida is amazing!  My friends and I always compare Costa Vida to Cafe Rio, and I think Costa Vida is way better because it is a lot more fresh.  Their sweet pork is to die for and this location is the best one that I've been to."}
{"text":"My favorite place!  Sweet pork burrito with mango salsa in the middle and medium on top smothered with cheese!"}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous wait for absolutely mediocre food I have no idea why anybody would wait in line as long as he do for this place with so many other great food choices in the local area I suggest staying away from here"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Sweet pork burrito is where it's at though. This is certainly not true Mexican food, it's very Americanized so as long as you go into it with that understanding, you won't be disappointed! There is usually a very long line around dinner time, especially on the weekends. I just wish they were open on Sundays, we've gone multiple time forgetting they are closed. But definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"I like this location a lot better than the one in Mesa. I don't drink, but I should be noted that this location serves alcohol, whereas the Mesa one does not."}
{"text":"I'm seriously obsessed with this place. My husband and I go every Monday because it is sooo delicious. The sweet pork is to die for! Absolutely recommend. Just avoid around dinner time because the line never ends!"}
{"text":"The carne asada is tender and flavorful. Burritos and quesadillas are huge. Some of their meat and sauces are very sweet, which is not our preference so it took a couple visits to figure out which meats we liked. For me, the pork and chicken is just too sweet, as is their green sauce. 

They grill the burrito/taco after putting the toppings inside. We do not prefer this so we have to catch them quickly enough to ensure this doesn't happen. Their cheese is always on the bottom of the taco/burrito and melted (unless you catch them before they grill the meat. 

Overall, it's decent very Americanized Mexican food. We don't crave it but it is convenient. If you use their app you can get rewards. If you fill out a questionnaire about the service you'll receive free chips and salsa on your next visit."}
{"text":"I've loved going to the QC Costa Vida for years and was STOKED when this location went in AND had a  drive thru!  Unfortunately, each of my several visits here have missed the mark in some way or other. After last night's unbelievably bad grilled chicken enchiladas and undercooked rice, I think I'm officially done.   There are enough similar places around to get our taco fix."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here a few times and always enjoyed it! Pretty cheap for the amount of food that you get. Service has always been good too!"}
{"text":"sweet pork burritio smothered. 'nuff said!"}
{"text":"I had a beef burrito and my wife had chicken enchilada. We both got sick from this fast food mexican joint. Food wasn't that tasty either. I thought it was really funny theres a big sign near the cash register saying tortillas are made on the spot when you see the workers take the wheat wraps out of a plastic bag and throw it on a hot plate."}
{"text":"Very poor customer  service and the food was not at all what we we're expecting. Lacks management, unorganized and workers need more training. The lines are very long and do not move quickly at all."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this more stars but I've been 4-5 times now and every time it takes FOREVER to get through the line.  They had just 10 people in line (half full) tonight and it took me 30 minutes to get three pork tacos. 30 minutes when not even busy?!? 

I stopped here as it was closer than Cafe Rio to my house but would of saved a solid ten minutes by driving the 3 extra miles to Gilbert road and going to Cafe Rio over there. 

Inefficiently ran, so if you go call ahead as they get those done in less than 10 minutes 

Food is mediocre and the meat isn't as succulent as Cafe Rio so I won't becoming here again."}
{"text":"Lazy employees
I was in drive through line and pulled up to order speaker at 8:58.  There was a car in front of me.
No one asked me for my order.  At 9:05 I backed out and left.  Definitely poor quality of employees"}
{"text":"It's very close to ASU's Tempe campus so it's a convenient choice for students. They usually have discounts in those ASU student insider coupon books. I love their Taco Tuesday Chicken Tacos and their Sweet Pork Burritos. The quality of food is consistent and the service is always great!"}
{"text":"Depending on how much you like this place, you could describe it as either a rip-off of or an improvement to the Chipotle model of dishing out sort-of Mexican food. Personally, I think it's a wash: Costa Vida does a few things better and a few things worse.

At Costa Vida, you have the option of ordering hard tacos, a burrito, a bowl, or nachos. Once you've decided the basic configuration, the real fun begins. You pick one of four meats, one of two different beans, one or more of the numerous salsas, and whatever you want of the standard toppings. They really pile things on here, which is a definite plus, and that makes the food here a pretty good deal. On the other hand, not all the options are wonderful. The tacos are noticeably smaller portions than the other options and the chips in the nachos often turn to mush under the wetter toppings. Of the salsas, several are tasty, but none of them appropriately spicy. But, that may actually appeal to you.

I think what's going to make it or break it for you with Costa Vida is how well you like the much lauded sweet pork. Everything else at Costa Vida is pretty unadventurous and safe; the sweet pork is really what sets this place apart. Basically, it's slow cooked pork, shredded up in a very sweet reduction that I would bet money is made out of a cola. The meat is very tender, but I found the sauce to be rather cloying, almost syrupy. I've heard it described as being like a dessert, and I don't think that is very far off. Some people love it, but I couldn't do it. It was just too sweet and an odd complement to the cheese, sour cream, lettuce, tomato, etc. To me, it the sweet pork seems like a better fit for a Southern restaurant. 

If it sounds like you may like this sweet pork, give the place a shot. There is often a big line to get food, but this is an efficiency kitchen and they handle rushes with aplomb. I found the dining area awfully loud and uncomfortably packed, but the seating outside alleviates most of that. Still, it's a little hectic for me, especially since I'm not impressed by the food. Get it to go or sit outside, that's my advice."}
{"text":"Honestly the first time going here I did not have a good experience. I don't like sweet pork on a Mexican burrito. They recommended the sweet pork so I tried it and it is not what I expected. Coming from a Spanish background I really love my burritos to be spicy. And even after I put all the hot sauce I could on it it didn't come back. I don't know if I would go here again."}
{"text":"Bland food as can be. $4 for an a taco. You will get a better taco at Del Taco for 1/3rd the price."}
{"text":"First time here today and it was alright. I got the sweet pork burrito (~$7 or $8), and if you'd like to try it too, my suggestion: come on a Monday because it's the daily special  ($5), you'll be able to save a couple bucks.

My burrito maker suggested the green salsa with the burrito, but to be honest, I didn't taste anything except the juicy pulled pork. It was pretty good, but too sweet for my taste. FYI: I'm definitely not a sweets person, I love salty and spicy food.

The burrito is very large, and it comes with rice, beans, choice of meat, choice of salsa, and cheese, and for $1 extra - you can get the enchilada which has extra salsa and cheese melted on top of the burrito. You can also get fresh pico de gallo-like salsa and lettuce on the side for free.

I actually prefer Chipotle over Costa Vida. The burritos at Costa Vida appear larger, but content wise, I think overall is comparable. I love Chipotle's corn salsa mix, and the steak is delicious. I study a fair amount at Barnes & Noble and Paradise Bakery in Dana Park, so maybe next time I'll try the steak burrito at Costa Vida."}
{"text":"Huge portions, clean shop, fresh ingredients, fast delivery, busy at lunch would go back

Order hot sauce (it is not very hot) and be prepared to saw through the fresh tortilla with a knife, too big to pick up by hand"}
{"text":"Quick little tip: Their new honey habernero salsa is da bomb!!! Spicy but sweet, loves it!!!"}
{"text":"I pre-ordered a chicken quesadilla on the way to work a few days ago. I loved the convenience of ordering ahead, and thought it was delicious with lots of cheese and grilled chicken (the rice and beans - meh.) However, I was really disappointed to find that it didn't include salsa and sour cream, standard quesadilla condiments. You have to pay an additional 0.79 cents each for a very small portion. Please tell me this was a mistake."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and was very impressed. I got the grilled chicken salad and it was delish. The guy helping me decide what to get was very nice. Definitely a good spot for some baja style Mexican food!"}
{"text":"The servers behind the counter are rude and move too fast for a first timer! Everything seemed drenched in sauce and I hated that the iced tea was only available behind the counter and I couldn't fill/refill myself. I liked the quick melt oven similar to Quiznos but I wouldn't recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Super excited when this place opened. My coworker loves Mexican food and highly recommend it.

First impressions the restaurant big with lots of seating and ample parking outside. The service was a bit slow but very friendly staff. Ordering was easy and the food was made via conveyor belt style.

We ordered the enchiladas and the tacos. The enchiladas are super cheesy and smothered in sauce. The mild sauce isn't spicy at all but good flavour. The tacos we got the sweet & savoury pork with black beans and rice. The black beans were nice and out favourite of the two options (refried and pinto). The server gave us three free samples of sauce for our tacos too! The only down side was when we were ordering; behind the counter the trays of food looked dirty and empty. They were scraping for the last bits to fill our order. This place is new and quite busy."}
{"text":"Worst \"Mexican\" Food Ever!. Very bland (no taste) and Way too Expensive. Was my first and last time to go. Will never recommend to anyone its very disappointing. I wouldn't be surprised if the place shuts down."}
{"text":"2 stars are only for the kindness of the staff .  As for the food it is mediocre at best .  Reminiscent of high school cafeteria food or maybe a corporate lunch room .   Most of the food and sauce is sugary and lacking authentic flavor .  The rice was undercooked and crunchy and lacked any flavor .  The green sauce and red enchilada sauce both seemed like they were straight from the can ( the cheap can ) and really didn't have any solid flavor .  The chicken was overcooked but decently seasoned but not anything exciting .   I wanted this place to be good but it just doesn't stand up .  We have gone a few times to give it a chance but both times was the same thing .  Best to go to Cafe Rio ( in the same shipping center ) it is much better and authentic or even better hit up Someburros( our favorite around here )"}
{"text":"Easily becoming our favorite work lunch spot! The menu is simple, but each choice is equally delicious. My fave is the Raspberry Chipotle Chicken Nachos. Each item is custom made to order, and the toppings are always fresh. The tables & restrooms are always clean, and the staff is super friendly. It's popular for a reason, so don't be surprised if there is a line. But the staff moves quickly & you'll be enjoying your meal before you even notice the wait in line!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I ever had so far. Taco Tuesdays are the best day, and staff super friendly and helpful. They gave me 4 samples of the sauces so I can choose"}
{"text":"Costa Vida is a fast casual Mexican restaurant similar to Mucho Burrito with a menu featuring burritos, enchiladas, tacos and quesadillas. 

On my first visit to this location, I tried the sweet pork burrito. In addition to the chosen meat, the burrito came stuffed with seasoned rice, beans, hot sauce and cheese. After a quick grill press, the burrito was served alongside a brief salad of lettuce and salsa. 

I enjoyed the warm stretchy tortilla but found the meat and sauce lacking in heat, despite opting for the hot sauce (over medium and mild). 

Living close by, I do plan on visiting, especially since they have an in-app ordering option."}
{"text":"So this new place appears near my primary Costco.  Time to check it out.

Basically this is like Cafe Rio. Decent flavors, nothing unique.  Portion size is adequate.  The \"sweet pork\" is perhaps too sweet. Fewer drink choices, but the horchata is OK.

Really nothing very compelling here.  Not bad, but I wouldn't make a point of coming.  Not much more to say about this place."}
{"text":"Craving something different give this place a try. This is fast food that does not come out of the fryer. The four stars is for a fast food comparison. You can get your burrito or taco any way you choose. Give the horchata try."}
{"text":"I went last week and loved the environment and food. I really enjoyed the pork burrito enchilada style. It had a good balance of flavor and the size was just right. My wife loved her small chicken salad. We all definitely be back."}
{"text":"Their enchiladas are so good, quite authentic Mexican. I always get the enchiladas with two sauces, mild and not spicy (the green sauce). Food is fresh and I've gone there three times in a row before. My bf always gets the burrito, he likes that too. So glad I can have good Mexican in the south."}
{"text":"The chicken tacos were great and the homemade tortillas they make right in front of you, and the way they grill the tortilla with your food is awesome.  I asked for the raspberry chipotle sauce, which goes on your taco's, burrito's, etc.,  on the side rather than have them put it on my tacos for me.  I think its the best way to go, as the chicken was good by itself.  This way you can add as much or as little of the raspberry chipotle or mango sauce to your food as you want.  I put a small amount on my rice and beans and ate the tacos as is, with sour cream.  I actually meant to order a burrito but I said tacos.  When I got to the cashier I asked her if she could put beans on my tacos, because I really like the beans and rice in burritos.  She added a small amount of beans to each taco and then asked me if I wanted beans and rice on the side and I took her up on the offer.  The place was packed and very clean.  I like the atmosphere and decor over Chipotle.  There seems to be a lot of places like Chipotle doing it better these days.   I really enjoyed my food and would order the same items the same way again, although on my next visit I will give the burrito a try.  Again, the food is good and the tortilla is awesome."}
{"text":"Eat here if you like beetles in your chicken tortilla soup.  

We went here at 6 pm Saturday, June 27, 2015.  My husband ordered a kid's meal for our daughter and two chicken tortilla soups for ourselves. We were then told the soup had to \"heat up\". After nearly 10 minutes of waiting while my daughter's meal was getting cold, the young food preper/server ladled the soups up.  When my husband brought them back to our table we immediately saw a smaller-sized beetle floating on the top of one of the soups!  Needles to say, we were grossed out.

My husband immediately took the two soups back to the cashier to return them.  The cashier took the soup with the beetle away and showed it to a man on the prep line.  He was dressed in a black uniform, and a bushy black beard and was wearing earrings.  The cashier then came back and told my husband they would get him another soup ( from the same pot in which the beetle was served).  My husband said he just wanted a refund.  The cashier was refunding the cost of one soup, when my husband said he didn't want either soup because the whole soup pot clearly was contaminated with a bug in it.  The cashier then took the refunded cash from the cash register and dropped it into my husband's hand. 

My husband looked at her and said, \"what, no apology for the bug, nothing?\"  The cashier simply said, \"well, my manager said it was just a piece of burnt tortilla.\"  My husband said it was clearly a bug because a burnt tortilla chip doesn't have legs and a head.  The cashier then shrugged her shoulders and took the next customer's order.  

We went to sit down, expecting the \"manager\" to come over and apologize for the bug, but no one came.  As we waited, we watched the same preper/server who had just served our soup cleaning out the garbages. That's when we left. Our appetite lost.  

We will never eat here again and have begun telling our friends and family of our horrible experience at Costa Vida."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Well, other than they are always super busy and the wait can be long sometimes, but that's just because everyone loves their food soo much. My husband loves their burros and I always get their sweet pork salad. De-lic-ious! Totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Sweet pork with the red enchilada sauce, you'll thank me later. Shredded beef is great too, but gives you some serious gas. Totes worth it. 

Go during lunch hours or taco Tuesday and the place is busy. Other than that not much of a wait time. Worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Food is good although they are always trying to rush me through and keep trying to wrap up my burrito before I'm done adding stuff.  It's like they don't want me to see everything I can add to my burrito. Also last time I put lettuce in my burrito so they would not give me any on the side ... Wtf ? 

I would strongly advise them on getting a salsa bar, that would be a deal breaker for me. I will not be returning unless it's heavily discounted or they add a salsa bar. 

Over all food is decent although every time I go there somehow they piss me off which is rare for a restaurant to do."}
{"text":"Mmmm...That sweet pork doe! I really enjoyed this place. Come with a big appetite and wallet. Two burritos and one drink was 21$! Its a beautiful 79° and they didnt have their outside table set up for sitting. Smh overall the food speaks for itself. You need to try peeps but if you cant afford, Chipotle will do just fine."}
{"text":"Service was good but taste was just okay. Chile is lacking in heat and flavor. 

Not a single vegetarian option on the menu. I always feel ripped off when I have to pay for the meat although I don't eat it. Lots of options out there Costa Visa--keep trying."}
{"text":"You run out of sweet pork Beef and the tres leche every fetching night!! Y'all suck! Why can't you make a consistent amount of what people want. Worthless, another lost customer to cafe rio."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend on a week day during lunch time.  I was excited to try something that had a vibe similar to Chipotle.  I was so excited they had a decent gluten free menu and it was all spelled out.  Well, it seems their staff aren't aware or not willing to accommodate.  They stated they couldn't make tacos for me because they would have to put them on the same flat wheel that they use for the flour tortillas to warm them.  I looked shocked and thought...Well, put them on tinfoil and then put them on the warmer but no.  They told me the ONLY thing I could have was a salad.  Well, that's exciting - or rather isn't.  The food was okay but truthfully I felt it was a little bland.  I will admit that I like the kick Chipotle has.  I thought the guacamole was okay but did enjoy the salsa.  I felt the prices were a bit high especially for a quickie lunch.  My friend who was with me, loved their food but I just found it mediocre.  Granted, I am limited as to what I can eat due to the gluten free needs but gluten free shouldn't mean boring and incredibly limited especially when your website indicates otherwise."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for lunch and it was sooooo good. I didn't even know this place was here, it's hidden by all the other buildings around it but I'm super glad my friend introduced me to this place. Will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Its not authentic.  But it tastes like food!    I arrived and they were out of rice.  It turned into a 30 minute wait for rice and steak to be cooked.  Which I gather would be a peak experience for this place in terms of FRESH.   It was a sopping mess as enchilada ahould be.  Everything was premade and besides steak and I believe chicken. ..it is not xooked on premesis or by any employee or i dare say even in this country...  The price is expensive,  just as expensive as other Mexican places in calgary...but they are authentic...this place is not.  I almost died from tacotime so I have sworn off the massive chain taco places as death pits...this is a \"no other choice\"  mexican place for me.  Ill go to los chilitos or el barrito before I g3t desperate enough to come back here.  15$  for two enchiladas or 1 burrito or a salaf or nachos of bland mexican compared to 4 of the most amazing mini tacos made by old mexican grannies...cant compare."}
{"text":"Wow! I ordered online and went to pick up my order about 10 minutes later. I passed a girl sweeping the floor as I made my way to the cashier to get my order. She was with another guest, and I waited there for her to finish. The girl from the lobby came up next to me and asked if I needed anything. (She stopped what she was doing to come check on me!) I told her I had an online order, and she said she'd check if it was ready. It wasn't yet, and I told her that was fine. She offered me a soda for free while I was waiting. Um, sure! She didn't need to compensate me for being too early to pick up my order, but it was really nice of her! As Always, the food was amazing; my salad lasted the 15 minute drive I had before I could eat it, and it was still like new. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is so-so, but the service was awful. The employees were incredibly difficult to hear and it was the most inefficient line service I've ever seen. 11:45 on a Thursday, during lunch rush, only two of six employees were really doing anything. Stood in line for 30 minutes, maybe 10 other customers were in front of me. A line of similar length at Chipotle would have taken 10 minutes, tops."}
{"text":"Costa Vida is #1 seed when it comes to burritos. The steak burrito smothered is unbeatable. The place takes a dump on Cafe Rio. The staff is always friendly. The cinnamon tortillas are the best and even though I always feel weird for ordering them cause I think they are for children, but I don't care.  The salads are awesome also. Everything I have had here has been good. The salsas are not salty like Cafe Rio. Everything is fresh, especially the tortillas. If you like a good burrito and have not tried Costa Vida, I don't know what you are doing with your life. Get with it, damn."}
{"text":"it was good, but a little expensive.."}
{"text":"After living a couple blocks from Dana Park for almost 2 years, I finally found myself here. I really enjoy Cafe Rio so I was expecting something similar. I got a small chicken salad with the black beans and it was good, the dressing was good, everything was good. The restaurant was hot, the cashier even made a comment about it, and that's really the only negative. It wasn't the best meal I've had but I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Our experience was disappointing from the get-go. The inside acoustics were terrible and you couldn't have a comfortable conversation due to the noise level. We ordered our food, which took about twice as long as Chipotle, even though it seemed this restaurant is trying to duplicate the model. The biggest problem was that we presented the Entertainment coupon for BOGO for lunch or dinner item. It was 12:15 so we assumed that qualified. Never before have we had a coupon with teeny-tiny writing specify it was valid from 2pm-5pm and after 8 pm. Why even bother creating such a coupon?? It will only upset people and make them feel tricked on their first visit, like it did us. The food was bland and didn't merit a second visit. The tortilla was too doughy and then got soggy from the juice of the pico de gallo salsa. Even if the food was awesome, we would not be back, due to the ill-intended coupon. Chipotle is a much better bet with consistently great food and service for a much better price."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Cheaper than Cafe Rio and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Just a few words. Steak Salad with the Tomatillo Ranch. I believe that's what they call the ranch but either way, just tell them that you want the ranch. They put one of their homemade tortillas on the bottom and serve the freshest ingredients on top. They have a small and large option depending on how hungry you are and the small one is pretty filling! I would recommend the sweet pork I believe it's called. That's better for the burritos or enchiladas and not so much on the salad. You'll thank me if you take yourself here sooner than later. I feel like it is underrated!"}
{"text":"Best location hands down! Makes the best shrimp taco with mango salsa!!! Must remember to request the lime. No lettuce ever, as it robs all the flavor from the shrimp and mango salsa.  It's difficult to not eat this 3-4 times per week...mango salsa is rather ADDICTING and better than any mango salsa I have tried anywhere!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly kid named Phil made my burrito. He was super cheerful and made the best damn burrito I've ever had"}
{"text":"The review is based on the food, not the staff. The staff deserve 5 stars for friendliness and understanding. I was impressed with the workers and the cleanliness of the restaurant. The food itself, however, was good in the moment but immediately afterwards my stomach was upset and felt like it was on fire. I went to bed thinking I just needs to sleep it off, but the next day my stomach continued to hurt. I used to work in food industry and am not a fan of Sysco and I could taste that their food was from Sysco. It did not taste fresh at all. I would not recommend this place to anyone nor will I return."}
{"text":"Great specials, fresh food. Definitely one of my new favorite lunch spots! Love the sweet pork!"}
{"text":"Place has some dank eats, and I go back whenever I can because of the student discount.  A friend brought me there around January and I've been back like 10 times since, even bringing my gf and my other boy, who both really like it as well.  You get a lot of food, it tastes better than Chipotle, and the environment is pretty chill.  I can always find a spot to sit to watch baseball or whatever.  Every now and then they leave the chili verde out too long and it gets too thick, or tastes too salty, but otherwise I've never had a problem with the place.  They don't try to skimp you on the food either, like Cafe Rio does, and it doesn't make your stomach feel crappy like Chipotle does."}
{"text":"So...... It was another Saturday, me and my wife driving around, what to eat for dinner. I didn't know and she didn't know. Then I remembered that a new place opened and what the heck, lets try it. We walked in late afternoon, no crowd, nice, and it looks like a chipotle, and I was, ugh, not a fan of Chipotle. Well we are here, I will play it safe and order a shredded beef quesadilla on a fresh, homemade flour tortilla. My wife had this monster smothered burrito, with sweet pork, refried beans, a green sauce and some fresh guacamole. I thought that sweet pork would be weird, but OMG, its great!!!! My quesadilla was great as well, the meats were very tender, and such a nice change from the usual. We ate there, and then the people started coming in. Looks like a popular place. The food is so fresh, hot and just great! The staff was very friendly and helpful. I give this place a big \"WOO HOO!!!\""}
{"text":"This review is not on the food but rather the lack of customer sevice I experienced thru the drive thru.  I was pretty excited to finally give this place a try since I had heard great things about their food. Anyway, while I was ordering 7 tacos, I was quickly interrupted and told I was only ALLOWED to order 6 tacos at a time in the drive thru.  I immediately asked why and she said that its company policy and the policy states that only 6 tacos may be ordered at a time. She continued to say that the line tends to get backed up because of big orders. Mind you I was the only car in the entire drive thru. Since when has a restaurant refused to serve \"to big\" of an order?  Goodluck ordering tacos here. ha!"}
{"text":"Me and the wife went there for the 1st time tonight, we got a coupon in the mail so we thought to try it out what the hell. Ehh it wasn't bad, Not mind blowing. I tried the sweet pork burrito and I probably wouldn't get it again. Nothing wrong with it. It was just a little too sweet for my liking. Also my burrito was a bit cold when I got home and we only live 3 mins from here, I wish my food was a bit warmer. On a positive note I would definitely go back there again and give it another shot. Food portions are HUGE. Price is reasonable. Good drink variety."}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of Costa Vida when it first opened and I hadn't been back for some time until recently.  Perhaps they hadn't got into the groove of things because when I returned it was quite tasty.  

I'm a big fan of the enchiladas (for the hungry days) and the smothered burritos (for the not as hungry days).  The medium sauce seems to have a bit more kick to it than the hot for some reason (and it's not exactly hot by any authentic measure but at least they have shelf of hot sauces)

Calgary doesn't have really good Mexican food that i've found but this is pretty all right and good based on a Calgary standard. 

Some cool things:

You can order from their app or online and pick up your order (I haven't tried this or seen anyone do it),   they have loyalty points and you can get a free chips and salsa with every completed survey from your receipt.  

All and all it's a pretty good place that's quick and reasonable.   (Just don't eat the Queso because it's SWEET and that's just wrong... )"}
{"text":"The place has real potential but just didn't really strike me like WOW. They are doing some things wrong-- mostly with the lack of flavor in the shredded beef, chicken, beans, and D- service. The price is probably 5-15% more than what seems standard or fair for this type of place. I wouldn't suggest coming here for a burrito/tacos. Go to chiptole, qdoba or baja fresh instead. Maybe even taco bell.. :(

The builds are skimpy and the service was not great. It was our first time and we told the two staff members such when we approached the empty line and they asked what we wanted. We took a minute to look over the menu and were asked 2x more if we were ready, as if they were saying \"hurry up\". To be clear, it was 2:30pm and there wasn't anyone in line after us and 5-6 people total in the restaurant. 

We ordered a chicken mango salsa salad and a beef burrito. 

I hate using the word \"bland\" as it appears on Yelp that almost anyone who can't describe why they didn't like food use the word \"bland\" to summarize the taste and its by far overused. But in this instance its the most fitting word to accurately describe the taste of the burrito. SUPER BLAND.

However, the salad was GREAT! It was actually really awesome and I would return for the salad again. I'll just have to hope that the service is a little friendlier and patient the next time : /"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far since it has opened. 
It is delicious, everything is prepared exactly how we ask. My husband is quite picky when it comes to onions and tomatoes and they haven't mixed anything up yet. 
The girl working the headset on the drive through is silly and makes it as if you are ordering from a friend, rather than some weirdo. 
She remembered me from my order, it was a little different, but that was cool!
Sometimes after working out, we will be coming here for our 'Mexican' food fix."}
{"text":"Just ate at Costa Vida in Gilbert.  Worst food I have eaten in some time.  The portions made up for the bad food.  They were very small and were not even considered enough for a meal by my 105 lb wife.  Why I say the portions were good because it simply meant I would not have to eat any more of what they call food.

The place was not crowded so the Cold food is unexplainable.  But it was so cold that I was going to take it back but after tasting it I just wanted to leave.  They have come up with some kind of sickening sweet BBQ type taste that is on everything.  You would think that poor portions of the main course would be hidden by a pile of beans and rice, but Oh no!  You would think the rice and beans were made of gold.  A small spoonful of each.  This place used to be good but just like every decent place.  They let it go to their head and start cutting back on portions and then the flavor goes and pretty quick they are serving crap like they are now.

WARNING: Go somewhere else for Mexican food because this cannot be classified as Mexican food in fact I dont know what you call it.  But when we got in the car my small skinney wife wanted to go somewhere to eat."}
{"text":"Sweet Pork salad, always. YUM."}
{"text":"After their re-modeling, everything is top notch! Located in the center of Dana Park, with AJ's supermarket to the right of it, this Costa Vida is a great place to stop by during a shopping! I have been going to the one in Tempe, but this new one is way much better in so many aspects. All their equipments and appliances are brand new, with brand new fountain drink machine and new booths, tables and chairs. It just feels a lot nicer when I qas dining there than at the one in Tempe, which is somehow old and lousy. Sweet pork is always the right choice and get Mayo sauce inside your burrito. I prefer veges and tamatoes on the side. I loved their food since highschool and I know I will be coming back again and again. Especially this one, whenever I make a trip to East Mesa, I am coming here aside all the good restaurants."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend getting the corn tortillas. My gent ordered his shredded beef tacos on the flour tortillas and said they were pretty good. I ordered the grilled chicken on corn and my first bite was bleck. They reminded me of frozen and thawed corn tortillas. They were a bit soggy, didn't seem heated and maybe even slightly stale based on the hard edges. My babe tells me I just have the worst luck. 

The rice was pretty good. I may get a bowl next time since I ended up dumping my second taco into the beans and rice and eating it bowl style anyhow. We went through the drive through, the lady on the speaker box was nice and re read our order to us. She re read it again once we got to the window. Everything was correct.

All in all for a quick bite, I suppose it wasn't too bad, for fast food. I was surprised they had no veggie options but hey, my expectations are a bit high, I have said this before."}
{"text":"Sweet pork is amazing. Hands down the best thing here. Their tomatillo ranch dressing is great on their salads. Make sure you get your burrito smothered with sauce! We love that this location offers student discounts too!"}
{"text":"Had a hard time deciding to pick just one meal on the menu. The employees were very friendly and raved about their personal favorite dishes. The atmosphere reminded me of chipotle but the food had much more variety/flavor."}
{"text":"This place is seriously AMAZING. I'm SO glad it opened up so close to ASU campus!
Everything is good. My favorites are the raspberry chipotle chicken tacos, sweet pork tacos/salad, or the mango chicken salad. Although I do love a good taco (and this place certainly has it!), I was surprised by just how much food is in the salad. If you're really hungry, get it! Haven't tried the other menu options yet... I want to try a burrito next. Anyways, I'm not sure you can go wrong with this place.
The main reason this place gets five stars, though, is the customer service. I've seen some mixed reviews about their customer service here, but honestly, I'm not sure if they're true. I was stuck in the restaurant during an intense thunderstorm one night, and I was freaking out because I not only had to ride my bike to my class, but I had my computer and was afraid that it would get soaked in the rain. The manager came out and personally seran-wrapped my entire computer and phone, and then gave me some plastic bags to put my purse and computer in to ensure they would be protected from the rain.
Needless to say, Costa Vida has a customer for life. Not every restaurant would do something like that."}
{"text":"Great innovative choices. Sweet pork is tasty, but a little too sweet for me. Mango chipotle chicken is good. Portions are HUGE! I am almost never able to finish the salad, enchilada, or burritos. Salad is good with the mango chicken without dressing. It doesn't need the dressing since the mango chicken sauce is so saucy already. Super cheap for taco tuesdays, but always big line. Despite the big line, they try to be pretty fast. Love that you can see them make the tortillas and food fresh."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place thinking it would be my new place when I got bored with Chipotle. The restaurant was nice, very clean and easy to get to in Dana Park. The customer service was good too, they were all pretty friendly. I tried the baja bowl with chicken and my son had the kids quesadilla. I wasn't sure which sauce to try, they had 3 so I tried 2 of them on the side and I didn't like either! My chicken was super dried out too. Fortunately my son wasn't too hungry because the quesadilla was SOOO tiny. The food wasn't awful but it definitely wasn't great, back to Chipotle we go!"}
{"text":"The sweet pork is delicious. Getting it \"smothered\" is worth the 99¢ but all inlittle pricing for what you get."}
{"text":"First time having this place. My son wanted Mexican and said this place good. It wasn't bad, but not great either. Not much flavor in the enchiladas and the rice was not cooked enough. 

He may like it, but I'll pass after this."}
{"text":"This is so good!!! Always go with my sister and friends. Today we went after my cousins hockey game with my grandma. Always extremely friendly staff. Too bad it's so far from where I live. I'd go everyday if i could haha. Way better than mucho burrito."}
{"text":"Love the tortillas! Favorite is the Chicken Salad."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmm. I would eat the sweet pork slathered on just about anything.

Except that."}
{"text":"This is a goto whenever I'm hungry and too lazy to cook, or when girlie is the same. 

The food is great, prices reasonable, efficient and friendly staff and an easy to access location. 

When she gets food and I'm not hungry, I get myself a Mexican beer from their offerings. The challenge is to finish it before they finish making her meal. I always win. They're quick, but not that quick."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place multiple times as they were building it. I finally tried it today for lunch. I was pleasantly surprised.

The menu was quite extensive with burritos nachos salads pretty much anything for anybody's tastebuds. Their menu also included lunch specials which I tried myself.

The food was fresh and delicious price was six dollars for a salad and a drink. Perfect place for Lunch or a quick dinner. Service was a little slow, I'm going to chalk that up to a brand-new restaurant opening.

Overall perfectly comfortable place for lunch and I will be back."}
{"text":"Love the sweet pork nachos."}
{"text":"This is one of hubs favourite places... he likes his tex mex. So when one opened up on 130th of course it was his first pick after a busy night of errands. The space is open, bright and clean. It's in the brand new spot on 130th along with some other new businesses. Decent amount of parking, although I can see that lot getting really busy on weekends. The staff were friendly, although a bit disorganized. We both got enchiladeas, sweet pork for me and beef for hubs. Overall the food was pretty decent, I do find it doesn't always look the most appetizing, I think it's the beans that throw it off but hubs went away happy so decent outing overall."}
{"text":"I frequently have trouble getting orders correct here. The food is good so I usually don't make a stink about it and eat what I get and don't throw a fit. This last time, I had enough. I ordered a cheese enchilada kids meal but they gave me a pork burrito kids meal, which I did not discover till I got home. I drove back and told them the problem. The cashier looked confused. I gave her the incorrect one and asked if they could make the cheese enchilada. A few minutes later, the shift leader came back to clarify what went wrong. I explained it all, again. I had a receipt in my car which I gave to her, not realizing this was from a prior visit. She pointed out that the date was from a week ago, looking at me suspiciously as though I were trying to pull a fast one. I was not asking for any free meals or compensation, I just wanted them to fix the order. It was a huge pain to resolve this. I got a half-ass apology when I drove away. 

All they had to do to make me a satisfied customer was just replace the wrong order with the right one. 

A bonus to win me over would have been a coupon or something for my troubles along with an apology for the mistake."}
{"text":"Let's get a few things straight here. As far as Calgary Mexican food goes,  it's not bad. But these guys don't hold a candle to a Texas taqueria. Have brought several Americans here and they were unimpressed to say the least. 

My visit landed me a chicken burrito with watery refried beans and soupy chicken wrapped in a tortilla that had been sitting on top of a microwave. 

I'm not saying this is the worst Mexican ever,  but anyone in the know can tell the difference between mushy Mexican fast food and authentic fare. If you are into spicy food don't even bother as the hottest thing they have is Cholua. 

What really gets me is that they have the balls to ask for tips on their interac machine yet don't provide table service. They must think their customers are idiots."}
{"text":"I'm gonna say it... Café Rio was created like 10 years before this place, and it's the EXACT same thing. Costa Vida just ripped it off (aluminum containers, revolving tortilla grill, ordering style) and added nachos so as to not look conspicuous (that's my best guess anyway). Nevertheless, my burrito was really good. Their horchata was horrible, and it made my entire life sad. But again, good burrito."}
{"text":"For some reason I cannot update the name/address of Costa Vida. The address is 1900-715 Main Street, phone 403-948-0345 and the name is Costa Vida. Like Marjie S, I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Costa Vida is very close what a Café Rio is like, for those of you that get down to Arizona/Utah/SoCal. Last night I had two sweet pork tacos that were made with freshly made corn tortillas and very good ingredients for about $9.00, but the thing that makes me rave about on about this place is that my favorite drink, horchada,  was priced at $2.29 for I all I could drink. I am thinking I can only find this at some very special places that I have ferreted out in SoCal at this price, and it was mighty tasty as well here. Costa Vida's salsas were very fresh, but if you are into habanero burn your mouth out salsas, you are in for a bit of disappointment, as the spiciest salsa has just a nice smoky mild flavor to me, the other is the standard fresh tomato based salsa that we are all used to. My pinto beans also  had a very good flavor. In my final rating must think about how the ingredients like beans/cheese cost twice as much here in Canada, as in the States, not to mention the labor costs, and I must say that Costa Vida does a very good job at offering some nicely made Mexican food! By the way they are going to have a Costa Vida very soon here in Calgary located near Southland  Drive and McLeod Trail!"}
{"text":"Costa Vida is always on point. I visit frequently and each and every time my food tastes so fresh! My go-to dish is the chicken salad. With the salad loaded with all of the ingredients, you don't even need dressing but when you do, the cilantro ranch is delish! And even though I can't eat a large, I order it just for the larger tortilla. They make them right in front of you so they're always fresh. My personal recommendation is their salad of course but their pork is so moist and flavorful as well. 

We also just catered food for my daughter's birthday celebration and their service and food was phenomenal. Food was piping hot! Their customer service from the point of ordering to picking it up was excellent! I highly recommend catering from Costa Vida for any event. Their pricing is extremely fair as well. 

Their \"competitor\" is really not, Costa Vida blows away Cafe Rio! 

Tempe's location consistently provides great service. Their staff and management is always very welcoming and friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Definitely try their sweet shredded pork. It's seriously to die for. It's decently priced for the amount of food you get. Big burrito and a drink is about 8 dollars and the burritos are huge. This place is clean and the service is great. Will come again and again."}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite food.  The chicken tacos with cheese are delicious!!  They always hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Love is fast food place. Very good for a chain restaurant. They have a wide variety of meats to choose from and not your typical. The sweet pork is really tasty. I usually have a salad which is served on top of a tortilla so it's really like a open burrito with lettuce and salad dressing.  I could eat them everyday. Good specials for students too."}
{"text":"The reviews on this place are legitimate. Had the sweet pork enchiladas with a buddy for lunch. Cost us $29 total ($15 each) and we should have ordered the small. The food is fresh, it is unique, the seating is accommodating and the guy running the place is great with people, was helpful and obviously loves Mexican food as much as I do. The only drawback is that I am going to pack on the weight here unless I seriously manage the portions I order because I just ate and I already can't wait to go back. Great job on the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. I was a regular, but something awful happened. The food portions got smaller and prices went up. The Gf and I used to have dinner for 2 drinks included for just over $20. Today I went in got only 2 burritos for $33. Outrageous price hike given I got less food with my order. 

Good food, now greatly over priced. Lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"Two words. Sweet Pork. That is all you need to know. This place is one of my absolute favorites.

I prefer this place over the likes of Chipotle any day, wish I lived closer.

Closed on Sunday :("}
{"text":"The food is awesome, especially the sweet pork. This is actually one of my favorite places. I would def pick over the likes of Chipotle or Qdoba anyday.

Smaller than the Val Vista location, but glad they put one in Tempe."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot for lunch today as I was super hungry and in the area and the food, IMO it's pretty mediocre. It's your typical Chipotle rip-off with the choose what you want in your burrito or bowl menu, but the quality is not that great. I got the Baja bowl with grilled chicken, the rice was bland, chicken is rubbery, and the cheese is melted, like they nuked the bowl after putting it together to make this gooey mess. Nothing about the food will bring me back, and the only positive is the girl at the drive through window was nice and had good customer service skills."}
{"text":"Two words:  Sweet Pork!  Yummy!  I was addicted to this stuff when I worked nearby.  You can build your own burritos, tacos, quesadillas etc. with sweet pork, beef, steak and Mango chicken (which is also a good runner up to the pork).  The atmosphere is very casual with surfing videos playing constantly and tons of small children running around.  It's a great spot for a quick lunch or soaking up the sun in the outdoor seating area while people watching."}
{"text":"Came here after the lunch rush on a weekday. Every staff member in the food prep line gave great customer service. They were polite and considerate! 

Food was delicious and location was clean and nice!"}
{"text":"Sad to give this place 3 stars but I just feel this location is lacking compared to the Mesa & QC locations. 
The vibe is casual, young, and comfortable. But the food has not been very impressive the last handful of times I've been here. 
Each time I've been in, it's empty to no crowd so I feel like the food just kind of sits waiting to be stirred up. The sweet pork was dry and hard in some parts. The pico seemed very watery. 
Today, I was thankful that the guy said the tortillas was too hard so he'd make me a fresh one for my burrito. 
It's nice that they do free cheese quesadillas for toddlers! 
This location is always clean! The staff is hit or miss for friendly tho."}
{"text":"Good food. Staff making the food gets orders confused. Desperately needs handicap parking."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying that I have been to several different Costa Vida's and I do in fact love their food. My family and I were very excited for this location to open since we would have to drive to Queen Creek or Mesa for that delicious sweet pork. However, this particular location can never seem to get orders correct. Several times, they have forgotten to give my husband the sour cream he asked for, twice, they have given me tacos with no lettuce or pico de gallo (the most recent incident happened today). Every time we go and talk to the manager, they apologize and either offer a free meal the next time we come in, or refund our money. I would just like to see them get orders right done the first time. I kept going to give them another chance since they just opened a month ago, but I think I will be driving the extra five minutes and just go to Chipotle instead."}
{"text":"The Sweet pulled pork is so good. My favorite hangover food. It's good when I'm sober too tho!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Tuesday around 11am. It didn't even look like the place had been cleaned from the night before. The line moved VERY slow and the people behind the counter seemed very unorganized. One of them didn't even know the menu items. They  just throw it on the grill or flat top to reheat it. Although.. the tortillas are delicious! The rest of the food was average at best. We tried 4 menu items. When you go to sit down there are big trash cans right next to the tables. Not what I want to eat by. Definitely not what I expected from a place named \"Costa Vida\" Kind of a dirty, dingy thrown together fresh-mex joint. Giving it two stars instead of one because the tortillas are outstanding and the place has potential."}
{"text":"So bad. Waited in line tonight for 40 minutes. This location was so hot people were complaining and fanning themselves with whatever they could find. The a.c. was set to 85. It was 92 degrees behind the counter. They were out of ice but didn't bother to tell the customers. I went up to the counter and asked them if they had more and they got me some but other people that asked where turned away. The nachos were not worth the wait. My chips were soggy and gross... I wasted $20 and won't go back to this location again. Cafe Rio is a much better choice!"}
{"text":"I've been here on a multitude of occasions and have tried nearly everything on the menu. Everything I've had is really just sub par so it wasn't a fluke the first time I went. Sweet pork isn't really good at all like how everyone makes it out to be. Portions can be skimpy and everything is just generally not great. It is also really busy so it takes forever to get an average and over priced meal and the staff is not accommodating. The only reason why it earned two stars was because of the freshness of their items. If anything is recommend a salad with the cilantro like vinaigrette, but you're way better off heading over to pita jungle or sauce."}
{"text":"Just had this place for lunch.  Had the sweet pork Salad upon my sister's recommendation it was pretty legit.  I would recommend it or take a friend there.  The tortillas are made fresh before your eyes, food quality was good, the serving side was HUGE.  It has kind of a chipotle feel with a more extensive menu.  If your looking for legit Mexican food places like this are probably not what your looking for, but if your looking for tasty baja style food at a decent price then this place is for you.  

On a side note, they have those REALLY COOL soda machines that have pretty much every soda imaginable lol.  I dig it!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but the food is so blah. I got three tacos (pork, shrimp, and shredded beef). They took the tortillas and placed then on the flat top, which I thought was to warm them up and then they put cheese on them and waited until it melted. The kept them on for so long that they all burned and black on the bottom. Then they added the meat, lettuce, pico and sour cream. There was so much juice from the meat and pico that the tacos were dripping and soggy. But the bizarre thing was that they had zero flavor. The pork meat was very sweet which was kind of a nasty combo with the pico and sour cream. 
So I guess I'm the odd ball based on the rest of the reviews. I think this would be a great place for someone who does not like spices or is afraid that Mexican food is too spicey. No worries here since the food is very bland."}
{"text":"For me, chicken salad or nachos is the way to go here. The chicken is amazing. This isn't Mexican food, it's sort of Mexican-ish. The pulled pork is extremely sweet. It's like super sweet bbq with not enough spices to cut the sweetness. I know lots of people who love it though. A small nachos and a drink is just under 10 bucks, but I can't finish the whole thing, and it keeps me full a long time, so it's not a bad deal. I see a lot of families here getting a large nachos and splitting it with smaller children. Every time I eat here the food is fresh and perfectly cooked. 

As for the waits in line, it's probably due to some numb nuts at the front who can't decide what they want. Maybe if they made the counter shorter so customers could see what's available, it could help. When I've been here the employees were helpful and the place was clean."}
{"text":"I have always only had great food here, it's my favorite place to eat!  I'm serious, if my friends want to order pizza or grab some take-out, I always steer them towards Costa Vida.  If I can't convince the group to join me then I will pick up my own Costa Vida while the pizza is being delivered.  I know, that's nuts and who doesn't love pizza... but I can not get enough SWEET PORK BURITTO!!  I have actually driven to Costa Vida specifically to grab some Horchada drink too, it is authentically Mexican fermented milk drink that tastes like Chai.  The saladas are amazing, the enchilada's are to die for, and the Tres Leches desert is delicious but must be shared, because its too big."}
{"text":"We ate at Costa Vida on Rural Rd in Tempe 60 times. We usually go on Taco Tuesday and get 9 tacos and tres leches with whipped cream and strawberries.

Unfortunately, 58 times they were out of strawberries. 35 times they asked us to repeat our order 3 or more times (because they forget between getting the tortillas, the meat, and ringing it up). 10 times, they left out our cheese or pico. The food is delicious, and the people are friendly and fun. 

The first review, we gave them 5 stars, 10th review, we have mostly 5-star and 1 4-star. 20th review, we gave them mostly 5-star and 2 3-stars. 30th survey, we gave them mostly 5-star and 3 2-star. 60th and final review, we gave them mostly 5-star and 2 1-star. We asked to speak with the manager, related all this story, and this was what the manager told us: 

You have to understand that you are only one customer. Our other customers do not complain about us not serving strawberries or taking down the advertisement. I do not appreciate you saying bad things about our store. We are the best store in the area, and we have the highest sales."}
{"text":"This location is usually pretty busy but the food is always good! Service is quick and employees are happy and nice. As for the food, it's definitely not authentic Mexican, but a brand of its own. My favorite is the sweet pork- personally I think Cafe Rio has better sweet pork, but Costa has better cilantro ranch dressing. Ask for the ranch dressing in the burrito or smother it on top- it's DELICIOUS!

{"text":"This place is excellent. I have been in the restaurant as well as the drive thru. This is made to order food at its best!!! If you are in the drive thru, Ally was a great help. People in the drive thru line need to understand EVERYTHING is personalized to your liking and made fresh!!! It is not a Wendy's, Taco Bell, or any pre-made awaiting food. THIS TAKES TIME. A lot of new people will be going thru the drive thru and inside!!! To give them a good experience, time is taken to explain and ask questions. Be patient for gods sake. Portions are great. If you need extra to fill your belly, then order extra. People get too out of hand with negative reviews that are undeserving which this restaurant does not deserve. Chill a bit and relax."}
{"text":"I called last week to inquire about catering our holiday party. We have a lady in our offer who has Celiac and CV is all GF so we were excited to order form here this year. I was speaking with the manager and he was incredibly short with me and the 4-5 questions I was asking. Simple things like the order minimum, if they include chafes, little things. He finally RUDELY interrupted me and asked if I had any other questions. I was a bit put off and I politely said, \"I guess not, thank you!\" and he immediately hung up. 

After that conversation we decided to go back to Cafe Rio, whom we used the last two years for our holiday party, even though they are not GF friendly, their service is excellent! I will not be recommending your catering to anyone as the manager was just incredibly rude, wish it were different."}
{"text":"Just witnessed the tortilla boy pile cheese in his mouth while working, lick his fingers, then pick up the tortilla dough and start kneading my tortilla for my burrito! Gross gross gross! #walkaway"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place by accident.
The wave on the sign & large garage door on the front caused me to I initially think that it was a car wash.
Similar to a Qudoba or Chipotle but much more fresh.
They have daily lunch specials that include a drink.
Very impressed!
I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is always good but I've had hit and miss customer service. The last time I came in I ordered on there mobile app and upon arriving they told me there was no order under my name, so I got in the long line to order food there. Thank god i looked at my bank account because I was already charged by them even though \"there was no order.\" So then I went and spoke to someone else who said to give them 5-10 min and they'll have it ready. So I went and sat down, only to have another employee tell me a few minutes later my food had been ready and sitting there the whole time! Glad I let my food sit there an extra 10 minutes..."}
{"text":"I used to eat here daily let me first tell you the meat at the Tempe location is garbage the sweet porky taste nothing like it does at the mesa location on to why a one star A they never have the same time they close and when I went there and they closed early they wouldn't even come to the door to tell me why they looked at me ignored me and made me feel like I did not matter I've spent thousands of dollars eating at vista Vida since I was 12 and I will never go back again"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food always tastes fresh and amazing and the staff is always so friendly! The manager Will is especially awesome! They were out of ice and he offered to bring my drink to my table once he refilled the ice and got my drink! Awesome service from a manager that goes out and actually helps his staff and leads by example!"}
{"text":"Very unhappy with this Costa Vida.  I fell in love with Costa Vida (an alternative to feeling guilty to going to Cafe Rio to much) in Utah, but this one didn't cut it for me.  

It is incredibly slow, and the staff is not that happy, and even worse the hotness of the enchilada sauce is in-consistent - one time I go its perfect, and another time way to hot..  Cafe Rio is the same EVERY TIME - they have it down to an art I guess.  Costa Vida needs to learn that.

The sweet pork is very good and does have its own taste (compared to Cafe Rio), but since that's the only reason I guess I will just keep going to Cafe Rio.   

Besides liking them much better they give much bigger portions and Costa Vida kind of cheats you on the meat and size of the burrito.  

If you are new to Costa Vida and Cafe Rio - I would suggest Cafe Rio - its faster, better and much bigger portions."}
{"text":"This location is not as good as the one in Mesa on Val Vista. I ordered a shredded beef burrito and they pretty much slopped it together. I ordered it smothered and he did not even ask me what kind of sauce I wanted it smothered in, rather, he just put the green sauce on it. I got pico de gallo with it and assumed they would put it on top of the burrito, rather, they put it next to the burrito, then it became soupie with the sauce. I will  probably not go back to this location until they at least get four stars like the other location."}
{"text":"Best sweet pork there is. Definitely recommend to anyone and everyone! Always fresh, and staff is beyond friendly"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Sweet Pork is killer & your mouth waters looking at the delicious chicken cooking on the grill!! My fav Mexi place in Valley!!!! Checkout the Daily Specials & save $$$$$ Oh don't forget to order the Cilantro 'n Pico - TO DIE FOR"}
{"text":"Oh gracious, I could not love the tacos here anymore than I do. They are double the size you'd expect, and are filled with yummy goodness. I had heard about Costa Vida for so long without trying it, and why o' why did I wait!

The cheese quesadillas are something I get cravings for, and they are just too good to not order on a regular basis. Go, don't wait, go...go now. Right now."}
{"text":"Love hate relationship with this place. Love the food but there's always about 10 people working behind the counter with only one really handling the food/behind the assembly line. Not sure what all the rest are doing but it doesn't help the movement of the long line that is constantly there. Food is really good though..."}
{"text":"We were looking for a delicious quick lunch from somewhere other than \"the Usual Suspects\" in the fast food world when I came across Costa Vida.
This place is pretty good! 
I noticed that the big, clean space was well laid out as we made our way to the front of the line.
The ordering system is easy: Pick your menu item (burrito, taco, salad, enchilada, etc), then pick your protein ranging from chicken to different kinds of pork and beef, then pick your sauce (red, green, raspberry chipotle, and at least one other). You then pick your sides and a few additional veggie-based toppings and you're good to go!
My lunch date had the pork carnitas burrito with green tomatillo sauce - it was enormous! Lots of meat inside, too.  I had the chicken enchiladas with rojo (red) sauce. Although I found the flavor of the sauce to be lacking, the other ingredients were plentiful and flavorful, and it wasn't dry which I find to be a common problem at other Mexican quick service restaurants.
We both had about half of our meal left over, so they certainly don't scrimp on size.
I love that on their website they have a nutritional calculator so you can see that ordering a salad won't save you much calories ;p. All their items are pretty healthy and nutritious, nothing is deep fried or fatty. 
So go ahead and get the tacos, you deserve it!"}
{"text":"Yum. Forever holds a spot in my stomach and a place in my heart. Well it was my place of employment for four years. I miss all the regulars and fun times spent on cultivating food, service, and improvements!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here the other day. I ordered the small salad and my husband got the sweet pork burrito. We also had queso. The queso was super runny and in my opinion not as good as their competitions. I also prefer the competitions (Cafe Rio) dressing. Again, runny and almost watery on the tomatillo dressing. Also, not as flavorful. I really want to like them. I just feel like it is lacking flavor. Maybe cutting corners too much. I get they want to make a profit but at what cost. I do like the fact that it has a drive thru."}
{"text":"This costa vida gets our order wrong like half the time. However I keep going back because they always are willing to fix it, and the people they have working there are always super super nice."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since high school and to this day, I absolutely love their food. The quality of the food, the service, and the environment is always great! It's so great that when I moved down to Tucson for a few years and they started building their two locations, I would go out of my way just to eat there. I personally get their chicken burrito smothered in green sauce or if I'm in the middle of a health kick, I'll go for a chicken salad. Whatever you get here, you'll never be disappointed. Forever a fan!"}
{"text":"Came here excited to try something new and different!! Was expecting to walk into great customer service and a fun atmosphere instead I walked in wondering if they were even open! Staff was extremely unhelpful and made me feel like I was being a burden to them! Food was way overpriced and not that great. Only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that my 11 year old liked it. Save your time (and money) and go to chipotle down the street."}
{"text":"I've been to Costa Vida many times bc it really close to my crib.  Food is good, the drive thru is cool and allows u to pick up better quality without getting out the car.  
Tacos are my fave...
Get after it!!!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this falls in second place on the list of comparable restaurants that I've been to: Chipotle has always been my #1, then Costa Vida, Qdoba, Cafe Rio.  Costa Vida is no competition when it comes to speed, Chipotle wins that hands down.  I got the chicken burrito with black beans.  It was delicious.  I love mango salsa so I got that.  As far as I know none of the other restaurants that I listed offer that but I could be wrong."}
{"text":"One pof my favorite take out Mexican food places.  Their Sweet Pork Salad is zoo good!  This place is usually a busy place and lines can be long, but they get the food to you fast."}
{"text":"It's been a few hours since lunch time and my overall impression is underwhelmed. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't that impressive either. Nothing really stood out about service either."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! It's the same concept as chipotle but not organic and has way more menu items to choose from. The best thing I've had is the sweet pork salad..at first it sounded weird to have sweet pork in my salad but it's the best! The small is a big enough portion for me. I sometimes think their kinda stingy with their meat and have asked for more and say that's the usual amount and give me a dirty look ..so their not as nice as chipotle when you ask for extra anything..but over all it's good. On Tuesdays the small sweet pork salad is $5.."}
{"text":"Think of it as a Taco Bell that serves beer. Had the cheese enchiladas, not bad at all. Rice was meh, beans okay. Service at the counter was friendly. Atmosphere much cooler than the Bell."}
{"text":"Came because someone said it was better than Chipotle....and Chipotle is bomb! Buuuut they lied. It was ok, I got the steak tacos and they were pretty skimpy, 2 small pieces in each. The rice and black beans were bland. The salsa was pretty flavorful so of course I drenched my food in it. I wouldn't recommend this place but I wouldn't tell anyone not to come if they wanted. I think I would give them another try and get something different. But better than Chipotle...I think not!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Just bummed this location doesn't offer the student discount like the QC location does..."}
{"text":"The Wednesday special was a great deal. For $5, you get a huge chile verde burrito, enchilada style, with lettuce and pico de gallo. The burrito itself was filled to the brim with pork, green chile sauce, rice and beans, and when I requested pico de gallo only, they heaped a enormous portion onto my plate.

Service, unfortunately, is pretty slow. Despite having what looks to be an army of staff for busy lunchtime, the line still moved at a snail's pace. The waiting area for the line is also uncomfortably warm. If you have limited time for lunch, I probably wouldn't eat here unless you've phoned in an order ahead of time to take out."}
{"text":"It's a busy place. The line was long, but went fairly quick. Seating is limited and it was loud. I can let that go though as it was lunch hour in a rather large plaza.  

The sweet pork tacos were what I went with because all the tips pointed me there and, well, that's what I went to try!  They were good, but the chicken tacos were so much better! I prefer salt and spice over sweet though, so choose accordingly. The salsa was full of flavor and the tortillas are handmade right in front of you! The chicken is grilled behind the counter... Looked like it might be dry, but it most definitely was not. And the rice... Cilantro lime rice. Honestly, I didn't taste the lime, but it was great anyhow. 

Delicious! I was afraid to admit that I found this place on Yelp (my bf threatened to ban me from Yelp after two disappointing picks, lol). Even he was satisfied with this one! :-)"}
{"text":"Love the sweet pork burrito! It's a great deal if you use the coupons in the Devils Insider."}
{"text":"This place had amazing food but the customer service is definitely lacking. If you go and the place is packed the line wait is about 20 minutes, crazy for a in and out trpe of place. I really wish they could get quicker service lines, accurate to go orders and I'd give them 5 stars but for now due to service."}
{"text":"Get the sweet pork burrito smothered with cheese and red enchilada sauce...oh and be very HUNGRY!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat! 
The mango salsa is to die for-- try it smothered on a pork burrito!!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this new location!!! I love the look. I love that the garage doors can slide open to include the outside seating in nice weather. The brightly colored wooden chairs had me from the moment we walked in. This is our new dinner spot (peace out Dana Park)! We stopped by for National Tortilla Day yesterday. I love that Costa does fun things like that! The mango smothered pork burritos are like manna from heaven!!! No one does mango salsa like Costa Vida. And the key lime pie is to die for!!!! My kids go nuts over their queso & chips!!"}
{"text":"Costa Vida has great food. Their sweet pork salads are my favorite. I do think some of their items are a little pricey but overall we keep going back for more. Great lunch or dinner spot!"}
{"text":"First of all I want to say that the food at this restaurant was horrible. The service we had was horrible. My girlfriend is now down with food poisoning from this place. I hope they figure out something cause they made a place I have never been before a place I will tell everyone never to go.... Chandler and Pecos location is no good.."}
{"text":"Three times in a row I have ordered food from the drive through.... every single time I specifically ask for no rice in my burrito, and rice has always still been added to my order, each time after the first I repeat myself saying no rice multiple times, and it has yet to be heard on the other end of the mic, that was the last time I go to that specific costa Vida"}
{"text":"Not bad for Mexican but it is quite expensive. Being ethnic as well we did expect more flavour in our meal. I don't think we'd be going back any time soon. Not comparable to Mucho Burrito."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food joint I've tried here so far , much better and generous portions than some other Mexican food places around town, Plus food is FRESH And DELICIOUS! Definitely a Canadian style Chipotle but BETTER! 
Well worth the try !"}
{"text":"Great customer service. We found a rubber band in our food and the employee treated us right and got us a refund and new burrito. Thank you"}
{"text":"Stopped at Costa Vida for lunch with my brother and his family.  He had enjoyed a burrito meal recently and wanted us to try it as well.  The burrito meal was a hefty size and some salad on the side.  Two people could share this entree unless you were really hungry for yourself . I had a sweet pulled pork natcho order which was quite tasty but it was almost same cost as the burrito meal .  The cinnamon milk was tasty which you could get by the pop machine area.  
Clean dining area and friendly workers !  Good fresh Mexican food here."}
{"text":"Sweet pulled pork enchiladas.  Was really good.  But after eating half I felt it was too sweet.  Service and place was great. Will eat here again."}
{"text":"Very fresh and delicious food!
Friendly and helpful customer service.
Overall a great Mexican restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Costa Vida is the future...

The dystopian future where we've exhausted our farming resources and instead eat manufactured and cloned mush that's in the shape of normal food. Where it looks like something but tastes like nothing. If they remade Soylent Green, Costa Vida would fit right into the background.

Another aspect of the future is automated machines, though Costa Vida hasn't gotten to that point yet it has a cold sterile atmosphere. To their credit though they attempt to rectify this mistake by hiring bored lifeless employees with an expression that longs for euthanasia. 

Sci-Fi writers looking for that future dystopian atmosphere to get the creative juices should come here!"}
{"text":"Food is great! A little over priced lunch shouldn't cost 16+ for a quesadilla, and drink. The only concern I have is when visiting last week they were changing the holding tanks that sit in the water to keep all the food warm. The holding tank has some build up in it and the girl placed it in the ledge letting the dirty water drink into the salsa and didn't take any notice. Kindof gross."}
{"text":"Okay...so...weird! I have been eating here for years and have never reviewed Costa Vida!! What is wrong with me!?!! 

I have three words for you...sweet. pork. tacos. These have got to be my all time favorite tacos! I skip the rice and beans and opt for some chips and salsa instead. Perfect!

Fresh tortillas made right in front of you! Delicious salsas. Friendly service. Super fun atmosphere! Just go...go get some sweet pork tacos, kick back and enjoy a yummy meal every single time you visit."}
{"text":"Just like the Mesa location this place rocks! Delicious sweet pork tacos and some chips with honey habanero salsa, mmm-mmm-mmm what more can you ask for? I can't get enough of this place. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious!!  We love it here and go all the time. The food is amazing, we usually get the chicken salads, but after reading these other reviews it sounds like I need to try the sweet pork ;)  The wait can be very long at lunchtime, but it's worth it.  And they are closed on Sundays which is a bummer.  But I would highly recommend it, I refuse to go to Chipotle anymore, you can't even compare them"}
{"text":"Their sweet port is def my favorite of the protein options. The chicken, pulled beef and steak are pretty good too. 

Pinto, black and refried beans to compliment your meal, in addition to rice. Several sauces and veggies you can top your burrito, tacos, enchiladas, or bowls. 

A go-to for us on Costco runs or when shopping in San Tan Village."}
{"text":"They have some amazingly tasty tacos here. The raspberry chipotle chicken ones are my wife and I's favorite. Improve the flavor with the cilantro ranch."}
{"text":"I had the raspberry chicken salad with the mango dressing which was pretty tasty. My problem is with the soda machine and how gross the ice dispensers looked. Of course I didn't notice until I went to refill my drink. Kind of worried about the rest of the store's cleanliness."}
{"text":"Best in 30 miles area. Luv it . sweet pork is the best.not any order will be bad.put a smile on my face the hole time I was there. Will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good american Mexican food. Nothing authentic about it, but it's still good. 
Very similar to Cafe Rio.
I really enjoyed the option of a small salad rather then a large or no size option."}
{"text":"Food is good. It's very American Mexican and not authentic but good. Service is terribly slow. You order your food at a walk up bar area so there are no waitresses, but the line for ordering food so annoyingly slow."}
{"text":"Awesome great tasting food, fantastic service.   I get a small cheese nachos, n a steak burrito, for free using the Groupon that expires soon in phoenix."}
{"text":"I knew of Costa Vida from back home so I was excited to hit this one up for a burrito, tacos, or an enchilada. On tonight's visit I went for the chicken burrito with rice, beans, hot sauce, cheese, lettuce, and the flour tortilla :)

It was all very yummy but I forgot to get it smothered, perhaps because I was taking it to go and was in a hurry or I was just thinking it might get soggy but it was fine

Next time it'll be smothered for sure

This location is great and pretty much on ASU campus so I hope a ton of students go to Costa Vida for some yummy goodness

Oh, the customer service was great tonight as well, the guy that helped me was very nice and friendly while making my burrito"}
{"text":"Well, I'd love to give CV 4 stars, however the service is horrible. The food is very good and cooked fresh to order. The worst part is the bad service- 8 of our drive thru orders in a row have been completely wrong and/or missing food. There is no way management has communicated our disappointment and concerns or it wouldn't continue happening. I've paid for food several times that I never received. I hope this location gets their act together as its a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"I used to go to Costa Vida practically every week when I lived in Utah. I love it!! So glad they're in Canada now.

It's very fresh and fast Mexican food. By far my favorite Mexican place. You walk through a line and tell them what you want on your food. The most popular menu item is their sweet pork salad with tomatillo ranch dressing. It's highly addictive!!!

I was so impressed at how cute this new location is, and how attentive the staff was. The price is also very reasonable. They're about $9-10 per entree, and I can never finish the whole thing."}
{"text":"Costa Vida wasn't as great as I had remembered it being. The food was fine but I ultimately didn't think it was that flavorful or exciting. The chips were chips and the queso seemed bland to me. The sweet pork tasted good but again, wasn't anything too impressive."}
{"text":"My favorite place to have fresh and fast mexican food without feeling like I'm having fast food.  My favorite item on the menu is anything as long as it is made with their famous sweet pork.  I have never had pork this sweet with such a great mexican flavor.  Conveniently located just south off the US-60 on Val Vista Dr in Mesa AZ.  I think this restaurant is just as good as any full service Mexican restaurant with the convenience of a fast food restaurant.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"OK, food is good. But I have to tell you waiting 30 min in line for takeout is ridiculous! It is also far to loud in the restaurant. Additionally, if they are really busy, they dont even look up at you or listen to what you want. I had to tell them three times for one thing because they didn't want to listen. Wont be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Solid Fresh Mex restaurant. Nice selection of pork, chicken and beef dishes. Guacamole was way too watered down; but besides that, the rest of the ingrediants were good. I tried the Mango Chicken. The Manago sauce was flavorful without being overly sweet. The chicken was moist and the torilla was excellent. A definate repeat when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"I think this place is great. I love any place that can give me a fast meal lunch or dinner that tastes awesome and gives me an option over typical fast food. Love the sweet pork salad. Always consistent. Service is typically good. Great for the family dinner or a quick lunch. Also allows me to eat here when I can't have bread."}
{"text":"Not good at all...chicken tasted weird and then we all had upset stomachs afterward. Staff not friendly or helpful. Food was way overpriced."}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time - 2pm weekday - so didn't have any crowd/noise complaint like I saw some of the yelpers did.

The food was delicious.  I ordered 2 tacos with rice/black beans.  I ate every morsel of the tacos which were large and stuffed with a good portion of meat (sweet pork for one, and shredded chicken for the other).  Lots of fresh lettuce and pico de gallo too.  I gave the rice and beans to my toddler for a snack and took the rest home.

The tortilla was devine.

The young people working were very sweet and explained my choices, thought my daughter was the cutest, and offered to take my tray of food/drink to my table for me as they noticed I had my arms full with child/diaper bag. Thoughtful.

Looks like in addition to our weekly visit to Chipotle we have a new place to add to the mix! Yea for Costa Vida!!!"}
{"text":"Comparable to Chipotle... better chicken and better pork, but the beef isn't as good. They actually make the tortillas from scratch right in front of you which is cool. I'm talking balls of dough flattened and then cooked. The chips are fresh too, but a little bland and boring - along with their salsa. I tried the 'hot' and it just tasted like a bean and butter sauce with no spice in it at all. Kinda gross truth be told...

If Chipotle was Port of Subs, then this place would be Quiznos - I guess that's a fancy way of saying that after they assembled my burrito, they toasted it. It was pretty nice. I ate every bite, so I guess it was good eh? They take the Chipotle thing one step further and you can garnish your aluminum take-out tray (yeah, even if you dine-in you're eating in take away containers - not so classy for a nice dinner, but fine for lunch) with beans or a salad or whatever you like.

This whole concept is pretty interesting - let's take a Mexican restaurant and cut out the waiters. It makes sense actually in quite a few ways (that I won't go into). People certainly don't seem to mind the cafeteria style dining since these places are always packed. 

It's not going to be my favorite restaurant any time soon, and honestly if I'm driving this far for Mexican food I'm eating at Matta's. Still, it's very tasty... close second to Chipotle for this type of quickie sit-down meal.

On a side note - the strip mall it's in looks like it belongs in Dubai or something..."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this costa vida they're fuckin closed I rolled through at 8:52pm and their website says TEN PM and the doors were LOCKED smh"}
{"text":"sweet pork burro+smothered + spicy salsa and lettuce= awesome lunch 

Place is often crowded and noisy. Food is always great though a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"We went to Costa Vida right after they opened in Gilbert, had been to the one at Dana Park in Mesa and was not that impressed, but thought we would give it another chance. We ordered and the total for the order was not right. They would not give me a receipt(cashier said I told her I did not want it) management was no help at all, contacted corporate and they sent it to the owner who ignored it as well. When ever I have had a problem at Cafe Rio with an order they always get right back to me. Even though the mango salad was good and the smaller salad was just the right size for my child we will not go back."}
{"text":"Very good food. Fresh, flavourful and prepared to order. Service can be slow (usually is). Prices higher than mucho burrito. Lost of landfill waste from food packaging - very 1980's yet to catch up with environmental norms. Want tasty food though this place is a fit"}
{"text":"Food is very good. Service is slow and gets backed up.  Price is too high. Expect to pay 12 or more a person. Food is slightly better than mucho burrito bit 25% more expensive"}
{"text":"Costa Vida wasn't outright bad but it wasn't very good either.  I shared a couple entrees-fish tacos and nachos with steak.

The fish tacos had itty-bitty pieces of fish covered by lots of mango salsa...so all you could taste was an odd sweet flavor.  No fish.

The steak nachos were decent but the nachos were heavy on salsa.  I mean heavy.  Like 4-5 big scoops-soggy-swimming-in-salsa nachos are not really very good.  Good nachos are about a nice well rounded blend of cheese, meat, beans and a smallish amount of sour cream and/or guac with a little salsa.

Not likely to return."}
{"text":"9:30 and the doors are locked. They are open until 10:00pm. Don't advertise that you are open to 10:00pm and lock up at 9:30 because you want to get a head start on closing.


I'm updating this review because I received a phone call from the owner after sending them a email. He was extremely emphatic and assured me that he was unaware that they closed early. That is exactly the customer service that is admirable!!!!! He even comped two free meals for me to redeem at a location which is closer to my home! Thanks Dano!"}
{"text":"This place has great reviews, I used to come here somewhat regularly 7+ years ago and remember loving it! Everyone is raving about the sweet pork here on Yelp, I love BBQ ribs, so it seemed the right thing to order; I chose it as a salad (which turns out is really an unwrapped burrito with extra lettuce).

SWEET pork. Like DESSERT sweet. Meat dessert. (I got the dessert meat salad, ha ha, full meal in one pan?). I chose medium salsa, it had no heat. My husband said the medium salsa was sweet tasting to him. I asked for a side of hot to see if that would counter-balance the overbearing sweetness, but it had what I'd call only a lightly medium kick. And it too still seemed to have a somewhat sweet base.

It's really fresh food, the tortillas are AMAZING since they are just made! The new self-serve soda machine, I hate to admit this, it sucked me in... They have diet drinks UNHEARD OF in restaurants, like diet Barq's root beer and diet sprite. The line to order was long, but moved amazingly fast. The counter girls were really sweet, the line guys were smiley and nice.

I REALLY wish I enjoyed the meal more. I wonder if the pork was always like this and I just always ordered chicken in years past. If I'm near, I'd be willing to give the beef or chicken a try, but I'd still be disappointed by that wussy salsa selection. Even the \"costa\" in Latin America doesn't have meat that sweet that isn't balanced with some savory flavor to it as well as a good hot chili kick..."}
{"text":"Restaurant quality food and cost meets fast food ordering and atmosphere.  Very little seating and hard to understand order takers.  Although the food was good...it was not worth the price.  Three burritos and three fountain drinks = $30.  $3 'service charge' on top of that.  Will opt for Baja Fresh over this place next time!"}
{"text":"Alrighty Burrito fans, this is one you otta try! I'm giving this place 3.5 stars since you definitely get a bang for your buck! I came here between a study session to get something fast, easy, and worth my money. 

I ordered the sweet pork burrito and its sweet and very tasty! The burrito is HUGE and only ~$8! Come on a Monday and its only ~$5! Like the size of a Chipotle burrito but maybe bigger! It's so huge, I cut the burrito in half and save the rest for lunch the next day. The contents of the burrito included rice, black beans, sweet pork, medium sauce, and cheese. For an extra $1 you can get sauce and extra cheese on top. I'm a fan of the burrito since I enjoy sweet pork. On the side was lettuce and tomatoes. My goodness... this burrito was almost the size of a plate! 

Onto the ambiance-- its a bit dark and lacks a cozy/welcoming feel. Overall, I'd say come for the burrito, it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Fresh, fast food that is oh so tasty not to mention filling. I ordered a chicken salad. A much better option for me than any other fast food within the complex. The employees were courteous, patient (as it was my first time there, I took a while to order) and professional."}
{"text":"A friend owed me lunch so he brought me a sweet pork burrito from Costa Vida. It tasted so bad I thought it was a prank. God, it was awfully. Do we really need another fast food Mexican restaurant in this world?"}
{"text":"The been here twice.  Once via Drive-thru and once dine-in.  The drive-thru took awhile but the food was good.  This place is basically a Chipotle with a drive-thru.  I highly recommend the flan.  It reminds me of Grandma's."}
{"text":"So I am a regular here. I've been at the Macleod address as well as the 130th. The primary difference that I can see is the staff. Macleod once had people who understood that considerate service is appreciated in loyalty and word of mouth support. No longer. Well to be clear it is no longer a given. Today the person I went to lunch with asked if the staff were always so \"rude\" and I had to admit that the last several times they were. I have never had that kind of treatment at 130th. Because the Macleod location is so close to work it wound up that I was there once a week minimally but no longer. IF I return to Costa Vida it will be at the 130th location where they still smile. PS: the woman who works the toll on Macleod has always been lovely and is the exception that used to be the rule."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good steak tacos. I was pleasantly surprised since I'm not a fan of Mexican food, and the Irish pub next door seemed more enticing. It was interesting to see the tortillas being made and I was pleasantly surprised that they were crunchy- not soft. I'm glad I can pick what to put in my tacos because I am a very picky eater. I wish the items weren't a la carte, though. The line was super long but it went by very fast."}
{"text":"I'm willing to try another location because the food was good. This location though needs to work on its customer service. Came here just before 8pm (website says it's open till 10pm). Asked for corn tortillas, they said since they're closing they're not making anymore corn tortillas. I'm no tortilla expert, but if you're open, I think everything on your menu should be available unless you literally ran out. The menu is a little confusing, it says \"Pick one of our Costa Classics or build your own!\" Looked over the rest of the menu and saw two picture labeled Costa Classics. When I asked what are the Costa Classics, the cook said \"basically everything is a classic.\" But nothing on the menu points out a 'Costa Classic', so that can was a little confusing. 
My girlfriend, who was standing right next to me right after I finished my order, was skipped by the girl taking our orders and moved on to the people behind us.
Went to pay for both orders, asked if I wanted lettuce or pico or anything, I asked for sour cream. Pretty basic item that comes with all Mexican or fresh/mex meal. \"That's 50¢ extra.\" Sour cream? Really? Guac being extra I can see, but sour cream? No. And with both of us standing there with two meals and only one cup for a drink in front of the cashier, \"you just want the one drink, right?\" I can understand if you ask the person if they'd like a drink and they say no, that's one thing. But assuming they Don't want a drink from the start, bad customer service.
Finally eating, food is just fine. But they start stacking chairs and rolling up carpets, still just barely 8:15pm when the site says they close at 10.
As I said, I'm willing to give another location a chance, but this location needs to work on its customer service."}
{"text":"This is a solid build-your-own burrito place in the style of Chipotle. The ingredients are fresh and diverse and the overall taste is good. If you are really craving this sort of place, I would say that it is leagues beyond mucho burrito but then again that's not a hire bar to set. 

The place is styled so that you walk in and get in line to order your food. It has a Subway style counter so that you can see the ingredients as you are pointing them out. As with most of these places things like guac/sour cream can be extra. The decor is a tex-mex/cal-mex style and there is amble seating. This is a great place for a good lunch or mexican inspired dinner. However, don't come here thinking you're getting anything close to authentic Mexican food. 

In general, I found the flavors good but a little underwhelming. The thing I did like, though, was that the tortillas are pressed and cooked right as we order then which is a nice touch and gives the whole burrito a little added freshness. However, the base flavor of these tortillas did not wow me. 

All-in-all, I would definitely choose this place for a quick lunch over McDonalds or Timmys but I wouldn't drive down in the South just for this."}
{"text":"Ha!  Cafe Rio wannabes.  Not even close though.  Got the small salad with chicken.  I tell you no lie.  There were 4 tiny pieces of chicken in it.  This place is nothing to be excited about.  Especially when there are better options in the same parking lot.  Don't waste your time.  Cafe Rio is 100 times better."}
{"text":"Came in the day after my birthday. My mom took me out and I wanted to use the coupon they gave me 4 free dessert with the app I have downloaded on my phone. It doesn't say on the app anywhere specifically on your exact birthday it just said bringing this daughter and they would honor it well unfortunately they wouldn't. If they're stipulations with your guyses coupons you should have release date so so people don't waste their time really disappointing.
The food on the other hand was great. My mom decided to try the new Baja Bowl she absolutely loved it it was light not heavy imperfect for someone who doesn't eat a lot and he's trying to eat healthier. I decided to be unhealthy and go out with a nachos the nachos are huge I literally didn't even eat a quarter of it. We also paid for our dessert of flan which was pretty damn good make sure you get extra caramel sauce and whip."}
{"text":"Their ranch is so watered down it doesn't even taste like ranch. Their sweet pork has tasted pretty low quality the last few visits. Not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed the food here. I ordered a burrito and it was delicious and very filling. I love the cinnamon rice drink too. The staff was friendly. Service was fast. Food was hot. You stand at the counter like you do at Subway.
The only drawback was it was noisy. It was a bit hard to hear my lunch companion. I wonder if there's something they could do to make it less noisy. But I would go here again for sure. 
I already recommended Costa Vida to my family. Oh and the prices are reasonable. I have to drive my daughter to work today. I think I will stop in and pick up something to bring home."}
{"text":"Love the nachos and that they have actual nacho cheese on them. I go there just for that, no were else uses that kind of cheese. Wasn't happy that the staff told me I could put anything I wanted on it and it would be charged the same, similar to subway. When I payed they charged me extra for every item added. Don't mind paying extra, but when I ask about it I would like the correct answer."}
{"text":"Meh. overall a dud. I was holding my one year old son while standing in line for close to 20 minutes. The line wasent even that long and it took forevvveerrrr. When my son and I finally got to the ordering area there was no smiles or a hi, nothing. I felt like I was inconveniencing them by ordering food? They charged me for the quesadilla which I hear is supposed to be free for kids 0-4. Overall I will not ever be back because now I have a horrible stomach ache."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say this is my favorite place but the food was good and the staff was pretty nice"}
{"text":"It's basically Chipotle but not as good. Considering we live in Phoenix and there is an abundance of good Mexican food all over the place ranging in prices I really don't see why anyone would eat here.. the staff were nice but the shrimp taco was the saddest excuse for a taco I have seen..."}
{"text":"It's so good but my tummy suffers in a real way. I eat here once in a while and I really like it. I've eaten salads, enchiladas and horchata. I enjoy the rice, the beans and the beef. I love the cheese and the salsas. I love that this place has large bottles of Tabasco. So enjoyable for me.

But eight out of 10 times my body rejects this food. I did see the staff kind of careless with their attention to cleanliness. Touching the hair or the face and then the food right after... I kinda blocked it out of my mind because I enjoy the food so much but I have to stop coming here. I owe it to myself. I owe it to my digestive system.

The decision is yours. Enjoy this food and suffer for 24 to 48 hours after. What's the alternative? That is up to you my dear Yelp audience."}
{"text":"Went in twice in one week and both times the tea was rotten as if they let it sit overnight for days. Gross. And the tomatoes in my pico tasted the same. Old. Rotten. I love Costa Vida.... I guess I'll just have to drive to a further location...."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant. The pork is amazing. Go get a sweet pork burrito or salad. You'll love it. The restaurant is always fun, full and delicious."}
{"text":"We go here a lot but the guy who does the salsa always  was very rude. Talking back to a customer when they asked for something. That's your job to get our food ready isn't it?"}
{"text":"Not super impressed this time around. I've filled my soda cup up 3 times with a different and each time it's gross. Also super watery salad. Not the same as Costa Vida in Utah unfortunately."}
{"text":"Stop by here all the time for some sweet pork nachos. The food here is soo good and reasonably priced for the huge portions. The setup is like a chipotle. You walk down the line and pick out what you want. The only downside to this place is the long lines. Every time I'm here the line is practically out the door and it moves very slow. The employees here seem to always have a lack of training and motivation. Be prepared to keep an eye in which plate is yours because they will not know. Some systems to ensure proper flow of the line would be very useful here."}
{"text":"I love their food but the employees at this location were a little disappointing. We saw one of them constantly on their phone and then give dirty looks to customers walking through the line. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"This is Costa Vida's 4th location in the Calgary area and it just opened yesterday.

I'm going to be frank. If Chipotle was in Calgary I probably wouldn't bother with this place. The whole first experience here was a roller coaster ride.

The first let down was that my wife and I tried to come her yesterday at 7:00 and they had already locked the doors, though the sign on the door says they're open until 8:00 on Sundays.

Coming in tonight it was busy as expected, but not super crazy. The staff all did a great job of getting everyone's orders completed. If you've been to any fast casual place then this is no different. You get in line and they take you down the trough of options loading you up.

One thing I like here is that they're \"making\" tortillas as you order them. They have the dough ready to go, it gets pressed in a machine, and then quickly grilled. It's kinda like what Blaze Pizza does with their dough.

I went with a Carnitas Burrito as that's my go-to when trying a new place to try to have a level playing field of comparison. Just like other Mexican places they start you off with rice and your choice of pinto or black beans. Black for me. Then they toss on your meat. They then give you a choice of sauces. I went with the enchilada sauce which they put a hefty portion.

Now here's where it all went wrong. Before I even knew what was going on the employee wrapped my burrito, doused it in sauce and threw it into an oven. What?! Now I know that this is a way to do it, but you don't see it at fast casual places, and when you do see it at more traditional sit down Mexican restaurants you usually get the option of having a soggy mess or not.

After the burrito comes out of the oven they ask you if you want lettuce and pico with it. You can also get a side of sour cream or guacamole ($0.99). YES THE GUAC COSTS EXTRA! Can all of the employees at every restaurant stop warning us already? We get it. My only problem here is that you don't get much for that extra buck you pay.

For overall flavour I'd give the burrito 3 stars. The carnitas is indistinguishable from any other place other than it seemed to be a little on the saltier side of things. The rice is boring. Sauce was good, but there was waaaaaaaaaay to much, hence soggy burrito. If I wanted \"wet style\" then I would have ordered an enchilada.

I was presently surprised when I went to get my drink and there was an horchata fountain. I love me some horchata. Unfortunately it was empty. By the time we were finished eating an employee had refilled the fountain. I asked her if they make it in house, which she said they do. I'm not sure if maybe it was made wrong, but it was terrible. I don't exaggerate when I say it was probably the worst I've had. There was an extreme amount of cinnamon. So much that it tasted like they had taken cinnamon hearts candies and mixed them with milk.

They do get a bonus point for offering Valentina hot sauce."}
{"text":"I was skeptical. Do we really need another Mexican grill? But Costa Vida is a solid Chipotle alternative.

Touting their fresh ingredients, Costa Vida is at its core just another variation of the Chipotle/Qdoba concept. Rice, beans, chicken... But the décor is stylish. The staff is friendly. The prices are reasonable. The soda machine is state of the art. All, at least in my still limited experience at this location, with shorter lines than Chipotle.

Conveniently located near the ASU Tempe campus."}
{"text":"Still great!  The guy putting the order together offered something we've never tried and it was great."}
{"text":"Still a solid 4 star.

The reason for the update is - it's been a while since I've eaten here - because the portion size on their chips & salsa has been reduced by a lot. Still very good chips, still really tasty salsas. And, what they'd been providing before was very large. So, all in all this remains a reasonable value.

Sweet pork burrito today. If you don't like sweetness, then this protein is not for you. The portion was very good. The meat was hot!

The place is always clean and I find the people working there to be very friendly."}
{"text":"Just went to the new Goodyear location (13233 W McDowell). Never been to Costa Vida before, but we will be back! New flavors, great service, helpful people with unusual pride for a fast food restaurant. We tried the mango chicken salad, sweet pork enchillada, raspberry chipolte chicken enchilada, chile verde,and chicken burrito. Everything was above expectation! We went back for dessert - tres leches and cinnamon tortilla - a nice finish. Really surprising food quality!"}
{"text":"The place was open, lots of seating.  Looked clean.  On the downside the music was blaring.  Why do these places insist on having such loud music?  I'm coming here after work.  I want to eat in peace.  Perhaps now that I am 43, I am an old fart, but really I just want to eat without music blaring.

The young adults working seemed to be in training.  Some of them appeared confused.  I did not see any paper menus around.  That is easier than staring up at a board.  I cannot imagine getting through the line at lunch in an organized manor.  Thank God it was not busy at 5pm.

I got an enchilada.  The tortilla was good and seemed pretty fresh.  Was not that impressed with the green sauce though.  They gave me a ton of beans which was good.  Guac is extra.  Yes, guac is always extra.  It was ok, needed more salt and lime, in my opinion.  The honey habanero salsa was awesome!  I really loved that stuff!  My favorite part of the meal.  So if the salsa is the best part of the meal.......I need to try a different meal I guess.

I like how everything is served in a potential take out container and that the lids are out where you can get them without having to get back in line.

I will try it again, but it seemed confusing to order.  Hopefully next time will be better.  I do think that it might be a huge cluster if I go for lunch though."}
{"text":"Food is decent- staff is not friendly and typically get things wrong.  It's annoying. Teenagers who aren't trained mostly and most of staff is unkempt Place isn't that clean either.  I won't go back - tried it 3 times thinking it would get better but each time I was disappointed.  Do not recommend!"}
{"text":"What can I say... My husband has me addicted to their sweet pork burritos.  I absolutely grave them at least once a week.

The place is usually busy no matter what time of day or night.   We are there so much we think the guy making our burritos knows exactly what we want.  I had one bad experience there but they made up for it the next time we visited.   I always order my burritos wet and haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Oh Costa Vida... I've been to this restaurant twice now and both times there's really nothing that stands out, nothing special that makes me want to come back. As I see in other reviews, this place is almost an exact clone to Cafe Rio which in my opinion is worlds better but I'll keep on Costa Vida for now. The setup is the same as Rio, the meals, the way the food is displayed, the turbo chef to cook etc. The food however isn't that great, as mentioned earlier there's nothing that stands out, no bold flavors, the salsa is just alright. 

I feel like the food could be improved because the meals seem bland. The service is nothing to brag about. And the price for what you get/what you taste isn't worth it. I think what keeps this place afloat is the fact that it's in a strong business complex. Other than that, there are plenty of restaurants in Dana Park that I would much rather go to."}
{"text":"I called in an order to go and was told it would be ready in 10 minutes, arrived 15 minutes later and it wasn't ready, which is not a big deal at all. They made the order while I waited and when I got home, the small sweet pork salad that I ordered had no sweet pork on it :/ I was pressed for time and had to go to work so I couldn't go back to have them fix it. All my Costa Vida experiences were great up until this one."}
{"text":"Is it better than Chipukele?  Sure.  Is that saying much?  Not really. The best part about this place is their tortillas which are hand-made right in front of you.  The corn tortillas are delicious.

I found the sweet pork to be WAY too sweet.  The shredded beef was OK.  The rice and pinto beans, IMO, were the best part.  I guess if I had to go to Chipotle, I'd pick this place, but if there was no gun to my head, it would be easy to forget about this establishment.  There wasn't really anything wrong with it, it's just there."}
{"text":"Costa Vida is my go-to restaurant for when I'm busy and need something yummy and decently healthy. That healthy part doesn't go for all of their dishes, but fits the vegetarian salad I always get there (I get no tortilla and swap in fajita peppers, plus everything else that comes with it). I really stay away from fast food, but that meal from Costa Vida is my big exception.

Their tres leches cake is also SO good, if you love rich, sweet things and want to indulge."}
{"text":"This is the Starbucks of Fast Food Mexican food meaning it's Crack!!!!!! So good and crackfullllllll"}
{"text":"Great food every time I go.  Love the taco Tuesdays and when they offer buy one meal get one free.  Lines are out the door but worth the wait for that deal and great food."}
{"text":"This is white Mexican food. Chipotle is better than this stuff. I tried the chicken burrito with mango sauce and I couldn't even eat the whole things. 3-4 bites in and I pretty much was done. Very bland and un-tasteful. If your looking for good food you wont be disappointed with chipotle."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times but won't be back. The food and price are decent however after the way they treated my friend, it's not worth it.  She ordered ahead online at about noon, and it was a work day with only an hour lunch.  By the time we got there at 12:25 it was still not made. We told the woman about our dilemma and she seemed very unsympathetic. My friend said we might as well wait in line it will be just as fast and the only thing she had to say was, \"you could try.\" We finally get our order and..... Of course it's wrong. Thank goodness my friend checked the food before we left or I think she would have lost it.   This time we got the manager he seemed to be a little more apologetic and tried to give us some free cookies to make up for the lack of service."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru for our first Costa Vida experience. Customer service and wait times were excellent but the food was just okay. We both chose the sweet pork as our protein (one burrito, one order of 2 enchiladas) and they aren't lieing, it is REALLY sweet. Too sweet for our taste. The rice and black beans were very bland / nothing special. I will CV give one more shot in the future and will try a different protein option, but based on what we tasted today I am going to have to go with Cafe Rio for the win. 100Xs over (even though Costa Vida is far faster / more convenient because of the drive thru)."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've since moved away from Mesa, but when I come to town I visit here every time. Their sweet pork salad is a must have. It's always clean and friendly. It's always busy in there, which speaks for itself."}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving this a 5 star is because their food is delicious. I've tried other Mexican restaurants and this is definitely my favourite one. Also their quesadilla was amazing! I love quesadilla and I almost always get them when I go to restaurants, but theirs is definitely one of the best ones I tried. Their Tres Leche is also a MUST TRY. If you haven't tried it, then you are definitely missing out.
I also want to give a big shout out to their crew. They really take care of their customers. One of them actually approached us as we were eating and asked how everything is tasting and introduced himself. If I'm not mistaken, his name is Joey. Very nice guy! I've never been to a fast food restaurant with this kind of service so I was shocked/surprised."}
{"text":"Amazing as always!  Can't say enough good things. Went to dinner on a Tuesday night and this place was slammed. Couldn't be more impressed with the service and considering the amount of people in line we cruised through the line surprisingly quick. You can tell a lot of planning and detail went into this place. It's a cool atmosphere. You can tell that the owners care about their customers as we were greeted by one of them. They wanted to make sure we were happy with everything. We would definitely recommend. The food was fantastic! Hats off to the owner!"}
{"text":"This place is cool. They definitely play up the Spanish meaning of costa vida in the decor.. beach life. I like the surfing videos that play on the tv. People are comparing this to Chipotle but the only comparison is that it's Mexican 'fast food'. This is fresh tasting and delicious. Chipotle is like if Taco Bell and Subway had a baby (in my opinion). 

The food is tasty, so flavorful and decent sized portions. It is a bit on the pricey side and their corn tortilla burritos are weird... more like quesadillas because they don't wrap them. Maybe the flour ones are different? I really like Mucho Burrito but this place is on par, although these guys are more expensive."}
{"text":"We go here occasionally if we're in the area and want something quick but don't want \"fast food\". The portion sizes are definitely quite large and the food quality is fairly average. The staff are generally pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"Costa Vida is a favorite of mine with their unique fresh salad mixed with hot rice and beans. The dressings and salad options are so tasty and filling. It's unfortunate that the service makes it sometimes uncomfortable being in line and ordering, almost as if you're a nuisance being in the restaurant. If Costa Vida fixes this piece of the puzzle they're on the way to the top!"}
{"text":"Meh.  I was excited to try a new Mexican place and was underwhelmed.  The value compared to other build-your-own-burrito places was not very good. The food wasn't as flavorful as Chipotle, although they do make their tortillas fresh in-house.  The guacamole was good, but everything else was just okay. I had a steak burrito and they put the sour cream, guacamole, salsa and lettuce on the outside.  I was so confused! I will not be coming here again when I can pay 10% less at Chipotle for better food the way I want it."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite restaurant.  I get the Sweet Pork Salad with ranch dressing  every time I go.  It's the best salad around.  We go to Costa Vida for almost every date night with my husband.  Great food, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place before, but always willing to try anything out. Constant chipotle consumer, so expectations were high. Plain and simple; overpriced for the quality. Definitely stay away from the queso. 2 stars given for great customer service. Wouldn't recommend for the food though."}
{"text":"I hate to admit it, but I like Chipotle. So since this place seemed similar to Chipotle in their offerings and it got great reviews, I figured I'd check it out. It's laid out in the same way (order at the counter, tell them what you want in your burrito/taco/salad) but the taste is distinctively unique.

The quality was great, everything was presented well. The pinto beans and black beans were good. However, I realized I'm not a fan of sweet meat; a lot of their offerings mix in sweet meats or sauces. It's like a sugar overload for me. I ordered the shredded beef burrito which was ok but the sweet pork my dining partner had was inedible...I was glad I didn't get it. 

It's a great concept if you like sweet dinner options but I reserve my sweet tooth for dessert."}
{"text":"Once you eat here, you'll never want to go to another Chipotle-like place again.  The food here is amazing, and it all boils down to the sweet pork.  So delicious, and if I'm ever unfortunate enough to have to head to the electric chair, a sweet pork burrito from this place is definitely on my last meal list.  The line can be long during lunch hour, but the wait is definitely worth it.  And it can be a bit noisy inside from all the people - but again, still worth it.

Side note:  for all new mothers, I swear that this place must be listed on some official list of places to take your little one and meet up with other mothers with their little ones, because I'm always shocked at how many moms and kids are in this joint during lunch hour."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews, unfortunately not authentic :( Taco Bell is actually better bang for your buck!  I would compare it to a sub par Chipotle- but completely bland.

The space is large and well laid out, friendly guys behind the counter and a lot of options to choose from.  I was optimistic when I saw them making fresh tortilla shells which is a plus!  However, the gouging started with the tiny kids meal and small salad I ordered.  Hubby had the burrito and it was huge but there was extra charge for 'smothered' and sour cream and guac.  My son had the two taco meal and it was really small for the $12 price tag, then tack on the extra guac and drink he was well above $15.  Everything was terribly soggy and just not seasoned well.  Mucho burrito puts this place to shame.  The amount of meat in my salad prob had only 2 ounces and the amount of guac they give you isn't substantial and part way through the meal the tortillas were soaked through.

The raspberry chicken salad I had was terribly sweet, almost jam like.  I barely got through it and had enough.  Had I known it was that sweet I wouldn't have ordered it, booooo.  Thankfully there was a fountain of horscheta to wash it down.  It's an acquired taste but I really was pleased to see that option!

1 star for the fresh tortillas and another for the horscheta.  I should have went with my gut and went to Paros souvla next door, chicken on the spit had me salivating as I walked by.  OPA!"}
{"text":"This is the much classier and tastier version of your Baja Fresh and Chipotle.  It seems that they really take interest in providing the fresh ingredients.  I haven't had this dish myself, but I heard the sweet pork is amazing.  I had a taco salad, and it was extremely flavorful.  I think the ambiance and where this Costa Vida is located gives it a clear sell that this means business!"}
{"text":"If they just had more locations I envision this place being the ultimate 'Chipotle-Killer'. I know it's a bit taboo to love chain restaurants here on Yelp... but I can't help it, Costa Vida has got the goods. 

It's all about their sweet pork... whether in a taco or burrito the stuff is made of WIN. They cook all of their tortillas fresh as you order, so when you walk into the place your nose is hit with the delightful aroma of freshly cooked flour tortillas. The concept should be familiar... walk through the line and build your meal as they cook it; just like Chipotle/Q'Doba/Cafe Rio. What sets Costa Vida apart for me is the freshness... I enjoy Chipotle on occasion but it seems like much more of a manufactured product, as to where Costa Vida looks and taste much more home-made. 

This is the type of place you can go to hungry and leave full, the food isn't greasy so it's filling in a good way. Easily recommendible! 4/5. 

P.S. Can someone explain to me why there are so many Mormon owned Mexican restaurants in the East Valley? It's always perplexed me. (I.E. Bajio, Cafe Rio, and this place just to name a few)."}
{"text":"I LOVE Costa Vida. We came here last night for dinner for the first time. We moved here from another college town, and Costa Vida was there and we loved that one too. 
This one is a bit smaller. But still just as good. The sweet pork is the only thing I ever want. So anything with the sweet pork in it, get it.
As for this location. It was good. I'd say a satisfactory substitute for chipotle or Qdoba. We went right at prime dinner time hours,and there were only 2 other groups of people there. So that made me happy, because I hate crowds. So we were fast!
The girls who worked there weren't that happy...but I was super appreciative of the one who was really nice and promptly removed her gloves without me even needing to ask when I told her I had Celiacs. She was the nicest looking person in the whole place!"}
{"text":"Unlimited horchata. I'm not sure what more needs to be said this chain Mexican restaurant combines authentic Mexican food with the speed and ease of a Subway style restaurant period for a quick lunch this should not be missed. If you are into Mexican food and don't mind the cafe Style Dining this place is really really a legitimate place to try."}
{"text":"We had dinner here the other night and it went well.  Their former drive-thru ordering kinks seem to have been worked out...thank goodness.

I got the Baja Bowl with pork.  I was a little surprised at how sweet the pork was though, it was almost too sweet.  Like BBQ style sweetness, as opposed to a Mexican food style pork, but it was still tasty.  My better half got the steak Baja Bowl and he loved it.  We shared an order of chips and guacamole and they were really good....fresh and flavorful.

I'm hesitant to order that pork again, because of the cloying sweetness, but overall their food is hot, fresh and delicious.  I'll return."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always good and quick! Sometimes when I come I feel like they don't give me much meat when I get the salad but other than that they are great!"}
{"text":"I'm late to the party on this one, I just went there for the first time.  I tried the rasberry chicken enchiladas. The contrast of the sweetness and the smokiness was a pleasent suprise.  I like the way they do the black beans and rice. Overall I would try them again as a quick meal, I wish they had one closer to me in the NE"}
