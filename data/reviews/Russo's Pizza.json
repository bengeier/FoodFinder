{"text":"This was our first time here. I'm always happy to support a family owned business. The pizza was FANTASTIC! The pasta was very good and the meatball was too. We also enjoyed the cheesy garlic bread that came with the meal and dinner salad. They even helped me to my car bc my order was big and gave me a free 2 liter. I will definitely be back, and can't wait to smell the restaurant again."}
{"text":"Delivered to me in Twinsburg.  Ordered chix parm dinner and salad.  Chix arrived nice hot and tasted great."}
{"text":"So I have never written any review before.  But the food and service was so good today that I downloaded the Yelp app just to write this review.  The owner provided excellent service and even ran out 3 suckers to my kids in the car when he missed us paying the check because he was taking a phone order.  The food was great, we will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Small parking lot out front. As you walk in, the decor is a bit dated, but don't let that fool you. The pizza here is AMAZING!! Oh so good!!  The folks working here are super nice and kind.   This will be my new go to place for pizza!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a case of where you should not judge a book by its cover. Russo's is in a small plaza and from the outside gives no indication of how wonderful the food is inside. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza and wings and I would say they were both as good as I've ever had anywhere. Pizza was a medium thick crust with quality ingredients in just the right quantity for me (just enough cheese and sauce and an adequate/not overwhelming amount of pepperoni). The wings were deep fried to just the right crispness with a unique flavoring (dill among other seasonings) that gave them a flavorful taste. They weren't very crowded when we stopped (mid afternoon), but I suspect we would have received the same great service, regardless. The interior of the restaurant is dated, but in an interesting and comfortable way that adds to the character of the experience. Overall, this is just a really nice family restaurant with great food and service."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night and had a great time. I ordered a pizza which was really tasty and my husband had chicken parm. He loved it! We both had salads which were huge! They Italian dressing was great and I loved the cheese on the salad. Our waitress and all employees seemed very friendly and prompt. We enjoyed the room we sat in it had a good atmosphere. We enjoyed watching the horse races. We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"So my friends were in town and we had a stack of menu's the former tenant left behind at my place and we can across their menu.   The eaty meaty big and bouncy pizza had a hilarious name so we ordered it. It was delivered faster than any pizza has been delivered to me in my life and was absolutely fantastic. Good toppings, sauce and cheese. Ordered the same pizza again two weeks later and was equally delicious.  I will definitely be going back to this place. They're polite, fast and consistent."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza, and this charming little hole in the wall--warm and inviting. Looks like it's been there forever with its eclectic decor of film star memorabilia and intimate red and green lighting; yet, they've only been there 5 years!!  The pizza is above and beyond your every day pizza!  Service was friendly!  We also ordered the dinner salad with the homemade house dressing. Yum!  We marked this pizza place on our GPS as our new fave! We WILL be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to start looking for new lunch spots. Ordered the chicken parm. Good tasting sauce, huge portions, crispy sauced up chicken. Delicious. Came with cheesy garlic bread and a side salad. Worth the $10. Some other coworkers had other things. Heard the garlic parmesan wings were a little dry. The half slab dinner was tasty. The calzone was a typical calzone. The rigatoni with sausage and meatball was delicious. Seemed like homemade sausage. The tour de lunch will continue, but I'll be back!!"}
