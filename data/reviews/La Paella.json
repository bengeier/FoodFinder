{"text":"Importing food from Spain might make something taste authentic; but in my opinion: a chef should use a love of paella to create beautiful new dishes using locally sourced foods.

An order of Spanish paella using imported Spanish ingredients starts around $45. 

4 stars less 1 for closed minded thinking."}
{"text":"I love that this is a small restaurant packed with ambiance and character. Great selection of tapas and the paella was delicious and authentic. We sat at the counter and had a great view of the chef preparing all the dishes."}
{"text":"La Paella is the best Spanish food outside of Madrid! As someone who is very connected to her Spanish roots I can spot a fake from a mile away.  Eating at La Paella was like sitting in Plaza Mayor - the ingredients in the food are imported directly from Spain, even the broth to make the delicious paella is imported so it doesn't get more authentic than that! The decor is subtle, leaving the overdone bullfighting pictures out and reminiscent of a true tapas bar and the staff...well Angel, Paco and the rest of team have so much passion for the food you can taste it! 
If you are looking for a truly authentic Spanish (not hispanic) restaurant then do yourself a favour and run, don't walk, to La Paella!"}
{"text":"Authentic Spanish restaurant, off to a promising start in Leslieville. Formally it was the Ejan convenience store for many years. The space has undergone a tasteful, classy  renovation, with an open kitchen and a warm, casual vibe. Burners are imported from Spain, and the kitchen turns out some very tasty, authentic paella. Will update my review after a return visit, but so far I'm impressed. Prices are not the cheapest, but the food is high quality."}
{"text":"I lived in Valencia, Spain for 1/2 year and for 15 years now I have not been able to have amazing paella. I finally found this location and not only was I blown away by the paella, but everything else in the menu including the paella was out of this world. Everything was perfect! The service was outstanding, the food was impeccable, the restaurant was clean and aesthetic!  This has to be one of my favourite spots in Toronto now!!!! Love love love love La Paella!!!!"}
