{"text":"Food is always good and service on point, see Alicia, she is excellent!  It's been several visits and I noticed that there is a lot of the same staff which is a good sign that things are working well from management on down. Everyone was helpful and had a smile which goes a long way in my opinion. Make sure to check in to get your complementary edamame.  Great sushi and great service, my fav happy hour joint!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here with family. Love the specials and all the delicious sushi."}
{"text":"Lost my business While dining with my children,  the manager approached our table to inform us that we were sitting at a reserved table and she needed  to move us. The hostess seated us at a table reserved for a later time. The manager questioned how i was seated there, clearly asking if I seated myself. Although I was told the patrons were there and waiting to be seated, 20 minutes later they showed up. But we moved WHILE in the middle of eating our appetizer which we were told she would move to our new table and would be on her for the inconvenience.  Gee thanks for disrupting my family's dinner and comp ' ing a $5 dish.  Our waiter was embarrassed and tried hard to improve our dining experience and we appreciated that. BUT, Never once did the manager stop by to check on us. Apparently, gaining repeat customers is not as important as making happy the family or friends that the table was reserved for.  It is no wonder they had several open tables on a Friday night while the nearby sushi competitor had a line out the door."}
{"text":"I have eaten sushi all over the world and have to say that I  would pass on this place. If you cannot even get the rice of a simple 2-piece Sushi correct, then you should just throw in the towel.  You know how when you think that sushi is going to keep well overnight in the refrigerator and then the next day you pull it out and the rice is hard and gross and the fish has a weird taste... yeah thats how the rice was...       I looked on Yelp and went here because of the good suggestions, however when I arrived the waitress did not even know what the difference between cold and hot saki was and what type of saki the restaurant offered.... WHAT??? COME ON!!!!  It's a sushi bar... RIGHT? Shouldn't  this be one of the first  things that is taught to your employees??? So, after I  educated her regarding saki, the saki we ordered was sub- par. The owners should take note and taste some saki.There are some awesome sakis out there that don't taste like rubbing alcohol!  I guess I should have know when I looked over the list of sushi and they spelled Crab with a \"K\"!  I guess if you are ready to eat whatever \"KRAB\" is then this is the spot for you!  Good Luck!!!"}
{"text":"Their Apocalypse roll!!!!!!!! OMG. My mouth waters..... I have gone 2 times and it's always very lonely but the food is awesome and service is good. You can order to go as well. I noticed that people that would arrive after me would ask for specific waiters/waitresses, it seems like the service is personalized. It is a bit overpriced though."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now, and the food and service has been great both times. Even the support staff go out of there way to ensure a pleasant experience. Hard to find this kind of customer service nowadays even though AZ is a tourism state!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Upon walking in, you may or may not receive a prompt greeting or seating. I think it depends on the time of the day. Early afternoons they seem to be understaffed, and it shows from being seated, to not being able to complete a meal on a 30 minute lunch break because of how long it takes to receive your meal. If you arrive in the evening they have more staff, however more customers so it's still slow on receiving your meal.   The staff have all been pleasant.   The food is average in taste, and a slightly higher in price than their competition.   The atmosphere is pretty cool inside except for the background house style music they play all the time. Depending on which wall you are seated next to, it's common for one of us to leave with a headache from the obnoxious low bass coming from the speakers. We almost got up and left recently because of how bad it was where they sat us in the lounge.  The outside patio is not happening. It doesn't even match the sultry theme of the inside.   They have a great thing started here, I think it just needs some enthusiasm from the ownership to really make consistent and timely service a priority."}
{"text":"I've never been a server, but I can't imagine it's fun to wait on a large party by yourself, especially when they all request separate checks, all just \"start\" with waters, and are so busy chatting that they take a while to order.  However, that's exactly what happened when a large group of us went out for a Happy Hour Birthday Celebration.  Our server was fantastic!! He never complained, got everyone's orders correct and constantly kept our waters full.  The sushi was great (Las Vegas roll) - decent size and delicious taste.  Happy Hour prices were fair and overall, we had a great time! I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"It took over 30 minutes to get our appetizers and dinner. Nothing special about the food that you could get at any other similar restaurant."}
{"text":"I recommend this place if you want a good time out with family,couples,dates,or with kids. My favorite dish is the Vegas roll#bomb-balicious! A fantastic meal with great ambiance and good service!"}
{"text":"When I'm eating lunch I Always order the sushi lunch special.  I love the Las Vegas roll w/ California rolls.  All for $10 you can't beat it anywhere!    Gigi always remembers me when I come in including my order.  If you're in the West Valley and crave great sushi for a great price stop by here!    Plus if you check in on yelp you get a free order of edamame!  Who doesn't like free?"}
{"text":"Great sushi at a great price. The restaurant is modern but needs a little touch up."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I tried this restaurant for the second time last night and still no better than the first. The food is mediocre and the service is horrible, their servers need a lot more training. Sent my food back because my order was wrong, then what I think was the manager came over to my table yelling at me saying I needed to order differently next time so my order would be correct. I'm vegetarian all I asked for was no meet on my order. Not sure how else I could have ordered it. Oh and even if you get crappy service they take it upon themselves to add in the gratuity so you don't have to. Shouldn't matter the party size, terrible service is still terrible service. I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK AGAIN."}
{"text":"Sashimi was not fresh...comments from diners in our party of seven: \"mealy,\" \"stringy,\" \"fishy,\" \"mushy.\" The cuts also seemed poorly executed.   Utterly disappointing for me. I would have sent the platter back, but others didn't want to make a big deal out of it. They also told me that we were in Goodyear (meaning not fresh fish), and it was a Sunday (meaning not fresh fish), and this place probably uses a lower-grade of fish... One diner solved some of the taste problem by dipping in soy sauce to mask the taste, which she said she didn't do with \"good\" sashimi.  (Note: I have had fresh fish on the west side of Phoenix --and on Sundays...)  I had started by eating salmon, it was okay, but not the fresh, melt in your mouth variety...then the tuna, which was mealy...then I tried the squid, which I usually love, and it was mushy and off-tasting. It was also cut very strangely, like no other squid I have had elsewhere. Its texture was so poor and its taste was off, so I had to spit that out. I tried another piece and had to spit it out. After that, I lost my appetite.   This is absolutely one of the worst sushi restaurants I have eaten at. (I have eaten at sushi places in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Singapore, and of course, here in Phoenix.)  I said something to the waitress twice (early on when I first tasted from the platter, and then towards the end of the meal, when she finally brought over a manager). The manager was rather defensive. She said the squid was frozen... I know that most fish --if not all --is required to be frozen prior to serving in Arizona. Even so, I have had good sashimi out here. One diner, who lacks a sense of smell, ate the most of the fish. But we left squid, salmon, and other fish on the platter. Never in my life have I ever left fish unfinished at a sushi/sashimi place.  So what was good? A firecracker appetizer - had fried wontons, tuna, and spicy sauce. The tempura was good, but I missed kabocha (Japanese pumpkin). Egg rolls were dubbed bland. Gyoza was bland. One diner had fish and chips and said he liked the fish, but the chips were just \"okay.\" Another diner had some sort of fried orange chicken and said the chicken was dried, others in the party tasted it and agreed. A complimentary fried banana ice cream was eaten up (the ice cream was ultra hard, but tasted good).   --I think this place does better with cooked/fried food rather than sashimi. I also think this place has too many things on their menu...and would bet that they have a lot of old food in their freezers. --I think they are trying to appeal to a broad audience by offering a wide menu, but then they fail to execute well...and end up with a lot of old food in the kitchen if demand is low. (Also noted only a few tables occupied when we were there.)  I think some of the positive reviews are more for rolls, which can really mask problems the fish may have.... Also, many of the rolls don't use raw fish.  A raspberry saketini was considered to taste like cough syrup. Some sake and beer were good.  Our server was bubbly and friendly.   Our appetizers came quickly enough, but our meals trickled out....Some diners started eating (the ones with hot meals came first)...as there food would have otherwise been cold. You'd think the hot kitchen could coordinate with the sushi bar.   I thought the place looked nice, with a red and black decorative theme... The big screen TVs with sports playing were a bit odd to me...more like a sports bar than a sushi restaurant.  The bathroom did not smell clean.  I won't be back.  Lesson to self: order a small serving of sashimi to test before ordering a big platter. Pay attention to reviews online. Avoid places that don't specialize in sushi/sashimi (this place tries to do too much)."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best sushi in the entire West Valley. The spicy tuna roll is fantastic. My wife and I are also big fans of the veggie cream cheese roll. You can't go wrong during happy hour either, when the rolls are only $4! The staff is also super pleasant."}
{"text":"Wonderful shushi place in Avondale. We ordered the hot night roll, shushi and green tee mochi for dessert and everything was fantastic.  Also the waiters are very nice. I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Decent sushi. We tried the Gila Monster and Hawaiian rolls. The monkey brains appetizer was delicious. Miso soup is average. We waited around 40 minutes after we ordered before our sushi arrived. However it was Friday night so I cut them a little slack. I would try them again if I happened to be in the neighborhood but I wouldnt go out of the way. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this sushi bar and their staff!! We literally go here several times a month sometimes even weeks. Best sushi around!! We always celebrate birthdays and special events here and they always do a great job accommodating so many people. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ok sushi, super salty orange chicken, we sent the orange chicken back and complained about it. The server let the manager know so the manager came back to explain to us that our palettes were the issue. I didn't want to argue and I let him know I'd leave my opinion on yelp he got very defensive and asked if this was a threat? He wouldn't let me leave till I somehow agreed that the food was good but I had a different taste preference. Ok sushi horrible service"}
{"text":"Loved my food just didn't like the cream cheese inside my sushi def will get it without next time"}
{"text":"On par! Started with the edamame and sake bombers followed by Miso soup. 3 way split with Gila monster poison ivy and Marilyn Mon roll. Everything was delicious and our sever Tommy was great."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow. We made a reservation for 6 and they set aside 1 table for 2, so we had to wait for another one to open. Reservation was at 7, we were seated at 8. Waitress was nice, but didn't come around much. Food was super fishy tasting (even the rice). Orange chicken was good and so was the rose margarita. My friends liked the sushi."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi! Lots of unique combinations! Even have a complimentary broth when dining in! Also a super friendly staff! Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"We walked away! Yep we did. We been ordering food from here. At first it was great, but lately..... Well it sucked, food was not what we expect it. Seriously, service SUCKED, water disgusting, and to top it off they don't check on you at all, 20 mins waiter passed by didn't ask if we need it something, so we had to walked away in the middle of it. We are NOT coming back, nor recommending this place again. You feel me?!! Guess what we went to FIESTA!!! Yeah is closed by. Highly recommended it, they treat YOU good. And no I don't work there."}
{"text":"Tommy the server is amazing! Very attentive and hilarious too. Great people skills and customer service.   I came here for my 30th and it was worth it. Love the atmosphere and seating. Even on a busy night was in and seated in under 10 minutes.  The Las Vegas roll and Monkey brains are the best!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the sushi.  Staff and servers were very friendly.  Look forward to going back and try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Not the Best Happy Hour roll prices as the other sushi places in the west valley. Happy Hour rolls and portions are much better at tomo (down the street) and ah hai (on cotton lane). So if you are just looking for some cheap rolls and apps, I don't suggest this place."}
{"text":"Great environment very chic, great food they have a great variety of rolls, and good prices, our server was so awesome, definitely coming back. We always have a great time when we come here"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sushi restaurant in AZ! Great Food, Nice Atmosphere and Awesome Staff! I highly recommend this place!!!! #Iloveit"}
{"text":"Great little place! Came here today for appetizers before some shopping. Food was good and service was fantastic! Will be back for rolls and drinks and an update! :)"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here first time on a Sunday afternoon for happy hour! I love the quality of their sushi but sometimes the service takes too long when it wasn't quite busy that day. I would come back for happy hour of course !"}
{"text":"The food is great, and the specialty rolls are fun to eat. The decor is relaxing and very welcoming. The only thing is the service from one of the female servers. I came in before her shift ended and when she left she didn't tell the other server about the appetizers we ordered so we just sat there till I went to the other waiter and let him know.  But overall, a good restaurant and good sushi for being so far from the ocean."}
{"text":"They do not deliver. False advertising. Update your yelp profile and be honest with your customers."}
{"text":"Ive never been a fan of sushi but this place is the restaurant  that changed my mind.  Now ill give it to you that the ambiance isnt all that great. But i love their sushi and their monkey brains (stuffed mushrooms) and i don't even like mushrooms that much either.  If you're not sure about this place at least  go in, get a menu and you can call in an order some other day. That's what i do. Cali rolls  take about 15 minutes(my most common order) and that's how long it takes me to get there so it works for me. And for $6.50? That's pretty convenient as well"}
{"text":"Nakama is awesome!  Fantastic service. Right now the mind-blowing Volcano Roll is my favorite."}
{"text":"Terrible service!  It took more than 30 minutes for our food to come out at 1:45 pm on a Sunday!  And it was hot inside too!  I asked for AC and they didn't turn it on. My first, and last time to this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Definitely the best sushi in the west valley. And they're always coming up with new creative rolls."}
{"text":"Not a food critic here, just someone who likes sushi. When you think of sushi you think of small portions, but at Nakama the portion for sushi are bigger than average and the pricing is very reasonable. When I crave sushi, this is my go to place. The staff and atmosphere are pretty great. So if you're looking for good sushi with lots of options and a good price, this is the place to be. Will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"More traditional sushi than what you would find at RA.  Not the best, but far from the worst."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday lunch with a friend and I must say how cool the decor and interior design is. Also really great sushi and nice waiters/waitresses."}
{"text":"If you have 5 hours to spare this is the place. They take forever to bring your sushi and the customer service sucks!  There was only one waiter here and every one waited over an hour just for food! It's ridiculous and it didn't even taste that great. I used to come here all the time and I absolutely loved it. The quality of the sushi and customer service is horrible."}
{"text":"Great food and Service!!! Amazing happy hour !! We come here often and love it.. try the salmon."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since it opened. The staff is very willing to serve you and assist with any dietary needs. The food is always top notch and well plated.  The modern asian feel to the decor is very fitting for a sushi restaurant. If my wife and I are ever hungry and in the area this is our first choice."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit and I was Wowed by this place.   As soon as you step foot and lay eyes in there, first thing you notice is the modern with yet a traditional touch to the restaurant.  This place had ambience and the true definition of lounge.  The staff are attentive. We tried and ordered a few things on the menu and Jane no complaints at all. The quality was fresh and the quantity was just right.    I definitely would make this my one stop shop for sushi and happy hour.sakebomb. Com!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Nakama for years and it is by far our favorite Sushi restaurant we have ever been too!  The food is always amazing the Monkey Brains is delicious and the Hot Night Roll is my favorite.  My husband's favorite is the Red Storm Roll but it is not on the menu so you have to ask for it.  It is a spicy salmon tempura roll with spicy ponzu sauce....very good!!  Their Sunomono Salad is also amazing and huge, big enough to share.  It is also very unique and different from anywhere else I have ever ordered one.  It also comes with Ponzu sauce and you can get it either regular or spicy.  When my parents come to visit this is the only place they ever want to go eat at.  So definitely try it out if you get the chance.  Sometimes they get really busy especially on a Friday or Saturday night and the service may be a little slow, but it is worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, food is good.. Great place overall and best of all, near my house!! Lol"}
{"text":"this place is fukkin great!!! lol... i was yrying to go to my favorite place akai hana sushi on peable creek @ mcdowell but they were closed for lunch from 2-4 so i decided n this place thanks to the too girls below me n i loved it fried california n las vegas were very refreshng along with regular california rolls"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time here and it was delicious!  I live in the east valley but have friends on the west side and they recommended Nakama. They were correct!  Friendly staff! Fast service!  Sushi was great! Vegas roll was my favorite.  Godzilla roll was my boyfriend's favorite.  The calamari sticks were the best I've had also."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, enough said! Stopped in on a Saturday evening and the it was pretty empty.  Had my first taste of a Poke Bowl - had the salmon, and I loved it ($11).  Sweet, spicy, salty, crunchy, all in one bite.  It will be my new go to dish when available, and there is a lot packed into the bowl.  Also tried the fried California rolls and the wife and kids loved them."}
{"text":"Came in for the $20 sushi and sake class. Amazing value, great sushi (what we tried) and extremely friendly staff and proprietors!  This place has a 'local' vibe that is hard to find at sushi places and even though it's a bit of a drive from home, I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Stay away from the entree's and go for the appetizers. Happy hour is worth it - service is very good.  Good atmosphere with nice hip music...we like to go here for happy hour but again I have always been disappointed with their entrees.  Wait staff is very chatty and friendly - remember you when you walk in.....Best thing is there Calamari App , great sushi (especially during happy hour) worst thing is the Yaki Soba noodle entree.  We go back on a regular basis...you should too."}
{"text":"I eat sushi a minimum of three times a week. Nakama has the absolute best sushi in the goodyear/avondale area. The fish taste so much fresher and their unique rolls are delicious."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite sushi place in the West Valley.  I looked at several reviews (thank you yelp!!)  to find good sushi after going to that aweful place in Westgate.  What really caught my attention on their website was their happy hour.  Not only do they have a variety of nigiri, plain rolls, and special rolls... They also have $5 appetizers and beer specials.  The sushi was great and tasty.  Service was decent, but they seemed somewhat aloof.  But what do I care?  I just found a restaurant to add to my regular list.  =D  Oh and btw, I'm giving it 4 stars because it's not one of the best sushi places I've been to, but it's definitely great for West Valley."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite sushi spot in the West Valley! I've tried several and Nakama definitely has the best quality. Service can, at times, be a bit slow but that's not really a deal breaker for me. Even my 7 year old loves the sushi here!"}
{"text":"Good sushi (not the best), good service and ok prices. Drink specials are hard to beat, but the sushi happy hour is mediocre at best-- seems to be a common trend, as more and more sushi places are dropping their good happy hour menus.  I like this place better than Tomo and Kabuki, it's at least the best place to go for sushi in the Avondale/Goodyear area."}
{"text":"This was the first time that I actually ordered food and drink. I had been at Nakama twice before, once for a private party of which the\"catered\"food was fantastic and the second time to hear a DJ. I didn't order anything because I'm so fussy that I didn't want to cause a scene with my date. This time, we came to watch the football game. I decided that I would take advantage of the happy hour specials. I was blown away. The drink was PERFECT. The service was PERFECT. The rolls we ordered........wait for it.....PERFECT! Unbelievable. I had nothing to complain about, criticize, or get disappointed by! I am in the service industry so I have very high expectations when I go out.  Nakama delivered. A high end Scottsdale style establishment located in humble Goodyear!"}
{"text":"Glad we live in the west valley, cause this place has the best sushi in town. We have been looking for a place with good service and very tasty sushi. Our favorite every time we go is the crunchy rolls. Can't say enough about the staff, everyone is so friendly. Been coming here for years, can't think of one complaint. Ok well , would love them to stay open 24/7."}
{"text":"Sushi is sushi. It's either quality or it's not. This place has high quality sushi. So when I review it, I compare it to other sushi bars in the area (ie across the parking lot). Music good, ambience good minus basketball on the two big screens. This place is always freezing.  Winter, summer, it doesn't matter...it's like someone there must be menopausal or something. This is one reason I pick the \"other\" place. The service is okay. I really hate when u order hot tea and they don't offer water to wash down your spicy tuna. Their sashimi cuts are more generous than the competition and their rolls are full. The bento at lunch is a great value and I love the variety of their tempura.  All that being said...I still hesitate and often turn around at the door knowing I'm going to freeze my ass off while I eat.  Here I am now, guzzling tea and miso and praying my box will come before my nipples ice over."}
{"text":"I'll keep this one a summary: very forgettable sushi, disorganized wait staff, sticky (and wobbly) tables, and two out our party of six ended up getting sick afterwards. Thanks but no thanks, there was nothing here that would make me want to come back"}
{"text":"I have been here plenty of times and have never been disappointed.  I've brought several people for their 1st time & they've all been back.  Tonight my friend was so impressed with the food,  atmosphere,  & service that she wants to bring her husband back tomorrow!   Usually I'm here earlier in the evening.  Tonight they had closed & we didn't realize it because there was nobody pressuring us to pay our bill & get out nor were we made to feel uncomfortable.   Our server,  Dillon,  was very personable & entertaining.   I will definitely continue to come back here & I'm pretty positive I just brought them a new customer."}
{"text":"Great prices, great food and fabulous bartenders.  They have wonderful happy hour but also everyday affordable prices.  Tommy at the bar is awesome."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite sushi restaurant in Arizona (the two that come closest are Tomo, which is ironically across the street, and Stingray sushi in Scottsdale). Delicious rolls (I'm a big unagi--eel--fan, and I personally think that they do those best out of any sushi restaurant I've been to), great appetizers, friendly service, and reasonable prices. You have to try the cactus roll--it's amazing."}
{"text":"Nakama has become our go-to dinner spot. From their potent mixed drinks, decent sake selection, friendly service and and fun decor, it's an all-around great place to enjoy a leisurely meal. If you want a quick meal, avoid Nakama - good food requires patience and there are often large parties (or small parties like mine who order a sizable variety of nibbles).   I recommend starting with the Hamachi Kama if you can get it (it's seasonal and goes fast). For those who have mentioned a concern that the chefs use too much rice in their rolls, which is not something I have ever experienced at Nakama, skip the rolls and order nigiri. Their fish is fresh and expertly prepared.   For gluten-free dining, ask that cooking sauces be left off (you won't believe how much better the already amazing unagi tastes without eel sauce) and request tamari sauce in place of the soy sauce at your table. Nakama and Hana are the only sushi joints I've been to in town that are familiar with and prepared to help gluten-free patrons dine safely. If you know of others, please message me!"}
{"text":"This place is really good they have a sushi roll CMT and wow we loved it! It was so delicious! We love going after work. The ambiance is nice its dark and the survive is good. They also have stuffed mushrooms that are amazing as well. I really like this place and enjoying going. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I heard they had Happy Hour all day Sunday so we went to check it out. We normally go to other places, so we decided to try this out. Server was awkward and sushi was not tightly rolled, kept coming undone. There were hardly anyone in there at the time and this should have been number one clue. We got our rolls and dig in! The rolls tasted pretty good, nothing spectacular, but good. It was when we got home a few hours later that my husband and I regretted this outing! Got SUPER SICK! Been up all night, both of us. Ugh. Never going back to this place!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and have had pleasant experiences both times.  The service is always friendly and professional.  The food was good too.  Tried the teriyaki chicken, orange chicken, and a smidge of the lettuce wrap.  All were good, decently portioned and we'll priced.  The happy hour menu was good too- food and drinks!  Restroom wasn't the cleanest I've seen.... especially this last visit."}
{"text":"Bscr was burnt. Sashimi salad had no salad. We got sick from the food. The service was good but the food was horrible."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant!  They consistently have good sushi.  Tommy our waiter was friendly and helpful.  He knows the gluten free choices and they have Tamari.  They have a good happy hour!  Good Sushi!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi. We went here last night for my birthday and got the Gila Monster roll, Spicy Tuna and since we're from Seattle, decided to try the Seattle Roll. They were all tasty! The spicy tuna, we usually get for my husband but it was actually one of the better spicy tuna rolls I've had.  The waiter gave me an excellent wine recommendation and it was so delicious! The atmosphere is nice. We got a free birthday dessert which was a white chocolate deep fried banana with ice cream and that was really good!"}
{"text":"Every time we go to Nakama we have a great experience. The Sushi rolls are amazing and unique. My favorite is the Marilyn Monroll and the Gila Monster. We just saw them light a roll on fire the other day and it was pretty awesome. We asked the server and they said the roll is called the lotus roll."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Nakama. Our waiter Tommy was outstanding and very helpful. The food was simply amazing. Great atmosphere, lighting was perfect. Tried the Godzilla shots, wow. Stuffed mushrooms, egg rolls, krab puffs, Las Vegas sushi and lettuce wraps. Awesome food and great flavors. Can't remember what the desert was, but we are definitely going back to Nakama. Thank you again Tommy."}
{"text":"Best Sushi I have ever had. Absolutely amazing. And the rolls are just huge. Largest rolls I have found at any Sushi restaurant. The Gila Monster and Poison Ivy rolls are just to die for.  If you are looking for sushi in the west valley, they cannot be beat."}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi snob, but I really enjoy coming here with my husband. We always hit up the happy hour and the prices are great. We've been here about 4 times and the service has always been pleasant. The food sometimes takes a little longer to make than other sushi places I've been, but they provide complimentary miso soup so you have something to eat while you wait. The portions are also generous. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Try the asian slaw, such a tasty appetizer! Also try the pacific roll, that orange glaze they put on it was so DELISH! The manager was super friendly and very interactive. We customized a roll and it came out exactly as we asked! Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Food is normal and the wait is ridiculous. We waited for an hr for three rolls of sushi and there were only four tables around. Not the server fault but the sushi chef. I was observing throughout the wait and he was doing preparation except for orders so everyone just have to wait."}
{"text":"Let's just say this place rocks. The waiters were ALL helpful - not just one. They worked together as a team to make us happy. Their rolls are huge and full of flavor. Yummy complimentary miso soup. And a great atmosphere. No wonder they are busier than Tomo next door..."}
{"text":"Sushi is something that I love, and coming up here all the way from north Phoenix just to eat  sushi was 100% worth it. I especially loved my waiter... her name was Katrina"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in the West Valley. Tommy is always our server and is the main reason we love it so much! He's attentive, on the ball, and super personable."}
{"text":"A great place to have sushi on the west side, my Sushilicious Group goes there every month and we are never disappointed"}
{"text":"This place was not the best service.  Our orders came out at different times for a family of 4.  The chicken teriyaki was salty.  The sushi was just ok.  We sat outside and the waitress was very new.  She was kind but knew nothing about the menu and couldn't answer questions.  Way over priced meals."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to watch the USC football game and enjoy yummy food. We stopped by other restaurants and the wait was 45 minutes. We noticed televisions from a distance as we passed Nakama, so we thought maybe they have the game on. We walked in and sat in the lounge area and one of the very friendly staff changed the channel. We shared the Nakama sampler and chicken fried rice. I enjoyed everything we tried, especially the monkey brains. We will be back to try an entree next time coupled with the monkey brains. The California rolls in the sampler were also very fresh. I definitely recommend this laid back restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't know if it is because my family and I went early or what but service shouldn't take 20 minutes to get a roll. Not only were we not greeted right away it took forever to get our sushi. The sushi rolls were okay but not worth the wait or the money especially since they were slow. Plus it sounded more like we were in a Mexican restaurant than a Japanese restaurant. I am all for speaking a different language but not so loud you make your customers uncomfortable. All in all we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Lame place! Their rolls were bland and the rice tasted weird. Server was nice but over herd him and others say, 'I thought they were poor. And I'm probably not going to get a tip.' No reason for the attitude, your food isn't that good. It subpar at best. 5:30 pm and only 4 tables. I'm guessing others think your restaurant is lame too."}
{"text":"Not bad sushi.... but not top shelf either.    Place was crowded and it took some time to get our orders.  My problem with the sushi was that none of our sushi rolls would not hold together when picked up with chopsticks.   I've never had to eat sushi with a fork until now."}
{"text":"This is about the 3rd or 4th sushi place I have ever eaten at. I must say its very high quality, and they have an excellent selection to choose from. I was spoiled from the get go since my first sushi encounter was in Hawaii so I havent quite found anything that ranks up there, but this place comes pretty close!  The amotosphere is very laid back, lots of young servers, and I was suprised not to see one japanese person working as a server or at the sushi bar. Not that its a bad thing, but usually thats what is the norm anyways it seems.   We had the rainbow roll, las vegas roll, and philly roll, as well as a salmon and yellow fin nigiri. IT was all fantastic! If you dont like sushi, dont worry they have a full menu from noodles to steaks. So even if someone in your party isnt a fan, you can still go and enjoy their great sushi!  My complaints: I would have given this place all 5's, but our waitress was under 21 and had no idea about sakes, and another waiter we asked a question about had no idea about the sushi. (He did state he was new and still learning himself)  There was a birthday party going on over in the corner and they were having a fun training class on making rolls, and cutting fish. I also saw on the menu that they are going to start having sushi and sake lessons, as well as some kind of speed dating thing as well. Over all it was a very young crowd, and it was packed. I think thats a very good sign of any restaurant on a Saturday night! We definately will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"We've always gone to another well know sushi place around the same area but we decided to try this place & we're so glad we did. Definitely our new sushi spot. Great food & even better service."}
{"text":"Popped in during happy hour and had the red dragon roll, lemon roll and the spider roll.  We enjoyed every bite.  Ivan was our sushi chef and he was very personable.  Tommy was our server and he took good care of us."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here and got the Bento #2. A lot of food for a great value! It was very tasty too! My waiter was very friendly and I got my food quick. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sushi is very good. I have had it all over the world and this place is great. Amazing service. Do yourself a favor and get the fresh made wasabi!!! They have a great twist on everything. Best edamame I've ever had. It comes peppered which I love."}
{"text":"Sub-par service (brought wrong orders, and sushi chef was obviously distracted, maybe not server's fault) and dirty restaurant.  I'll give them kudos for competing with Tomo though.  Not reccomended."}
{"text":"This place is so good and my ultimate favorite sushi spot, but the lighting was really messing with my vibe. One of our table lights was out!!!!!!!! My eyes hurt. The waiter was mas o menos, seemed a little new, but he was nice. But yeah, that lighting was garbage cans"}
{"text":"Sushi is always good, service sometimes slow with a big group.  We had 16 people there for sushi sunday with only one waitress, who didn't seem super happy to have us.  GREAT PLACE Still our sushi sunday spot."}
{"text":"Had dinner with the family here Friday night. It was around 6pm and not many tables open but we were seated right away. My husband and I have been loyal customers for over 2 years. We love their drinks as well as the awesome rolls. The staff is always friendly and attentive. They always accommodate my shellfish allergies. They make my steak rolls custom made to perfection. Prepared accordingly.  Decided to bring everyone today and had the ribeye steak instead of the roll and oh my goodness, it was huge and juicy and delicious. My kids had Las Vegas rolls and they absolutely will be back for more. By the time we left there was a line outside and rightfully so. We eat here often and will continue to do so. Yummmm"}
{"text":"Love this place, best sushi in Avondale! Great waiters, great food, awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. I've celebrated birthdays here and other special occasions. Usually, I'm beyond happy with the food and service, but, today I was extremely disappointed. It could be because it was a Monday and because their usual friendly servers weren't in but our order took forever and it was mediocre tasting. The worst part was that the cook/ bus boy was walking back and forth for about an hour and he looked very intimidating. It made me very uncomfortable. Looked like he was trying to pick a fight or play security. Can't complain about he waiters here, they are always nice. Hope this place steps it up. I won't be coming back for a while."}
{"text":"Went there on weds during the day it was slow but siting at the bar and talking to the sushi chef was enjoyable. I had the sunburst roll and it was amazing. I also had the poison ivy which was okay. I'm looking forward to going again and trying different rolls."}
{"text":"Had a great time with our server Tommy.  Definitely want to come back!! Food was great. Tried the Godzilla roll."}
{"text":"Great food, classy place, sushi is what i get when i go, i absolutely love this place, never had anything go wrong. People are nice, staff is awesome, atmosphere is great. Get there, enjoy and stay safe."}
{"text":"This is our regular place and for good reason, we love it here.  The food is awesome and we almost feel like we're on Cheers whenever we walk in.  Many of the staff have been around for a while, so lost recognize us.   So here are recommendations from long time patrons...  If you like spice, go with the Godzilla roll.  It has jalapeños that depending on the season can pack a good heat so make sure you have lots of water just in case.  A rich, salty, decadent roll is the lotus roll and it comes to your table on fire.  We love the mechanics roll because it has a spin on a traditional roll and it has some nice chopped onions and cilantro and the monkey brains are so dang good!  Try their edamame- they put lots of sea salt and pepper on them.  And ask for Tommy or Gigi.  They are both great servers and have been there for a long time.    Now, you may have to wait some time to get your rolls.  That's just part of a good sushi restaurant that gets pretty busy sometimes.  So order a sake bomber, enjoy that edamame and monkey brains, watch whatever sport is on the tv, and talk to the people you're dinning with.  The wait is well worth it."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Came here a couple times and thought it was good. Came another time, not so good. Came in to give another try and we could not eat the food. Plus, we waited a long time while 2 other tables got up and left. Asked to speak to the manager about the food that we could not eat and was told she left. When we saw her a few minutes later, the waitress said, she must have came back and she would ask her to come over. She refused and the waitress apologized but still charged us for the food we did not eat. Poor management and because of that, we will not be back. Btw, we told the waitress that we just wanted to let them know how the food had changed and what we liked about how it was before."}
{"text":"Love love love this place- firecracker app is the best food ever and the soy paper rolls are the best in the west"}
{"text":"This place is great - a bit pricey, depending on what you're ordering. The food is yummy! I had their California rolls - they were so good I asked for seconds. I also had their pork egg rolls, which were also good. My friend ordered these fried shrimp things and he liked them too. I also had their Choclitini, basically their chocolate martini - it was yummy and strong - I'm a lightweight, so it only took me one to get me buzzed. To top it off, I had their fried banana with ice cream and that was very delicious! I would definitely come back!  :)"}
{"text":"A week in Phoenix for golf, baseball, and sushi. Had take out here twice!  Great service, very friendly staff and good sushi."}
{"text":"Soy Sexy roll goes so hard. Always have a happy hour, really good price. Perfect place where quality meets cost. I suggest seaweed salad and yellow fin salad when they have it.. They also have green label kiren beer every now and then  Months after I wanted to edit this. Happy hour prices suck now but they did add rolls with carna asada and chicken for non-fish eaters who get left out."}
{"text":"This place is great! We come here at least weekly and have been trying new dishes with success.  We love the rolls, especially the BSCR roll. Also, love the nakama appetizer sampler: great monkey brains, egg rolls, and jalapeño tempura. we love the tuna carpaccio which is outstanding. And even though this place is Asian fusion style it has some of the best fish tacos around (nakama tacos). To top things off this place donates a portion of your bill to eScrip!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out, quite disappointed on food. limited rolls on the menu, most are tempura and spicy tuna. would be more appealing if has pix of the rolls. I was looking for salmon but most are tempura salmon. I want my fish rare not cook. only the MonKey brains was good to me. however, friendly waiter and fast service"}
{"text":"Ask for waiter tommy he is awesome!! Gigi is always friendly!!! Such a good variety of menu options!! I would like to see their happy hour selections have more variety and more items. The Lotus Roll is the best in town."}
{"text":"My too favorite rolls are the Lotus Roll, this is about presentation, there is something about a sushi roll that arrives at your table on fire!  My other favorite is the Poison Ivy, a little bit of a spicy kick, and flavorful!  I recommend this place as well as those two rolls."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend who has her review written below mine lol! My first thought of this place was classy. I love the Red and Black decor and the seating that consisted of couches and roll out chairs.  This place has a good vibe and the DJ plays Reggae music that you can't help move your body too from time to time! What we ordered:  Crazy Roll - Crab, Spicy Tuna, Cucumber, Avocado, Eel Sauce, Orange Sauce 10.00  Marilyn Mon Roll - Shrimp Tempura, Avocado, Cucumber, Spicy tuna, Crunchy, Orange & Eel Sauce  10.75  Poison Ivy - Spicy Tuna, Avocado, Fresh Shrimp, Cream Cheese, Jalapenos, Salt & Pepper, Baked    11.25  Snow White Roll - Cali Roll, Red Snapper, White Sauce, Eel Sauce  Cheescake Martini - 8.00  Our Waitress was also the bartender but she did a good job of keeping up with us especially since there was a rush of a crowd that came in.  The martini was a little strong so be prepared if you don't like them to stiff watch out haha! I had to add a little bit more juice to mine :) Overall great spot! Might jsut be one of the best in the area!  Be sure to check in you will receive FREE Edamame!"}
{"text":"Positive consistency is key in my book! Nakamas wins my vote for great customer service...fresh, delicious, and BIG sushi rolls...perfectly-fizzy and tomato-y micheladas...and the clean, inviting, cozy, RED decor makes this casual,  yet classy sushi house a tad bit more sexy and intimate- even if you're just enjoying a mid day special such as their bento boxes."}
{"text":"Pros: Good sushi for being so far from the ocean.  Very polite and friendly staff.    Cons: Loud people at the bar that thought they owned the place.  All in all, this place was great.  Thanks Nakama!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim after a week in Sedona AZ.  A friend suggested it.  Well, I live in CA and this didn't disappoint!  I will say OMG!!  We eat sushi 2-3 times a week in Cali at some of the best spots. Hard to beat  First off our server Christian was one of the best I've had in any restaurant. I, myself a former waiter was impressed. He told us to do the happy hour and I did. I had the Las Vegas roll and the crunch roll.  Outstanding.  See pic.  If your in PHX. Trust me. Come here and log into help for a free edamame.    Ask for Christian. He will ale sure your experience is worth while ."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch for a reasonable price. The decor is beautiful - very chic and modern.  The beer was icy cold, the edamame was seasoned perfectly, the sushi was beautiful and tasted good, and the wait staff was friendly. All in all - a great experience! So happy we have a place like this on the west side of town."}
{"text":"I like this place. I don't love it- but it's not bad. Pretty good service I like that the chefs actually talk to you and the drink specials are pretty good. Not the highest quality sushi, but satisfying."}
{"text":"Tried the edamame for free (yelp check in coupon) that was really good... Recommend getting. Husband got the hummus cucumber, he liked a lot, full of flavor. The rose margarita was just okay, probably won't order again. Tried almost all the sushi on the happy hour for the $4 and $8. All tasted good, not incredible or the best I've ever tasted, but they were good, especially for the price. Service was okay, waiter forgot to fill water, wasn't busy at the time. Atmosphere is relaxing and laid back. Great to bring a group."}
{"text":"I decided to step outside of our normal American food places and we ended up at Nakama. I was a little skeptical because it was a lounge and I had my two young sons with but I figured since happy hour was over we should be okay.  Nakama was a little hard to find because there is no sign on the main road (McDowell) but my GPS is sharp. Upon entering the restaurant, my first impression was that it was very dark. The colors of the place are red and black. The greeter immediately greeted us with a welcoming smile and we were seated right away. At first, I thought that was a good thing, but then again it made me wonder \"Why is there no wait?\" I was excited to see we were seated at a big table, but then when the appetizer was brought out, it proved to be a bad idea because we had to get up to pass the food back and forth to each other. The waitress was very tentative and friendly. She brought us refills well before we needed them which avoided us having to go thirsty. I loved that my sons were allowed to share a kids meal at no extra charge. They ordered the chicken strips and fries. My sons do eat sushi but since it was a new place for them, I ordered them their own food to safe.  I ordered the monkey brains appetizer and it tasted wonderful. For checking in on Yelp, we got free Edeme. They were hard to open up and salty so I only ate a few. I did like they were warm. Once the appetizer was done, our rolls came out. We ordered the teriyaki chicken, the baked scallop (BSCR) roll and the shrimp killer roll.  I was not a huge fan of the chicken roll. I picked it to be safe but it didn't taste right wrapped up in a role with rice. I had to get used to their use of soy paper. I miss my seaweed.  To drink I ordered the iced green tea and that tasted as usual. All in all, it was a great experience. Oh and the bathrooms were clean and smell great. I consider that a plus because some places do not keep up with their restrooms because they don't think it's as important as the rest of the restaurant. I could also see the kitchen on my way to and from the restroom and it looked very organized and clean. There was a full bar which is great for their Happy Hour. I will definitely go back. I am excited to have found a great sushi place in the West Valley!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend she had bought an Amazon deal so she wanted to use the voucher. I wouldn't came back even if I had a voucher. The service is great the place is clean and nice, but the sushi is just not good. I had the crunchy roll; the rice just fell apart wouldn't hold. It lacked a lot of flavor. I won't be back again."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Servers are extremely friendly and efficient.  Rolls are always great.  Be sure and ask what roll is on special that's not on the menu!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is amazing and fresh and they have a good variety. Service was surprisingly fast considering the amount of staff they had (our waitress was also the hostess and bartender when we dined in).   I have ordered out from here a few times and the sushi is just as fresh when I get it home.  The atmosphere is very nice, red colors, great lounge, even has pillows for some of the areas. Indoor and outdoor dining, and the night we went on a Saturday they had a DJ playing reggae music and the place got crowded and lively. A great hangout spot for excellent sushi."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi! The menu has more than the basic rolls. I've tried about 95% of the rolls and I haven't yet disliked any. HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TRY THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"I love this sushi spot because of their yellowtail Kama. It is heavenly. Everything else on the menu is pretty solid. They have a decent happy hour and cold beer....enough said."}
{"text":"Love it!  Great Happy Hour and yummy rolls.  I am a fan of the Tootsie Roll and the crunchy roll.  They are very friendly and accommodated a large group of us for a birthday happy hour in the middle of the week. You know how when you show up with a big party and you ask the dreaded question...dun dun duuunnnn...\"Can you give us separate checks?\"  That look of horror and disgust usually crosses the face of your server?  Not here...he happily gave us all separate checks and didn't make a single mistake.    Our sushi chef for the evening was Santiago...a couple of us who went to Nakama tonight used to frequent a sushi bar called Fish Market back in the day (a moment of silence for the best caterpillar roll in existence...oh the shrimp tempura roll too!)  and Santiago used to work there.  He still remembers us and is probably the friendliest sushi chef around!    I have been to Nakama SEVERAL times and have never...EVER left disappointed!  Everyone is always friendly and the food is always good.    See you next week...happy hour!"}
{"text":"Some of the freshest sushi we have had in a long time.  We sat down at the bar about 6:00 and were greated right away. Tommy our server was super friendly and though it seemed he was also serving a number of tables in the general restaurant he was very attentive to our needs. Our drinks were constantly filled and our appetizers were hot. Prices were very fair. Even though we missed happy hour we were able to get 2 appetizers several sushi rolls and plates, hot sake and 2 drinks for under $50 pre tip. My only complaint was that the hot green tea was just a lipton green tea bag. You sort of expect the green tea to be that higher grade loose leaf stuff. But, in their defense...it was 120 degrees outside. Im probably the first person in months to order hot tea. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I thought the place smelled strange when we came in but the other people I was with didn't smell anything. The atmosphere was nice with bright red walls and dimly lit.  Our server was very nice and came by to check on us often.  She recommended the Lotus roll, which is served on a platter with fire. Kind of a cool presentation but the smell of lighter fluid was not appetizing and the roll wasn't good - served with cold crab and melted cheese on top. I would skip it.  The soy sexy roll (horrible name) and Marilyn Mon roll were both delicious as was the Crunchy Eel Roll.  Sushi took a LONG time. The table next to us must have waited 45 minutes for their sushi and they gave them some extra food for free for the long wait. We didn't wait quite that long but it was close.  I noticed another table ordered fajitas. Kind of random for a Sushi restaurant.  I'm not from the area so I can't comment on the other sushi places around but I might try another one instead of coming back here on my next visit."}
{"text":"I checked in and got a free edamame..  That was pretty cool.  The rolls are pretty big and it was fresh. Some things here are not my taste, like the music.. or that sake was barely on the menu.  I'd happily go back though."}
{"text":"can't say more then it wss not great, and their service sucks."}
{"text":"Worse service EVER!!! Came in and the hostess was rude, but we let it slide. The 2 guys working offered us miso soup and brought us our drinks, but our waitress was extremely inattentive. We ordered our food and within an hour we were checked one 0 times! No apologies on why our 2 rolls we're taking so long and no asking if we wanted another drink. The place was dead so there is no explanation as to why we received such horrible service, it doesn't take much effort to check on your tables when the place you're working at is dead. You'd think you'd try harder when it's dead to make the extra tip. It came to the point where we couldn't even pay our bill because she never came out to check on us so we sadly had to leave a $20 which meant leaving her a tip she DID NOT work for or deserve. We will never go back and make sure our friends to not check this place out. Don't waste your time!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour, but unfortunately the online posted time was different from the restaurant so we missed it. We decided why jot stay and try it out... Service was great, not sure why they had 5-6 people out in the dining room when there was only 3 tables seated, mist just stood around and watched the basketball game. Our server was very nice however and chatted with us about the game and food. Too bad the food wasn't as good. I love sushi, but if I am going to pay $8 for 5 pieces it should be pretty good, but mine very ehh. We also go the sampler appetizer which wasn't all together a waste, the stuffed jalapenos were good but very hot, which I like but my husband not as much. The \"monkey brains\" were very greasy, the edemame had too much pepper for my taste, the scrolls were also greasy but had good flavor. I probably won't go back, would rather go to Hayashi who has a better and longer happy hour."}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for lunch... We had miso soup (complementary), edamame (free from the check in in offer), the lunch special with Cali and crunch roll ($10), we left stuffed for $11 BUCKS!! (well, plus a tip, so more than $11... but hey) That is awesome!!  The miso soup is very good, the edamame is salted right and cooked right and the Cali and crunch rolls are very very good!! Our waiter was good too.   Small complaint, seems like the place needs a little detailing, the vents are dusty, tables sticky, walls smudged... Clean overall, but needs a little tune up..."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with my family.  Like the atmosphere (modern and happening) not too loud.  My family order a WHOLE table of food.  I got the Miso Soup and Fish and Chips.  Yes, I ordered Fish and Chips.  The fish was panko!  Everything was tasty.  The service was good."}
{"text":"This was the worst place ever service was horrible. Waited a hour to be served. Drinks horrible. Waste of time."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with a meet up group that we are members of. We had always enjoyed this place but unfortunately yesterday was just not up to par. Our drink orders were taken promptly and they brought out several bowls of edamame for the table which was very nice. It was a really good thing they did to because it took forever for our food to finally arrive. There were eight of us and only one lady making the sushi rolls. I ordered the Sashimi Platter #2 and it was OK. Maybe the last visit we took to another sushi place was still on my mind and this one just didn't live up to our previous one. The pieces were just not as thick or as fresh and in addition hubby found a bone in one of his pieces. We also had a Red Dragon roll and it was just OK as well. It was aggravating however because it was not rolled tightly enough and every bite would fall apart when you would try to pick it up. So again it was an OK place but not one I would select on my own. I would go again with our meet up group but not when I'm in the mood for really good sushi."}
{"text":"I don't eat Sushi in Phoenix...except at Nakama.  Delicious, creative rolls and a great menu for those in your party who are not Sushi-lovers.  Also, big bonus for having good kid's menu."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before but only had the sushi.  I went with a friend the other night and wasn't in the mood for sushi so i ordered off the menu.  I ordered a chicken udon noodle dish.  The wait time was not unreasonable nor the service up to the point that our food arrived.  The chicken was not seasoned at all and tasted as though it had been pre-cooked and warmed up.  The noodles were slimey and the dish was totally inedible.  We flagged the waitress down and when I told her that I didn't like the dish and that the noodles were slimely.  She informed me that they were supposed to be??  She took the dish away and two minutes later someone that I assume to be the manager came over with the dish in his hand.  He asked  me what the problem was and I explained to him that the chicken tasted like it had been precooked and warmed up and the noodles were slimely.  He also informed me that the noodles were supposed to be that way.  While he offered to get me something else he was not apologetic in the least and had a bit of an attitude.  I ordered the stuffed mushrooms off the happy hour menu.  They delivered two deep fried balls about the size of my fist.  While they didn't taste old and slimely they were not good and they sat in a pool of soy sauce that  just made everything soggy and salty.  The waitress did check back on us to see if we needed drinks but did not ask me about the food again and she seemed to carry on somewhat with the manager's attitude.  My friends like the sushi and they do go there a lot.  My suggestion if you do go here is that you stick with the sushi and stay away from the other menu items.  When the bill came they had deducted a portion of the first dish from the check but had still charged me for a portion of it.  It was not as if I'd eaten half of it and then sent it back.  I barely took half a bite.  I'll meet my friends for a beer and sake here but I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Great sushi every time! Appetizers are super tasty. And Tommy is waiter/bartender  Extraordinaire! The rose margarita made with 3 amigos tequila was so good. 2 was ok but I could've drank 10 they were so smooth!"}
{"text":"Oishii desu!    Delicious and great happy hour prices!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  We should've known when we sat down and there was not 1 asian person in this place (including the workers).  One of the rolls we got was the lotus.  It tasted dirty and like lighter fluid (it is served surrounded by a flame).  There were 3 of us in our party tonight and we all left feeling sick.  Not only would I not go back to this place, I would encourage all of my friends NOT to patronize this place."}
{"text":"Love the decor on the inside...we sat in the bar area in a cozy booth/table thingy. It was still happy hour...we got spareribs, coconut shrimp, tuna roll, and salmon roll. The ribs were not good to me at all..too fatty and tough. Shrimp was good and so were both rolls. I had a couple of grape martinis and we took some chocolate covered strawberries to go. Service was average and we did enjoy most of our food. We would like to go back and  try some other menu items."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst lunch EVER!! I WISH I COULD GIVE IT 0 STARS.. Food was Nasty egg rolls were so greasy, I bit into the egg roll and had a mouth full of grease-- YUK! NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"We had dinner and ordered the Nakama sampler to start. It was very good, the lotus roll was the highlight of our meal. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is acceptable for a suburb in the desert.  I would give it 3.5 stars if I could because I liked our waitress.  The ambience could be improved a little, but it is otherwise a good place to get some sushi."}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous review.  Tried the poke bowl the other day.   Awesome!   Seaweed salad was good and lightly sweet.  I will definitely get this again!  Remember to check in on Yelp to get your free edamame.  It's done in a way I've never had before.  Still in pods, with salt and fresh cracked pepper.  Yummm1"}
{"text":"Good sushi ! I love this place Personally I like it better than the overrated Kabuki  Their salmon rolls are the best and I don't remember his name but my server was so nice and very attentive Even complimented me on my well behaved son (: definitely my go to sushi spot in AZ"}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular, but great food, amazing service and a well thought out restaurant.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Boy this started out poorly, I was really getting worried but in the end I'm glad we stuck with it.  Being out at the only Suzuki dealer within 120 miles that can do warranty work  meant forgoing our favorite place, Zen Sushi, in favour of Nakama.    After entering,  8pm on Friday, we met a rather confused greeter. No drinks menu, no sushi menu nor utensils, yeah we had to request the existence of ALL these, thankfully Mike,the waiter, was on the ball and things got a lot better from here on in.   Thai Basil Udon - Udon with tomato and  basil  in a blazing sweet chili sauce with chicken was  pretty good, the sashimi  and sushi were better than average for the  are (E.G, Phoenix metro  not Avondale)  and it's not going to break the bank.   The pomegranite soyu was great  and well worth trying out.This was a recommendation from the waiter , though I think the bar tender was strong-arming him into making it;), which was a really good idea. Sadly they had ran out of Sapporo 12oz  , so it was a soft drink kind of evening from there on.   Nice surroundings, not too crazy on  a Friday night and certainly worth another visit when in the area but  I wouldn't drive by Zen sushi, Hot wasabi or Tokyo lobby to get there"}
{"text":"Never have had bad sushi here and they usually have good deals or happy hour specials. They have a quiet atmosphere and no load annoying music or crowd. On Sunday's they even play football on their bar TV so I can sneak in a few good looks on my date night with the wife. The service has always been good, minus the one time we had a waiter standing on the seat next to me to try and close the blinds and start cleaning up. It made things a little awkward but other than that we have been regulars here and it's always been a good experience."}
{"text":"Service: 3 Atmosphere: 4 Music: 2 (I'm not into the latest hits or electronic voices.) Rainbow Roll: 4 Spicy tuna hand roll: 3  The host was okay.  The waitress was blah.  She was barely around and we waited between two visits(Water and Order) from her probably a total of 40 minutes. The place was not busy. I would have been more accepting of this if they were busy.   The spicy hand rolls were made first and left sitting out on top of the counter for awhile. This was because they were still making the Rainbow Roll. I would have preferred they had served it right away as soon as they made.   The hand roll should have been more balanced with the ingredients. Understand this is from someone who prefers more tuna on her rolls than most. I also thought it would be spicier and it was spicy, just not the tear-jerking spicy I like. Then again I'm in love spicy food.   The Rainbow Roll was good and quite larger than I expected.  The middle filling could have been less creamy and more crabby.   Overall decent place and I would come back for the Rainbow Roll. I think you should sit at the sushi bar and not the table as I believe the people there were served faster or I would sit outside if it's not too hot to avoid the music."}
{"text":"Their Happy Hour $4 spicy tuna rolls are the size of my fists= HUGE. Worth going to for their happy hour alone...  Like any other restaurant in Arizona, Nakama sits in an indiscreet shopping center surrounded by your typical Kohl's and Walmart's, albeit it's right off McDowell Road so you can't miss it. Happy Hour goes from 4-7, which includes cheap drinks and did I mention some massively amazing cheap sushi rolls?  We had a feast= 2 beers X $2.50/ea, edamame $5 (huge portion, so that makes up for the slightly above avg price), 2 spicy tuna rolls $4/ea, 1 yellowtail roll $2, sashimi salad $10, chirashi $14 (sashimi salad/chirashi not on happy hour).  Service is slightly slow, so be sure to order some appetizers/booze while you're waiting. Ambiance is chill, club music pumping; don't know if it's my sushi music of choice but who can complain for the cheap rolls?  Stamp of approval!"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour to say the least. Love the miso and the edamae. Kid friendly for sure too. I enjoyed their rolls and my daughter had lots of fun with their bowl."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on Sunday afternoon.  The place had 2 other customers and we had to wait more than 40 .minutes for our food to arrive after ordering.  The food was good, but the service was terrible."}
{"text":"It is the best SUSHI in the WestValley.  Happy hour rolls are delicious and cheap.  My favorite sushi roll is the Hot Night Roll and I can only find it in this restaurant.  I totally recommend it! It is a very simple, hidden away place with GREAT service.  I come here anytime I want sushi!"}
{"text":"Good deal on the Oysters, nice rolls. Nothing to write home about, but as Sushi bars go it was A-Ok. Probably the nicest Sushi Bar in the Avondale area."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed by the decor. It's mostly red and black which should work but when I saw the patio furniture it was ripped and clearly worn out.  My friend got the stuff mushrooms and I had the Lotus Roll.  The mushrooms were not stuffed mushrooms. Rather they were mixed with this seafood and deep friend and came out the size the baseballs.  The Lotus roll came out on a bed of fire which I have to admit was awesome. But the flavor left me wanting something else. It was incredibly sweet and felt like a course mush in my mouth.   I wasn't impressed by this place and I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.  I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Alright far, far West-siders.  It's your lucky day because I have a treat for you!  Wait for it...  Good sushi in Goodyear and it's not another chain restaurant!!  No, you're not hallucinating.  Yes, you heard me correctly.  I didn't think it would happen, but it did.  Here's the skinny...  Nakama is the latest and greatest raw fish development West of the 101 and North of the 10.  It's in the Lowe's parking lot and decorated red and black with tables, booths, and a sushi bar.  They offer both sushi and an \"Asian Fusion\" menu.  I tried a little from both and although it's nice to have other options for non-sushi dining pals, they fell a little short with the Asian fusion menu.  We started off with the Pan Asian Chicken & Vegetable Lettuce Wraps.  The chunks of chicken were good and well sized with lots of veggies to accompany, but the dish was really, really bland.  My husband had the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box and was not impressed.  The teriyaki and salad weren't that great and the gyoza was only so-so.  It also comes with an entire California roll and a sushi - the latter he sub'd for more gyoza.  Not liking seafood, it wasn't for him and he would have rather had more teriyaki (had it been good).  I tackled the sushi menu and ended up with the spicy tuna roll and eel cucumber roll.  Both were delicious - especially the eel cucumber!  The service was really good and the portions were good for the price.  They have happy hour Mon-Sat 4-7 and 10-close and all day on Sunday which includes $5 starters, $2.25 domestic drafts, and $5.50 sake bombs.  The only bummer is that there isn't actually any sushi on their happy hour menu.  So, let's review:  hit up the happy hour, order up some sushi, and skip the Asian fusion.  It's overrated anyway.  You know what's not overrated?  A new non-chain restaurant in the far, far West valley."}
{"text":"Always love this place. Tommy is the Best. Great food. Great people. Always treated well."}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere and margaritas!  The service was also very good. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"My friend and I met here for an early dinner.  They have a sushi happy hour from 3-6pm all week, with prices on a number of items worth checking it out.    We started with a tempura mix, which was very tasty.  The veggies are cut thick, so you actually get the flavor of them, not only the breading.  We also ordered some nigiri, salmon and snapper.  I'd never had snapper sushi before, and was very pleased with it.  But the salmon was the star...it was so tender, like biting into butter, it literally melted in my mouth.  We ordered a few different rolls, my favorite was the Philly roll...nice big pieces and deliciously fresh!  We also got a tuna roll (can't remember what it was called), it was good, but tuna isn't my favorite...nothing against the roll itself.  We also decided to try the Las Vegas roll, which had baked salmon and was served warm and tempura'd...interesting.  Not sure whether I liked it, or not, but not because it wasn't good, only because I'm not sure I enjoyed the cooked salmon.  I was enjoying the raw salmon so much, I should've stuck with it...LOL!  Our server, Tom, was friendly and fun.  He was very attentive, made sure everything was alright and glasses were full.  It's not a fast meal, but it was relaxing and chill, giving my friend and I time to talk and enjoy our food.    We had a really nice time, and will definitely be back again...I can't wait to have more salmon nigiri!!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service and smelled really horrid! Last few times I've been here the seats are ripped up, pillows stained and needs to be deep cleaned BAD!!! Too bad, we used to LOVE this place."}
{"text":"After passing by this place for years, we stopped here on our way out to do some late shopping. We only had a little over an hour before we had to get going to get to the store before they closed but when we walked in on a Tuesday at almost 7 and there were only a couple other tables, I figured it would be ok. We swere greeted and sat around the corner from the sushi bar so I could see the people at it but not the bar itself or the chefs.   We promptly ordered the Nakama wings as an appetizer and 2 rolls and 8 pieces of nigiri. My issue wasn't so much with the food but with the seriously lacking customer service. (All the food was just ok at best). Though the appetizer was out quickly, our first view of sushi did not happen for almost 45 minutes. One roll came out first and the server did not mention which one it was, and since we had ordered some of their specialty rolls, I couldn't remember exactly what it was supposed to be nor what it looked like. After we had taken a piece or two, I could hear the server talking to the sushi chef and realizing she had brought us the wrong roll. The roll she did bring us was kind of boring. When she meandered over to tell us and asked us what we wanted to do, I told her I still wanted what I ordered.   Here's where they let a good customer service opportunity pass them by. Instead of leaving the half eaten roll for us to finish since it was their mistake and we were starving, she took it and walked away. We waited 20 more minutes for OUR order, all of this mind boggling since it was so empty. Then when the food came I could tell it had been sitting since i ordered fresh water eel and it was almost cold. We ate a bit and decided we had had enough. She never refilled our drinks nor asked how the food was. We then had to chase her down to get the check and a box as she only had one other table and seemed to ignoring us completely.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I crave this place. Sushi is amazing. And i love the server, Mariya! ;)"}
{"text":"Sorry to say that Rey and Becky (owners) have let down there regulars on a regular basis.  We've had problems the last three times and they've either got it wrong or took way too long.  Tonight was no different.  They catered to a large party and told us they purposely out to go orders behind them...I've been a regular since they've opened.  For better service go to Tomo...WAY BETTER SERVICE!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here because of a gift card sashimi was cut paper thin u could see through it had to eat two pieces at a time to get a bite. Sushi was fair, nothing to rave about. We figured well had 50 dollar gift card no expiration date on it so it would be a wash. They would not honor it saying it was a year old again no expiration date. Then they said they would give us 15% Off our bill. I get the bill and the 15% was only for non happy hour food. On a 55 dollar bill we got 4 dollars off. if you want great sashimi and service Hana on 7th ave clearly is at the top of the list. They serve fresh thick cut sashimi there sushi is flavorful and  well prepared."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now.  I love the sushi!  It's nice to have a nice sushi place on this side of town, a non-chain!    However the first time I went, my husband who is a non-sushi eater, ordered a cooked meal it came about 10 minutes after I finished my sushi!  Also the watress was very rude.  The second time we all ordered sushi so the timing wasn't off, but the service still sucked.  I will ofcourse continue to go because I love sushi and it's like 5 minutes away.  Also they deliver with youbuyandwefly.com, so you can't beat that!"}
{"text":"So we tried this Sushi Restaurant on Friday - we thought we should give it a shot - because we have been to the competitor in the same parking lot twice. I will say it was OK - not bad - not somewhere I would avoid. But I think it was OK. When we walked in the hostess station seemed to be a place of confusion (multiple people manning the station all trying to figure out what was going on). The Poke Tini was really very good. The rolls were above average. But the salmon Nigiri - not so good. I order this almost everywhere I go. I took the first bite and had to really work to swallow the very fishy tasting salmon. I left the rest on the plate. In credit to the server she removed the nigiri from the bill. So I will go back . . . but unfortunately I think their competitor has them beat."}
{"text":"STELLAR amazing and dynamic. Monkey Brains were insane and the Apocalypse roll blew my mind. Cant wait to go back. There are tons of places in the area but this is the BEST!!!!"}
{"text":"just went there for happy hour - very good!  got a saketini and mt fugi for $5 each.  got a spicy cali for $4 and a couple other rolls for the hh special price $7.  we thought the prices were very good - even got the free edamame for checking in on yelp so that's nice!  nice place, good server. will go again for happy hour."}
{"text":"this place undoubtedly has the best sushi in the phoenix metropolitan area, the pieces are hugh  and are always fresh unlike what you would get at an asian buffet that serves sushi. you will definitely leave there full and satisfied no doubt about that."}
{"text":"You will not find better quality or quantity sushi at a better price. We've been to 27 places in the Phoenix metro area, and this place is BY FAR the best."}
{"text":"As you pull up and park Nakama is inviting! The decor was original and comfortable/relaxing. They have multiple settings to choose from, a Metro Bar to a all inclusive Sushi Bar. Along with you normal family style seating, inside and out on the patio, Nakama is just a great setting that fits the GoodYear area Very Well!.   Now I'm by no means Sushi Expert,but Nakama's is right on par with the culture and finesse required, I think, to grab the Sushi lover's taste buds! My first choice was one I thought I was familiar with, a Rock-n-Roll! Well I've never seen it done any other way...... Until I tried it tonite. Rapped in a cucumber peal !!! Yes I was a'little concerned to, but let me reassure you it was good. From there the waiter recommended the nite's happy hour special....... the name I can't remember. BUT the food I can and will continue to enjoy every chance I get !"}
{"text":"Great portion sizes, good pricing and a modern atmosphere. The service is good, even though take out is a little slow."}
{"text":"It was my brothers birthday Saturday and we made a reservation for 10 and THEY GAVE OUR TABLE TO ANOTHER PARTY. We showed up on time so there was no excuse for it. On top of that, they sat all of us at circle tables that are only meant for 3 people maybe 4. Our food took over an hour. And when we were paying the waitress blatantly yelled that our card was being declined for a certain amount. Horrible. Never returning."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Thursday. Not busy and the service was very good. A pricey sushi place with excellent fish. Scottsdale prices for a Goodyear location.  Large portions for appetizers.  Cucumber salad was easily for two people. $8 spicy tuna roll. Waited far too long for the chicken bowl. It came out towards the end of the meal at which point I just put it in a box. Very disappointing because there were only 6 people there.  Worth trying out. Might go back."}
{"text":"Very good. Best sushi by far in appearance, environment, and service."}
{"text":"Today was the fourth time we have eaten there. And seems as though that each time we go, the ratings go lower and lower. The first time we ate there, it was at lunch hour on a weekday. We sat at the sushi bar and the owner and sushi chef was there to serve us. I have to admit, the way he cuts his fish is bigger than all the sushi places I have been (that includes NV, CO, WA, NM, CA, HI, Okinawa, Korea, and other sushi places in AZ). He was friendly and told us to come back for their happy hour the next time we were in that area. So, for the first time we ate there, I would give it a 5 star rating. We went back a second time, this time for dinner at around 7 p.m. It was packed lightly and yet the service seemed slow. Sushi was good, soft shell crab was not cooked too well. And, to top it off, they ran out of the yellow tail collar. SO, okay, four stars for that meal. Third time was dinner again at around 6 p.m. Again, the service was slow, but the sushi was good. 3 star rating. Today, Saturday, we went before 5 p.m. to try the happy hour. Although there weren't many customers yet, the service again was slow. I told my family, if in two minutes (after waiting for 5 minutes) no one shows up to ask us for our drink order, we were leaving. Thank goodness somebody showed up. Then, we ordered our food: soft shell crab, tempura appetizer, crunchy roll, spicy tuna roll, yellow tail, albacore, salmon and tamago for our son. Once again, the soft shell crab was a big disappointment, the tempura was not good, but the sushi again was good. We get our check, and 10 minutes later, no one has picked up our payment so I got up and handed it to another server. Today, I give it a two star rating. It seems like the place is self destructing each and every time we eat there. Never again will we go back to Nakama. We went back there the second time because our first experience was great. We went there a third and fourth time so that we can confirm that that is one place we will never spend money on ever again."}
{"text":"The best sushi in town!!!!  Fresh wasabi, service, sushi, salmon sashimi all amazing!!!  Responsibly priced!  Green tea shot while you wait for a to go order.   Have been here several times and every time it's fresh and outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find among the collage of restaurants and shop in this shopping district.  After driving past it twice, my daughter spotted it and we went in.  I love the price of the Happy Hour food and Beverage items.  California Roll for $4?  Yes!!  We ordered two but only needed one.  They were huge!  Great value.  We ordered up a nice bottle of wine and it was priced reasonable for a restaurant.  The food was all fresh and delicious.  They have some American items on the menu as well for the picky eaters.  My son had the very Japanese dish of Chicken Strips and Fries.  Our server was attentive and laid back.  We're usually fast, in and out diners.  His laid back pace helped us relax and enjoy the meal.  We weren't in a hurry so why not?!?  It's a great fusion restaurant that would appeal to almost everybody.  Go and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"We were greeted by our waiter Christian who provided excellent service! Complementary miso soup, happy hour on Sunday a plus! Our rolls were fresh and delicious. I'll be back next time I am in town for sure!"}
{"text":"Generally I like this place. The service is great and friendly and the drinks are fairly priced. The sushi can be a bit expensive, but if you go during their super short happy hour you catch a break.  The pepper on the edamame is really different and good.  One complaint their happy hour is too short. Considering Goodyear is not some large corporate center, a lot of people have a decent commute home. So a 4-7 would be better. I'd come more often.  Also nice is they will help to customize your roll and their fish is much fresher than other places.  And to the reviewer who commented that no Asians in a sushi restaurant means it's automatically bad is kind of racist and not very helpful. I would also assume you'd skip a doughnut shop because there were no cops there?  Besides, this area is not exactly high on the Asian demographic."}
{"text":"I ordered Yellow Belly and they served me Yellow Tail. They insisted it was Yellow Belly and it OBVIOUSLY was not. Anyone who has ever had Yellow Belly would see the difference immediately.  But they argued it with us anyway. For the record, my wife and I were very polite about this.  Then.......we were approached and asked (in a tough guy voice) \"Is there a problem?\" There was no greeting, no introduction. Just a tough guy \"Is there a problem.\"  Not sure if it was the owner or not. Doesn't really matter.  The stories about how they cut their own sushi and yadda, yadda, yadda don't cut it. This place tried to scam us, got caught and then played us off like we were idiots who could be intimidated.   We were given a miniscule discount, for the record. However, we will never go back.  We are better than your lousy restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent. Been coming here for about 2 years now and I eat here at least twice a week with my dad, we are regulars here. I usually come during the afternoons as to avoid any weekend rush at night because the bar is popular. BEST Veggie Rolls I have had anywhere, not only vegetarian but if you get them without cream cheese they are VEGAN safe as well, I love them because they are not huge saucers they are an actual ROLL. Their complementary soup and salad are awesome and they make an excellent Arnold Palmer. Service is always on point and they treat us well here. Not to mention $3 Sierra Nevada pints.. ALL day.. EVERY day.. Doesn't get any better than Nakama when you want a nice decent prices lunch!"}
{"text":"Been going bear for years and now once they start to get a good following their food cost stays the same but the portion size has decreased in half! Sad to say every single entire and appetizer was a fraction of the size. Still tastes good but for the cost go in town."}
{"text":"Average sushi, poor fusion, inattentive service  Tried Nakama as it's close by and looked like a fun Asian-fusion place. We had some sushi, the curry dish, a Thai platter, and fried rice (for our daughter).  The dishes were sweet and were missing traditional Asian flavors and spices.  And by sweet, I mean disturbingly so.  Like the kind of sweet that makes you grimace.  The service gal was nice, but very slow. And she and another service gal were confused who had our table multiple times.    The sushi was good enough for Arizona-- tasty, well-presented, and tasted fresh.  The fried rice was also par for the course.  We waited a good amount of time between refills on drinks, check-in on food quality, and finally the check.  On the latter, we sat for about 15 minutes until someone came by we could flag down to ask for the honor of paying.  Again, they are nice, but inattentive."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant. I eat here at least twice a month and I love the service and the food. All the waiters are very friendly. I love happy hour too, the specials are great. If you are looking for great sushi at a great price I highly recommend Nakama."}
{"text":"This place while quiet... was loud! Loud with flavor. Our waiter, Jason.. was THE cutest thing evah! He was so extremely helpful with all of our questions. We had sushi, sashimi, deeelish black pepper edamame. A \"tad\" spendy, but I would eat there again and again. For the food and the service! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I like to sit at the bar and watch the food that is being prepared. The chefs are always very friendly and if you catch them during a slow hour, they will even show and explain how the rolls are made. I like coming here because they have great customer service and a polite staff.  The sushi here is also very good. I love trying new rolls. I would have to say my two favorite spicy rolls would be the Sunburst Roll and the Poison Ivy Roll. The Sunburst has octopus on it with small slices of lemon. You would think that having the octopus slices would make this roll too chewy, but you would be wrong! Trust me, I was hesitant about the octopus at first but don't let it turn you away, you would be missing out!!The Poison Ivy roll has a cream cheese/ jalapeno spread that's baked on top, which in my opinion is why its so good!   I would definitely recommend this place for all those sushi enthusiasts!"}
{"text":"Came in for some sushi and was pleasantly surprised how good everything was. The portions were large and our server was excellent."}
{"text":"Loved it! Tommy was a doll! Great food and relaxing atmosphere. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I used to go here about once a week, but it's become less and less and maybe no more because their service is terrible!!!  While the sushi is good, prices are good, and portions are big, the service is totally turning us off.  There have been countless times where a waitress has asked us to pay our bill so she can go home.  There have been countless times when the service was extremely slow.  AND, there have been countless times where they are practically pushing us out the door (by putting ALL the chairs up on the tables) and it's only about 9:00!!!  It's disappointing because we like the place, but the service is continually bad."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since opening, and love the trendy atmosphere!   It's my favorite local spot to hit up for my sushi and sake fix. They've got a great happy hour and I LOVE their Saketinis! If you are a fan of flavored vodka martinis,  but they're a lil too strong tasting for you, try a saketini. They've got several flavors, and they pack a punch without the throat burning sensation of vodka! NO pucker face after a couple s-tini'z! And if you're not a drinke r,  the Iced Green Tea is tasty! My  choice hot roll is the Lotus roll which is soooo yummy!!! while my go-to favorites will always be the Vegas Roll, and Marilyn Monroll (no soy sauce, ginger, or wasabi needed!) Plus+Same managers every time I visit! ++ Ask for Tommy- he's a great server!  YELP check in offer: free Edamame!"}
{"text":"Sushi was very tasty and all the food was fresh. Service on the otherhand was non existent.  We waited over 45min for our first sushi roll. Our server didnt seem to care about out dining experience, just dropping the food, check and hoping for a tip."}
{"text":"Went again and my husband got food poisoned by the sushi. He ordered 3 hand rolls and not long after started feeling bad. He ended being sick for 2 days. We will never return."}
{"text":"all I can say is go early, this place locks the doors at 9 PM.  The menu is large, the food is pretty good. Everyone was very friendly that I can say.  I would go back just for the people."}
{"text":"Wonderful happy hour specials if you don't mind there not being any Asians in here. There was a lot of pepper on the Edameme but the price and the quality of the sushi was well within comparison."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Really like the stuffed mushroom appetizer too.  We always buy too much lol. Service is great n very polite.  The music is really good n its not too loud so you can actually have a conversation with your date.  Awesome place to eat."}
{"text":"Yummmm! Im a regular and sometimes forget to check in but a great app in the stuffed mushrooms or the monkey brains! Wings are great too but if you like them fried just a heads up these are not."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday at 5PM. The bar tender was also my waiter and he was superb and very attentive. I order Red Snapper and salmon nigiris, salmon rolls, stuffed mushroom, calamari. I enjoyed the sushi! The stuffed mushroom was pretty good and much bigger than I thought. (Even my picture of it doesn't seem like it shows it's true size.) stuffed mushrooms and the calamari I was alright. My friend ordered a steak plate and I tried a piece, but it felt like the steak was tough and over cooked. Overall it was a decent experience at Nakama. As my dinner hit peak hours, service was still great!"}
{"text":"Javier and I went here on Saturday night, the place was dead. Only 2 other tables and one of them were regulars. We ordered 2 different sushi rolls, the soy sexy roll, which consists of  Tempura Shrimp, Crab, Spicy Tuna, Avocado, Cucumber / Soy Paper, Orange Sauce, Eel Sauce. I ordered this because it's very similar to a roll I love at blue wasabi called \"me soy horny\". Javier got the Las Vegas rolls ( he gets this one every time) it consists of Salmon, Avocado, Crab, Cream Cheese, Rice / Tempura Fried, Eel Sauce. This one was good as well, one of the better Las Vegas rolls I have had. The pieces were HUGE, this made it a lil difficult to eat without it falling apart. We were full off the two rolls, it was the perfect amount. I took a look at the happy hour prices, they weren't too great. The Las Vegas roll is $7.00 regular 10.00, and they didn't have my roll as part of happy hour. My only complaint is I wish the place was more live. I'm used to eating sushi at places like blue wasabi or Ra where it is always packed and playing good music. I will return to this place despite the atmosphere just because the rolls were so good."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch today. We arrived just after they opened and I think we were the first ones there. The place is nicely decorated and the service was good. We ordered Edamame to start. It took quite a while for it to come out and when it did it did not seem to be cooked all the way. I also went with the salt and pepper option but I think I would leave the pepper off if I ordered it again. We ordered and split a couple rolls. The crunchy & Las Vegas roll. I didn't care for the Las Vegas roll but I am not a huge Salmon fan, but my son liked them both. The food was ok but the place I normally go is just as good and cheaper and that's probably where I will go in the future."}
{"text":"Favorite place for sushi. I always come back for Marilyn mon roe. Staff is super nice and friendly. Service on point. I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"I don't really write reviews however I must say I was very satisfied with the service I received at this location. The waiter \"Tommy M\" was very attentive and polite and the sushi was adequate to satisfy my hunger. I am not a sushi connoisseur however the meal was still satisfying based on past experiences. The environment was adequate for family outing. I would come back again."}
{"text":"I will never come back. $20 for two avocado rolls and a vegetable roll during lunch. The avocado looked terrible with brown spots. The rolls were so tiny. So not worth it."}
{"text":"Good happy hour.  Food is average.  Hispanic owner/chef.  Yeah, not very authentic but not bad."}
{"text":"My hubby and I LOVE Sushi. We have been all over the valley and we have our favorites. This place is definitely NOT our favorite. Wont be coming back. Prices are too high for quality. Came for Happy Hour and Their menu for it sucks. They have like 5 rolls no one wants on it. Too much rice on rolls. Rolls are loose and fall apart easy. And overall taste of the sushi was EH. Paid $44 for 2 people on HH. Tomo near by is much better!!"}
{"text":"Bleh. Went for lunch today, and was not impressed with the quality of the food. Nice atmosphere, and the service was good, but the sushi was not. The rolls were bland and all tasted the same, with the exception of the tempura yellow tail roll that tasted exactly like tuna noodle casserole in a sushi wrapper. Not exactly what I was hoping for. I know good sushi is hard to come by in this area, but this was just not good at all."}
{"text":"Just had the BEST Happy Hour!! Great Prices - Great Food - Great service!!! We had 2 martinis ($5 each!!!) and some great Food. Tempura was terrific - sushi was great (salmon skin roll - amazing) The service could NOT have been better.   HIGHLY recommended! I think the Happy Hour is daily (Sun-Thurs 3- close- 3-6 and 8 til close Sat & Sun) Don't miss it - Great fun"}
{"text":"The service was ok but me and the wife went there for the sushi, not the drinks or to chit chat with friends. Unfortunately we didn't pay attention to the yelp reviews that spoke poorly of their sushi since the place has such high reviews. Well the sushi was lame, they were tasteless and pricey and they added way too much rice to their rolls. It could have just been the cook that was there at that particular time but seeing as to how my wife ended up throwing up I don't think we'll be going back a second time."}
{"text":"Ordered too much thinking like some of the sushi restaurants I've gone to would serve small portions. Good food, good portions and not stingy on the rice."}
{"text":"I need to explain the rating on this one. I am a regular at this place as we live close and find it superior to most other restaurants of this type in the area. I have always had decent service and great food... On Mother's Day, I had returned from a trip to L.A. and my wife wanted one thing for Mother's Day...NAKAMA. We went and they were not busy (as in most cases) and we sat down to order. I have a Passport Card, and usually get two-for-one items which keep the price down nicely. There was no happy hour as it was Mother's Day, and I guess I can live with that. I also had a check-in reward for a free edamame from Yelp. We were promptly informed that \"because of our Mothers Day Special, we cannot honor the Passport card tonight\". I asked about the special and it was a $30 plate that would probably have cost less ordered any other day. I decided we would deal with it and asked for our edamame to get started. We were told \"we are not honoring that tonight\". At that point, I was frustrated and a bit tired from a long trip and got up to leave. On the way out, the manager said \"I don't want to let you guys walk out of here unhappy...Nobody honors specials on Mother's Day\". I replied \"I will bet Tomo does\" and we paid for the Diet Coke and left. We had a great meal at a nearby mexican restaurant and all is well. All that being said, I love this place. The food is always good, but the fact that something so stupid as a free $4 appetizer was not covered for regular customers is somewhat unsettling to me. Maybe it is that I am whining about a free appetizer, but my point is that you just cannot find REALLY good customer service as readily anymore. The manager said he recognized us and STILL refused to even consider doing us a small favor in return for our repeat business. Not letting us walk out would have gone a LONG way. Will we return?? Absolutely. But I might not be as quick to recommend NAKAMA to friends as I have done so often in the past."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Their Crunch Eel, Las Vegas Roll, and Popcorn Roll are AMAZING!  They are even willing to make some of my rolls with soy paper and no rice which is awesome for me!  They have some killer spicy tuna that really hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The food is amazing and from 3pm to close their happy hour is priced extremely well. The New York roll is my favorite. I also like the spicy Kirin and rainbow roll too. The tempura jalapeño and shrimp appetizer is the best I've ever had. I go almost every week. If you're a sushi lover on a budget Tokomo is a must. My only complaint is they need more servers. If they are busy you will wait about 30 minutes to get your food"}
{"text":"I have been going here since it opened. The only decent sushi in the SW Valley. Good service"}
{"text":"I have come back to this place multiple times and I have always received great service and the food is amazing. Sake bombs are great too for the price.  Love the atmosphere here. This time we tried two desserts, the white chocolate stuffed banana with vanilla ice cream and their tempura cheesecake.  Both were deep fried, drizzled with chocolate sauce and plenty of whip cream to share for 4. Their monkey brains is a must have and I recommend their Jalapeño roll and Las Vegas roll too. The yokesoba noodles is fantastic."}
{"text":"My husband and I usually go to Tomo  Sushi, across the parking lot from here but they don't have happy hour on Sundays so we decided to check out Nakama instead.   We were disappointed. The service was decent but the sushi was just not that good. The cali rolls were too mayonnaisey. The tuna rolls tasted off and the yellowtail rolls were very dry. The Miso was good though.   The decor also looks very cheap and the floors are FILTHY. I don't think they ever clean them.   I just don't get how they can stay in business with a place as amazing as Tomo not 500 feet away."}
{"text":"We used to come here all the time for the atmosphere and good food, but the last few times the customer service has been HORRIBLE the food hasn't been all that either. They have gotten orders wrong and then are rude about it, offer a credit and when you try to redeem it they tell you someone's already used it, WTH! I ordered a take out order was quoted 45 minutes and got there exactly 45 minutes later and still waited 30 minutes only to be told that they were BARELY making my order because a large group had showed up AFTER I placed my order and they decided to put the big groups food in first. I asked for a refund and left. We will not be returning! So upsetting idk what happened to this place."}
{"text":"Place is good but it's hard to compete with Tomo next doorish... Owned by a Latin couple so a bit not as Asian with the sushi. But incredible mixed drinks and happy hour."}
{"text":"I belong to a \"Sushi Lovers Group\" and we travel to sushi restaurants all over the valley. Nakama is a favorite with the group and we visit as a group at least once a month. Fantastic food, a great Happy Hour, and the service (even with a large group) is always top notch. Highly Recommended!   http://www.meetup.com/sushilicious"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner with a few out of town guests. We walked in with a party of 10 and Nakama had no problems getting us seated quickly. I started with edamame (free with Yelp check-in), continued with vegas rolls and several sashimi pieces and finished with sake! The service was great, especially considering our party size and the food was fantastic! My wife and I will be back every time we get that craving for quality sushi! Thank you Nakama."}
