{"text":"I've been a Safeway shopper for years. This is by far the worst location I've visited. The selection is lacking, the prices are high, and the customer service is terrible. If you must visit, self check. The cashiers are unfriendly and seem inconvenienced. On several occasions I've approached this store to smell and see Safeway employees smoking within close proximity to the front door. It's tacky and unappealing."}
{"text":"Slow at the register. No self checkout lanes. Rotisserie chickens are NOT fully cooked. A lot of their products are past the expiration date and their deli is a ghost town.
The only good thing about this store is they have a Starbucks!"}
{"text":"This is a nice Safeway location. When I shop with my two young children the staff are helpful and engaging to them. Produce, meat and dairy selections are all plentiful!!
Avoid Sunday morning shopping as there is typically only one cashier on (the same one all the time) and she isn't the sharpest tool in the shed. She will make your checkout experience painfully slow."}
{"text":"Under staffed at peak hours, don't ever go between 4-7pm. Understocked, they barely have green beans ever, last time I was there no lemons, corn is always bad. The bakery is good as is the butcher but they're usually closed when I have time to get there. Then it's all off limits."}
{"text":"Love love love this location!   It's so clean and the staff is eager to lend a hand or answer any questions. I typically shop at Wal-Mart but. I'll go out of my way to stop in here and do my shopping. Check out is always fast and friendly. Defnirely a neighborhood grocer (:"}
{"text":"One Safeway store to the next is pretty similar. They generally follow the same template in terms of shelf and store layouts. \"Safeway branded\" items are standardized, even between the U.S. and Canada. 

Usually. the stores execute a centralized plan. And the plan flows outwards from California. 

There are positives and negatives to this, I guess. In some ways, it's like McDonald's: you know what you are getting before you walk in. In other ways, though, it lacks flexibility to take advantage of unique locations. 

I need only compare this Safeway store to the Co-op down the street to highlight that it could really benefit from some creativity, simply because of its location. 

For example, there are a lot of downtown office workers who like quick, convenient, lunch choices... with variety. This store doesn't try to meet that need more than any other location, which is too bad. I'd pop in over lunch more frequently if they did. 

But I digress. 

I DID swing by to grab something QUICKLY for lunch (mostly because there is a Starbucks in house... so 2 birds with one stone...). The grab and go counter was my target. 

Disappointing, I must say. 

Things like prepared salads are truly minuscule, portion-wise, for the price. Especially compared to, say, a nearby Sunterra option. 

But I did note the packaging of said salads is the same as what I'd see in Montana, so again \"one strategy for all.\" 

I ended up grabbing a sandwich... (which I later discovered, back at the office, must have been sitting in the deli counter for quite some time. The lettuce was already half-rotting and turning black inside. Rotate them, much?) 

And the checkouts.... they really did turn my \"grab a quick lunch\" into a much longer procedure. The express and self checkout lines were substantial. 

Which brings me to this aside: Superstore makes an effort with the self-checkouts to assist those who aren't that bright. They put a big sticker on the floor that indicates \"form one line starting here and wait for the next available register.\" 

Safeway is kind of a free-for-all. Sometimes people form two lines at the self checkouts, so it's not \"take the first available register,\" its \"get stuck in the slow line and watch the other zip through.\" 

Or, other times, people start lining up so far back (like in the aisle at this location) that others don't even KNOW there is a lineup. So then you get to watch the ongoing \"uhh... EXCUSE me!! there is a lineup back here!!!\" 

I maintain that if you don't know how to form a line, you probably shouldn't be using self-checkout."}
{"text":"Came here to buy lunch and 2 bottles of nice wine. To get turned down. I had the official MVD ID paper you get while your is in the mail and my vertical ID that says I turned 21 months ago and they would not sell me the wine. I went to Walgreens after where they actually tried to scan the official MVD paper which scanned and I was able to go about my day and have a wonderful one. Just moved to this area and would rather drive a farther distance to a grocery store than come here. The customer service was terrible. She automatically assumed I didn't want the food I had walked around the store for 30 minutes for. Ended up having the get my lunch somewhere else."}
{"text":"The woman who works in the deli is horrible. I made sure this time to look at her name tag and her name is Jenny.  She saw me walk up, made eye contact, then walked to the back.  She came back out and said, \"do you know what you want?\" She is incredibly rude and had absolutely no personality.  I am in the customer service business as well and work with the public all day long, so I understand sometimes it can be frustrating, however that does NOT mean I am rude to ANY of my customers and I expect that same level of respect from other businesses. I will NEVER buy anything from that deli again, and will tell all my co-workers to stop supporting safeway deli as well until they learn to hire/train their employees to treat customers properly."}
{"text":"This Safeway has a great meat counter and friendly enough butchers who know what they're doing and are willing to help you find what you need.
They also seem to have a better than average flower selection and at cheaper prices. But that's the only thing that's cheap about Safeway. The food prices seem to vary, sometimes more than other places, sometimes less.
Overall, the meat department makes visiting this Safeway worth it. Great selection...."}
{"text":"this is the review of starbucks not safeway. i love the grocery store with exceptions of some very unfriendly workers.

the starbucks is soooo bad. i always always always recieve an eye roll or attitude from the barista. its so disrespectful representing starbucks like that. once i asked for my recipt amd the barista was so unhelpful it was ridiculous. they cant even heat up any pastries. i will only go here for an iced latte but even then i really dont like the attitude.

very bad."}
{"text":"This is not my regular Safeway, but I needed food, and I knew they would have some. I found it was super busy for a Wednesday night at around 630. Not normal for me being in a quiet NW area which never gets really busy. I had to wait in line (an express line as well) for at least 15 minutes. And the self check outs were just as long as a wait. 

Like I had mentioned, this is not in my neighbourhood and was just passing by and needed dinner, so it wasn't bad, just too busy for my liking."}
{"text":"Compared to Frys this place is awful. I don't know if other Safeways are like this but I don't wanna find out from what I experience here. The store looks bleak after being remodeled. And the employees got worse. The ones I've dealt with lately seem to be annoyed and irritable. One person at Customer Service counter named Jessica (on receipt) usually has an attitude and looks harassed. There's another scary old guy with graying hair that only acts nice towards older shoppers. Sure that's fine, but he's not as accommodating if you look under 30. The only person in any grocery store I've shopped at within AZ that acts this frigid. I heard him tell a little 18 year old girl she could't bring her tiny puppy inside (huddled inside a bag) just because it bothered him. Nobody that's shopping I know ever cares about that. I'm sire a 50 year old would've gotten a pass from him. Some of the most horrible service since dealing with my car dealership and that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"Great store. Civilized clientele, cashiers great though deli staff is comatose.
Reason for the bad rating? Long waits in line, express line not always open and
the self-serve check out frequently requires assistance."}
{"text":"Some of the staff here suck. Zero personality, and even less of a grasp on the english language. Prices aren't much better than co-op or sobeys, but the latter 2 have better service."}
{"text":"This store is horrible since Ben has taken over managing duties!!  Deli is filthy!  I've complained numerous times only to be told by Ben that he just inspected it and it was fine!!  Also checkout is always 20-25 minutes since they got rid of self checkout!! Plus I have to bag my own groceries 90% of the time.  Just terrible!  I suggest going to Fry's or A.J.'s and say a big NO to this store!!!"}
{"text":"DOWNTOWN CALGARY SAFEWAY:
Least helpful staff, some long time (union I suspect) employees are abrupt, impatient, rude, short, and even smirk at guests paying to come here..
Least stocked shelves after 8pm(when I shop after work)
Longest waits,
And its the most expensive in the Beltline.

After tonite's unhelpful service and lack of problem solving attitude from the self serve check out staff, I've decided to stop beating my head against the wall and start shopping at the Midtown Co-op. I suggest everyone downtown do the same!!"}

{"text":"You guys are GR8 & u really try.  (Luv the new decor & renovations, btw).  I am sorry,  I cannot recall everyone's name, but Scott in Wine & Liquors always so bery helpful.

Gary in Meat  never misses an opportunity to shout to customers (from behind the meat counter) HOW ARE YOU! can I help with anything?!  They guys in produce, the check-out, the baggers. (Did I mention other staff members find & seek you, ask if you need anything, and when you do will actually WALK you to what you are looking for? ie: marshmellows, they r hard to find!! so they don't just go, \"o asile 15, or possibly 13... last i ch'd\")   I will have to make a mental note & recall specific names to re-write this review & give thanks to those specifiaclly deserving.   

BTW, no one has dry ice - these guys do!! (very handy for fun, martinis, pool parties :-)"}
{"text":"Do not come here if you want to be out quick. Always 1 person in cash out and if you're lucky maybe two. Otherwise you will be spending 15 minutes just waiting to cash out. Absolutely ridiculous for such a large store."}
{"text":"I shop at Safeway and at this one in particular because its the closest Safeway from home. Some people prefer going to the Co-op nearby, but I'm a Safeway fan.

How can you control long line ups? I don't know since I'm no grocery line up engineer, but I wish they could find a way to improve the efficiency when its really busy! haha but then, this place would never be busy and how fun would that be?!

I'd prefer it not to be busy, but its just part of the shopping experience here.

Apart from that, this Safeway is A.O.K. in my books. Its clean, their staff are friendly and are very helpful. I don't know everything and its good to know there's people that work somewhere that will help you. Once time, I went here on a Wednesday night and was looking for a presliced loaf of sourdough bread for my sandwiches. They didn't have any left, so I asked someone if they had any presliced ones. The lights in the bakery were already shut off, but she told me to give her a minute. When she came back a moment later and had one freshly sliced for me :) yay! People appreciate little things like that and I certainly did.

Thanks Safeway on 8th & 11th! keep up the great work :)"}
{"text":"Close to home , good for picking up items you need quickly. The organic veggie section is terrible , and the international food section ( Asian / Indian / etc ) is sad. Seems like less selection than other safeways. The organic milk is awful , enough that we now order from spud.ca for milk and veggies."}
{"text":"I like this location much more than the \"ghetto\" one near my house. Maybe it's nostalgia, as this was the first Safeway I every experienced, when I first moved to Calgary. Maybe because its cleaner and better merchandised. I don't know. I just know I get excited when I know I need a few things and I happen to be downtown.

What I like: 
Their produce seems better, fresher and more organized
They carry higher end items than my Safeway...things that are a little more diverse
The clientele seems better (props to the seniors who shop very dressed up at this location). 
The cashiers are more efficient and friendlier
Their \"to go\" deli etc is well run and stocked
It is way less crazy on a Saturday than my usual one
It has a Starbucks

What I don't like:
The security guards. First of all, they often seem to be on one set of doors only. (Good luck with that - I think shoplifters may be able to outsmart that tactic). I know why they are there but it is a bit off putting to be sized up as I walk in
The parking lot: Always seems to be a bit of a madhouse, weekday or weekend.

As Safeways go, this is one of my faves."}
{"text":"I generally visit this Safeway only for the pharmacy, and the occasional item I need quickly (I generally find Safeway's prices on the high side).  I have used this pharmacy on a regular basis, for over 5 years, and service has generally been excellent.  Staff changes in the past few months, though, have brought in a bunch of employees who have poor organizational skills, and no customer relations skills.  As an example, I stopped by, today, to have them fill a prescription; then went over to Chinook, picked up a number of things, and returned.  When I got to the line-up at the pharmacy counter, there were only 2 people in front of me.  I waited for about 10 minutes, while they searched for the prescription of the customer in front of me, didn't find it, and filled it for her.  Then, I got to the counter.  The pharmacist said \"ah.  You were just here.\"  When I told her that that had been well over half an hour previously, she said \"no.  You are wrong. It hasn't been that long, and we haven't filled it.\"  I explained what I had done, in the meantime, and was again told that I was wrong, and that it hadn't been filled.  She shuffled through a few piles of apparently randomly-stacked baskets, to find my order, and filled it while I waited; but if this is the new trend in customer service, then I'll be finding another pharmacy."}
{"text":"Great quality grocery store.

It's always clean and tidy, never messy floors even in the winter. On big occasions (Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc) It is very busy, but usually I can get around and get what I need easily and enjoyably. 

Staff are always very friendly and helpful. They even have the self-check out machines that I usually use when I am buying a few items, which makes the process quicker.

There is also a wide selection of gift cards to purchase, as well as you are able to buy event tickets and  transit ticket/passes there at customer service.

I only took off 1 star because having an allergy to wheat and flour, I need to buy gluten-free products. They have a small freezer filled with a few different types of bread and muffins, but thats it. I often have to visit other grocery stores to buy my gluten free products.

But this Safeway is great, always my first choice!"}
{"text":"Bought dinner here at the deli. Choose to purchase the greek salad and chicken wings. Greek salad was $1.79/100 g and the chicken wings were $1.99/100 g. The salad was very good, but they got carried away with the Greek salad dressing. The salad itself was satisfying with big chunks of feta. The chicken wings were ok. Not the best I've tasted. However at $6 for 300 g, I'll take those salt and pepper wings and satisfied my craving for protein.

I really love the self check out. The speed at which I can do my own servicing almost makes me not mind that I am adding to Safeway's profits."}
{"text":"Friendly employees and a great selection of products. Ex: I bought a bag of all natural sweet potato chips here for about a dollar less than Whole Foods. I looked for the same chips at another Safeway and they didn't have it! My husband also finds great deals on meat here. I'll send him to Safeway to get one thing and he comes back with two full bags of meat and the excuse \"but babe, it was 50% off!\" I also LOVE the Pub sandwich from the deli. Downside: not open 24 hours, but I still don't know of any in Arizona that are..."}
{"text":"It's a grocery store! A decent one at that. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"ROTTEN MEAT ALERT!!!!

I ran into this store on 2/16/17 ONLY because it is across the street from my business and I was running late to get dinner started after a long day. (I normally shop at Fry's or Whole Foods) I grabbed a pack of boneless, skinless chicken thighs & a container of supposedly fresh fruit pieces & headed to the cashier. When I put the fruit on the counter, the lid popped off exposing the \"fresh fruit\". I asked the cashier if the container was supposed to be sealed (like most containers containing anything fresh).The cashier looked at me, shrugged his shoulders & said \"I don't know\" in the most annoyed, nonchalant manner possible.  So I say, \" Oh right, you just work here huh?! He says, \"yep, I just scan the items\". Ok fine, this is customer service in today's world whatever, so annoying. I grab my bags & leave. I get home, started to make dinner, opened the meat & it's the most foul, disgusting, ratchet smelling pack of meat I have EVER smelled in my 50 years!! Now, I'm really annoyed. I check the expiration date and its dated 2/8/17, current date was 2/16/17! I call the store to speak with someone in the meat dept. it rings and immediately disconnects. This happens three times, so I try for general customer service, gets disconnected again. Finally, I try the bakery dept. & someone answers. I ask for the store mgr. so they transfer me & I get the \"closing mgr.\" I tell him about the meat (very calmly may I add) he says very lackadaisically \"well, just bring it back & get another pack. No \"I'm sorry that happened,\" I'll make sure the meat dept. checks this out, we pride ourselves on carrying the freshest meats & produce available, we'll work hard to make sure this doesn't happen again, nothing! So I said \"well you might want to tell the meat dept. to check the chicken so they can pull all the outdated packages so no one else buys week old rotten meat\" and I get \"Oh, yeah..I'll do that\". Finally, I tell him about the top popping off the fresh fruit & the cashier's response and he literally says \"hum\" and then silence. By then I knew I was wasting my time with these idiots and ended the call with never mind, I see you don't give a crap about any of this so I'll just write a review to let the public know. Maybe they will care about buying rotten meat & getting horrible customer service! \"Hum\" 
I would give them -00 stars if it were an option! Will never step foot in that or any Safeway again."}
{"text":"Terrible location.  Rude staff. I'm sorry. If the saying \"The customer is always right\" still stands, the staff at this location has clearly never heard the saying. 
I went in on my lunch break at 11am today and was floored that a store that is in a mall, with businesses surrounding it doesn't have a hot deli that is 100% stocked at 11am.  Completely unacceptable.  The food court vendors have full trays of food at 11am. Why is it so hard to follow suit? I walked by the counter and asked when the rest of the product would be ready to be told \"when it's out\" by a totally disinterested deli clerk. I'm sorry. When did that become the standard for Safeway? I asked if there would be chicken tenders out soon and wasn't even given a response. The clerk simply walked away.  I did the same. Went to the food court. Got food, ate and went back through Safeway about 35 minutes later and the hot counter had maybe 2 more items filled. Way to go Safeway. Way to lower everyone's expectations."}
{"text":"Ugh. Time to start going to Co-op.  Awful awful experience today at Safeway. Was at the deli and asked for 100 grams of ham. The deli clerk went about getting it and I looked at the cheese selection. I got my ham and went about my shopping. When I went to the self checkout to pay my ham came to over 6 dollars. I looked at the bag which had about 120 grams or so of ham but a sticker clearly stating that there was over 330 grams of product in the bag. I waved over the clerk Susan, who was watching the self checkouts and asked if she saw anything unusual with the bag of ham. Her response with out blinking an eye was \"Well obviously you got hungry while you were shopping. You know that's shoplifting, right?\" I stood there rather shocked and she just kept going on and on about how she was sick of people doing that in her store and how I should be ashamed of myself. I asked to speak to a manager and she flat out told me to pay for my merchandise and never come in again. Glad to know that Safeway employees can make those decisions without consulting management. And for the record,  I'm almost certain had I been paying attention the woman in the deli would have been busted leaning on the scale. Fail Safeway. Big fail."}
{"text":"Great location for a Safeway! The self check-out systems are always the first to be updated out of all the Safeways in the city and this is be only Safeway where the customers actually know how to line up for the self check-out and the Starbucks so that the main walkway is always clear!!!

They are open until 11pm, but they lock the right doors at 9pm. The store also has a RedBox machine and an atm. If you want to save time do your shopping during the week and avoid this place on Sunday evenings!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to shop at, the only downside is that the store isn't a 24-hour store.  They have a lot of alcoholic beverages and usually have a great price for it.  I only come here when they have a lot of dairy/deli products for sale.  Good place, but I still prefer Fry's any day over Safeway."}
{"text":"The only reason why I frequented the store is because of it's proximity to my home. There are approximately five employees that I have seen working, and out of the 5, 2 are the only helpful in the store.  

The checkout woman, who I will not name, has repeatedly gone out of her way to make my experiences there completely terrible.  She is rude, condescending and takes \"Power trip\" to a whole new level.  The managers are helpful, especially Keith.  

If this store wants to stay in business, corporate needs to read the reviews and make a CHANGE.  *First Yelp review- that's how bad the employee is who shall remain unnamed*"}
{"text":"You already know my obsession with grocery stores, and you also know how much I especially love grocery stores that are surrounded by other opportunities to shop. So when a grocery store is located INSIDE a mall, you know I'm gonna give it mad props.

Located inside North Hill Mall, this particular Safeway bodes exceptional customer service, convenient parking, easy access for those who do not drive (Lion's Park C-Train stop), a Starbucks inside and convenient shopping hours. Plus did I mention it's located inside a mall?!?!?

Get your groceries bought, your bills paid (Roger's Wireless is inside the mall, as are a couple of banks), and add the finishing touch to your latest outfit by picking up a hot new accessory. One stop, hella shop!"}
{"text":"While I shop at the Farmer's Market for most of my fruits, vegetables, and meats--sometimes only the Safeway will do for Triscuits and the like--and thank heavens I live precious blocks away from a good one.
Besides having some of the finest Chunky Cheese Bread that ever rose in an oven, these guys offer the savvy Airmiles collector boundless opportunities to rack up miles on things that are otherwise painfully mundane (like toilet paper, or laundry detergent).  They also have some boutique items--like Devon cream (which I needed for Steak Diane the other night) and kosher salt.  
Don't expect to save enough $ to put your kids through college--like all grocery stores in Calgary, the essential act of eating costs big bucks; but do enjoy Safeway member savings, Airmiles, and the allure of this particular location's reputation as \"Singles Safeway\".
Happy hunting. . . I mean, shopping."}
{"text":"You know what's convenient? Spending a day shopping at the mall, only to realize that you need to pick up a couple of groceries and finding out that the mall you're already in actually HAS a grocery store inside of it!

This was my recent experience at Market Mall. 

The LAST thing I wanted to do was make an extra trip over to the grocery store after I had just finished spending hours in the mall. So lucky for me, I discovered the Safeway that is inside Market Mall. Ingenious I tell you!

It's got all the glory of a grocery store, but it's inside a mall. You can swing by on your way out of the mall, grab the couple things you need, and head straight home!

It was the perfect ending to my shopping spree :)

Here's to getting all your shopping done in one place. Huzzah!"}
{"text":"So you already know how much I love traipsing around grocery stores. Yes, I have my favourites in the city, but every now and then, I like to explore other grocery stores just to confirm the fact that my favourite grocery stores are my favourite grocery stores for a reason. 

When it comes to this particular Safeway, you know, the one in Kensington right off of the Sunnyside C-Train stop, it's definitely not my favourite. Its location is amazingly convenient, but the store itself isn't all that. 

Yes, it is a pretty standard Safeway, but it just doesn't excel in any way. 

It doesn't blow me away like a few of the other grocery stores in town. 

Yes I stopped over because I needed some groceries on my way into downtown and yes I was absolutely delighted at how convenient it was to hop off the train and hop back on with bags and bags of groceries, but overall, I wouldn't do it again. If it means I have to walk a few extra blocks to get to the store that I love, you'd better believe that next time, I'll be taking the walk."}

{"text":"This Safeway in Marda Loop seems to be a slightly smaller version of other Safeways throughout the city. We often come by here on the way home, and find that sometimes we can't find what we are looking for. They seem to be on top of things though, with lots of fresh produce, shelves well stocked, and not much in the way of lineups."}
{"text":"I love this store. I am on a first name basis with almost the entire staff. They are always happy and helpful reflecting good management. 

They always have stocked and organized shelves. My only complaint is that the butcher area is too small. That being said, if there is something you need the butcher can usually find it in the back."}
{"text":"Here goes... I live pretty close and have lots of good choices around for grocers... (Frys, Sprouts etc..) I would say this is the worst of the lot.  Store is small, scant, and not a great selection of groceries or produce.   In a pinch I feel like I've gone and been disappointed each time. 

I've tried there prepared food for the last time.  Tried some chicken fingers for the kids, got home and they were literally inedible.  I heated them up for the kids, and they were literally like chicken Jerky.  Almost like instead of throwing out old food, they just keep refrying it until someone buys it.  I thought maybe I over heated them.. but they were all the same, cold.  Next experience was the meatballs.. OMG I didn't get down a bite before pitching the lot.    I did have the rotisserie chicken which was undercooked if you can imagine.  Produce, do they know Sprouts and Frys are literally across the street or within a mile.. everything just looks dated.

Place is always empty, and i'm pretty sure this is why...  Lots of great alternatives in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"There are some very rude workers here. The manager was very rude. No one was at the customer service desk and had to go look for someone and when asked got a very rude reply from the Manager. And another worker left to her \"break\" but couldn't help us out for like a minute. I guess she needed her break when there was a long line for one elderly worker."}
{"text":"Seriously this place is ridiculous. I don't know how they are even still open and haven't lost all business. Only provides one or two checkouts open at a time regardless of how busy it is or how many customers waiting in line. Prices are a lot higher than competitors too. Just awful."}
{"text":"The waffle Donut has arrived. Yes, it is a waffle with some chocolate icing on top. It is dense and really not that great, but a nice invention. The rest of the store is fairly typical Safeway, but the staff is quite friendly here. Jose the self-check-out cashier is a good guy and many others are helpful as well. Skip the waffle donut, but shop here if possible."}
{"text":"Good for picking up a few items but the selections are not wide.  The butcher is small and the meat they put up didn't look appetizing.  Maybe because it was 8pm but it did not give me the feel of an upper tier grocery store.  Service was good and folks were helpful."}
{"text":"Where oh where to start? I guess with the positive. That is my wife and I own a restaurant close by and the convenience of this  is the ONLY reason that I will step foot in it any more. 

Safeway management you need to get your act together and either close this store or bring in a new, professional team, one that knows how to put the customer first. Now to the longstanding issues:

1. Since Sprouts moved in across the road Safeway management seems to have completely abandoned this store. 

2. It seems to have been always understaffed but the store management up until late 2016 seemed to be doing their best. Since then a string of management changes has only cause the death spiral to accelerate. 

3. Employee moral seems to be at a record low but there are still a few smiling faces. Debbie and Debbie always great you with a smile and Russell does his best to resolve issues.

4. When I need something I normally need to be in and out of the store fast - that is a practical impossibility. Rarely do they have the express lane open. This morning for example I needed two gallons of milk, that is all. I picked them up and headed to the front of the store. One lane open with 6 people in line with several with full carts. Eventually another teller came over and attended those of us in the back of the line. Then miraculously as  the two open lanes thinned out another teller showed up in the express lane but then did not have any customer to serve.  Typical.

5. Prices - produce prices are by and large much higher than Sprouts.

6. Selection - very poor.

7. Maintenance - floors are pealing and patched with ductape, sharp edges are protruding (for months) from several of the coolers causing a potential injury hazard, etc.

8. Given the loss of the excellent bakery manager, most of the shelves of the \"fresh baked\" items are scarce on a Sunday morning. As an example the items that I purchased this morning had been made on the 30th (I should have checked the date) and instead of \"crispy\" were soggy.

9. Now what is totally unacceptable (the blame lays squarely on the shoulders of the current management) was what happened in believe on Saturday the 22 of July. After a long day at our restaurant I walked over (about 9:30pm) to Safeway to pick up some smoked salmon and two other items prior to heading home. I picked up my items and headed to the front. When I got there there was only one teller working. She had a full line (most of which had full baskets). As I walked up I asked one of the other ladies if they could open another line. She said yes and pointed me to the next isle over. I headed over and another man followed me (he had approached the other line shortly after I had). As I put my salmon on the conveyer the teller walked up. I greeted him with \"hi Phil\" (since I am a very regular customer and like to call them all by their name). To which I received the reply \"I AM NOT HERE FOR YOU, I AM HERE FOR HIM!\" with Phil pointing to the man behind me. Shocked, I left the line and joined the long line in the other isle. I was so taken aback that I forgot my salmon (and Phil did not even show the courtesy of passing it over to me or telling me that I had left it on his conveyor, so I went to the back of the store and picked up another packet). When it was my turn with the teller asked asked her to get me the manager ASAP. After finishing my checkout and waiting for about 10 minutes the manager came over. I asked her to step away from the teller area because I wanted to have a private conversation with her. So we headed to the area between produce and floral. As I stated to tell her what had transpired Phil came up behind me and joined our conversation. I said that I had not asked to speak with him but he stayed there anyway. As I addressed his conduct he started rolling his eyes at me and waiving his hands. I told the manager that this was unacceptable, that he should not be there and they they should look at the cameras and see what had transpired. I also asked that the GM give me a call. I went back on Tuesday morning and asked for the manager. He was not there but I was promised a call. I waited all about noon and called the store for the manager. Was told that he was in a meeting but would call me back shortly. That did not happen. Late that afternoon, I called again and finally spoke with him. No apology, nothing. 

I hope that somehow, someone at Safeway (who cares about customer service, the future of this particular store and has just a little bit of clout) reads this review and actually does something to improve this location. I like the convenience of having them next-door."}
{"text":"I like this store, I already know where everything is, so I don't waste time.  It is on the way to my home so I can stop here and get my groceries.  For some reason, if I am home, I go to the Summit Safeway, even though they are both the same distance from my house.  I guess it is a matter of custom."}
{"text":"Safeway is super close to our home in Grayhawk so I come here at least twice a week for a few things. If the chicken is on sale, I'm all in! I get our milk and deli meats at this store as well.

Meat department is rather slow at times but it doesn't bother me. There is a lady who works in the butcher block who is so stinkin' nice, I can't even handle it. I should really  find out her name.

Deli department is always a hit no matter what store I'm at so expect some sort of wait. I always am right after the customer who has to order 8 different kinds of deli meat and cheese, lol. 

I love their J4U app, saves me money! Love racking up the gas points. Husband just filled one of our cars and saved $1.00 off a gallon. Yes, please!

Anyways, the parking it a bit tough but whatever, walking is a form of exercise so just walk instead of driving around waiting for someone to pull out.

Read the reviews below, they can open up a few more check-out lines but I can't imagine why so many people are angry about having to wait to buy their groceries. Go to Costco, you're going to wait there too."}
{"text":"I literally hate this store.  I normally go to Frys but live 2 seconds from here, so once in a while I end up running in to save myself the extra 5 minutes' drive to Frys.  This store is horribly organized and has a tiny selection, along with the price hike that I've come to expect at any Safeway.  

Take this fun quiz to see how Safeway-savvy you are!

Q: Where would you find crushed tomatoes?  
A: Well, at any normal grocery store, they're with the canned vegetables.  At Safeway, they're tucked away in the Mexican food aisle.

Q: What size options are there for crushed tomatoes?
A: At most places, anywhere from 8 to 28 ounces, with 14.5 ounces being the \"normal\" size.  At Safeway, your only option is 28 frigging ounces.  Who the hell needs that much?!  

Also aggravating: they only have about 4 checkout aisles and no self-checkout.  Remind me never to go there again."}
{"text":"This is  my neighborhood Safeway when i dont feel like going down to Walmart Supercentre. 
This is essentially the downtown safeway, and as such it is an interesting mix of people. There are almost always people hanging around out front. Located behind this store is also a recycling drop off, so a lot of the homeless are collecting cans back there, and also hanging around out front. 
So, on to the store. 
The vegetable fruit selection here is decent always nicely stocked, and  for the most part consistently fresh. The meat/deli section looks good, however I dont eat meat so I cant comment on it too much. This store is always well stocked and even though it is pricier than somewhere like Walmart or Supercentre they often have the buy one get one free specials which can be really good for saving money. 
The bakery section has all the standard stuff, and in particular I have always found the girls behind the counter where they make the birthday cakes super nice.
In addition they have a sandwich/hot food counter that serves up custom sandwiches as well as chinese food. I imagine on peoples lunch break they pop in here for a bite. 
They have the self check outs, but what I find a tad frustrating is that there is no system to ensure that if you are next in line, you are next.( something I see at alot of these things....) they need to figure something out to ensure that the line up is based on the next in line principle. 
This safeway also has a starbucks express type thing and the kids that work there are friendly. 
This place can be really really busy just after work and on the weekends. I wouldnt recommend making this your primary place to get groceries, but in a pinch it is fine."}
{"text":"Upon visiting the Safeway # 1253 store tonight at approximately 6:45 PM I encounter  the manager on duty Jessie and Amber a checker.   Jessie and along with two female employees were standing at an end cap blocking the aisle visiting. I asked Amber for the name of the manager and she said she wasn't allowed to give out that information. I then went to speak with the person reported to be a manager named Jessie and asked him if he thought this was appropriate behavior and he said yes I asked him if his boss appreciates it and he said yes. As a customer, I think it's inappropriate."}
{"text":"Groceries are expensive, but thats because you're paying for the Airmiles. Pharmacy staff is nice, but there is never enough people on as it is fairly busy and there always seems to be a long wait."}
{"text":"There are a lot of Safeways around and I'm sure we've all been in them and even done some shopping at them from time to time. It's a gigantic chain store but I still find quite a bit of difference from store to store, and therefore a reason to review.  Let's go point form to get to the meat (rear centre/right) and potatoes (far right).

- Unusually friendly staff.  There's a a few of them that really stick out in this location! They're so friendly that I sometimes think they're mocking me. In all reality they're just very genuinely friendly, so I take the next minute to reevaluate and correct my unnecessarily pessimistic disposition.

- Shiny clean produce. This is a staple among among Safeways and a real selling feature for sure. In general, their prices are higher than many other grocery giants, but if you need mass produced produce, Safeway is a solid choice. 

- Huge wait times. - I've not once seen this Safeway, or really any for that matter, run at full capacity. I've seen queues with over 18 people, but there are always closed registers.  For some reason I forget about it often and am kicking myself when all I need is 1 item.

*Side Note* I always think it's fun when you finish purchasing your items and the cashier says \"You saved $6 dollars today.\" Who knew?? Did you know you save money?? Huh,  I must be reading my bank statement wrong because it looks like I spent well over $100. ;)

See you tomorrow, Safeway."}
{"text":"You ever walk into a Safeway grocery store and it's BACKWARDS? The deli and bakery are on the right and the produce is on the left. WHAT IS THIS MADNESS?! This is my alternate universe Safeway.

Tip: You know all those sales that have a certain quantity number? At Safeway they don't matter - you just get the deal anyway. Buy 5 for $5! Check out the fine print it will say \"$1 each\". I guess the \"Buy 5\" is just a friendly suggestion to BUY MORE THINGS! It works too! But now that you know, maybe you can combat the psychology of it all.

I'm still waiting for the day that it's busy enough for Safeway to open all of the tills. I've never seen it! Regardless of the day or time, they only ever open enough tills to keep an irritatingly large queue. Safeway is really the only store going that I quite end up going in for a few quick items, then just decide to put them down and leave.

Same, pretty decent quality everything and a good number of \"organic\" options for food as you'll get at any Safeway. More expensive than Superstore or Walmart but they've got perks like free bags and people to help you out. For a mass consumer grocery chain, they're a little bit more service and quality oriented than the absolute lowest price."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter what time of day you go to this store, they have it understaffed. You try avoid the rush but they'll only have one till open so you still have to line up to the back of the store. At peak hours, they'll have more tills open, but only enough as to keep the lineups going way down the isles.

I don't get it, Safeway... Why aren't you utilizing the cashier stalls that your store is already equipped with to make more money? An extra cashier would move more people through meaning happier customers and more money from you. I understand that it isn't worth it to have cashiers doing nothing, but even if you reduced to 15+ people lineups down to 3 or 4, your store would still be running at maximum capacity and therefore the most money you can make/hr. The increase in revenue of having another cashier has got to be greater than the $/hr it costs to have them working, no?

Now add the several times I've had to abandon a shopping cart full of groceries because your line ups were too long. That's alone is an immediate loss of several hundred dollars - enough to pay for another cashier... On top of that, and way more valuable, is the future loss of an entire customer as I no longer shop here since I pretty much can't. There's no one to take my money in exchange for your goods.

The floor staff here are friendly and helpful, and the cashiers are always clearly working hard and are very efficient. It hurts me to write such a negative review since they are good people who are always very nice. I don't think it's a question of the staff you have on, but of the ones you don't. What's going on, Operations Management?

This isn't on one occasion - this is on every occasion, at any time of day."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of this grocery store, I find the selection small and the prices high compared to other grocery stores., but I still come here on occasion because of the proximity. 

I am rarely ever intrigued by the meat and seafood counter which is ridiculous since I'm on the Paleo bandwagon and those are my main food group options. Even the prepackaged meats are not that appetizing, but when I am in bind - say when I thaw two steaks and come home to find my husband ATE BOTH, I will come here and grab something. 

The Deli section is probably my favorite area because of the huge sandwiches you can get for a reasonable price. You will also find the rotisserie chickens in this area along with a sushi station.

From the bakery section, I have only ever gotten caramel apples which were decent, but it is few and far between that they are even available. I do appreciate the pretty flower section in the produce department although I have never purchased any items from there, its still nice to look at. 

The store itself is always clean with a full Starbucks inside and the staff again are either hit-or-miss. Every time I have been here there only seems to be one check-out cashier present so most of the time I end up going to one of the four self-check out stations which is a huge negative for me. If I wanted to play cashier, I would revert back to age 6 with my Fisher Price plastic check-out stand!

Bottom line: its a grocery store, you can get the necessities here, but if you need any speciality items or higher quality health food items you are out of luck."}
{"text":"This isn't the fanciest grocery store in N Scottsdale, but it doesn't need to be because it's only a grocery store ... Right?

I come here regularly to grab food from their prepared foods section - victor & Ellen are awesome and always take good care of me and I've never had any trouble or drama when dealing with them. Some of the other staff members can be a bit difficult @ times when they fail to use common sense or forget how important it is to give your patrons exceptional customer service.

My favorite items from the prepared foods section are the roasted/backed chicken 8 piece meal (simply delicious chicken), Mac & cheese, and I love their kale specialty salad rocks the house!!"}
{"text":"I am here quite often as I get my prescriptions from here at the pharmacy. When I am here I also pick up a few groceries and I like how neat and tidy the store is and the selection they have. 
The produce is always good too. 
The only one complaint I have is that I am set on to be automatically called when I need to refill my prescription or pick it up when it is ready but I never get the calls and everytime I go in I always have them check my phone number and it is always correct so I do not know why I am not getting these calls. 
That is a bit frustrating but other than that it is good. 
Plus when I do not pick my prescription up for a week they end up calling and saying \"Your perscription has been sitting here for a week, do you still want it?\" and that is how I am reminded to go get it so that helps! :)"}
{"text":"There's never anybody at checkout....the employees  always seem to be in a rap session in the manager's office. Deli is a ghost town. No self check out. For some reason there's a Starbucks inside even though there's one right across the parking lot."}
{"text":"I have seen in a lot of Safeways in a lot of different places/countries in my time so I would consider myself somewhat in the know when it comes to the variatians between stores..

The first thing that struck me about this Safeway was that it was the first one I'd ever seen that had a Tim Hortons instead of Starbucks in it.. Maybe thats a new trend in Alberta, but I do like that option.

I  didn't have a single bit of change on me when I walked in but the lady who was working in the floral department was kind enough to spot me one.. Very much appreciated and speaks to the kind of customer service philosophy a store has..

I found the safeway to be impeccably clean, well stocked and with great employees.
When buying fish in the  butcher section, I was originally planning on buying the Basa fish filets that were behind the glass counter.. To my surprise the butcher pulled me aside and showed me where there were frozen Basa filets in a combo pack in the freezer for about 3x less than I would have paid behind the counter!! The fish behind the counter was all previously frozen anyway.. So good deal and another example of customer service that one rarely encounters in chain stores anymore these days.

The only little glitch was upon check out when the cashier didn't ask me for my Safeway card.. I almost forgot about it entirely when I was about to pay ($200), and then I remembered my club card.. She entered it in and my total dropped down to $160!! So thats one little problem that was very close to costing me $40..

All in all I can only highly recommend this grocery store, and hope they keep on hiring the quality staff they have so far.."}
{"text":"I frequently shop at this location, as it on the way home. They have a good selection of items on well stocked shelves. They also have a Starbucks inside for your coffee fix and also a deli counter that offers pre-cooked food to go.
They staff is always friendly, including one of their young managers named, Keith Richard. Obviously his parents have a strange sense of humor or clueless.
My only complaint is that they do not have any self checkout lanes."}
{"text":"I'm just here for thanksgiving supplies and I stoped at your Starbucks and the lady was wonderful and sweet. But this girl cane into this quiet area where we were watching the football game while we waited for our coffees and she said \"I want to stare at the TV pretending to care about football\"and she stayed there watching and when we were walking away she walked off too and yelling \"I honestly have no clue what was going on on the tv but I don't have anything else to do\" and she skipped away. If she was my coworker or Employee I'd be very upset that she's not using company time wisely. She was a red head and hanging out in the deli area in front of counter. Leaving store now and she's still standing around."}
{"text":"There are some good and bad things about this store.
Parking can be a problem at Christmas. I love parcel pickup.
I do not love their management trainee. He needs to learn about customer service.
Some of the cashiers seem very stressed out.
The meat cutters could be better.
The bakery is pretty good."}
{"text":"This was the only store i knew in downtown that was nearer to my place and reachable in the blistering cold and sells almost all groceries and vegetables. Of course they aren't cheaper compared to other places like canadian superstore and other places but as it is reachable in day to day life .. 
One good thing about it is that they have tax free mondays !!! Hasn't anyone noticed it yet :P .. Yes every monday they don't charge the 5% GST on the goods you buy. 

I was over greedy when i got to know that they give 10% off on every first tuesday of every month. So i went here on first tuesday of that month instead of monday hoping that i cud get 5% additional discount to monday. 
Crap!! noticed that there was not discount on the bill. Rushed to the customer service and reported and I was told that i had to buy a minimum of $35 to get 10% off. Unfortunately my bill was only $25. 
So be careful about that marketing tactics :P . 

Unless you have a safeway card( of course getting one is a free), you don't get good deals here. So i suggest to go first to the customer service and pick up a safeway card and then go ahead for shopping at this place.

The bread they sell here is cheaper and fresh compared to other places.
And the vegetables are maintained fresh too. 
Sometimes they do have pretty good deals. So need to keep an eye on them. 
We can get almost all groceries and meat here. I like the chicken at this place. Fresh and tender.

Good thing is that it is open till 11pm."}
{"text":"Great store always. Had everything we needed for our vacation. Although, they did not have postcards ??"}
{"text":"This store goes above and beyond in customer service!  There is always someone available to show me where a certain item is.  Why would anyone go to Frys where  you could literally die in an aisle and no one would find you for days - there has never been any employee to help me, ever!!  If you could ever get someone to ask a question to, they just point to where you're supposed to fine it.  At Safeway they always ask, \"May I show you where it is?\"  I'll gladly pay a little extra to get the best customer service.  My time is worth something."}
{"text":"The butchers here will help you out. Good guys. I grab my meat here when im using the suaces from bansai. love it."}
{"text":"I'll preface this review to say that while this is not my \"go-to\" grocery store, I've been in a handful of times and it has never disappointed.  Typically I'll run in for an item or two if I find myself in the area, but most recently, I stopped by here to pick up a couple of balloons for a friend of mine who just had a baby.

Bonnie in the floral department helped me out.  She was super friendly and provided great customer service.  She went above and beyond to make sure that I was satisfied with my balloon selection -- I chose a cute \"It's a Girl\" balloon and a latex white one to go alongside it -- and put matching ribbon on.  She also showed me how to clip the balloons in the car so that they wouldn't be in my way while driving.  Thank you, Bonnie!

I frequent the Safeway on Indian School and 48th St or the one on Camelback and 32nd St, but this one makes for a great option when I find myself closer to Scottsdale / Shea.  If nothing else, go have Bonnie help you with flowers or balloons... that will be sure to brighten your day!"}
{"text":"In this area of the city you pretty much have every grocery store as an option to choose from, I don't consider Safeway my usual go-to but there are a couple things that tend to draw me to this location. First thing I like about this Safeway over the other stores nearby is that it tends to be quieter, as you know it can be extremely frustrating to go grocery shopping when you're constantly weaving your cart through people and avoiding collisions with other shoppers. This usually isn't a problem at this Safeway. Secondly, there tends to be pretty good variety here, especially when it comes to some health food options which is surprising for a non-specialty grocery store. Not only do they stock a decent selection of well known health foods, but they also carry their own healthier food line known as \"Eating Right\". This line is easy to spot with their signature green logo. Seriously pick up one of the Eating Right products next time you're in and compare it to one of the regular brands, you might be surprised, I know I was!

Overall it's a pretty conventional Safeway store. I would say it feels a big smaller and crammed compared to some of the other locations, but it still has all the items you'd expect and isn't missing any of the major departments. Yup even a Starbucks. Prices tend to be a bit higher here compared to some of the other stores, I'd say pretty comparable to Co-op though. The quality in the fresh goods is solid as you would expect from Safeway (Bakery, Deli, Meat, Produce and Seafood), the floral department is a pleasant surprise here as well. Staff are well trained, polite and professional, never had any issues. 

To summarize, it's worth checking out if you need a change from the norm, are interested in some healthier options or just don't like crowds."}
{"text":"Inner city location so it does have some challenges.  Small store so selection is a bit less than the big suburban locations but still the same quality.   Produce section is big and well lit as well as being well stocked. Deli and butcher counters are nice friendly staff and good selection.  There is also ready made food and a sandwich counter and the requisite rotisserie chickens.   The downside is clearly this store has a high level if theft and the security presence reflects this. This is not a fault of Safeway but that combined with some unique shoppers can make for a less than pleasant experience.   Upside not as many panhandlers as outside the store in Kensington."}
{"text":"This location is smaller than others (Westhills for instance) but don't let it fool you, it has everything the urban grocery shopper needs.  There is a full bakery, floral dept and deli as well as a good selection in the butcher case of better cuts and prepped stuffed chicken breasts and the like.  I like this location because I can walk to it on my way home and if I have too much to carry I hop the 419 and off I go.  Otherwise its fill the basket on my bike or hoof it on foot.  They have everything I need and the location can't be beat for me.  Two downsides that stop it from a 5 star for me.  The folks that sit outside, I won't go in to detail but it's just not welcoming.  The other downside is they just don't have enough cashiers on for the after work crowd.  They are always busy at this time and the 3 tils + self serve is never enough.  All that being said it is still way better than the downtown location which is just sketch city.  Don't enjoy seeing someone attack security because they get busted shoplifting."}
{"text":"Great Safeway store, very friendly employees has made this my store of choice lately. Conveniently located at the corner of Scottsdale Road and Pinnacle Peak, its just a little bit out of the way home. It certainly beats the  Albertson's store near my house which is just not very good.

Overall Safeway has also had some great deals lately. Give them a try soon!"}
{"text":"I will drive out of my way for the service I receive here.  The floral shop has my business coming back for more.  I live in The south valley but find myself often needing to stop in if nothing else for a pick me up from the two incredible personalities that run this department.  If you need a pick-me-up stop in. It's been my secret for a year.  I am enchanted!?! Go figure.  Here is a picture I took of the two angels who always help me.  They are simply the Best!"}
{"text":"Came in last minute for a birthday cake and we wanted it personalized. Unfortunately we arrived after the bakery staff had already gone home however the store manager Shawn not only helped us personalize the cake but he also got us a discount as the writing wasn't perfect. This store consistently provides us with good service and today was above and beyond. I would recommend it to anyone! Thank You Shawn for your personal touch."}

{"text":"very clean and easy to find things. i go here a lot to grab some lunch so some of the employees are familiar and are extra nice to you. They have a starbucks inside and they have a sandwich area to create your own sandwich/pizza. If you use your safeway card you get a free sandwich after like 7 purchases (I think 7)."}
{"text":"This Safeway is probably the one I frequent second most, but I quite often drop by when I'm coming back from downtown. 

I never have issues with parking - for the number of people who visit the store, the parking lot is quite ample. There's a Starbucks inside, which is great for caffeine addicts like me. It's generally clean and well-stocked.

Except on Sundays - don't go Sunday evenings because the produce section will be EMPTY. Also, they don't have a separate organic/gluten-free section, which is more important for me now that I don't consume dairy. And it's smaller than most Safeways, so I can't always find what I'm looking for and the specialized items you can find at other locations are generally MIA.

All in all, good for grabbing a couple of items but not where I prefer to do my big shopping trips.

{"text":"Ok, I shouldn't be doing this but had a late meeting at King & I, so just parked here temporarily, less than 15 min.  Afterwards, made up for it by going inside to buy an orange ;)

It's a great location to have a major grocery name just a bit off the main DT; and it's a good size too.  Produce section on the left, always neat and tidy.

Self-check machines, I love those.

Starbucks inside, seating area a bit tight, close to the main cashiers."}
{"text":"How come the Vancouver safeway's don't have Timmy's, instead of Starbucks?  Star right there.

Plus another one for underground parking.

It's a big, big store.

{"text":"They are out of everything all the time. !!!!! When does the manager ever look at the stockroom. You guys have got to check the shelves or something. You are out of milk. How the hell can you be out of milk. Terrible terrible terrible."}
{"text":"I shop at this location really regularly because I live so close, not because of the quality. While I will say that the staff at this location are really friendly, helpful, and regular (you see the same smiley faces every time you go), the produce section is sad. I was there just today and picked up a bag of crinkled carrots that had expired March 3rd (it's now the 22nd), as well as oranges that had gone so rancid they'd turned greyish black. They don't seem to rotate their produce probably as regularly as they should, but the rest of their stock throughout the store is pretty good. 

The store (mostly right by the front doors) is definitely not very safe, however; they have to keep security guards posted by the doors as some pretty unsavory and often belligerent people frequent the location. I definitely WOULD NOT recommend shopping at this location past about 9. Gets pretty sketchy in the daytime too, now that I think about it."}

{"text":"This location is 5 minutes from my home, so yes it's easy to get to for me. There is adequate parking, although during prime time after work hours it is packed!! I normally venture out at the crack o dawn. The store recently had it's grand re opening after it's remodel was completed. I knew where everything was...for the most part. Now I'm relearning the store. The staff has always been friendly but now they are over the top! Everyone has a smile and engages in small talk. The store is amazingly clean (remodel just finished), hopefully it will remain so. The cashiers understand and execute Safeway's coupon policy flawlessly. I have never had a problem and I use coupons everytime I enter the store. The only ones that have caused a slight bump are the reduced price in store meat coupons. Even those are working better after the remodel. I'm glad this store meets my needs and is pleasurable to shop in. It makes shopping so much easier when the store and employees care about their customers. Thanks Safeway! Also love the JUST FOR U program!!"}
{"text":"The Desert Ridge Albertson's may be just a minute from my door, but when I have some major grocery shopping to get done, I drive a little farther to this Safeway.  It's a much better store, with all the Safeway standards and a friendly and helpful staff, but there are still a few things I don't dig about this place.

The selection feels a bit smaller than other Safeways.  I don't know if the store is smaller, or if it's just me, but I feel that there's a lack of variety at this location.  Expiration and pull dates on many items always seem to dangerously to their deadlines.  I needed sour cream during my shop on friday, all the tubs had a sell by date of Monday.  I know that means it's still good for another week or so, but I'd be more comfortable with the food if I knew I had more time with it.  This supermarket could also benefit from upgrading to self-checkout.  Some people prefer to be serviced, I prefer to get out as fast as possible.  At least open up a few more registers.  Have you ever been stuck in the grocery store purgatory where you've waited behind that person with 100 items who's blabbing away with the cashier, then someone opens another register, but your stuff is already on the conveyor belt, so the person behind you gets to cut a head?  Yes you have, and you hate it too."}
{"text":"This is the closest Safeway to where I live. Its located in Beltline. Came here to pick up a few things. Well got ice cream and unfortunately, I wanted to pick up those English batter fish from the frozen isle but they only have one left. I was told buy one is $10.99 and buy two is $8.99 each. They said I can't pick up one for $8.99 and that it has to be two. So, I decided not to get it and plus the reason why its the only one left was that the box was pretty much very beat up. I think that one box will just end up in the garbage can seeing that I gave it to the sales and he just put it in the cart with all the random non freezer items. 

Its spacious here. No different than any other Safeway."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see that this Safeway has a Tim Horton inside. Never seen this back home in Vancouver. So came here to do grocery shopping. I picked up some ground beef and steak and of course a few other things. Well I like this location more than the one in Beltline. It seems like there is a higher chance of finding sale item in stock here. 

I like shopping here. Lots of parking if you have a car. Friendly service. It wasn't that busy when I went in at around 7:30 ish."}
{"text":"Review #19 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012

While the rest of this Safeway seems to have stayed the same, the sandwich counter just isn't what it used to be. I'm not saying it's bad. It's actually still pretty kosher... it's just that, well, it's not what it used to be!

First off, I always enjoyed using the individual sandwich kiosks when I still worked at ATCO. But over the last couple of years, slowly, but surely, they were out of order more and more. I was in on Monday to grab a sammy and they've all but disappeared.

Bonuses to the disappearance of the ordering kiosks:
- I no longer have to wait in line behind people who can't figure out how to use them
- I can't get frustrated because it's out of order a good portion of the time
- More face-to-face time with a real person while ordering

Not-so-bonuses
- Really, all I've got here is the joy of using the self serve bits to pay for my stuff. 

Crap. Here I was all upset about the kiosks being gone and was giving Safeway sandwich counter a three star... and now at the end of the review, I've sorted out my true feelings on the matter, and it seems I think we're better off without them. Back to four stars at Safeway. It helps that the staff at the sandwich counter are always smiley and friendly and that they seem to have remedied the amount of focaccia bread they stock!"}
{"text":"It's no downtown Safeway with Alex behind the sandwich counter, but this Safeway's got some good things going for it.

1. It's in Market Mall. All malls should come complete with a grocery store. It's the one thing Chinook is missing. The malls that do have grocery stores really are your one-stop-shop for everything.
2. It's one of those fancy-schmancy newer layouts with the pharmacy right in the middle instead of at the back. It was my first time at this location, and you know, I think it was actually easier to find what I needed.
3. The checkouts are quick. This is typically the case in any Safeway I've been to, but it counts just the same. When I'm at the grocery store, I like to get through the checkout line as quickly as possible. In fact, this is true of just about any store. I enjoy the browsing/shopping part. I dislike the waiting in line part. Granted, I was here at around 7 pm on a Sunday, but the cashier was quick to ring me through just the same.
4. It's ideally located for those in the area without vehicles. That's just a long winded way of saying it's within walking distance for a lot of folk. Does that make it good for the environment?

I have yet to find a Safeway that I don't enjoy shopping at (except maybe the one just north of 16th Ave, but that's a review for another time)."}
{"text":"The Starbucks a old lady name Toni is so rude in the morning and very lazy person. Always don't want to greet people. She gets upset when the order wasn't right and don't want to help other people. I don't bother with her when she is there I walk away. That's the only place I had my problems with. Toni don't deserve to work there if she is going to treat people like that. My clients and friends say the same thing about her."}
{"text":"went in yesterday for a money order staff is friendly and service is very good and as you enter employees are willing to help they don't act like they dont see you when your about to approach in need of help i would totally return here for all my shopping needs"}

My trips to this particular Safeway have always been pleasant. There's always parking available, they always carry the products I need, everything is well organized, there's always someone who can assist you and I've never had to wait in line to checkout. This is the location I regularly visit for my weekly hoarding of food and I find it surprising that this location doesn't get too busy even during weekends."}
{"text":"Very Clean store. But I guess when you're paying about 300% more than you would anywhere else, the place can afford it. The people in the front are pretty friendly. There is a lady in the deli, she is pretty friendly/talkative. There are people who mill around the store wearing name tags, they are not friendly or polite.

I just cannot get over how expensive safeway is."}
{"text":"This location must be convenient and one of the few grocery stores in the area as I went in on a Sunday evening and it was packed.  It seemed to be a good Safeway with lots of products in a bright store.  

I picked up one item and went to find the express line but each line up was so long people were standing in the aisles.  I didn't bother waiting and left the store.  Every time I work by this Safeway the parking lot is packed.  Although I'm sure some customers are for nearby businesses.  Next time I'm around, I may stop by and hope that I can find and pay for the items I want."}
{"text":"Today I had forgotten my inhaler at home and was having a hard time breathing. Brenda in the pharmacy is extremely nice and was super fast at filling the prescription. Less than 15 minutes! Fastest pharmacy ever, super impressed. Much appreciated."}
{"text":"Things this Safeway has going for it:

1. Freshly made sandwiches (you punch in your order, they make 'em right in front of you) are FANTASTIC and very reasonably priced.  Try the California Dreamin' on ciabatta bread.

2. They have a far superior bakery than the Co-op down the street.

3. The hot \"Chinese food\" isn't as bad as you'd think.  I usually go for the stir fried veggies and maybe a meat dish.  I like how the veggies are not usually soggy, more tender crisp.

Things this Safeway needs to work on:

1. 4-6pm on a weekend.  You'd think it was Boxing day in there, total mayhem, avoid at all costs.

2. Self checkout.  The line is behind you.  Seriously, it probably stretches down the aisle.  Be polite and check please.

3. Produce section - Co-op takes the edge on this.  Produce just doesn't ever seem appealing to me here.  Either MUCH too pricey or too waxy, or not ripe.  I rarely buy produce here.

Pro tip - if you don't have any items that need weighing and the lines for the cashiers are insanity, hit up the customer service desk to pay.  Saves time especially if you're just running in for that carton of milk and box of emergency cookies.  Hehe.

{"text":"I never used to shop at Safeway but since moving inner city I've grown to love it.  I enjoy how they price sale times.  Not only do they show the sale price, they show how much you're saving and also the price per unit (in case you want to compare a similar item from a different brand).

It's a small enough store you're not spending hours shopping for groceries but yet it's large enough you'll find everything you need all in one store.

If they run out of rotisserie chicken at certain hours just talk to customer service and they'll give you a coupon for a free one on your next visit."}
{"text":"I have a love and hate relationship with this grocery store. The only reason I stop here is because it's close to my house so it's convenient. They have just about everything i need and it's an average size store so it's easy to find what you need. 

It's also a nice benefit to have a pharmacy inside the store.

My biggest gripe about this Safeway is that they always seem understaffed..there are always lines at the checkout lanes and i just find that to be a pain in the butt.

Convenient Yes but my favorite grocery store ? NO...Just Ok..

I am however looking forward to the Sprouts opening across the street in the summer of 2014..."}
{"text":"With their recent rennovations I can see why Safeway groceries cost a little more.  This location is very convenient and the staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"I guess I'm just lucky. I have found everything that I was looking for in this grocery store and more. There seems to be a large rotation of help, I'm not sure what that means. I'm happy with the location and prices, in par with other grocery stores. The store is always clean and staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I've got to give my props to this specific location of Safeway.  Normally, I wouldn't write about a store like this, but I've got to say something about this particular one.

I love this location!!!  Every time I go (which is quite a bit) I am always super pleased by the customer service and friendly smiles that greet me.  Even the cashiers are such pleasant people, and I always end up striking up a conversation with them.  I don't know if this Safeway has different hiring expectations than others or what, but they are definitely different.

Since I live close to this location I go quite often, and am actually a little sad when I'm too far to visit it.  Okay, that's probably the sad part, isn't it?!  I can't help it.  I really, really love the workers at this one Safeway."}
{"text":"Very long review below as it is what I sent to Safeway Corporate. This is or was my neighborhood store and I am consistently not happy with it but today's incident absolutely floored me. Good customer service is tough to come by and my expectations are low but not taking someone's loss seriously is never excusable. 

I have been going to this store for decades and had an incredibly unpleasant situation today. I have to preface with I am in the customer service industry so it takes a lot for me to complain. I also tried to contact the store to mention this to the manager and once I was put on hold for 14 minutes(so I hung up) and the second time, the phone was never answered. I went to the store and checked out and when I got home, I could not find my house key. I checked every pocket, my car and the parking lot at my condo before I called Safeway. I was convinced I had to have dropped it there probably in the check out line when paying. I called the store(I know this is an annoying call as I get them in my industry but you never know the importance of someone's loss on the other end). The young man on the phone was very dismissive and said he'd go check. He came back on the phone and said there is not set of keys at the checkout. I again mentioned it's not a set of keys it is just one loose key and he said \"yeah not here\" and hung up. I am so glad I doubted him and drove back to the store. I could just tell he didn't really check or look well. Meanwhile my groceries are standing outside my condo in the heat. I went back to the checkout and my key was right there on the floor. This was very important to me...it was my house key and my entire family(who has an extra key) are all out of town. So if I would have listened to your lazy, incompetent worker...I would have had to spend $100+ calling a locksmith. Yes it's my fault for dropping my key, but it is inexcusable for an employee to take such matters flippantly. I don't think I can ever shop there again knowing the absolute lack of care the people you hire have. I don't know what resolve there is to this but wanted to make you aware because I felt it was absolutely inexcusable and most importantly avoidable."}
{"text":"A nice and clean supermarket with all the usual stuff for such businesses. They have a good deli, a cheese bunker, pre-made sushi and a pharmacy."}
{"text":"A friend of mine warned me before I came to Calgary that groceries were much more expensive that they are in Toronto.  

Unfortunately, she was right.  I walked into this Safeway, and had to think twice before picking anything up.  Whereas I would normally buy soy milk for $2 in Toronto, here it was $4!  HOLY MOTHER OF MERCY!  

I'm not sure if this is a Western Canada thing too, but all the beverages were shelved in a bazillion different locations.  Pop was in a different aisle than juice, and soy milk and energy beverages were also in different aisles.  It took me awhile to find what I was looking for.  

The store is also strangely dim.  But.... cool that they have Wi-Fi!  

On another note, the staff here are incredibly friendly and very helpful, unlike many of the grocery chains that we have over in Ontario.  Excellent customer service.  The cashier actually greeted you by name, and they offered to carry your groceries out to your car.  They bagged them nicely, made sure to wipe down the scale and conveyor belt so as to not contaminate your other groceries.  Great attention to detail!"}
{"text":"It's definitely not Fry's on Shae & Tatum, but it is still very good for a grocery store.  I like to go here for the sandwiches.  Safeway sandwiches are better than Jimmy John's down the hall."}
{"text":"Everything you could want in a grocery store. Great selection of just about everything. The quality you would expect from a Safeway. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Best Safeway in town.  Very clean and very hard working nice people.  They always have the freshes products and nice staff.    I love Tuesdays when its discount day I was shocked and excited about my discount.   Looking forward to going back for more good stuff !!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS SAFEWAY !!! The staff are amazing. They always greet me with BIG smiles and remember my name. 
My favorite Safeway in Calgary."}
{"text":"I was sad to hear on the news today that Sobeys has bought Safeway Canada. What does this mean? I don't know!

If I lose the Tuscan Tomato Basil Bisque that is the star player of Safeway's branded food products, I may cry. That soup is part of the reason I still shop at Safeway.

Oh and so I can also earn my Mum Air Miles, WHAT ABOUT THE AIR MILES. Aeroplan sucks.

Anyways, this Safeway location, though it may not remain a Safeway location for long, has the world's tiniest Starbucks inside, a pharmacy, 4 self checkouts, and a produce department that can't seem to get it's ordering right. One day there will be no baby spinach, the next no kale, and then the red peppers will be missing-what are those? I forget what they look like-oh wait, they cost $2 EACH. 

I guess I will have to say goodbye to Lucerne milk, which is the milk I grew up on and every other type tastes funny to me.

If I am such a grumbles, why do i continue to shop here. Well, this Safeway location is sheer convenience for me to stop in on my way home from work. Decent selection, expensive as all Safeways are, and the pop hasn't been on sale in forever. 

Tops and tails better than the Communist Safeway in Mission, but you could be an empty store and still accomplish that."}
{"text":"I have been withholding comment on this Scottsdale Road and Shea Safeway store for quite some time. The cashiers are rude, talk to each other over you, no thank you, no hello....they hate you!  But what finally made me comment was what happened yesterday. I needed a certain type of tomatillo for a recipe. I called to inquire if they carried it. Two different people answered the phone and put me immediately on hold. I was on hold for 25 MINUTES. It almost became funny. I was going to remain on the phone just to see how long it would take but I hung up and went to another store. Funny thing is while I was on hold, I had my husband call to see if they would answer the phone. They didn't......imagine that. So done with this store. So many other places to shop."}
