{"text":"I love this place! The healthy meal options are amazing! Or grabbing a quick smoothie full of nutrients on the run. They even have a kids menu! I haven't ordered the delivery option but they never disappoint"}
{"text":"I got the pokii bowl and it was delicious! The staff were friendly and helpful and the service was fast. This is a great place if you're looking for healthy fast food."}
{"text":"This place needs to get its act together. Aside from cancelling my delivery and not telling me, they took orders with equipment that wasn't working. Out of avocados. Took 20 minutes for two orders with nobody else in the place. Give me a break. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Walked in here as it seemed like it was the best option around. Staff looked bored and uninterested. Ordered the bamboo bowl, took it back because it was missing mushrooms and broccoli as advertised, the guy said he didn't have any in the store (would have been nice to know before I decided to order that particular item) and they failed to tell me, so they kindly replaced it with avocado and an egg. Food tasted okay but really lacked any sort of flavour. My biggest beef with this place is that it presents itself as a healthy/environmentally friendly/green place, yet they serve all of their food in take away containers even if you are eating in. You have to ask them for water which comes in plastic cups. Huge amounts of waste going on here and it's the reason I won't ever return to a Freshii until they sort this out."}
{"text":"I had a late afternoon lunch today at Freshii. I'd heard good things from my colleagues about their wraps so I figured it was about time I try one. I had the Khao San burrito and was it ever good! It was super filling and the spicy peanut sauce was to die for. The only thing that I would improve was that it wasn't quite heated all the way through but rest assured, had it been, this would have been right up there on my list of best wraps (and yes, I have a list of best wraps - you don't?). Anyway, thanks for making healthy eating on the go an absolute pleasure. #thatsawrap"}
