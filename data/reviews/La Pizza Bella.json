{"text":"The owner is the nicest guy in the world.  The pizza is very solid, but the subs may be better.  The balboa, which is half hot sausage and half meatball is delicious.  The prices are fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food, fast delivery, and the owner is a super nice guy.  My office orders from here at least once a week (sometimes more) and they always deliver our order within 30 minutes, whether its a delicious XL pizza to share, or everyone's favorite hoagie, salad, or calzone.   I love their Italian hoagie and steak salad, but it's always hard to pass up a few slices of pepperoni pie.   Oh, and they have Turner's in the cooler... always a crowd pleaser!"}
{"text":"Pizza was very, very average. Mushrooms were canned and sauce seemed to be as well.  It tasted rather bland--my wife went for the salt shaker. Italian hoagie was very standard as well--nothing special about the meats or cheese. The lettuce and onions were fresh and cold, and the pizza was delivered hot, but overall a disappointing experience. Still looking for good delivery options in the Fox Chapel area."}
{"text":"La Pizza Bella in Blawnox--Wonderful Service from some super great people. They have pulled through for us many times with pleasant attitude and good food. 18 pizzas for lunch? no problem. Thanks Guys!"}
{"text":"This is the true local Pizza shop you have been looking for. The best Italian sub in the area!!! The also have great Cheesesteaks and Pepperoni rolls. The owner is as friendly as it gets and actually cares that his customers are happy. He will make you just about anything anyway you want it. Very fast delivery too. Great local spot."}
