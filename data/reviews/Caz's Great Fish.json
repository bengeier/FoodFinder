{"text":"Fantastic fish! The batter wasn't overly greasy like some other restaurants in Mississauga and Toronto. The price is reasonable and restaurant has a lovely decor"}
{"text":"You're hard pressed to find something this good ANYWHERE else. Light, delicious , fragrant fish with delicious salad , and awesome sauces . They have two different types of vinegar too, malt and white. Great friendly service and relaxed atmosphere :) would recommend"}
{"text":"...nice, simple, clean place with friendly staff and good fish and chips. located in the same plaza as chapters, licks, boston pizza, etc, it's a fairly new environment. 

we got the battered zucchini as an app, loved it. the batter was light, not too little, not too much. as a main: haddock and chips - large portion, again, great batter, no complaints. 

would have earned a 4star if the price wasn't slightly higher than most fish and chip places."}
{"text":"Caz's is by far my favourite fish and chip place.  They have the lightest crispiest batter and a choice of haddock, cod, halibut, orange roughy, salmon, and other non-fish options if you wish.  I think the menu has changed as they offer a la carte, i.e. Fish and chips or all inclusive which includes coffee or tea plus your choice of a brownie or rice pudding for dessert.

Service is really friendly as well which makes it an enjoyable experience.

Come as often as you crave or as your waistline will allow"}
{"text":"I rate Caz pretty high because I've never felt bloated or greasy after eating their fish n chips.  I always get the halibut--would be awesome if they offered Grouper as well maybe one day? Batter is perfect the fish is lightly coated and batter has nice flavor portion could be bigger for the price.  Chips are perfectly fine.  Fish was fresh."}
{"text":"We went to our favourite place to go to for good Fish & Chips for dinner this past Friday (Jan. 20, 2017) for dinner and it was closed.  Nothing on the door, but regular restaurant hours and this past Christmas & New Year Holiday hours.   I hope it is not closed for good.  Anyone have any information as to what is happening at this Oakville location?   Thanks."}
{"text":"Just adding a star because we ended up here on good Friday and it was a bit better - obviously the last time out fries had been just siting there waiting for our fish to be finished.  The fries weren't perfect but the fish was delicious and that's really what we went for.  Plus the portions are so big you can only eat so many fries.  Will probably keep trying them. Oh and get the coleslaw!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic lunchtime dining experience here, I very highly recommend the Halibut. The Halibut and chips entree also comes with coleslaw and a slice of bread and butter. I got 2 very generously sized pieces of Halibut and large helping of chips on my plate. It was so much food I was definitely struggling but so tasty I didn't want to stop eating! The fish is of good quality with the batter being super light and cooked perfectly golden. A nice touch is that they make their own coleslaw and tartar sauce which are both quite delicious. 

At first you'd think that $13 is a bit much for regular old fish and chips but think again, the portions are huge and the food is incredibly fresh and tasty. I've also gotten takeout from here which was fantastic. 

The service was perfectly on par as well. She was quick and came by to check on us often. As for the restaurant itself, the decor leaves much to be desired with their vinyl tablecloths and cafeteria style seating but once the food comes none of that matters."}
{"text":"I was not a huge fan of the fries there but I liked the seasoning. The fish was delicious and the server was really nice there. I wish they did more Groupon offers because the appetizer was actually delicious!"}
