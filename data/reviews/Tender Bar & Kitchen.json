{"text":"Great evening last night at Tender Bar + Kitchen.  The food was terrific - loved the shrimp and grits.  Enjoyed a couple of great drinks and learned a bit about mixology along the way.  My deepest thanks to Jeff, Marie, and Craig for making the evening fun and memorable.  See you at the corner soon, Linda!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I have never written a review for this place?!  Great great great selection of drinks, what is there not to like?

Did I mention they have good cocktails?  Pretty much any type of cocktail you could possibly want!  And the wait staff/bartenders are more than happy to talk you through the extensive menu or make suggestions!  

My favorites right now are: Corpse Reviver, Last Word and really any of the gin drinks!

And until recently, I hadn't really given the food much of a try.  The dishes had looked very small and so  I had mainly considered Tender Bar a cocktail bar with snacks.  More recently, brought a group of out-of-town guests to Tender Bar and we ordered a wide range of dishes: Brussels Sprouts, Potato Skins, Duck Confit, Gnocchi and most importantly the flank steak that was on special that week.  All the dishes were fine, nothing extraordinary, but the flank steak was our favorite!"}
{"text":"I loved this place yet again!  Great cocktails, friendly service as always (hey Sam!) and a beautiful interior.  They also have a late night happy hour starting at 10 which is awesome for your wallet.  We brought friends visiting from NY which was fun and they enjoyed the place too.  An elegant bar with great cocktails."}
{"text":"love the cocktails and experienced bar staff"}
{"text":"5 stars for drinks! If you're looking for the perfectly crafted beverage, this place has the most skilled and artistic bartenders in the 'burgh - no question. I can mention a spirit or mood and they really nail it every time. 

We also walked in with a small party that quickly grew into a large group. With limited seating and rather strong personalities in the group, these guys handled it amazing - thanks to Chas for your stellar service."}
{"text":"The friendliest bar & restaurant in Lawrenceville, by a landslide! I've been here three times. The first was after eating at Industry across the street and receiving dismal service. I came to Tender for a cocktail. Both of the bartenders were super friendly, and the cocktails, as many have already said, are very strong. For happy hour prices, it was incredible! 

The second time was for New Years Eve. Your ticket included hors d'oeuvres, a welcome cocktail, two drink tickets, plus a champagne toast. For the price, it was an incredible deal! The servers passed around hors d'oeuvres quick, and often made several rounds. 

Lastly, I went to the beer class on Saturday. Again, incredible. For $20 a ticket, we had A LOT to taste and the teacher was an expert. The owner was there to facilitate, and he is clearly the reason why Tender's friendliness is so blatant a contrast from other Lawrenceville spots. He was super nice and recommended restaurants in Pittsburgh that he didn't even own. 

Highly, HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places in lawrenceville. The staff is beyond polite. The drinks are incredible and food very good. Best burger around."}
{"text":"Was in town looking forward to trying this place.  Couldn't have been more disappointed.  The hostess was extremely rude.  The lounge area was empty but she insisted we couldn't sit there.  No explanation but a \"NO\".  We proceeded to the bar and asked our bartender how we could get on the waiting list for the lounge area.  He was just as confused as we were since again, it was empty except for about four people.  The hostess rudely told the bartender the same thing, NO, they can't sit there.  Thank you to the bartender who genuinely apologized and offered to buy us a glass a wine.  A few minutes into our stay the lovely hostess told us we could now sit in the empty lounge.  Too late, wasn't feelin the rude vibe.  Too many other places to go in Lawrenceville.  Left and won't go back."}
{"text":"Go for the atmosphere. The cocktails are expensive but worth it to relax and have a well constructed drink. Very good last spot for the evening."}
{"text":"We almost didn't go here because of some of the negative reviews.  We're glad we ignored them.  Yes the menu is limited. But look, there's a steak, a chicken and a fish entr√©e and a couple of burgers.  My wife had the chicken and I had the fish.  Both were excellent.  We each had a small plate as well and again they were great.  Okay, if you're looking for a wine list and 6 cuts of beef try the Sonoma grill,  but If you want a cocktail and a good meal with good service in a nice venue, this place is hard to beat"}
{"text":"Best selection of spirits in Pittsburgh.  Excellent cocktails and delicious food."}
{"text":"I ordered a hanger steak and it came out undercooked as 3 tiny pieces of meat on a fancy plate. I'm not stupid- I can tell I'm being ripped off."}
{"text":"Drinks were good , our waiter was great and potato skins were good with the Truffle dip -
However I have to make the note that  I work in media and entertain a lot of clients all over Pittsburgh. I chose to go to Tender last night with a client because I live a few blocks over in  Lawrenceville. Unfortunately the hostess was actually rude. The bar was full so we chose to sit near the entrance in the couch lounge area which was empty. 
The hostess immediately ran over and told us that the couches were \"generally meant for parties of 8 or more\" REALLY ?? She suggested two hard back chairs in the area  and when we declined (and at that point should have just walked out) she sat us on a bench (with no back) along the side. Once the party next to us left we took their somewhat more comfortable chairs and the hostess actually glared at us. Probably won't be returning again. (and after an hour or so their was still no one sitting on the couches."}
{"text":"This place is just obnoxious and small. Went there once and will never return. I don't mind paying high prices for the specialty cocktails, but the food? Never again! Very very small servings and not that great. 

Also, the seating was terrible. We were squeezed in like sardines right beside this piano, so my friend couldn't even get out.

I will stick with Acacia on the South Side from now on. Similar drinks, nicer staff, not as pretentious. No food, but that's an okay exchange in my book. Tender was that awful."}
{"text":"Their chicken wings gave me food poisoning! It was a special appetizer last night and I've been throwing up all day. I also had the pickle platter and that was lovely. The reason I didn't give one star is because I don't normally like mixed cocktails but they have some lovely ones. My bartender Jay was great Jay if you are reading this don't take it personally but I had to let the world know about the chicken wings!
I will probably go back but won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Too bad you can't give 0 stars.   I was planning to meet some people for some drinks a few weeks ago.  My wife and I ordered $10 drinks that were mediocre at best that we were planning to nurse for a bit.  When our friends arrived they were told they couldn't enter since there were no seats at the bar.   Apparently they can't deal with people \"standing\" while drinking.  So we all left for a more welcoming venue-- and Tender lost a lot of business, not just that night, but forever more.  Totally lame in every way and with so much competition in Lawrenceville.  I expect (and hope) to see a big \"CLOSED\" icon next time I see them on Yelp."}
{"text":"Classy place. Good drinks. However classy this place may be, the music they're playing knocks it down several notches. Leo Sayer and disco? No. Just no."}
{"text":"My fiance and I checked this place out and LOVED IT.
Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu. He went through it with us pointing out all of their crafted cocktails with recommendations for our personal tastes.
We tried three different appetizers to share (charcuterie Board, potato skins and chipotle/lime wings)  and were impressed with each one.
If you don't come for the food, check this place out for there amazing cocktails. I stuck with the fruity ones (Aurora & The Typhoon) which both were delicious and looked too pretty to drink.
My fiance stayed with the whiskey and also loved his choices. Needless to say, we will definitely be coming back.
Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Drink menu and drink execution are solid.

That said, this bar suffers from incredibly inappropriate service by the tall blonde with glasses who may be the manager or lead bartender. I witnessed this woman berate and mistreat a group of well-dressed gentlemen who were engaging with others sitting at the bar. It was clear to me that she judges patrons that do not squarely fall within her beloved hipster brethren. I will not return. I will actively dissuade my friends and contacts from patronizing this business."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but since we've been turned away twice because \"those tables are reserved and you can't stand at the bar\", and \"the restaurant is reserved for a private event\", I'm giving Tender one star. Seriously, you let someone rent out the entire bar on a Friday night for a baby shower? Tender needs to decide what is it, a bar, a party hall, or a restaurant."}
{"text":"How does Tender have the stones to charge $9 for a 12 oz. pour of Green Flash IPA when you can walk less than a block in either direction and find it for $6 a pint? Of course the price was not indicated on the draft list because if you care about prices you don't belong in a place like Tender.

Oh yeah, the service sucks too."}
{"text":"Tender is a gorgeous space that is well-decorated, with well-meaning waitstaff. However, the rest of the experience is a disaster. Where to start with the issues at this bar/restaurant/whatever:

1. The bizarre rules. Tender is seated mainly by reservations, yet people who place them routinely still wait for tables. And you can't have a drink at the bar because there is no standing at the bar. I can't think of a better way to encourage people to leave a place! The main space is beautiful, but the back rooms are small & cramped, and it's unclear what purpose the equally dungeon-esque downstairs rooms could serve. 

2. The waitstaff/bartenders: All of them are well-meaning, if a bit pretentious, but that's fine. What's hard to accept is that no one seems to know what is going on. Simply asking what beers are on draft produces a flurry of activity that still doesn't result in a simple list. This is probably in part due to the aesthetic decision to have silver tap handles without the descriptive beer handles; this is fine if the staff is briefed on what beers are on tap, but not so good when they are not. Different waitresses and hostesses are constantly coming up asking different questions; the whole thing is not what you would expect from a fine dining restaurant.

3. The cocktails: they range from okay to great. Again, this is fine, but not what you would expect from a restaurant priding itself on its cocktails. Also, an attempt to order off the menu can end badly: I tried to order a Brooklyn cocktail only to have the waitress check, say it was okay, take my order, and then come back and say that they didn't have the ingredients. A prohibition-era bar doesn't have Rye, Vermouth, Bitters, Maraschino, and some kind of digestif?

4. The food. When I first ate at Tender, right after they opened, I would say that, based on the price vs quantity of food, Tender is by far the most expensive restaurant in Pittsburgh. Portions were shockingly small and shockingly expensive. Plus, there was nothing of great expense or difficulty to prepare on the plates. To be fair, I know they've revamped their menu, so maybe they've addressed this issue.

In short, Tender feels like a bar run by someone who likes restaurants, not a restauranteur. Everything is flash and sizzle, but no substance."}
{"text":"For the price, the food is not worth it. Went to the bourbon tasting dinner ($60/person). The spirits and cocktail were delicious but the food was nothing to write home about and the servers were not warm or welcoming. Would not return. There are many other really amazing restaurants around town - Meat and Potatoes, Cure, Spoon, Legume, Pusadee's Garden, Toast, and the list goes on...."}
{"text":"If this rating was based solely on aesthetics this would be a five. However, beyond the uber cool look, there isn't much to rave about. Menu- super limited. Definitely more of a drink spot than a place to dine. 

The service is slow and the girl who took care of us reeked of \"I really don't want to be here and I am just barely putting up with your requests for water and more drinks.\"

Wine was good- we had the spicy greens and beans. Not spicy at all. Made with kidney beans. That was a first. Others, because of lack of options, chose the BBQ chicken which was dry. They are trying to be a hip place but for what you are paying you get okay food, and really lame service. We went to Soba for a drink afterward and the interaction with kind, friendly, knowledgeable staff was a marked contrast. 

I won't go back toTender again and do not recommend."}
{"text":"Decent enough drinks and bartenders, but food is just ok. Pricey for average small plates. Smaller, but cool interior. Overall a pretty hipster experience."}
{"text":"Finding parking no mean feat, walking 2 long blocks in the cold to find Tender, a really nicely done and bustling ambiance through which we were lead to a quiet corner table where the four of us could hear each other.  We all ordered drinks and dinner.
 I didn't mind the limited menu; the food was delicious and varied enough. The drinks were exquisite and imaginative.
The service? Swiftly inserted into our conversation were the orders and food deliveries, the plates cleared even before we'd finished them. The waitress took my unfinished drink almost out of my hand. I grabbed it back from her, saying I hadn't finished it yet!  A few minutes after we had dined, the waitress returned and asked us to leave the table for their next reservation, and offered us the lounge to sit in. 
    We vacated our table , and sat down in the lounge but a few minutes later, she returned, asking if we'd  order any more drinks. Since we declined, she again asked us to leave, saying they needed the our coffee table where you couldn't really dine.  There were other empty tables, and no waiting people visable.
    Are they kidding? Thrown out twice!  We'd spent money and tipped well.
     If we'd ordered more drinks, would the \"waiting people\" no longer matter?
     Unfortunately, we won't ever return to this place, even though the fare was fine; 
we are mature people and don't want to be treated as though we'd gone to McDonalds.  
    So, no parking, rude treatment, great food, cute place. We would have been repeat customers if we'd been treated decently, but there are so many others to try..."}
{"text":"I've been to Tender a number of times, most recently last weekend for dinner with a friend, and I've always had a good time.  First things first- I love the atmosphere!  The building used to be a bank which gives it a unique touch.  Other than the bar it's mostly lounge seating, which is a nice change from other places on Butler St. 

My favorite thing about Tender is the drink menu.  The house cocktails are amazing and they're updated fairly often, plus they have a second page of classics to choose from.  And there's a really good selection of bourbon, scotch, whiskey, etc.  The bartenders have been friendly and helpful any time I've been there, which is great if you're struggling to make a decision.

Until last weekend I've only really eaten appetizers, but the last time I was there I had the ribeye sandwich.  It was pretty good, probably not the best I've ever had but I still really enjoyed it.  I ordered the potato wedges as a side- the only disappointment was that they ran out before we were able to order a second plate.  

Just some things to note- there were only two of us but we had to wait 45 minutes for a seat.  I would recommend making reservations on weekends, especially if you have a larger group.  Also, the bar has a \"no standing room\" policy.  This is great when you're actually sitting at the bar because it's not crowded and you don't have people ordering drinks over your shoulder, but it's not-so-great if you have a friend meeting you later and there isn't a seat available when they get there.  I would try to plan ahead in that situation if you can."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with friends for drinks and food in the evening -- always great. 

The decor is really nice, cozy, and interesting. The owner even gave a friend and me a personal tour one night after we overheard him talking about the history of the building. It was a bank, and the restrooms are where the vault once was! There are still some original features, such as the bar which was made from marble on the bank walls, and the front wall is decorated with original cheques from the early 1900's-ish. The floor is original, if I remember correctly, and they have some framed, genuine doctor's prescriptions for alcohol :) 

Their cocktails are perfection, complex and high-end. Of course you'll pay high-end prices, but it's worth it. The food menu is relatively small, but I think most people will find something they'll like, and it will be delicious and of high quality. I'm obsessed with their smoked squash soup with pistachios and goat cheese on top, and baked mac'n'cheese with a small arugula salad. 

They also frequently have entertainment such as local live music, or holiday events such as a delicious Mardi Gras menu. 

Go! Do it!"}
{"text":"Tender Bar and Kitchen is the best bar in Pittsburgh to get a cocktail hands Dahn.  I was born in Manhattan, my family still lives there and I frequently go to Apothoke when I am home.  If any of you have ever been there then you know it is an awesome that place and I don't have to explain it.  I moved to Pittsburgh 5 years ago and have been waiting for a bar like this to spring up.  After having around 30 different cocktails while always circling back to my circles of latitude Manhattan,  I thought I would write a review and squash all of these Yelp snobs with reality.  In my personal opinion Tender bar is better than Apothoke and has the best drinks in the Burgh.  

If you want to go to a bar, get rowdy, order shots and chase women with loose morals go to the South Side.  Stay away from my watering hole.  Keep this place classy Saint Pittsburgh.  The drinks are pricey however, it is all about the ingredients they are using to make your drinks.  The mixologists are not going to reach into a well and pull out rock gut spirits to make your drink.  Wait, there isn't even a well they pull the bottles right off of the shelf  Again, go to the South Side.  

I'm tired of reading, it's expensive, the drinks are to much, I wasn't expecting this, where do they get off charging so much for a beer.  The food is a rip off I'm getting screwed .  Listen the fuck up, you are paying for the experience not the drink.  I can sit there all night watching them make my drinks with their homemade vermouth and mixers knowing it will kick ass.  realistically how many can you drink at one time?  2-3?  4 if it's a Monday?  What is that like 40 bucks grow up.  You are paying for a night out and an adventure not to stand in a corner with a miller lite trying to avoid catching Hep C. It's easy!  If you are broke don't go out! Quit complaining stay in make yourself a pound of pasta with a stick of butter and call it a night.  Or again go to the Skank Tank commonly known as South Side.  I have never gone to the capital grill and say I wonder if they have a cheap steak tonight you pay for quality and the experience.  I would love to see any of you out in NYC ha stick to the rivers and the lakes that you are used to. 


Now on to the atmosphere.  Very stylish, the layout is for a kick back night.  You can post up at the bar in the comfortable leather bar stools with backs or sit in a lounge area on a couch with your friends and talk about which candy is better ring pops or fun dip.  Some nights they have live back round music.  The music isn't loud or obnoxious and you can talk over it!  Not yell to your mate.  There is no standing allowed in the bar area which is awesome.  People don't reach over you for a drink or spill on you or split you and your date from conversation.  

The food is great with smaller portions for sharing.  The food quality, presentation and taste is outstanding but the options are limited.  Tender Bar & Kitchen is exactly how it sounds its a fantastic bar with a Kitchen not a restaurant.  Don't expect to go out with your Bros and order a cheese steak and Fireball.  If you go in with the mind set that the food quality is outstanding and the food selection is limited then you are set.  Lets put it this way, the drinks are a priority and the food is a luxury. 8 pages of drinks and 1 of food. You do the math.  I have never been let down and I get excited to see what their food special of the day is.    

If you start your night with a cocktail or finish your South Side adventure with a nightcap this bar will deliver.  Hope to see you there.

Cheers"}
{"text":"We showed on a Saturday as a party of five. With a friend visiting from our of town, I figured we would take her to a few neat spots. The bar area is really nice, the lounge area in the back was beautiful. I really wanted to like it, I really did.
Approached the hostess, asked if we could sit outside. Advised, no, they only have seating for four. Is it that hard to pull up a chair? So we were directed to the lounge area in the back.... We were shown to two lounge type seats for FOUR people and they handed us a wooden dinning room table for our fifth... BUT that couldn't be done on the patio.
We looked over the menus, decided on drinks and even on a small plate. We sat for five minutes, no one ever came. So, we left. Walked right past the service station, made eye contact with a server as we passed... NOTHING WAS SAID. Not even a hey, we will be with you in a second. Nothing. 
 Yet another spot to not return to. Ever."}
{"text":"Top notch cocktails and great food.

Stopped in early on a Monday for cocktails and dinner. The service was fantastic and cheery. Cocktails came out quickly and the food was prompt.

The bar itself is beautiful and the cocktail menu is expansive and interesting. Probably reasonably priced for the high quality. There seemed a happy hour going on, but it wasn't mentioned or well advertised.

$10 burgers on Monday, which was a great deal. Also had the gnocchi, which was very well done.

Will definitely go back, especially for the cocktails and burger special."}
{"text":"I give a four star instead of three mainly because it's a nice place to hang out with friends. The interior is nice. I read the story about the location after seeing so many ancient checks on their wall. 

It's probably not a great place for dinner since the menu is so limited. However, most of the food is good. We probably ordered most items on the menu. We enjoyed almost all of them except for the pasta, which was undercooked and was still undercooked after we ask them to cook it again.

I don't drink that much, so I cannot say how good their cocktails are. Some of the drinks are really tasty while some are quite interesting. I probably won't come back for their drinks given the price and how much I got.

Btw, most of food highlighted on Yelp are gone!"}
{"text":"Well made and unique drinks are the focus at Tender.  I usually come back to The Van Buren, which has been on the menu since day 1.  They've divided the menu by spirit forward, sweet, and light/refreshing drinks...it might be the most sensible drink menu I've ever seen.  There's also a list of standard cocktails that includes quite a few tiki drinks.  The Jet Pilot comes in a cored pineapple with a flaming lime cup of 151...pretty impressive for $11.  As our bartender last night pointed out, there really isn't anyone in PGH doing tiki drinks, but Tender does them very well, in an albeit classier environment.

While I never tried the original food menu, the new burger/snacks menu seems like a better fit.  Try the tots.  The architecture and decor is polished and makes you want to dress up a bit.  With no standing and not too many seats, I've always had quick and friendly service, and seem to learn or try something new every time I come."}
{"text":"Came here last night for their soft opening.  The review is for the cocktails only, not the food. I absolutely adore their 1920's decor and staff outfits. Although we did have to wait almost 2 hours for two cocktails, I understand that mistakes are to be made during a soft opening and that they are still ironing out the kinks. The drink menu is fantastic. I ordered a pain killer and an old bond street fizz. The cocktail list reminds me of several places in New Orleans that I frequent. I really wish I could have ordered food, but I think it may have taken an even longer time to receive than the cocktails just due to the overwhelming response from those dining last night. The shrimp and grits and meatloaf both sound delicious. The owner, Jeff, was present and came around to several tables. You can tell he really wants to make Tender a success! So, I will be back to Tender but not for awhile. I want to give them time to work things out and expect an even better experience when I return."}
{"text":"I know this is a hipster fabulous place with great craft cocktails and ironic hipster but elite fare... however i was mortified by the reception we received tonight.   Despite a week long reservation for a party of 8 for restaurant week,  they sat us at the bar seating area and expected 8 people to eat our 3 course meals from couches and a low coffee table.  I don't even think the table CAN FIT 8 plates.  After politely inquiring if they can seat us somewhere else where we can at least reach our plates while dining with comfort, they informed us that the empty restaurant (it was 6:40pm) was filling up in the next 10 minutes.  We left and went to Senti who were more than accommodating of our large party on short notice.  They even gave us a bottle of rose champs on the house!  I guess our $500+ revenue / dinner means nothing to Tender.  Trust me, guys, it's not worth it stopping by Tender.  They obviously don't need your money.  Sure, they have good and fun drinks... but so does the Abbey, Butcher and the Rye, Muddy Waters and Industry.  The food at Senti, Vandal, Abbey, Smoke, Spirit and many other places in Larryville is so much better.  Skip this place and go somewhere where they actually appreciate your patronship and treat you like human beings."}
{"text":"I've been to Tender several times and so I've seen it change since it's opened. I really didn't like it much at first- too pretentious. But they've significantly improved their host staff, which really helps the overall experience. The servers are very knowledgable and helpful, without being pushy or intrusive. And the bartenders are some of the best in the city. I can always count on getting a cocktail that's exactly what I want after talking with the bartender about my taste preferences. The staff all really cares about what they do and genuinely want the patrons to enjoy themselves.

The food is very good, though it can be a bit pricey. I tend to order some of the cheaper menu items and really like them. The brussel sprouts and potato skins are soooo tasty. The burger is one of the best in the city. And they recently put a pulled pork sandwich on the menu- amazing sandwich and only $9 for what is easily 2 meals for me. So, while it can be really pricey here, there are ways to make that better.

Finally, the ambiance is great. They often have fun live music playing. The background music when the staff sets the playlist is fun without being too hip or pretentious. I like that they've opened up the lounge space so it's easier to get seated when they're crowded."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Tender after repeatedly ogling the drink menu. I wish I could give two ratings to this place. As a bar 5 stars. Drinks were well worth coming for. For people who complain about the price they are comparable to other quality drink places such as Acacia or Meat and Potatoes. As a food establishment I would give 3 stars, good not great. 

We went on a Thursday around 630. I will say the service to get our first drink took awhile give how few people there were, however the server was attentive after that. I will concur on some of the other reviews stating some of the staff seem more interested in talking to each other than serving customers. 

I had The Katherine, which tasted like an interesting take on a Manhatten , and the Don Lockwood , which was tasted mostly like a very smokey scotch with maple syrup. My wife had the Antifogmatic and the USS Richmond. Would recommend the latter, bit sweet but very good combo and flavors complement each other well. 

We both had burgers. Again good not great. Perhaps I've become spoiled with so many newer high quality burger joints like Wingharts and Burgatory. Though I will say you should add the potato wedges just for the garlic aoli sauce. Next time will have to try the small plates. 

Would go back for the drinks anytime, I do hope the service becomes better. I will say our drinks came fast after ordering , contrary to some reviews."}
{"text":"I dont know why everyone always gives this place such bad reviews. I have been here numerous times and every time I have excellent service, cocktails, and food. I love the ambiance and whole feel of the building. Makes you feel like you are at a comfortable speakeasy which is a breath of fresh air from the typical yinzer dive bar that litter our city. Also as a bartender myself, I appreciate the no standing policy they have in place. The last thing they would want to do after crafting over a cocktail for a large amount of time is to hear some dude sticking his arm thru the guests asking for a Miller Lite. Keep up the good work Tender. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the service and atmosphere. Elliot and Sarah were extremely helpful knowledgeable. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a true cocktail experience."}
{"text":"Went for drinks and we were very satisfied. Staff was really friendly and professional. We loved the creative cocktails and the vibe."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. It was during a Pens play off game so you could actually find a seat.  Beautiful venue.  Friendly hostess and bartender. No standing policy is strict.  So if you don't see a seat at the bar or lounge area or have a reservation, you'll have to come back another time. But this makes it nice for a place to actually have a conversation with someone.  You don't have to yell to talk to the person next to you.  

I ordered the Cold Snap.  If you like ginger snaps....this is wonderful.  Loved it.  Ordered the Tom & Rose second round and it was tasty.  Enjoyed the rosemary flavor.  My friend ordered a Mint Julep seeing as its Kentucky Derby time.  If nothing tickles your fancy on the menu, you can just ask the bartender to make you something special and surprise you....just give him/her your base alcohol that you enjoy and whether you like sweet, sour, herby, or spicy and they will come up with a magical drink.  The drinks are expensive, but worth it.  

My friend and I shared the meatloaf and hushpuppies.  The hushpuppies were good, but you definitely needed a dipping sauce since it is dry by nature.  Unfortunately, I hate ketchup (yes, I know I'm weird) and that was what it came with.  But one of the servers was happy to get me some aioli to accompany the pups.  The meatloaf was very good, as well as the little potato pillows that came with it.  We asked the size of the meatloaf and got 2 different answers.  The first answer was the most accurate; it was SMALL.  Splitting the meat loaf was like 3 bites each.  And for $12, you expect a little more.  I understand the concept of small plates, but for that size, it should be around $8 or $9.  So the only reason that I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is the price of the food to the portion size ratio.  Six bites of meatloaf and some potatoes pillows does not add up to $12 even though it was good.  We were told that the meat they used in the meatloaf was antelope.  This could be the reason for the higher price.....but it tasted like beef just the same.  So the total bill for the night for two people....for 6 drinks and 3 small plates came to over $100. I will come back here, but I'm going to have to make it more of a special occasion thing in order to not hurt the pocket book too badly."}
{"text":"This place is great if you like frozen, reheated bar food, warm beer and rude staff! We have been checking out various restaurants for restaurant week and we really, really wanted to go to Industry but it was just too busy so we bit the bullet and went to Tender.  We heard service was pretty lousy from other friends but we decided to get it a try.  Regrets!  Oh, the regrets!  

With this part of the city going through such a resurgence, it is a shame a place like this takes up so much real-estate.  Next time I won't waste my time driving into the city if this is what you get for all your time.  Next time I will just stay ip in Wexford where the owners and staff appreciate your business."}
{"text":"We tried Tender for the first time last weekend and loved it! Great spot to get guaranteed well made drinks. We went around 7:00pm and it was quite empty, however we were able to get a seat at the bar and befriend the bartenders. The nice part about Tender is the bartenders have a say in the drinks menu and each have their own unique drinks to try out. Additionally, they truly take the time to make a good drink and answer any questions you may have about the cocktails, liquor etc. A good bar has bartenders who aren't too busy to talk to their customers and know their liquor facts quite well. 

We also ordered dinner, which was good but not over the top great. I got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with pineapple and potato wedges, delicious! My boyfriend ordered the chicken pappardelle which was a huge portion and quite heavy. It needed a bit more sauce, but overall flavor was good!

Definitely would go back for drinks, but maybe a little later in the night when it's more lively."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks. Even the mocktails are the best and original. The food menu is small but power packed. I can highly recommend the hangar steak, totally worth the price. But stay away from the Shepherd's Pie, it's OK at best. 

The best place for cocktails in the city, hands down."}
{"text":"I wish there were a no stars option on Yelp. While the whiskey selection here is outstanding, none of the bartenders even know how to make a whiskey sour. My husband ordered a lemony whiskey drink that was so bad he couldn't drink it. I ordinarily would not waste my time writing a review because of a couple of bad drinks, but I feel that it is neccessary here because of the level of pretentiousness exuded by the entire staff.  They act like this is the premier and only bar of Pittsburgh, claiming they take reservations at 10:30 pm just to sit at the bar. Get over yourself, Tender. And swipe left."}
{"text":"... what is up with this place? I thought I'd give them another chance.  We've now been sitting here for 35 minutes without drinks. This is a bar, right? The sign outside says so. These drinks better be f-ing amazing."}
{"text":"Great addition to l-ville, but lacking for the time being. The cocktails are great and the bartenders are extremely friendly. The drinks however, take a long time, even with 3 bartenders. They stumble over each other from time to time, looking unorganized. I love the bar, but having to see a hostess to sit at the bar is weird. A bar is a bar. It is for people to network and mingle. Whether sitting or standing, a bar is where the energy is in the restaurant. The four dishes we ordered were good, but not great. The portions are too small. I don't know why people try to do tapas in Pittsburgh. Pittsburghers eat! They will still order multiple portions... So feed us. Mac & Cheese was cold and the hush puppies were like dense pieces of chalk. The pork was really good. I recommend this dish. The vegetarian chili was also very tasty. I am excited to go back, but education for the staff, better food presentation and a less aggressive hostess needs to improve before I do. Welcome to L-ville."}
{"text":"Tender sits in the heart of Lawrenceville as a renovated bank, making for an interesting and unique set up. Fantastic food is paired with equally well-crafted cocktails. Service is prompt and tailored to your needs but at the cost of limited seating. That coupled with steep prices made me ding a star off the rating. This place is well suited for a few friends or a date, just remember to make reservations- no standing room!

Ambience:
It's a small restaurant that's been fashioned from an old renovated bank. Definitely made for a unique feel but it's dressed up in an old school, classy kind of way. Dimly lit and matches the care and attention both you and your order gets.  Not so great for families and kids but perfect for a date or small group (3-4 people max). 

Food:
Since we went on a whim, we ended up sitting by the bar and ordering the Tender burger. For $11, it was very reasonably priced although many of the other dishes ranged from $20-30 and small plates seemed a bit skimpy on the portion. That being said, the burger was flavorful, well-seasoned and cooked perfectly. The potato skins were a must have for a side as well. One of the better burgers I've had around not due to originality but simply due to great ingredients and perfect execution. 

Drinks:
These will make me come back every night. Plenty of places in Pittsburgh offer unique, craft cocktails but this place by far gives them the love and care they deserve. A sign of that is the fact that the bartenders' names are listed on the menu. The waiters are well-versed in what they offer and make great recommendations. Despite having tried a few different ones, I can't get away from the Forty-Third Street. One of the best cocktails in Pittsburgh that I've had. Perfect for someone who likes bourbon and spices- the cardamom really evens out the bite."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner at Tender and we will be back.  We were immediately seated and impressed with the options for cocktails.  Our waiter was one of the best; he was very knowledgable as he guided us through the options for drinks and food.  He was always  available but never hovering. The drinks were great!  We ended up with burgers, which were ok.  There are  too many burger choices in Pittsburgh today.  We will return for the other dinner choices, though."}
{"text":"We went to Tender on one of their pre-launch nights. This is a great place and I think, once fully up and running (with full menu), this will be the next hot spot in Pittsburgh. We tried some cocktails, which were inventive and delicious. The food we sampled was also great--designed for sharing, we devoured mini lobster rolls, among other things. The menu was bar food. I'm looking forward to seeing how this evolves once they are post-launch. 

This is a great addition to the higher end bar/restaurant scene in Pittsburgh. Service was also friendly and informative. My go to place remains Bar Marco because they have demonstrated their ability to stay at the top of their game (and improve) over the year or so they have graces Pittsburgh with their presence. I'm sure that Tender will be one of those great places too. Exciting that there are now at least two fantastic places where you can get amazing cocktails and great food in a sophisticated and cool environment without TV screens playing sports."}
{"text":"Draconian Chair Policy

We were excited to stop in before Tender's impending closure, hoping to try one of their famous cocktails, yet, were stymied by an event I can only describe as springing from the mind of Larry David.  After we were seated, we realized that we may need an additional chair for a friend who was on the way.  (Now, before I go forward, let me be clear that I understand that this initial mistake was completely on us.)  We noticed an empty seat across the room from our table, which was not being used by the three other patrons occupying the table.  When we approached the waitress about potentially securing an additional seat, we were told she would have to ask her manager. \"Not a problem\"--we naively thought.  

After waiting approximately ten minutes (I can only imagine the amount of deliberation that must have taken place over this logistical nightmare), the manager approached our table, informing us that we would be unable to secure an additional seat due to a two-hour wait--even though we had casually strolled into the bar minutes earlier and were seated immediately.  (There was also an empty, unused chair behind us).  Keep in mind, we were all okay with the fact that we could not get an additional seat--this was not a problem for us.  One of our party suggested that it was okay, he would just stand and leave the chair for the member who had yet to arrive.  I can only guess this proved to be an insult to the establishment, as the manager condescendingly stated that \"We don't do that here\" and \"that won't work\".  My friend, giving the manager the benefit of the doubt and thinking that she meant he could not stand on the well-trafficked side of the table, offered to stand in the corner by the table instead.  This suggestion (which came about due to confusion on my friend's part) was met with a derisive, \"We can go back and forth about this all night, sir\".  A surprising response, considering no one was argumentative with the manager--we had just assumed that one person would be able to give their chair up for another, like 99% of the other bars and restaurants in the city. 

After being lectured about the bar's full capacity as being an additional reason for ChairGate 2017, while also observing no less than two empty chairs at otherwise-occupied tables, the manager left.  Cue the \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" theme, as, within five minutes, another customer from a table on the opposite end of the room casually strolled up to the table behind us, inquired directly to the individuals seated there about using their extra chair, and was rewarded with an extra seat.  It should be noted that both the manager and waitress who \"helped\" us entered the room multiple times after this, with the manager standing where the offending chair used to be, and the waitress partially kneeling on the borrowed chair (which also sat empty at its new home)--both, either none-the-wiser, or uncaring.  

Morale of the story: it is better to ask forgiveness than permission.  Also, Tender seems to have become a victim of its own success."}
{"text":"THE BEST BAR AND RESTAURANT IN PITTSBURGH RIGHT NOW! 
THE BARTENDERS ARE THE BEST IN THE CITY AND THE CHEF IS THE BEST KEPT SECRET IN THE BURG!

Hi My Loves!

This is a big deal! My super fans know you have to be ::gasp:: EPIC - to get 5 stars from me!

I have been waiting a long time to write this review because:
1) I take my writing career (or lack there of!) very seriously when it comes to reviewing excellent places.
2) I constantly go here and have one great experience after the next to add to this review.

Life in the past year has been a winding road of fun and fascinating experiences and Tender has been on that road with me! I started off the year here having dinner with an old friend and it kicked off this great new love affair with the whiskey bar trend and a new chef that is keeping a big secret - he's a fucking genius!

All I can recall from that initial dinner...was some warm fuzzy alcohol induced memories...NO (;
What I recall was a deliciously executed fish dish and really artful cocktails.
I was hooked!

Since then I feel I go there every couple weeks and have dinner and drinks and great conversation with cool patrons and AMAZING bartenders. ::IN MY OPRAH VOICE:: I HAVE FOUND MY ELEGANT DELICIOUS VERSION OF CHEERS - I AM A SEXY BLONDE NORM! YES! ha!

About the drinks...

The staff here is incredible, they contribute new and interesting cocktail recipes and execute classics to a T! I'm not a big drinker - PER SAY! But historically, I'm not a brave drinker. I don't always try a lot of new things. I stick with standards - Girl drinks, whiskey drinks and  CHAMPAGNE! (I sound like a snob huh?!) AB FAB FANS...I would be Patsy! 

I have to give MAJOR props to Elliot, one of the bartenders, who has taken me out of a rut and has me trying new things constantly. 

Drinks I recommend:
1) Pizzelle cocktail: Elliot and their bar manager have biscotti liqueur! Old ladies everywhere rejoice...but don't you dare order the last 2 bottles that remain in Philadelphia (thanks a lot stupid Pennsylvania State Stores). Tastes like a cookie! Suck those cocktails down ladies!

2) Red Vespa cocktail: Lower alcohol content for when you wanna have a cheese plate for dessert. Campari and Coffee Liqueur! I call this the Betty Draper breakfast drink. It's like a boozy coffee that if I had a bender in the 1950s at my Nantucket beach house with the Kennedy's ...I'd wanna wake up with this!!! With my cigarette and my shot gun and my foo foo neglig√©e! I wish I could imbed pictures in my reviews so you can see my crazy visions! If you get these cultural references -I LOVE YOU!

3) Fly By Night Cocktail: Black strap molasses rum and lots of lime! It tastes like a tropical gingerbread house. I would never even think up this wild combination but it is excellent!

4)Classic Daiquiri...of the non-CHI-CHI's variety!!!! This brings me to a key point of Tender, the execution of true classic recipes refined. These daiquiri's are the purest interpretation and not the gross chain restaurant butchering. I can sip these back effortlessly! 

About the food:

I have NEVER had one thing here that wasn't exceptional! This food is on par with much bigger /famous restaurants. And as I write this I want it to remain my delicious secret and yet fear masses of housewife asses will flock here and somehow ruin it. Stay away housewives! You are too old and uncool, you lack tattoos and trendy Goodwill store reimagined fashion. Keep your pearls and Kate Spade bags away! Be gone!

That said...! Some foodie hightlights...homemade pretzels are good to keep up your drink buzz without getting too boozy. Every fish dish I have ever had there is perfectly cooked, light and balanced. I've had homemade pasta thats just so light and delicious. Their roasted chicken that's a usual standby on the menu is anything but a standby! Everything is like you're eating at the chef's table. Simple but delicious recipes that are elevated and elegant without being pretentious. 

I can't say enough good things about the bartenders! Elliot, Craig and Hannah make it an art and an experience for patrons.

Please go here! This is my favorite restaurant of the year in Pittsburgh. AND if you see this fabulous long haired, big boobed, beautiful blonde, laughing at the end of the bar...it's me! Come buy me a drink! ;)

Love you!
Muah"}
{"text":"Great food! Great drinks! We had the rouse and aviation cocktails, winter salad, beef tartar, duck and pork. Beef tartar was okay but everything else was great. Very good service!"}
{"text":"We brunch a lot. A LOT. Easily one of my favorites. Bloody Mary is on the ahort list for best in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a drink with my friend one night as we were walking around in Lawrenceville. She told me that it's usually very busy and booked, but it was later in the evening so we decided to give it a try. We walked in and I immediately noticed how interesting and fun the inside of this place is. I heard it was an old bank converted into Tender. There is still a huge safe in the bar area and its definitely a conversation piece. Anyways, I digress... :) They had openings and we were able to be seated outside. They had a lot of drink options, but not an overwhelming amount. I apologize, but I forget the drink that I ordered, but I will say it was delicious. The presentation is subtle but creative. I didn't try any food as we had eaten earlier in the evening, but I would love to go back and try the food there. Overall, I think it's a great place to meet up with friends, and I would definitely go back. The staff was super sweet also!"}
{"text":"We were there on Saturday, around 10pm, and were delighted to be seated without any booking. The only seats were in the backroom  - usually I hate backrooms, you are far from the action, they are uncomfi, waiters forget about you, but the backroom at Tender is just fine with nice lounge style seats. So no reason to complain.

The cocktails were all tasty, some very good. And we sampled 6-7 this evening. They also have some punch - beware headaches next morning. 

The main room is beautiful, and the bar gorgeous. The service was ok, but not fantastic. 

It's not cheap, but the cocktails are worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, good drinks! Great place for friends to meet. We had a small engagement party here in the downstairs room which was absolutely wonderful. Very charming and cozy. We had our own bartender and good appetizers. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh. The atmosphere is relaxing and intimate. The cocktail list is extensive, but easy to navigate, and the drinks are always perfect. The food is impressive too. Try getting multiple small plates and dessert."}
{"text":"To qualify, I have technically only had one cocktail here, but was very satisfied with the experience.  Of course, I got to try sips of all the others at the table, which gave me more data on the cocktail quality beyond my one drink.  :)  I had the Immortality juice, which sounded light and refreshing but was boozier than expected.  Very tasty and balanced, however.  They seem to make things on the tarter side, which suits my taste just fine.  All the others I tasted were similarly well balanced.  The place has that prohibition-era feel to it, which by now is nothing new, but it is beautiful and cozy inside.  Service was very friendly and prompt.  I would definitely go back anytime when I'm in town!  Good to see Pittsburgh getting some great cocktail places!  I would love to try the food too..."}
{"text":"Really cool place! The bar was as impressive and unique as the drinks it produced. The food was followed suit in creativity and taste. The deconstructed banana split was amazing. I would be happy to return."}
{"text":"I absolutely love a finely crafted cocktail, and can get one here. I bring my out-of-town friends here when they're visiting and they're always impressed by the drinks and the ambiance."}
{"text":"We had a lovely time at Tender last night, mainly because of our super cool waiter/bartender, Mark.  He was smart, fun, funny and cool.  We LOVED our drink selections that HE chose for us.  I will say that the prices are too high.  Nice, nice atmosphere however, the decor doesn't warrant a tab of 30 bucks for 2 drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a couple of cocktails with a friend after putting it on my list a few months ago. I was expecting an experience a bit different than what I got. While the interior was nice, I was kind of expecting a bit more of an upscale vibe and drink menu- however, the drinks were mostly tropical and fruity and the bartenders were wearing Hawaiian shirts. I had no problem with this, but the prices (and decor) should be in agreement with the drinks and dress code of the staff. Overall, I didn't know what kind of bar/restaurant Tender was gunning for- is it more of a laid back tropical oasis in the middle of Lawrenceville or is it upscale and trendy with a tropical infusion? I really had no idea. Maybe if I would have taken a look at the food menu I would have gotten a better idea, but I left after one cocktail (which I had no complaints about)."}
{"text":"Went here the other night with my girlfriend. A friend of ours was raving about it so we had to see what all the hype was. Was she ever right! Place was awesome! Drinks were amazing, staff was great, we got the ice cream...whoa, mind blowing. Even in the cold weather I would eat 12 more servings."}
{"text":"It's quickly becoming a pet peeve of mine that bars are not allowing patrons to be seated within the hours that they advertise on their doors.  Multiple patrons were still seated at the bar enjoying their drinks and yet I was turned away 40 minutes before Tender was supposed to close.  I suggest not going there late on a weekday night because it will be a waste of your trip.  The interior is unique and it is a bar I'm sure that is worth a visit once but the hours they list are deceptive."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, tasty food and cocktails done right! I would return!"}
{"text":"If you're a man who wears form fitting vests and bow-ties who likes to get creative with his facial hair and wait forever to be served high priced cocktails, this is the place for you.

If you're a woman who likes to dress as a character on a television show set in the early 60's except that you're covered in tattoos, this is the place for you.

I kid the hipsters, but that's not why this place gets 3 stars (3.5 would be more accurate, but forced to choose, 3 is truer than 4).  No, the reason for the middling review is that when I arrived with my three friends on a Friday at about midnight to a bar with a light crowd, I had to wait over 15 minutes to be served.  We sat at the bar where one man was washing glasses/straightening up, and two women behind the bar were chatting about something relatively amusing and checking facebook/texting.  

At first I was mildly amused, then after 5-8 minutes simply couldn't believe nobody asked us for our order - I mean they do get to keep the tips right?  After about 15 minutes I argued we should leave.  My friend then addressed the bartender and asked for us to be served. 

There was no demanding crowd.  The people behind the bar weren't hustling.  They just let us sit there.  Perhaps we were treated this way because we buy our clothes at Nordstom's and not some Brooklyn flea market specializing in vintage whatever - I don't know.

The room is very nice and seems like a great location for a bar/restaurant.  Prices were high but not outrageous given the room.

Had drinks the same night at Hambone's and  Industry Public House - both across the street from Tender and they both were great if very different bars."}
{"text":"Tender makes cocktails extremely well, has a fantastic selection of modern and classic cocktails to choose from, and a solid liquor collection (e.g., PVW 23). My favorite cocktails are the Corpse Reviver #2 (gin and absinthe) and the Vieux Carre (rye whisky and cognac). They have excellent lighter stuff as well. It takes a while to prepare these cocktails. On busy nights, it can take more than 30 minutes. The food consists mostly of smaller plates of appetizers with a gourmet twist on low-brow local specialties.

Of the bars in Pittsburgh, Tender has one of the best atmospheres. The interior is decorated in a 1920's bank theme. You sit on comfy sofas or around the bar at white leather chairs, and the lighting and sound level are comfortable. Cozy, but you can still have a conversation. Definitely good for a night out with friends or a romantic date."}
{"text":"Incredible cocktails! The staff is extremely knowledgeable about each and every drink and can expertly walk you through the extensive drink menu. Classy and timeless while being modernly adventurous simultaneously."}
{"text":"Oh how I adore you craft cocktails!  The cost of a drink is steep, but so i the content of alcohol.  The bartenders really know what they're doing!
I've tried nearly everything that involved cider, whisky, and vodka.  
The Wooden Nickle has been one of my favorite go to's since this place opened.

The food i constantly changing, it went for bad, to alright, to passable.  I hear they're changing to menu and chef again so perhaps this will lead to more delectable things to come.  

Lets talk decor, though.  Besides the cocktails their attention to detail in the decor is divine.  The staff is kind, generous, and very welcoming.  Quick to offer suggestions, and quicker to say \"Oh!  That drink is my favorite on the menu\" when you order.  They're encouraging.  The chairs are comfortable, the couches are cloud like, and the repurposed checks and vault is just incredible.  I love this place for all of that.

Since I'm not the richest of people, it's hard for me to justify spending a good $75 on cocktails alone (we always have to get more than 1!) but it's a great treat and definitely a place I would suggest ending or beginning your night with."}
{"text":"I helped to host a private party (a bachelorette) and it was wonderful and Jason Carr, the manager, was extremely hospitable and welcoming and I would recommend anyone doing a private party here!"}
{"text":"A friend and I made reservations here during Restaurant Week. The atmosphere was welcoming, if a bit sterile-feeling, but the drinks were tasty and potent. I started with the Pickle Plate, which had a variety of pickled veggies. For my entree I had the  pan-seared trout with barley risotto. It was nicely prepared and very tasty. For dessert I had the key lime pie (because I can never say \"no\" to key lime pie).

Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I'm definitely looking forward to returning and trying the regular menu."}
{"text":"I am LOVING this place. Had no idea it was doing a soft opening (they officially open on 4/5), and wandered in. The decor is stunning, and has a great 1920s vibe. Super high ceilings, great looking bar. It's located in an old bank (hence the fun name), which helps to maintain an austere and civilized ambiance. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the acoustics were manageable, since most of the new places in Pittsburgh seem to be extremely loud.

The staff are very friendly (still have a few kinks to work out in terms of timing, but that's OK), and the drinks are all phenomenal. I haven't had the food yet, but spoke with some other patrons who did have a meal, and they said that the food was very good. All of the food is based on regional specialties from around the States. And, all of the food is made from scratch in house. If the food is as carefully attended to as the drinks, then I think we have a real winner!

Can't wait to come back, and am so excited to see this new addition to the Pittsburgh food scene!"}
{"text":"Tender is a wonderful addition to the Pittsburgh bar scene! They have extensive collection of bourbons and other drinks that you can't find anywhere else. They're trying to bring old drinks that folks from our generation never heard of and make them popular again which is really cool! The cocktails are very unique and tasty! The food menu is small, but every item we tried was fantastic! The ambiance is the best part! It's very retro Speakeasy like, with very beautiful interior design. They successfully kept the beauty of the original retro place; they even created a really beautiful wall using old checks from the old bank that used to occupy this space in the old days! There was a Bluegrass band playing when we were there on a Tuesday night. I hope they start bringing jazz musicians too!!
I would definitely go back and bring more friends. It's perfect if you're not starving (because the portions are small) and craving excellent cocktails! 
My only advice to the owner is to educate the bartenders and servers more about the history of this place, and the retro drinks!"}
{"text":"My review is a bit sorted since I believe that I went about my first experience entirely wrong. I did not get the memo that the only food they serve are \"small plates\" and I don't think they do a great job at making that known on their menu, so you depend on listening to the server. Anyways, the only reason this was a problem was because we had our reservations on their grand opening night at 6:30, which was exactly when I wanted to eat dinner. This is personal opinion, but I hate small plate restaurants. You pay a lot of money (particularly here) for less food, and I'm not into sharing. 

The food: I was there with a larger party and the only food I ordered was a bowl of chips. It was a small bowl and $5. I ordered this before knowing it was all small plates, but from the critiques of the others, I didn't miss much. The chips were OK, just plain, regular chips. Not worth $5. The mac & cheese (maybe a cup and a half) was $10 and had a funny taste. Some others in the party enjoyed what they got, and in the future I'll branch out.

The drinks: Mine were good. I ordered the Cold Snap (super gingery) and the Penny Farthing. Some of my friends disliked their drinks, but I think this is natural when you're trying a place known for interesting mixes. The only issue is that the drinks are pricey, so you might not really be able to order several types and try a bunch. They definitely knew what they were doing with drinks .. but I was hoping, since that seems to be the purpose of Tender.

Overall: I wouldn't come back for food, only drinks. I spent over $30 for 2 drinks and a bowl of chips, and then headed over to Industry for a burger, fries, half an appetizer, and a beer for $26, which seemed a little more worth it. I probably would have had a different experience at 8 or 9 pm, after having dinner. I'm not in a hurry to go back and I feel the prices did not quite match with the area."}
{"text":"Old bank turned bar with a great atmosphere. Bartenders are very friendly! Wonderful selection of good quality liquor in unique and convenient location! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The only place in Pittsburgh I would go to just for the pickles. The cocktails are interesting and delicious. It's very trendy, and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite cocktail place in Pittsburgh. All the bartenders are very experienced, so don't be afraid to order off the menu. The food is pretty delicious too -- they have one or two entrees which vary each day."}
{"text":"Recently I visited Tender to celebrate a friend's birthday. I forgot that I had visited this spot months ago.  Not sure how that happened but here's what went down...

First, parking to go anywhere in Lawrenceville on a Saturday night is challenging. Patience and circling the block a few times earned me a parking space in front of Arsenal Lanes which is basically Tender's neighbor. 

Tender is housed in an old bank that has been transformed into a sexy bar/restaurant. There are couch, table and booth style seats adjacent to the long bar. There is also a dining area away from the bar in a second room in the back where I dined on my first visit.   In my opinion, that area is nice for a date because it's dark and has a nice vibe to it with the high ceiling, raised windows and intimate seating. Sitting at a table near the bar allows you to people watch and socialize which is always fun.

Craft cocktails seem to be all the rage here and they're proud of it. There are many different combinations and their spirit list is fairly long. Tell your server what some of your favorite flavors are and they will recommend something amazing. 

Now, about the food. The charcuterie plate...just get it. You get a decent sampling of meats and cheeses with toasted baguette slices and stone ground mustard, olive tapenade and apple butter, sliced apples and blackberries. It was $28 but worth every penny for a tasty shareable app. I ordered their veggie sammy sans the challah bun and opted to have it served on lettuce. This fried green tomato, fried egg, gouda, sauteed onion, avocado and frisee stacker with a side of tequila-poblano remoulade was ridiculously good. It also came with parmesan fries and more of that delicious stone ground mustard. I found myself using more of the mustard over the remoulade. Delicious! Dessert was a few mini donuts with squash ice cream. The donuts tasted like balls of decedent french toast. The ice cream was reminiscent of spiced pumpkin. If you see it on the menu when you visit, just go ahead and order it....you won't regret it. 

Lastly, the folks working here are very proud of their business and they should be. It's a great place to chill or dine and the service is amazeballs. Go see for yourself."}
{"text":"There is nothing that I can say  that hasn't already been said. The liquor selection is fantastic, the food is almost always amazing, the bartenders are fantastic and incredibly knowledgeable, the owner is often there to ensure things go smoothly, everyone is nice, blah blah blah. Oh, and the no standing room policy? I dig it. You yoga/sweat pants wearing people might not, but it's nice to be able to enjoy yourself somewhere that isn't packed to the gills."}
{"text":"The drinks and bar here are amazing.  The design of the space is excellent.  That said the food is only ok.  I would suggest this as a good bar to get a pre-dinner drink or somewhere to go after dinner for a nightcap."}
{"text":"If I could rank this with zero stars, I would.  From hostess to server to the manager, every person was extremely pretentious and acted accordingly. I've never been treated with such disrespect in my life and the level of rudeness is unbelievable. 

Let me paint a picture for you.  My wife, 2 friends, and I went out to dinner in Lawrenceville, and then we were going to get a drink afterwards at Industry, a bar across the street from Tender. Industrt was at capacity, so we decided to walk across the street to check out Tender. As soon as we walked in, the hostess glared at us as if we were lowly servants that belonged in the gallows. Since we already ate, we asked if we could stand at the bar and have a drink. They said, no one is allowed to stand at the bar and we would have to be seated. They lead us to a corner table where we each ordered a drink and a dessert. After the waiter took our order, his spider sense somehow alerted him that we were \"too intoxicated to be served\" and proceeded to have the manager throw us out. 

We were of course shocked because we just came from dinner where it was BYOB and we split 1 bottle of wine between 4 people over the course of a 2 hour dinner. We obliged without incident and as we walked out, we felt embarrassed and awfully mistreated by this obnoxious manager and walked back in to inform them that what they had done was extremely rude and misguided. Granted they cannot serve people who are intoxicated but any person who had the slightest bit of common sense or experience in the restaurant industry can tell the difference. 

How were we treated when we walked back in to relay our displeasure, the manager said we are keeping the \"Riff Raff\" out of this place. If four 30-something's are \"Riff Raff\" then this stuck up, pretentious bar can serve its desired clientale and then close in 6 months. Don't worry kids, the \"Riff Raff\" will bail you out when you default on your bills and the bank seizes the property."}
{"text":"The cocktails here are always inventive and delicious. The staff is really friendly and nice too- last time I went here my friend spilled his cocktail as soon as he got it and they were happy to provide a refill at no charge. I can't commend on the food since I have only been here for drinks, but it looks great on the neighboring tables."}
{"text":"Overly pricey,  not very friendly. Very strict about who can stand where in a crowded bar."}
{"text":"I've been to Tender a few times now, and have had the pleasure of enjoying a different seasonal cocktail menu each time. Cocktails are reasonably priced ($10-$12 on average), and the focus on quality liquor paired with seasonal ingredients shines through. The ambiance makes for a cozy night out (Tender is housed in an old bank and retains a kind of old-timey ambiance with dark furnishings and those bank teller-looking lamps). I hadn't enjoyed their food menu until this past Saturday night, when I splurged on the Tender Burger, which was cooked to a perfect on-the-medium-rare-side-of-medium with delicious cheddar, caramelized onion, and pickled fennel to round out the richness of the meat and the pub sauce on the top side of housemade challah (yum). Not sure how good Tender would be for a larger group, but would highly recommend for a date night or a night out with a few buddies."}
{"text":"Definitely worth it to go on the first Tuesday of every month when they have LIVE MUSIC (old-time violin and banjo). I wish they had it more often; it is perfect for the ambiance, Great place for a date."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times for dinner and late night drinks and the atmosphere is amazing! They have an extensive cocktail menu and the bartenders are very friendly & knowledgeable. Haven't had a bad cocktail here yet!

The surrounding lawrenceville area is also nice if you want to check out some small eclectic shops, eat some food, or bar hop"}
{"text":"I want to give this a 5 for cocktails and the bar but food just does not live up. Drinks we had wine and cocktails were all amazing. They really had someone select some awesome table wines. Food however, like everyone says - super small portions. I had to stop at wendys after because I was starving - after 50 bucks on dinner.

Mac and cheese - nothing special. basically pasta with panko topping; really lacked flavor

beef on wreck - tasty but so incredibly salty

strip district salad - extremely disappointed by the description and the name which lead me to believe I was getting a true pittsburgh salad; instead, I got beets and dandelion greens? None of that was listed in the description nor is anything about that pittsburgh in origin!

lobster rolls - amazing - I can see why on a few nights they have sold out of these

beignets - I went with a friend who is from the south - she was extremely disappointed when they arrived - the coffee chicory sauce is terribly bitter and the dough was dried out. The server could tell we did not like them and offered us the banana split. This was very tasty but was presented as a deconstructed banana split - again nothing in the description. It was perhaps half of a banana with 2 scoops of ice cream each the size of my thumb. Great tasting but looked like melted soup on the plate.

In conclusion - they really need to work on this food menu - the tapas style american cuisine is counterintuitive and not going to work. perhaps they should put a real menu with apps salads entrees etc or just focus on small appetizer plates. Im just confused with what they are trying to do. 

I was not aware of this \"standing room not allowed at the bar\" but thats just ridiculous. Its def not a bar then and they should ditch that idea asap"}
{"text":"We went for dinner here on a Monday evening around 8:30 and were seated immediately. We were both astonished with the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant and declared we loved it before we sat down. The place seemed massive. 

Our waitress was friendly and answered our questions we had. I thought the service was exceptional and everyone who worked there was very polite. 

We ordered the Buffalo Chicken Dip with pita bread and it was amazing. Out waitress brought us more bread to finish it off!

I got the Pulled Turkey sandwich and it was good. I felt a little full from the Dip so I didn't eat much of it. 

Everyone seemed to rave about the wedges. I'm not sure why. There wasn't anything amazing about them so that was a disappointment.

All in all, I think Tender is a good place if you'ee looking for ambience and atmosphere but the food was sort of average. To me, I feel like there's nothing to really draw me back."}
{"text":"Awesome food, cocktails, and service. Live music sometimes. Love the vegetarian burger."}
{"text":"My friends and I always enjoy our time at this bar. The bartenders and waiters are all extremely knowledgeable about the drinks and are very helpful when guiding your selection based on what you like. Watching them make the drinks is fun too because they all rather intricate. 

Last time I went I had the sun never sets, which would be perfect for a summer drink (it's blended). I've also enjoyed their Buffalo Chicken Dip in the past!"}
{"text":"Timely that the opening of this establishment coincides with the release of Gatsby.  Why?  This place is fancy and has that old-school look to it.  From the very obvious regal maroon walls to the more subtle additions including a type-writer posted on a ledge behind one of the booths, this place is fancy.  They should have kicked me out for walking in here with hospital scrubs on...

Luckily they were kind enough to let me be and allow me to stimulate the local economy.  Four of us were able to enjoy an early dinner one weeknight evening.  We shared numerous plates including the mac n' cheese, hush puppies, vegetarian chili, among others.  The menu is unique in that food offerings are stratified across geographical regions-a very different and creative way of doing things.  All dishes were tasty and hit the spot.  

What perhaps makes Tender even more unique are the cocktails.  Very unique selection, carefully crafted, perfectly executed...can't really think of any other places around here that compete.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy dining in Pittsburgh, but this establishment has more of a NYC/DC/NYC/Chicago/LA feel to it.  It's super fancy, high-end...blown away.

Pittsburgh needs more places like this.  It's a great addition to the neighborhood.  Don't come here expecting a cheap meal.  Don't come here expecting to get super full off your meal.  Don't come here for leftovers.  If you want a good bang for your buck, take your game to a dive bar.   Expect to spend about $30-40/person for a satisfying meal with a drink.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"Went to Tender this past Friday. The location is good, right in the heart of Lawrenceville, but parking could be an issue depending on when you visit. I was fortunately able to find a spot on Butler St. I had made a reservation and recommend you do the same. The space inside the restaurant is very small and I only saw about 12 tables, mostly 2 tops. The service at this restaurant is top notch! Super friendly and attentive without being overly attentive. At first glance I thought the menu was limited and very basic, but the overall quality and flavor of the dishes proved to me that sticking to what you excel at is a good idea. We started out with the potato skins appetizer. Although I was expecting more than just the potatoes with chives and a dipping sauce, the flavor and texture were great. She had the burger and I had the NY Strip. The burger had the best flavors of any burger ever. The server said the secret \"pub sauce\" gives it its unique flavor. It was amazing. The NY Strip had excellent flavor as well. It was cooked perfectly rare as I had requested. The steak came with some fingerling potatoes and an eggplant medley which when paired with the steak created the most unique and flavorful combination. I loved it. The beer and cocktail selections are good too. We were too full for desert. Overall this was a great experience. When I first saw the basic menu, I was a bit disappointed, but once I received my food and tasted the quality and flavorful execution I was won over. The service was top notch. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, and I will certainly plan to return."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here late on a Saturday after hitting up a few other bars in the area.  I have wanted to try Tender for a while but it never seemed to work out so I took this opportunity to make sure we stopped by before heading home for the evening.

It was late probably close to 11, and they close at 12.  Maybe for this reason I believe we were the only patrons in the place.  The bartender, though he said his name but I can't remember, was really great.  He engaged us in conversation and made me a great cocktail an Old Pal, I love my ryes. I am pretty sure this place is more known for their extensive cocktails than their food.   He chatted with us like we had been friends forever.  Nice guy who really made the experience a lot of fun.

They serve a limited late night menu and this was perfect since we were starting to get hungry.  We ordered the Tender Burger to split.  It didn't come with any sides which was kind of disappointing for the price.  However the burger really hit the spot.  I am looking forward to a return visit, perhaps a full on dinner is in order."}
{"text":"Another victim of the nyt article. Excited to dig in here after our flight to Pittsburgh. We had reservations, and they sounded busy when we called to see if we could move our reservation up, (we couldn't) but really weren't busy when we got there. 

First, drinks. Lion's tail was quality. Martinez well made. Second round not as good (weird, hunh?) horses neck had that weird bar sour taste. Aviator was kinda same. 

Food: charcuterie plate, $28, we're thinking \"sounds big, might be the Denny's grand slam of fine charcuterie\". What showed up was a dusting of home plate. Although each item was quality, the baseball analogy had us thinking cocktail frank vs foot long. Highlight of the game was the pickles - especially the tomatoes, however the stadium was less then half full. Second inning: no runs (ribeye sandwich), no hits (veggie burger), no nothing (burger). One all-star was the pickled fennel on the buns, but the mushrooms slid into second base in a double play. 

Total for three approached box suite status, but no home run."}
{"text":"Drinks here aren't cheap (~$10) but the quality of the product is well worth it. I particularly like the Clover club, which is a nice refreshing Gin drink made with egg whites. It's a nice break from the normal cranberry vodkas I get. You can get all sorts of other cocktails and their main focus is on whiskey. The food is delicious and they usually serve three or four large plates a day and some smaller appetizers. I've had the lamb and the duck confit (~$20) and both are really good. Their burger is also excellent and Mondays are Burger night, where they have a variety of burgers available for cheap (~$7). It does get pretty busy so reservations are recommended unless you can get there early."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the atmosphere here. The bar is gorgeous, and the back room is intimate and lovely. Very relaxed but chic, with a cool vibe and killer cocktail menu. Though I am a hardcore fan of Bar Marco's cocktails, Tender is definitely a major contender in the Pittsburgh craft cocktail scene. The bartenders obviously know what they are doing and take pride in making sure that each cocktail is unique and delicious. The drink menu includes comments from the bartenders, which is awesome and gives more insight into the creation and enjoyment of each cocktail. I have loved every drink that I have had here!  

Now, the food, while good, could definitely be better. The portions are small, as others have mentioned which doesn't bother me but might those who are looking for a more substantial meal. I will say though that the servers and kitchen staff are also very willing and helpful when dealing with my food allergies; the last time I went my food was prepared incorrectly and they immediately fixed the issue and took half off the dish on our bill. I had the pork, which was good but not amazing (I'm sure it would have been better with all of the toppings added that I had to eliminate!).

This is an amazing spot for a romantic date or a relaxed night out. The last time we were there, my boyfriend and I were amazed that the place was not very busy for a Friday night. This place should be hopping, and we hope that more people discover this wonder soon!....Or do we want to keep this gem to ourselves? :)"}
{"text":"Best cocktails in Pittsburgh.

No lie.

When you ask someone in Pittsburgh to make a caiparinha and they do it as good as the guy on the beach in Brazil and you're immediately taken back to the beaches of Bahia - you've stumbled upon a magical place my friends.

That's how I test you by the way...\"I'd like a caiparinha.\" If you look like an Obama fan the day Trump won, then you don't know wtf you're doing.

Having said that, the first sip of this magically concocted drink was impetus enough to devour the entire cocktail menu.

Didn't care for the \"kitchen\" part at this point; although I will say the plates coming in and out of the kitchen did look quite tasty. The items seemed gastro pubby. 

Anyhow I ordered two more drinks of the menu, both rum based, and both phenomenal. The Sheriff drink and the Ten Wands drink. 

Beautifully made cocktails in a very dim, sexy, intimate, and trendy atmosphere. 

Perfect spot for a date or pre-outing cocktail with friends. Space seemed limited so maybe call ahead for bigger groups?

Otherwise park your rear at the bar and prepare to make your liver and taste buds simultaneously smile. 

Like this, =)"}
{"text":"I love the range of atmospheres you get on different days. On a slow weeknight, you might have bartenders dressed in flannel, playing Morrissey on the turntable. On weekends, you'll have folks dressed to the nines while big band plays, bustling about as they sling carefully crafted cocktails to a packed house.

If you've read my reviews before, you know I like to keep the company of bartenders. I love watching the combination of speed and precision, the slight technique variations, and of course the education. That's what I feel like I get when I visit Tender -- an education in how flavors might unexpectedly combine, and how to do it myself as well. The bartenders are welcoming and assuming the place isn't totally packed, happy to shoot the breeze with you about the background of a drink, or a spirit, or talk personal preference. For a budding cocktail enthusiast, it's a great environment.

The \"kitchen\" part of Tender Bar & Kitchen is clearly secondary to the cocktails, but the small bites they serve are always satisfying."}
{"text":"Tender is quickly becoming my favorite go to bar and restaurant. The atmosphere cannot be beat. It is like walking into some bar of yesteryear but not in a pretentious way. This old bank converted to bar/restaurant has live music- piano player, bluegrass, they tweet what's going on. The bartenders mix up craft cocktails so delicious I cannot believe my eyes. And the food is delicious!

The fun thing about Tender is while I've been there with a friend and we had a great time, and I've also had a great experience just grabbing a meal at the bar. My bar neighbors were very friendly, and my bar tender Sarah took excellent care of me. 

The drinks are fancy, delicious, and pack some serious power. For this lightweight about 2 and I'm flagged. The food is divine, pulling from different areas of Americana and dishing up some truly awesome eats. I had what may become my favorite cheeseburger there the other day and I can't say enough good things about it. I must return and have it again.

It is not a cheap place, but you are paying for the quality that is in every step of your visit, the skill that is put into your drink, and into every step of your meal. They aim to take proper care of you, and I believe it's worth it. To summarize: I dig what they are doing here in a very big way, and I think you would dig it too."}
{"text":"YUM. My husband and I went with another couple, and we all really wished this place was around in our drinking days! The drinks were awesome and so interesting. The dining room is dark and each table is fairly private, it was a very cozy spot to enjoy company. The menu is small but excellent, all of our dishes from the salad to the burger to steak sandwich were high quality with unique flavors. Butler street has so many interesting places, and most of them really gives the Pittsburgh food scene a boost. Tender is certainly one to try! We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance. Disappointed by the food. 
Hubs and I met a couple friends at Tender during restaurant week. The menu listed on the restaurant week website did not look very appealing to me but the regular menu had some interesting finds that I thought would be tasty. Upon arrival, we found out that the only menu they had was their restaurant week menu and some bar snacks. Not to mention that the restaurant week menu was not the same as what was listed on the website. Therefore, if you wanted to eat a meal, you only had the restaurant week menu option which was $25 for an app, entree and dessert. There were three selections for app and entree and two for dessert. I had the hot chicken for an app. Reminded me of a spicy boneless wing. The burger for entree which I ended up giving half to hubs because he did not care for his pasta dish. I tried the pasta and had to pass as well. (And this coming from a carb addict!) For dessert, I had the gingersnap and peach ice cream sandwich. The ice cream was melted and the cookies were hard. On the other hand, I repeatedly stole bites of hubs deconstructed key lime pie which I usually hate. The highlight of our meal, the beer our server suggested to us which I can not remember for the life of me!  All in all, Tender seems like a good place to get a drink and a snack before or after a meal. If I do return, I will do so on a full stomach."}
{"text":"I wish i could say more..i think the first review i read in yelp was correct..something about it being to pretentious..walk in on a sat night and imno dummy i knew there would be a wait..but see 3 open tables and was politely informed they were reserved..but then asked how long if a wait it was..was just told it would be awhile...like getting the feeling my business wasnt needed or desired..maybe because i didnt have the rite hipster look..dont know...food smelled good tho so i will definetly give it another try...maybe during lunch hours"}
{"text":"Tender Bar & Kitchen is my favorite place in Pittsburgh to get a cocktail and one of my favorite places for dinner...whether it's a quick burger or a more involved meal. They have such a fantastic combination of attentive service, excellent bartending, and a diverse menu attuned to seasonality and local options.

Servers are knowledgeable about the cocktail and food menus, great at handling exceptions/food allergies, attentive without taking over your dining experience, and personable. Although the space does transition to a louder crowd as the evening progresses-it can be fairly quiet and spacious for an early dinner, even at the bar. When the younger crowd comes in and the live music options start up, it can definitely be challenging for conversation, but the liveliness is cool, too.

If I could afford it, I swear I would have a drink here every night. Probably my liver is happy that it's not going to work out like that. Their cocktails are attentive, careful, creative works of art. My favorite was the 43rd Street (now off the menu, I think). 

I love their smaller-sized menu options, which are a great alternative to a giant entree. They have my second-favorite cheese/charcuterie plate in Pittsburgh (it's beautiful...seriously...) and the staples that they keep on their menu, like their super tasty burger with pub sauce and potato skins, are always great options. They also generally have a pasta, fish, steak, and pork/chicken entree...so even if the menu is small, there's enough diversity for everyone.  I'm not always a fan of their pasta dishes (they had one on the menu for awhile with some amazing and unusual spring vegetables, but it had a watery/thin sauce and just didn't come together for me), but their sandwiches are always awesome. 

So lucky this place is close to home."}
{"text":"Short review here; another to follow someday once I've been here more extensively. I've been in once in the last month. A friend and I stopped in after going to Industry. 

The ambience and feel of the place is fantastic. Low-lit, sort of 20's/30's-ish vibe. All the fixtures seem to be very carefully chosen to great affect. Reminded me a little of the old Embury. The bartenders had the sort of facial hair one might have expected of such a joint.

We weren't ready to eat so we sat at the bar and stared at the cocktail list. Ah what temptations. Eventually, I settled on the Strip District Sequel and my buddy had the Perennial Effect.  This is craft cocktailery (is that a word?) at its finest; putting your trust in the experts and knowing that while you the layman may not understand all the nuances, you'll be notably pleased with the end result. You can tell in the way the bartenders go about their trade.

It ain't cheap but them's the breaks. Bravo, Tender, bravo. I look forward to coming back and trying the actual food menu sometime soon."}
{"text":"I love coming here for drinks at the end of a night. They knowledgeable staff is always able to recommend a drink or offer ingredient explanations. I like sitting in the bar at one of the couches and just hanging out. They don't pressure you to move along and the drinks make you not want to!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice. First time for after dinner drinks on our anniversary; second time for their New Years celebration. We aren't New Years kinda people and we had such an amazing time!  The bartenders here really know their craft and will not steer you wrong. We over-imbibed and enjoyed every minute of it. 
There are a few places in Pittsburgh that up the ante and this is one!"}
{"text":"The place is great for the cocktails, a ok for the food without more excitement. For cocktails, there is a long list with a lot of tasty options. I definitively recommend to go there to try different alcohol: gin, rum, vodka, etc.

For the food, I would rather go somewhere else - the food is expensive and average in general. You might give a shot to some dishes, this is definitively good but for that price range, you can get better."}
{"text":"Tender has the best cocktails in Pittsburgh. There aren't too many bars around here that serve fancy cocktails, so if that's your thing, you should check them out. The food is also quite delicious--try the potatoes. The biggest downfall is that it gets very crowded, so get there early."}
{"text":"The drinks were good. The food was good but not great. We had the lamb chops, pulled pork, potato skins, and pickle plate."}
{"text":"Here's the thing - don't go here for *primarily* food. I LOVE their drinks. We have a group of 4-10 people that we go here regularly with. 8/10 drinks are knock-your-socks-off amazing. 1/10 is merely really good. The final 1/10 drinks (or less) is a miss. If you think of this place as an upscale bar *with food on the side* you won't be disappointed. I have never gone here for a full dinner, because that's not what they do best! This is an awesome place to take family & friends for drinks. Occasionally we order a nibble to go with the drinks, but I recommend against that as a routine practice. Drinks are where Tender truly shines!"}
{"text":"I have never written a review for a restaurant | bar before; however, after my meal last night, I was compelled to share my experience. Everyone knows that Tender serves delicious drinks. I myself have been enjoying amazing craft cocktails in Tender's swanky environment for quite some time. The restaurant is clean and tastefully decorated; the staff are friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.  

What surprised me was the addition of chef Brian Little to the Tender team.  Last night Brian created the most delicious, tender, fall-off-the-bone lamb shank I have ever had.  The impressive caveman-like shank of meat was artfully plated with complementary sauces, potatoes, and mushrooms picked fresh that day.  Food of this caliber is something that many, including myself, may not associate with Tender. Realizing this, I decided to write this review. Spread the word folks, Tender has food... and its amazing!"}
{"text":"The cocktails were spot on, perfection. Actually I think all cocktails should be prepared this way. Bar tending has gotten sloppy and people expect less. These are what cocktails should be, no less

The potato skins were awesome, the presentation was superb. It's a nice \" adult \" crowd if you know what I mean. 

The tiki drinks were a surprise. Where else in this city would have falernum! A local ' burgher couldn't even pronounce it!

No pinnacle vodka here, lol

Love the quality of the establishment.

The only negative was grease splatter all over the large edged tomato soup bowl. It was very obvious.
Update .....
I've greatly reduced my rating. Tuesday's and Thursday's are LOUD  live music. Terrible bland, generic music you won't like ! It's too $&@& loud! 

It ran me off for sure and Saturdays are too busy here.....back to grit and grace"}
{"text":"it's a shame that this place is closing because they really have excellent cocktails. can't go wrong with anything on their menu. also ordered appetizers: frog legs, buffalo cauliflowers, and black garlic hummus. all were seasoned well and delicious. not the cheapest place of course but you truly get what you pay for. visit them before they close on april 22!"}
{"text":"Tender is . . . fine.  The bartenders and wait staff are all incredibly friendly.  The food is always good.  If craft cocktails are your thing (they are not my thing), they get high praise from the BF who loves that kind of thing.  But the aggressively hipster vibe and the overpriced food make this the place I go when every other place in the neighborhood is too busy."}
{"text":"Wow, I gotta say that Lawrenceville/Butler St. sure has changed in the past 10 years-- that said, this neighborhood and its new restaurants (so new, that a lot of currently swinging hot spots still appear as vacant lots on Google Maps!) aren't some horrible flagship for Pittsburgh gentrification, rather just an example of how young people, new ideas, and burgh-loyalty are slowly creating a food and arts culture that are no longer as parochial as most things, old and new, have been in Pittsburgh for a long time.

Tender is an old bank vault done up to be a classy, old-fashioned-cocktail spot with a tiny tiny food menu to compliment your mid-to-high-end boozing.

Croutons and Pork were great (and cheap!) compliments to our cocktails, and after a few more ($10) drinks, we proceeded to the dessert menu for chocolate and creme brulee!

Come here expecting to spend $10-$15 on small, fancy, DELICIOUS bites, and about $40 on cocktails.  While the ambience is high-end, the clientele is still Lawrenceville (in a good way) which helps to humanize the stately interior. 

All around a nice spot--and kind of a rarity in Pittsburgh.  While it was a little \"bourgie\" for its surroundings, it was also a refreshing, more SF-feeling joint that stood out BECAUSE it doesn't necessarily match the existing dining culture in Pittsburgh!   It's a great place to spend $20 bucks on a nice drink and munch before posting up at a dive bar!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! 

If you like a pretentious, egocentric, uppity dining/social experience then Tender is the place for you. I read some of the reviews and thought I'd give it a shot but now I am convinced that these reviews were written by the employees or their friends. It's like they are doing you a favor by just letting you step foot in the place. Don't waste your time with this overpriced wannabe of a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Beautiful place. Beautiful cocktails.
We came here on a Saturday night during restaurant week.  The menu is normally quite limited, and as others mentioned before, the portions are small.  Because of this, it's an ideal place to meet for after work drinks and small plates, or a late night snack and night cap.
We started with the pickle plate, city chicken, hot chicken, tried the burger and pan seared trout, and finished with the vegan ice cream sandwich and key lime pie.  I didn't think the menu completely vibe with the speakeasy atmosphere, but was tasty nonetheless.
I'll definitely be back post- restaurant week to try more food from their evolvng menu (and many, many more of their cocktails!)"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Tender. We went during Restaurant Week and had a not-so-great experience. I understand they get really busy during that time, but it is also a time to really dazzle your patrons and get them to come back. I'm not in any rush to get back there. I also found out that their restaurant week menu is offered every Monday, so there should not have been any surprises in tke kitchen, besides maybe more patrons than a typical Monday.

Brynn was our server and she was the best part of our meal. She was very sweet and very knowledgeable about the menu and cocktails. The bourbon in the drink I ordered was far too smoky for my liking, so she offered to either get me a new drink or doctor up the current one. I decided to see what they could do to change the current one with those grand shelves of liquor and was very impressed! She described what I didn't like about the drink to the bartender and they added some sort of citrus juice to take away the bite of the bourbon. 

We ordered from the special Restaurant Week menu. I chose the Blue Burger with potato skins and my boyfriend chose the Tender Burger with bacon and a salad. This is where things started going downhill. The salad was ok and the skins were pretty much just roasted and seasoned potato cubes. We both ordered our burgers medium, so we were very disappointed when they came out VERY well done, almost charred and not even a sliver of pink in the middle. I was leery of sending it back to the kitchen after getting my drink fixed, but we decided to talk to our server and send them back. I figured we'd have to wait for a bit, but it seemed worth it to get a meal that was not overcooked. It took about 30 minutes for our food to come back out...needless to say, the rest of our party had long finished by the time it arrived. Tender is not a huge place, so it's not like they were preparing burgers for hundreds of people... Based on experiences in the past, I expected the kitchen wait time to be addressed by a manager, but nothing was mentioned.

When the second round of burgers (finally) came out, they were absolutely delicious. My review would definitely have been bumped up to 4 if that had come out the first time around, but the overall experience and service is just as important as the meal itself."}
{"text":"Being new in town, I discovered Tender so late in the game that it closed before I can make a second trip.  Great cocktails, awesome happy hours, and amazing old-fashioned decors.  it is very sad to see you go, but I'm glad I had a taste!  Cheers."}
{"text":"If i could have given Tender 3.5 stars I would have... but instead of an overall rating I think it helps to break it down...

- For service, Tender gets 5 stars: the host/waiter was friendly and gave us some great insight into the menu and ordering suggestions

- The ambiance gets 4 stars: The rehab of this old bank was great and the overall feel was very cozy... but I wouldn't give 5 stars because it was actually a little bit too cozy (I felt like I was right there in all of the awkwardness of the first date happening next to our table)

- The cocktails get 4 stars: they had some really interesting combinations and a huge selection... the cocktails we tried (the Petrichor and the Parker & Barrow) were great, but I would say I have had some that I liked a little bit more at some of Pittsburgh's other locations

- The food, however, gets 2 stars: We started with the olive plate and mac n' cheese to share... olives were tasty but we got a total of 4 large olives, 2 medium olives, and 6 itty bitty olives (think the size of a bean) for $4. The mac n' cheese was about the size of a softball, but I have to say i LOVED all of its flavors and the salty arugula and granny smith apples it was served with. I will give them the $7 for that.  Then we both got burgers, added bacon for $1, and shared one side of tater tots and one side salad ($3 each).  Our two burgers and sides totaled $32. Don't get me wrong, it was a really good burger.  But it was average-size and there was nothing particularly amazing about it.  $3 worth of tater tots turned out to be six slightly larger than the frozen kind served with Heinz ketchup.  The menu proudly stated that they served \"Simply Heinz\" as if that was supposed to make me swoon.  Sure, I'm happy they served an all-natural option but if you're going to make a point to talk about where your condiments come from you should probably make them in-house.  Lastly, the side salad came with everything the regular salad included (butternut squash, carrots, greens, ginger dressing) but to continue to \"save a buck\" the kitchen decided to leave off the goat cheese.  I'm paying $13 for a burger and you can't throw on $0.50 worth of goat cheese, which makes everything taste a million times better?

In short, I thought Tender was a great place to grab a cocktail or two and I will definitely be back to drink away the cold winter sting... but I will make sure I eat before I go."}

We arrived around 9pm on a Thurs., and although there were a decent number of people, it wasn't crowded.  Although there were open tables, we opted to sit at the bar, which was a great choice since it allowed us to gaze at the huge wall of liquors, which was the first thing that we noticed as we drove by while looking for parking.  Also, it allowed us to interact with our friendly bartender, Sarah.  Finally, I think it provided a better overall view of the interior, which definitely evoked both a bank and a speakeasy. There was also a pianist playing, which added to the ambiance--I believe this is the norm for Thurs. between 9-11pm.

We had two rounds, with the first round consisting of house specialties, and the second round consisting of tiki drinks.  For my first round drink, I ordered the Barvey Hallbanger, a drink concocted by one of the other bartenders for entry into the PGH cocktail week competition.  As the name suggests, it was similar to a Harvey Wallbanger, but more complex in flavor.  (I can't recall specifics and I can't look them up b/c they're not on the normal menu, unfortunately.) My +1 ordered a paper airplane (particularly appropriate in light of his profession as an airline pilot), which was quite fruity and refreshing, and didn't taste like bourbon at all, even though it was bourbon-based.  Even though I wouldn't have expected it, on both rounds, my drinks were stronger than his.

For my second round drink, I ordered a Mai Tai, per Sarah's recommendation, and my +1 ordered the Navy Grog, which contains 4 (count 'em!) types of rum.  My mai tai was great--this'll definitely be one of my go-to tiki drinks from now on--which I expected.  The Navy Grog surprised me, however--I thought all the rum would be too much, but it went down surprisingly easily!  All of the drinks were well-balanced and stiff--I'm glad I didn't have any more since I was definitely feeling tipsy after the second round!  Although the small plates looked interesting, we didn't order any food because we were both stuffed from all of the food at the Burgh Bash.

While it was a bit pricy, and therefore not something we can do every day, my +1 and I definitely enjoyed our experience at Tender.  The drinks, service, and ambiance were all great for imbibing some craft cocktails, especially later at night after having eaten substantially elsewhere.  We also liked that the neighborhood (Lawrenceville) caters to a more upscale, yuppie crowd than the South Side, although, as we learned, parking can be just as hectic.  4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I hit this place during its soft open on my way out of Pittsburgh, and I feel bad that I'm not going to be able to give them a second chance!

The service was very slow (especially cocktails), but friendly! I'm not factoring the slowness into my rating, since it was pre-grand opening and all. The ambiance is gorgeously Art Deco inspired.

As a bar, this is a perfect addition to Lawrenceville and really ups the game for drinks in the neighborhood. The cocktails are insanely good, and I would expect no less coming from the same people as Verde. I especially love the extensive list of \"refreshing\" options, since I like my drinks not-too-strong but not-too-sweet. They're pricey, sure, but easily some of the best-crafted libations in the city.

The food was somewhat disheartening. They say everything is \"sharing sized,\" but they're just avoiding the words \"tapas\" or \"small plates\" because of the negative connotation. Sharing sized means a heap of meat at Union Pig & Chicken or a mountain of pasta at Buca di Beppo, not a miniature sandwich.

For plates that are meant to be shared, the menu is not well thought out. We came with a group of six and had to order multiples of dishes because they were impossible to \"share.\" For example, Yaka Mein--mini bowl of noodle soup (not very shareable to begin with) topped with one rib (do we each nibble on one end?) and half a quail egg--this is way too difficult to share between even just two people. Beef on Weck--hockey-puck-sized sandwich--just because it's cut in half doesn't make it \"shareable.\" The concept needs to be fleshed out a little bit better.

As far as taste, the Yaka Mein was the only thing I really loved, and I wish it wasn't topped by a dried out rib. The meatloaf was good (but tiniest in size). The flavors of the Beef on Weck were there, and the roll was perfection, but the meat was again, too dry. The mac & cheese was creamy, but one-note. Skip the deviled eggs (you've had better at a work luncheon) and the oysters (couldn't taste the mignonette at all?).

You'll easily spend $40 a person here, and you might still be hungry afterward (the men at our table were). Which is fine if the food is amazingly tasty...but it's not. It's just average, and at these portion sizes, isn't worth it. I wish I would have spent all my money on drinks instead!

Hope Tender can pull itself up...I'm a fan of Verde, so I have faith in them!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. First, it's a very nice atmosphere - cozy but not at all crowded.  It's fun and laid-back. The menu is small but everything I've ever eaten here has been fantastic, and most of it is great for sharing.

Then, of course, the drinks. The list is extensive and I'd be willing to bet there is something for everyone. But where I'm always the most impressed is the knowledge of the servers and the bartenders.  They are always ready with a recommendation if you need one (even if you can only give them something kind of nebulous to go off), and more than once I've trusted them to mix up something unique for the final round. As a result, I've tried a lot of things that I probably would not have ordered at another bar, and I've never been disappointed with the drink that's been placed in front of me."}
{"text":"After embury closed, the chance of getting a nice cocktail in the burgh was slim to none!  SO glad this placed opened up.  The Pre prohibition style drinks are so yummy.  I lean on the stronger side of drinks and can't stand very sweet ones, and Tender does exactly that.  

If you don't know what you want, they'll recommend something awesome on the menu, or create something original.  It's a no standing policy bar, so it never gets too crowded in there.  The staff is super friendly.  Don't get intimated by their solemn stares.      

My favorites are still Old Amsterdam and Widow's Kiss.  Food is tasty and light.  It's more tapas style.  Hush puppies are always a crowd favorite.  What goes better than fried goodness and delicious drinks?  Hands down, the BEST cocktail joint in Pittsburgh so far."}
{"text":"Been twice now - last night, and a year ago. Yesterday's server was off-putting. Food portions are tiny, so be forewarned - though that pickle plate was pretty delicious. Panna cotta was lacking. 
Cocktails are good but overpriced."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 3 1/2.  I feel bad giving it the first 3 star review.  I'm torn, honestly.  

The ambiance: cute, cozy.  I love it.
The location: Lawrenceville.  I love it.
The service: great, wonderful, attentive - my glass of water was always full and as soon as my cider was gone she asked if I'd like more.  
The food quality: also wonderful.  We had:

Lobster rolls: Perhaps the bread:lobster ratio was a bit too high, or maybe it was that the bread wasn't toasted and too fluffy. I was expecting a bruschetta-type of appetizer, but still good nonetheless

Macaroni and cheese: I love comfort food.  Mac n' cheese gets 2 thumbs up. 

Beef on Weck: Really good, but the roll was really hard to chew.  

Fluffernutter: we just had to.  Fancy restaurant.  Marshmallow banana sandwich?...and it was probably my favorite dish. It was almost dessert like.

Hush Puppies - meh, kinda dry. 

Turducken - the corn bread stuffing was great, and the sauce was drizzled over definitely contained cranberries.  I loved it.

For dessert we got the beignets and the moon pie.  This was the only point I was dissappointed in the food quality.  I've been to NOLA, twice.  I've had the beignets.  These were NOT beignets, and on top of that, they tasted like burnt chocolate.  Ugh.  The moon pie, while good, elicited the following question from one of the members of our table: \"Were these just taken out of the hoho's box?\" They also had some weird (green!) mint liquid drizzled on top.

Ok, so the food quality was great, for the most part.  But the price for the food...and the amount of food you get was not. We spent over $120 for 4 people and were still hungry.  I wish there was more on each plate.  Especially the turducken (2 pieces?) and the Beef on Weck.  They should specify that each dish really serves only 2 people.  We were told this was tapas-style, and most tapas dishes at other restaurants serve at least 3.

I wanted to love this place so bad!  It's owned by the same people who opened Verde, which I love and will go back to again and again and again.  But I can't say that I'll go back to Tender.  Either lower the prices or increase the amount of food on the plate."}
{"text":"Let me paint the picture. Visiting from Los Angeles. Walked in on a recommendation for a  drink. 4 of us good looking crowd. Walked in on a Tuesday looking for a table. Hostess said \"the computer estimates a 3 hour wait\" LOL . You're not that cool. I looked around this crappy light bar with a fat middle aged crowd. We walked right out laughing our butts off"}
{"text":"I came here for restaurant week, had the sweetbreads, lamb, and chocolate cake. 

The food was very good, the combinations of flavors in each dish were very well done. It wasn't mind blowing, but I think that has to do with my own personal taste. 

The regular menu is fairly small, which isn't necessarily bad. I feel like this allows them to really focus on the few dishes and make them good. There is a very large liquor selection. The ambience is trendy and laid back. Perfect spot if your looking to have dinner and then have a night out. It's like a one stop shop. 

Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. I'm fairly new to red wines and I tend to lean toward a sweeter red wine; however, our waiter suggested a dryer red wine, the cuv√©e..it was absolutely fantastic.  It paired perfectly with my meal. 

I definitely would come back. Our waiter informed us of their brunch on Sundays, I will be coming back to check that out."}
{"text":"Jessie is arguably the best server I have had in a bar ever. Her recommendations were stellar. The food was excellent. The drinks were phenomenal. I wish I lived here to come more often."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a friend's b'day.  If I remember correctly this was their official opening day after a week or so of a soft launch.  I opted for a glass of red wine but after looking at the group's interesting and tasty cocktails, I would recommend opting for a cocktail rather than a glass of wine or beer.  

We shared several plates including the hush puppies, red potato salad, fluffernutter, lobster rolls, mac & cheese, poke and the beignets.  

Everything tasted great but I thought the lobster rolls and the poke stood out as they were fresh and seasoned well...I also love seafood, especially seafood done right.  I'm not a huge potato salad fan to begin with and don't usually get very excited about mac & cheese unless it's done exceptionally well and has some extra fixins which I didn't feel like this had.  I think the fluffernutter should be along side with the other desserts but it sits with the other small plates.  I thought the flufernutter was a better dessert option than the beignets, although the fluffernutter could have used more peanut butter and was marshmallow - the bread, tasty as it was, overwhelmed the dish.  

I did contemplate giving it 4 stars but I thought that it was too pricey for what you get.  Although we got seven plates to share between 5 people, they were very tiny and came with a hefty price tag.  All in all, I think it's a great place for a drink and a couple appetizers before heading out for a dinner at a more reasonably priced establishment."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh! The ambiance is classy but fun, the food is unique and extremely good and thoughtful and the prohibition style cocktails are to die for! Did I mention the cocktails? They really know what they are doing here! Ask lots of questions, the bar tenders are excellent mixologists and can hook you up with something you will fall in love with. If you are trying to impress your friends or a date, bring them here."}
{"text":"Stumbled in on a Saturday night while waiting to be seated at another restaurant. They have really great drinks. Strong but still refreshing. We also decided to try the frog legs  They were good but I couldn't get past the idea that I was eating frog. 

Anyways I hear they are closing. Sad face because this place is definitely a cool spot to get a drink in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Friday evening with my fiance and two other dining companions.  We had made reservations earlier in the week and arrived at the restaurant right around the time of our reservations and were immediately seated.  The hostess took us through a cool looking bar area and into a back room that had two tables for 4 and a lounge area.  It was a pretty cool space and the lounge area looked like it could fit right into the Mad Men TV show or maybe even a bit earlier.  

As we sat down, we were given our menus.  Since it was Pittsburgh Restaurant week they had a special going where you could get an appetizer, entree and dessert for $25 and gave three options for each.  Beyond that, I can't really say that there was much of a menu besides a bar snacks section which left me disappointed.  Long before we got there our dining companions had let us know that they would be about 15 minutes later than our reservation for dinner.  As such I decided to order from the bar snacks portion while we waited for them and so we started off with the popcorn which that night ended up being a dill covered popcorn.  It ended up being really good with a decent amount of butter on it and a generous serving of dill.  For dinner I decided to have the spicy chicken as my appetizer, a pasta as my entree and then a vegan gingersnap ice cream sandwich filled with peaches and cream ice cream.  One of my dining companions asked how the ice cream was vegan and I believe that they replied that it was made with tofu instead of diary.  My meal started off well as the spicy chicken had a good spice level to it.  It was actually much spicier than I had been expecting but that is a good thing to for me as I love my food to be spicy.  Next up was the pasta which was quite a disappointment.  There was barely any sauce on it I honestly could not taste any of the flavors that they had on the menu.  Normally I like just about everything that I eat but I don't care for wasting calories on something that is bland and doesn't taste like much.  Finally I had the dessert.  It was, well interesting may be the best word.  Whenever it came out to us the ice cream was melting which was fine and I dove right into it.  The taste was not that great although not bad either and I wish that I could describe it but I don't know that I have ever had anything comparable to it.  At least the ginger snaps were good as they were a little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

The bottom line for me is that I will not be heading back to Tender in the future.  I honestly can't say that the food was terrible, but it wasn't nearly worth the money that we spent on it.  Beyond that their menu was very limited and if they had posted the actual menu that they were serving on the restaurant week website instead of a sample one from which they were only minor similarities, I do not believe that we would have gone there.  At least the service was good and the ambiance of the place nice"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried it for first time recently and loved it.  Great atmosphere. Classy without being pretentious. Great interior in an old bank building.  We sat at the bar and asked Elliot the bar tender for some recommendations -- spot on.  Amazing cocktail.  I think it was fair priced and we had olives and potatoes skins for appetizers.  I think the menu is a bit disjointed.  We found some of the choices odd for cocktails.  They had some small plates and some large ones.  I think really they should get rid of the large plates and expand the list of small plates that could really go well with cocktails.  But still I would go back again.  Good job."}
{"text":"My friends and I were so happy to spend our $700 elsewhere after Tender gave us a coffee table in the direct sunlight (to seat 8 women for dinner) and a nasty attitude for requesting a new table. 
Glad they are doing so well they don't need to treat their customers well."}
{"text":"I've dined at Tender numerous times over the last year, but most recently on a Wednesday night with my significant other. We sipped a couple cocktails and devoured their amazing hush puppies. Seriously, they were served with some magical butter that left me wanting to lick the bowl. Similar to The Livermore and Bar Marco in that they serve some kick-a** drinks. Different in that they appear to have a much broader assortment of booze. And although The Livermore is broadening its food menu, Tender has an appetizer and dinner menu that you must try if you haven't already. The vibe is fun, warm, cozy and sexy. On the weekends, it can be hard to get a table so call ahead. Also, keep in mind there are several seating options at the restaurant, including traditional booths, however there are a number or smaller tables and couches in the rear of the restaurant. I don't mind that section, but I can imagine some may find it uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I go to Tender a good bit for cocktails. It is right down my street and I love how creative the bartenders are. I've only had their appetizers up until the other day. I had a good friend in from Florida and we wanted a special girl's night out. I had originally wanted to take her to The Vandal but a few other friends decided to join so I felt something a little more intimate would be better for the situation. 

I've never sat in the back room before but it was pretty cozy and intimate. It would be good for a date if you're into that sort of thing. We shared a cheese plate, a charcuterie plate and brussel sprouts. All were delicious! There were pickles treats all other the meat and cheese plates including celery, which I hadn't had before and loved! The brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly and had a lot of bright citrus flavor! 

For my entree, I ordered the salmon. It came with a garam masala couscous and hericot vert. The salmon was mid rare and I'm trying to get with it but I do like mine a little bit closer to mid. The masala sauce was delicious though and I am game for any kind of bean any day of the week! Everyone else was really pleased with their food and for how much we ate along with a cocktail, the bill was reasonable. I'll definitely be more apt to eating their food instead of just enjoying their cocktails in my future visits!"}
{"text":"I love love love loved this place! From the moment you step inside the old school feel is great! Start with ambiance A+++ reminded me of the early 1900's and loved the fashion style of the bartenders ! Onto the drinks. Up until this point bar-tending didn't require talent! I have never seen drinks made to perfection like I did here, and not your normal style of drinks! Everything was fresh! And they make their own cola..
FOOD: ordered and tried a majority of
Different foods here, all small plates and portions deviled eggs were amazing along with the Mac and cheese oysters and yaka soup! The presentation alone made me just wanna take the food home and display it, not eat it..."}
{"text":"At 66y/o I may have well been the oldest person in Tender on Saturday night, besting my wife by 2 years. What was young and fresh? the food and staff! Fresh ideas on lamb chops, pickled vegetables, wings, and our Tender staple a great burger. This evening we decided to have several of the appetizers and split the burger between the two of us. The lamb chops were blackened with just enough kick and wonderfully seasoned. They were served with a quinoa. This is the first time I have ever been willing to take a second, yet third and forth forkful of quinoa. It's taste was unique with a great texture. When I was growing up in Pittsburgh, the best pickled vegetables were at Weinstein's for tomatoes and pickles, and the carrots at Del's. Tenders plate was out of this world with each vegetable having been pickled with different seasonings. The micro-shaved carrots were the best, just delicious; the chards of celery, florets of cauliflower, red/yellow thinly sliced peppers almost as good as the carrots. But besting even the carrots were the green tomatoes. I had to keep a piece of the green tomato aside, so it could be  my dessert, the last taste of the evening after all else had pleasantly disappeared. The wings were both sweet, savory, and just sticky enough to be very finger-licking good! We shared the Tender burger, which we will sometimes stop in just to have on the run. As always, it was delicious bacon, pickled fennel and light greens! Lastly, you can't go to Tender without at least one alcohol beverage: mine was the Scorched Earth with mezcal, Cappelletti amaro, sweet vermouth, stirred. It was smokey and sweet at the same time!!

I wouldn't mind if you don't go to Tender, there are enough there whenever you arrive, so a few less contending for a great meal would be ok. But really, go, I want Tender to be around for a long time! I intend to live for a while longer and don't mind being the oldest gent enjoying its offerings.

I see that one of the extended questions for a review has to do with attire. Folks are in shorts to sport coats/dresses. You also get to see the latest in young fashion, hairstyles, and shoes.

{"text":"I returned to give this another shot. There were six of us and we got a cozy spot with a little couch in the corner. Our service was slow but I did enjoy my drink. I felt a little slapped in the face though. In my last review I rant about how our party had five and there were four seats at the bar. \"No standing at the bar\" was the rule. However last Saturday there were many people standing at the bar in different parties. Maybe this bar changes their rules hourly. I really don't know. Seems inconsistent with the reply management wrote me."}
{"text":"Very friendly and welcoming place.  Limited menu (Monday night burger night) but the food was very good.  Service was very good, and the cocktails worked fine.  Went with our 10-year-old who was welcomed and greatly enjoyed the cream soda _and_ root beer.  Beautiful space."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 8 people when we visited home and ended up in \"the green room\" which is a lounge separate from the main bar area.
The waitstaff didn't tell us about the room and that we wouldn't be at regular tables. Would be a nice area if you had a large party and wanted to mingle, but we rearranged the couches and side tables a bit to make it more comfortable. Had to unexpectedly limit what we could order (nothing that really needed a knife and fork -- hard to cut a steak on a coffee table)
Generally really yummy food (shared a bunch of the small plates) and pretty good service. In the end felt like visiting a friends house who put up big $$ for a private chef and servers! ha! Just make sure you know what to expect if you make a reservation!!"}
{"text":"After looking at the menu and reading some of the reviews I was very excited to try Tender.  The concept is perfect for me, American tapas with plenty of comfort food. 

It appeared to me that there were two main dining areas, the front and the back.  I sat in the back, and didn't love the feel of it.  The space felt cramped, also, there was a group in the back that was uncomfortably loud.  This didn't help my dining experience.  

The cocktails were fantastic, but it took forever to get them.  I understand that they are hand crafted, and that takes time.   However, we got our cocktails only slightly before our food came, and I was tempted to order my second one immediately after receiving the first.  I opted for a glass of wine instead of another cocktail in the end as I didn't want to wait.  

For me at least, the food didn't quite deliver the flavor I was looking for.  Nothing was bad, but nothing jumped out at me.  I tasted the hush puppies, mac and cheese, meatloaf, and scrapple.  Each of them were fine, but none of them were great, and there didn't seem to be enough creativity (or really any) in the dishes. 

Love the concept, but in the end they just didn't deliver what I was hoping for."}
{"text":"It may have been a bad day, it may have been incredibly busy, there are a lot of excuses that they could say, but my experience was down right awful. 

We had a reservation for 8:30pm and just stood there at an empty hostess stand for 5 minutes before someone finally acknowledged us and came over.  When we finally sat down and ordered it was yet another long long wait.  30 minutes before we got 3 drinks. It was an hour before we got three dishes. AN HOUR. I'm not exaggerating here, it was legitimately an hour.  1 hour = 3 dishes. The waiter wasn't even around for us to ask him.  It was yet another wait for us to ask for our check (we had to ask another waitress because our waiter wasn't even to be seen). 

TLDR: Worst. Experience. Ever. Why. Oh God why. I wish we never came. But the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.
I used to really like Tender, but it's taken a turn for the worse. I live in the neighborhood and used to eat here about once a month. Used to... Until today. It's still a cool space in a well-worked old bank building. Gorgeous high ceilings. Great design. Good bartenders but the good service ends there. 

Two weeks ago my date and I were sat at a bad table in the back room. We asked nicely for one of several empty tables but were told those were for people with reservations (we had a reservation). So we ate at a lonely corner table (not the romantic sort of \"lonely) where we were generally forgotten about by the service staff. Those tables never filled up. Ok... No problem... Everyone has an off night and I've had plenty of good times here so they get a hall pass. 

Today they cancelled my New Year's Eve reservation - by email, and without explanation. I'd booked it two weeks ago, and modified it three days ago to make it an hour earlier - both the original and the change were confirmed by Tender.  No phone call, no reasoning, just \"get lost.\" Fine. You don't want me to be a customer, I'll go elsewhere.
Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  Ambiance was fantastic.  I just got back from a trip to NYC, and this restaurant could easily fit into a Manhattan neighborhood.  Had a very 1920's vibe; I felt like I was taking a step back in time.  I loved the way the wait staff dressed; women wore black dresses, and the men wore vests and newsboy caps.  So happy to not see a woman wearing a white shirt and black tie.  

I thought the food was fantastic.  I'm a huge fan of small plates.  We shared the hush puppies (awesome), lobster rolls (awesome; and I can't believe someone below wrote about the bread to lobster ratio, and how it needs improved...give me a break), the mac & cheese (great), the deviled eggs (good, but my least favorite of the 5), and the poke (first time I've had this, and I like it a lot).  I also had an almond phosphate soda, which I highly recommend.  5 small plates seemed like the perfect sharing amount to split amongst 2 people. 

I will definitely be back, and I highly recommend giving this place a try!!"}
{"text":"After returning here several months later, it does seem they have improved quite a bit.  The food I had the 2nd time around was much better and it seemed like they weren't trying too hard to reach beyond their abilities with the various ethnic foods and focused more on American and comfort type of food options.  The cocktails continued to be very good, but I still find the ones at Bar Marco to be superior."}
{"text":"I have never eaten here, but I love stopping in to try one of their interesting cocktails. The bartenders are personable and will help you find something you'll enjoy. Yes, it is generally more expensive than a typical bar but you're also paying for the atmosphere and creativity. I generally do not like to go to places where I can just make the food or drink myself for a fraction of the cost. I don't mind pay for these drinks because I can't make them myself, and they get me out of my gin and tonic comfort zone. The people that can't appreciate this place simply aren't the clientele this place is targeting. Perhaps you should try Belvedere's down the street. If you think you can appreciate a slightly more expensive, creative, hand crafted cocktail, I suggest you try this place out."}
{"text":"It was time for the monthly get together with our foodie friends when we selected Tender Bar & Kitchen as our venue for tasty treats.  This old bank converted into new hot spot in Lawerceville takes you back in time (think flappers and Gatsby) while embracing you with childhood memories of food.

Thank goodness for small plates because my decisions would have been ever harder!  We ordered a little of everything - oysters, hush puppies, deviled eggs, SCRAPPLE, and (my favorite) lobster rolls!  Being a native New Englander, this brought me a piece of home.  Fresh, sweet, creamy, and the crunch of the roll... I'm salivating as I write this!  My only wish is that there were more to a serving or I could just order a larger version.

Since this is the place for high class cocktails, I selected the Blood and Sand.  My new favorite beverage in Pittsburgh.  Scotch and Blood Orange juice - How can you go wrong?  When you visit this diamond, please don't order a bud light.  Step out of your comfort zone and try something new.

To satisfy our groups' sweet tooth, we ordered one of each of the desserts.  The moon pie was a little underwhelming.  Fluffernutter was finger licking good, bringing me back to my childhood.  I wouldn't call the banana split a dessert.  It was more like a piece of art.  It looked beautiful and delivered delicious flavors.

Tender Bar & Kitchen now has a tender spot in my heart.  I cannot wait until the next time we venture out for cocktails."}
{"text":"I went here a couple times then stopped.  The bartenders are WAY to into themselves, which is probably the reason the service sucks.  What this place needs is people interested in serving the customer not posing.  I don't need to be looked down on by the people slinging drinks. And it's too bad cause I like the owner."}
{"text":"There's nothing better than when the reality of a brand new spot not only lives up to it's pre-opening hype, but surpasses it. So it was with Tender.

Part of the \"Tender\" name comes from the establishment's emphasis on BAR. Six high profile, named bartenders have created spot-on cocktails that not only shine, they exceed all expectations. Each bartender (startender?) has created his or her own spin on classic cocktails or else has upped the ante by coming up with entirely new creations. What's in store for you in the cocktail department upon your first visit?

Do NOT miss the Nathan Luchansky-created Once Upon A Honeymoon with ginger-infused apple brandy and blood orange marmalade. Despite what you may think, it is not too sweet at all. It is just right.

Sean Rosenkrans created a delightful pastis-kissed, non-blue curacao creation called  Death in the Allegheny. Served over crushed ice, one of our group declared it tasted like a \"Good n Plenty snowcone.\" Yaya's Snowcones on the Northside never served a flavor that GOOD!

Craig Mrusek (Dr. Bamboo), who specializes in Tiki drinks, came up with a cocktail named Nilsson. There was some discussion around the bar about it being inspired by Harry Nilsson of the \"Put the Lime in the Coconut\" fame. This was another crushed ice delight that hit all the right coconut, lime and rum island notes without being overly sweet. As Nilsson sang, it was no problem to \"drink it all up.\"

The last cocktail sampled this particular evening was Marie Perriello's Hemingway's Mistress. Made with smoky mezcal, Luxardo marachino liqueur, grapefruit juice and lime, it was simple...but so much more than the sum of all it's parts. It's easy to see why Hemingway might have had a fling with this tart little number!

The kitchen draws on some regional cuisines of the U.S. to feature on the food side of the menu. Look for specialties from the South, Northeast, West (of here), Pennsylvania, and (okay, not a region) Classic Americana. If there's shrimp n grits on the menu, that will always be my order. Bonus, it was gluten-free. 

The plating of two round grits cakes and two head-on shrimp was a vision in simplicity. Keep in mind, these are small plates, not full size entrees so servings are small and shareable. Well, if you want to share and not keep all that deliciousness to yourself alone.

The hubby ordered Beef on Weck and got 2 small slider-sized portions of perfectly cooked beef slices on those beautifully seasoned buns. And no, he didn't share either. We did share a plate of crispy potato chips with aioli to dip the chips. The aioli was the only negative of the evening...we couldn't remember what the menu had said it was and certainly couldn't identify the flavor except to say it was bland and weird. Skip the aioli, but get the chips!

Oh...that other \"Tender\" meaning? Legal tender. Tender Bar & Kitchen is housed in a former bank so the double entendre of \"tender\" works on both the \"bar\" and \"legal\" levels.  If it sounds like I focused on the cocktails, you are correct. While the food was very, very good, it's the cocktails that will keep me bouncing back. Like a rubber check? (Sorry, couldn't resist a last cheesy bank reference.)"}
{"text":"The cocktail menu, atmosphere, servers and food are near impossible to beat.  Tender Bar & Kitchen is definitely in my top 3 bars in Pittsburgh. My favorite spot is the two seats at the far end of bar. Brilliant for taking in the atmosphere and people watching to your hearts content.

A great touch to the House cocktail menu is the inclusion of its creator underneath.  It allows you to work out which bartenders style works for you...if you frequent there enough. 

We feasted on the appetiser, small plates and dessert portion of the menu. It was one of the best meals I have had this year in Pittsburgh.  I am drooling just thinking about it again. We shared the lamb sweetbreads which were delicately coated, fried and sprinkled with crispy prosciutto. I chose the sweet potato gnocchi for my main - oh boy!! Not only did it look gorgeous but it was absolutely delicious.  The gnocchi was made to perfection and surrounded in a delicate sauce, sprinkled with bleu cheese and accompanied by squash and romanesco broccoli. My friend ordered the burger of the day, which was a mouthwatering combination of pancetta, baby kale, a creamy aioli atop a beef patty all held together within a brioche bun. It was the best burger I have tasted!  Absolutely devine.  Finally we decided to share the dulce de leche cheesecake. People - if this is on the menu, order it immediately.  I was so full but couldn't stop eating it. Sweet caramelly perfection is all I can say.

I love this place and highly recommend it.  Great atmosphere. Great food. Great night out."}
{"text":"I've been to Tender for drinks and snacks a few times, but last week we took advantage of Restaurant Week to taste their offerings ($14 for a burger and a cocktail...what a steal!).

Good burgers, excellent potato skins (I've ordered them every time I've gone), and some very creative cocktails. If you're looking for $3 well drinks, hurry past, but if you'd like to step back in time and enjoy some piano-playing with your libation, the $10 or so for the cocktail is well worth it. Service at the tables has never been a problem; not sure about from the bartenders themselves."}
{"text":"Came here during restaurant week. I got the smoked burger and it was recommended that I also try the tater tots. Since they're known for their drinks I tried the Bees Knees cocktail. I like my drinks sweet and this foot the bill perfectly. The burger was tasty (i liked the chipotle relish) but the tater tots were the highlight. They were perfectly done: crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. We came for a late bite so things weren't that busy and the service was fine. Would definitely come back to check out their other offerings!"}
{"text":"Went there last night with colleagues. During drink two, we tried to make conversation with other patrons and the manager informed us that we weren't to talk with anyone else at the bar. Never going back, and that manager should seriously rethink her decision to get into the service industry."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, delicious food, the drinks were made well, and the staff was polite and accommodating. We made reservations for right when they opened, and enjoyed a nice quiet dining room for about an hour before it started to fill up, but even when it was full it was a pleasant experience. Our waitress was the best!"}
{"text":"This place was my favorite stop of our whole trip to PGH. Our server, Sam, was absolutely fantastic, helped us choose our drinks based on our spirit preference plus he knew every little detail of the restaurant. Did you know they hand-cut their ice cubes from a large block and stamp them with their logo?! Cool stuff. 

Drinks were so good, the food was divine, but service couldn't be beat. Definitely come here for food and cocktails... And ask for Sam, he'll do you right!"}
{"text":"We love the atmosphere here and the cocktails are great. However this place really needs to rethink its music. It needs some cool lounge music but instead they blast pop music. Last night we were trying to enjoy a few cocktails and some dinner but the mood was ruined with \"Bang Bang\" blasting over our conversation. Otherwise, this is a chill spot for drinks and dinner."}
{"text":"Returned after the new chef hire. Prices are up and portion sizes are down. Server was rude to the clueless yinzer sitting next to us."}
{"text":"If delicious food and attentive, fine service were the only barometers for a meal, Tender would rate five stars.  There are, however, many other factors which detract from its rating.

Parking on a weekend night in an area which is residential and which has one restaurant or bar after another on the \"main drag\" of Butler Street, is an adventure, and if you do find a space where parallel parking is necessary, good luck trying to pull it off on the narrow streets of Lawrenceville. The restaurant states at the website that parking is available on the streets surrounding it: try to find it. Three of the four members of our party waited a long time for the fourth individual to find a place to park and return to the restaurant after he dropped off his companion.

The website states that the restaurant has a \"no standing room\" policy, which apparently precludes individuals from congregating in the entry room as they wait for a table, perhaps because there is no true waiting area.  Fortunately this was not an issue as the table we had reserved was ready for us upon arrival.


The dining area into which one enters is loud, crazed, and jam-packed.  I was delighted when the hostess said that she would take us to our table, and headed toward a back room.  We had one of the best tables in the house.  The noise level was tolerable; we were away from those that were massed in the entry room.  

There appears to be no provision for coats, so they dangle on one's chair.

We saw no bread and none was offered.  

There are no salt or pepper shakers on the tables.

There is an excellent selection of unique cocktails, pricey at $10 and up. 

This is not a place to linger at length, at least not on a weekend night.  After we had been at our table for nearly two hours, we were told that another party was awaiting it with a reservation.  We were told that we could sit at a sofa and chairs in an adjoining room, which we did.  We were there for twenty minutes before we were asked to leave it as well due to another party with a reservation. We would have hoped that some arrangement could have been made to accommodate us 
within a meal that was $200 for four people.

The portions of all dishes are tiny and not inexpensive.  The menu contains a total of only fourteen items, including appetizers, small plates, and large plates.

Turnip soup was delicious and beautifully presented: $8 for a tiny bowl. The best buy on the menu is the excellent Tender Burger for $12 though it comes with no side dish.  The a la carte potato skins, an additional $4, were marvelous. My brussels sprouts appetizer, $6, was great, but overpriced for the small portion. There was a choice of all of two desserts.  Our milk chocolate bread pudding for $8 was delicious, but barely enough for one person. 

There is no one leaving Tender with food to take home because of the tiny portions.

The evening was a mixed bag."}
{"text":"Came to Tender with a friend on a Thursday night around 6pm. It was pretty quiet so we got seated right away. Our waiter was great- very friendly, explained the menu, answered our questions. I ordered the Tom & Rose which was unbelievable - who knew rosemary and lemon flavors make a good cocktail!?! As for food, I was not blown away, but maybe I just picked poorly. I had the duck sausage and beans (appetizer) - it was pretty spicy (BBQy) which was ok, but the sausage and everything tasted a little dry overall. My friend had he burger and said it was really good. I Will definitely be back for the drinks, and maybe to give the food another shot. Also curious what the ambiance is like later in the evening..."}
{"text":"So far I have only had cocktails here, but they are excellent.  The specialty menu is very carefully designed, and every drink I've tried on it so far is exceptionally balanced.  Don't overlook a drink just because you don't like one of the ingredients -- when in doubt, they taste better than what seems like the sum of their parts.  My favorites from the specialty cocktail list are the Pecora Investigation (great if you love scotch, intensity, and smokiness) and the Once Upon a Honeymoon (and I don't even like apple brandy typically), but I'm sure they are excellent at all the classic cocktails too.  They make an absolutely delicious Boulevardier, and I look forward to trying their Manhattans and Sazeracs.

The upstairs bar/lounge is absolutely beautiful and the bartenders/servers are dressed totally in theme.  The men wear vests, suspenders, and hats, and the women are dressed like flappers or in other elegant 20s fashion.  There is 20s style jazz, and the live music on their hard opening night was a wonderful bonus!  It sounds kitschy, but it really works... you feel transformed to a different place.

The downstairs is less impressive, and it kind of smelled like a kennel when we sat there on opening night.  It felt more like a small, regal room of a french palace than the downstairs of a speakeasy-type joint.

The service I received both times was top-notch.  The bartenders (I had Frederick) and servers alike obviously all know the cocktails VERY well and are great with giving recommendations based on what you like and what you're in the mood for.

Definitely looking forward to revisiting this joint for small plates.  Beignet time!!!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this hotel-esque bar, but the cocktails blew me away--literally, I couldn't walk straight. It was the best and they were delicious. On Monday nights they feature $7 burgers so I will be back to eat--and maybe have one drink if I am feeling rich enough."}
{"text":"Terrible experience tonight at Tender. We had a larger party of 5 to start, and were seated in the back room promptly. Our server, Nathan was fantastic! We had 2 people come to meet us, and there were 2 open chairs right beside us, and we were informed by the hostess that they would not be allowed to dine and drink with us, because it would \"disrupt\" the others eating with a party of 7. Terrible and rude attitude from the hostess and management, and we will not be back. If you like uppity restaurants that frown upon the guests that aren't rich wanna-be hipsters, this is your place. Otherwise, I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"How did it take me so long to find this place? Stepping inside makes me feel like I'm in an completely different city. Reminds me of some of the bars that I've been to in North Beach in San Francisco. 

The dim lighting and cozy bar atmosphere make it a perfect date spot.

Their drink list and even just one look at their selection of liquor on the bar (and all the way up to the ceiling!) is extremely impressive. My date and I ordered Corpse Reviver #2 and Mexican Firing Squad Special and we both agreed the latter was the best!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and drinks for our party of 4! Only one page of food on the menu but still something for everyone and a bonus, some entrees in the mid teens. Super creative cocktails! Nice back room for quiet, intimate dinner seating."}
{"text":"I promised Cass over a year go that I'd return to Tender with a companion. After winding up with a $50 gift card for this exquisite and entertaining establishment, Kay and I awaited the right opportunity to use it. 

That moment came when the fridge and cupboards were bare at home, and payday was so near yet so far. 

Gone are the kitschy (but welcome and supremely executed) homages to the ambience and dishes of yesteryear since my last visit. Instead, Tender is going out of its way to prove to the public that while the revamped menu may be even more sophisticated at the moment, no one will turn you away for not looking your most dapper. 

Wanting to maximize my credits, I went for the relatively inexpensive Tender Burger. 

There's been a debate amongst the more famous chefs lately as to what cuts of beef to use for a burger. Many are claiming that chuck is the only way to go for the sake of succulence. Others scoff at that, even going as far as to add oxtail and brisket to the mix. The mighty chefs at Tender are in the latter camp, crafting a patty made of not only chuck but skirt and flank steak. Cooked to a fantastic, deadshot medium-rare, this burger shed joyful, savorous tears when bitten into, proving close-minded purists wrong by refusing to stay safe. A fresh-baked, scratch-made wheat bun held the proteins and garnishes such as cheddar, greens, thin shards of pickled fennel, and a \"pub sauce\" that recalled a jam session between mustard and aioli. 

And while we're dipping into the subject of aioli, a divinely flavorful cup of the truffled variation accompanied a helping of frites or \"chips\" that Tender dubs Potato Skins. 

Yeah, I too assumed that I'd be getting something involving sour cream, melted cheese, and bacon bits. Instead, these potatoes were ideally crispy outside and fluffy inside, their odd, unpeeled, haphazardly homefries-style cut not affecting their consistency at all. Parmesan and minced scallions embellished the steaming heap of spuds, elevating them 100 floors above fast food with a restrained opulence. 

Our appetizer, The Lobster Rangoon, would take Americanized Chinese and thrust it into the future by way of some portal off the coast of the Atlantic. Cilantro, sour pickled carrot, and a sweet chili glaze playfully confused my palate with a fun-loving riot of flavor as the creamy decadence of the crunchy wontons interiors. The pieces of lobster were surprisingly assertive and did a bit more than merely flavor the cream cheese filling.

Cass, the genial blabbermouth, just had to tell the chefs about how I was waxing enthusiastic over everything I'd eaten thus far and that I hadn't been by in nearly 18 months. Without warning, Cass brought to us another small plate as we were halfway finished with our other dishes. 

Sashimi. Hamachi sashimi. Who'd have thought Tender would attempt this? I never even noticed it on the menu, and when Cass told me what it was and that it was on the house, I nearly collapsed. Lime, sesame, roe, radishes, and other vegetables enhanced the natural, moderately fatty, almost smoky profile of the yellowtail. Plated as if it were a serpent crawling from a pool, in the bottom of the bowl was a milky sort of couli that added further depth, the entire sum of the tapa instinctively refreshing our taste buds for the dessert to come. 

Tender has a way of overturning expectations, and the Chocolate Pudding did just that. Anticipating a goblet of chilled, wobbly custard, I was instead presented with a cocoa-studded minaret of bread pudding that was was similar to an English muffin in terms of crunch/chewy texture and buttery essence. With a fanned strawberry for decoration and a mint leaf on top, a quenelle of espresso ice cream counteracted the warmth and provided a mildly bitter contrast, making it coffee and dessert in one, the fruit adding juicy tartness, the mint making it mystical, unforgettable, causing it to linger in the mouth for hours afterwards. 

Tender itself lingers on the brain as well, proving fertile for culinary fantasies that cannot be dismissed as impossible, tempting gourmands to return with regularity."}
{"text":"Very rude people. Would not let us sit at the bar unless all bar stools were available for everyone although people were standing & not sitting on their bar stools. They made a scene about the situation which was not needed. They seem very self righteous. We went across the street to Industry & they were super nice. This establishment actually said \" There's no place for you here\" I live in Florida & No restaurants I have ever been in my life would ever say this. I've never experienced rude people like this before!  Good luck to you. You are rude!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this gem of a restaurant/bar! Everything from the decor/ atmosphere to the presentation and quality of the food was absolutely excellent.  I had a reservation because there is such limited seating, which is highly recommended. The hostess was very pleasant and our server was incredibly knowledgable about the food choices, the cocktails, and their craft beer selection. 

We first ordered the cheese plate as an appetizer which had a perfect mix of savory and sweet accompanying additions to the cheeses. I got one of their specialty cocktails which I would highly suggest. The bartenders are very obviously experienced and good at their craft. My girlfriend and I split the burger and potato skins, both of which were incredibly flavorful. I would definitely go back to Tendr the next time that I'm in Pitt. It's a hidden gem that won't disappoint! Next time though, I'll go to sample more of their amazing specialty cocktails!"}
{"text":"Long overdue for me to write this update, but I did return to Tender last year (12/1/14) for my 26th birthday with my mom, dad, and boyfriend.

It pains me to write this review, because the first time was really good; a 4-star experience, and I was hoping the second trip would be more like 5-stars. But it wasn't meant to be. I think that the delicious drinks were the only thing saving this from a 2-star or worse.

I made reservations in advance, but the only table options they had were either on couches or at tables right near the door. Since we wanted the full dining experience, we opted for tables. But still, right by the door, and it was COLD outside! My mom lamented that we couldn't sit in the back like we did last time, where it was a more intimate atmosphere. I felt bad about this, because I probably should have specified in my reservation that I wanted to sit there again. Oh well. My fault I guess.

The server came by not too long after to bring us water and menu. He was in the process of training another guy, which was no big deal to us. The other guy (wish I had remembered all the names) was really nice and came by often to replenish water. I think the trainee was better than the actual trainer... because it took FOREVER for the other guy to come by our table. We finally got a drink order in. The one positive I will say for the main server was that he did recommend some excellent rum drinks for me and a good drink for my mom. That was appreciated! And he was indeed friendly and personable, just really slow.

When it was time to order food, I was halfway done with my drink and considered ordering a second one just in case it took him forever to come back again, but I thought naah this place was top-notch the last time, he will surely be back again to offer another drink. But it wasn't until toward the end of the meal that I got 2nd cocktail, and needless to say, that was kind of a cockblock for me. I wasn't really feeling it by that point, but I got one anyway because fuck it, it's my birthday, lol.

Food-wise, it was kind of a flop. Wanted to push my boundaries and try new things. And they seemed to encourage that. But I was deliberating over sweetbreads, which I have never tried before. And the way the server described it, made it sound like it would be fantastic. But sadly, I really hated them. And they were NOT cheap either. If he had prefaced everything up front with \"we can't take certain dishes back or swap them for something else in case you don't like them\" that would have been fine by me. But instead of apologizing, he just took the plate away with an odd look on his face like a mixture of anxiety/pain and walked away wordlessly when we told him that no one at the table liked them. They tasted bland too me and greasy. Like popcorn dipped in bacon fat. Meh. I wanted to like them, I swear! And I felt bad about it.

For an entree, he had recommended a lamb curry dish for me. I told him I couldn't digest spicy food but he assured the dish wasn't really spicy at all. I believed him, and when I went to eat this stuff, man....my nose was running like a faucet. It did have good flavor, but I felt sooo sick afterwards even after taking my digestive enzyme medication. Mom really enjoyed her dish tho she said it seemed overpriced for the amount of food she got. I reminded her this place is supposed to be more of a light-bites type of place with a focus on drinks. My dad did not eat, save for a bite of mine which he enjoyed.

Server told us about desserts. Only two choices and neither of them seemed appealing to us. The whole experience was kind of bleh and it was really a lacklustre birthday. They didn't offer to do anything special, tho I am relieved there was no awkward singing or clapping like big chain places (ick) but at least stick a candle in a lemon wedge or light my drink on fire or something. Maybe I'm just an idiot for thinking they should do some birthday themed cocktail, hah. Or at least a shot!! When Sean and I went to Taste (a restaurant VERY similar to Tender located in STL for one of my birthdays a few years ago, the head bartender there brought me a birthday shot of his favorite rum which was such a nice touch! It wasn't a lot or anything, but I didn't care! It's the thought that counts.)

But when the bill came...man, it was realllly awkward. They wanted to charge us for the sweetbread which we barely touched and really disliked. My dad was just going to pay for it, but I told him to at least politely inquire. And when he did, god, was it awkward. The server hummed and hawwwed about it & disappeared in the back. He was gone for a LONG time. When he finally came back he said they had taken it off the bill, and did apologize, because he said they had \"taken it off the wrong bill\" initially. Weird. My dad thought he fabricated that story to prevent an awkward situation.

Needless to say, I don't think I'll ever go back. :("}
{"text":"Came here with a group of five and we nearly tried everything on the cocktail and food menus. Great selection of cocktails and a smart staff who could make anything you'd like with their full bar. Awesome space too.

All the food was good, but there were standouts, here's some to get and some to skip:

Get: Hush Puppies, Deviled Egg, Turducken, Shrimp and Grits, City Chicken, Banana Split

Skip: oysters (as a Bostonian, I may be biased, but these were served lukewarm, strange to me), Scrapple ($10 for scrapple?), Mac and Cheese (a bit plain), Moon Pies (a bit off from what you'd expect)"}
{"text":"I'm so sad that Tender is closing. 

I was first introduced to Tender within a month of me living here, and I instantly fell in love: cool people, great happy hour, and swanky decor. Whenever anyone asked me about my favorite bar in Pittsburgh, I would immediately respond Tender. The bartenders are sharply dressed to match the decor, and they know how to put together a mean (and creative!) drink. Most recently, I tried their Daiquiri de Fresa: refreshing, sweet but not overly so, and delicious. Even my friends who don't generally like rum loved the drink!

The food here is generally solid (though not usually mind-blowing, just standard solid food). Their black garlic hummus is intriguingly addictive and worth a try if you haven't had it.

The staff, and especially the bartenders, are always so nice and friendly and helpful, and really always made Tender such a fun and chill place to be.

There are other cool bars in Pittsburgh, but this loss hurts. Thanks for the good times, Tender. Until we meet again!"}
{"text":"I live in Lawrenceville and have been to Tender a few times. Each time I've had a slightly difference experience (all good) and I figured it was about time I write a review.

To start, the ambiance is great. Noise level varies a lot depending on how busy it is (note: it's always busy on the weekends) and seating seems to be available for many group sizes, which is surprising for a place like this. Low lighting, which I like in a cocktail bar, and cute seating areas that can accommodate groups and offers a little privacy, especially in the back. Yes, \"in the back\" is actually a place you'd want to sit here!

DRINKS
I've had my fair share of special cocktails from their menu, which were all very good though I tend to order vodka martinis most of the time, since they make good ones. Drinks are definitely the highlight here and the bartenders are all very nice, which can make it fun to sit at the bar if you go solo or with one other person.

FOOD
I had always wanted to try the food here. The menu wasn't that extensive, but the options they did offer sounded good. I ended up at Tender last weekend and decided that would be the night that I ate there. I was very disappointed to see that there menu had changed and was now even more limited. They had some small starter dishes and the mains consisted of a burger and a vegetarian sandwich. There was also a couple special items and they were already out of one by 8:00pm. Not what I was hoping for.

My friends and I all ordered the burger and some sides of their potato wedges (because the burger comes solo). We all thought the burger was decent, but not great. The cheese on the burger was not melted, which definitely stood out in a bad way. The potato wedges would have been better if they weren't completely covered in sour cream (I mean covered!).

OVERALL
If you're looking for good cocktails, go to Tender. I will be back for drinks. Tender offers a slightly upscale vibe in an area with a lot of casual options, which is great! However, I would not consider going here for dinner again. Maybe drinks and some snacks, but definitely not a full dinner.

I would give this place 4 stars based solely on drinks, which seems to be their focus anyway!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!!!  Our server, Cass, was fantastic!!!  So knowledgable. So friendly. And was on point with EVERYTHING!!!!  Food was amazing too. Mac and cheese, potato skins, chicken skewers, the burger and the tator tots were awesome. 
Not one complaint!!!!"}
{"text":"I came for dinner late on Saturday night. We had made reservations earlier in the week. We were seated immediately, even though we were 15 minutes or more early for our reservation. I ordered a cocktail made with vodka, cherry, pomegranate and lemon. It was very girly, pink, and served in a martini glass, oh and it was also delicious, refreshing, a little more on the sweet side, but not too sweet. 

The menu has various appetizers and a blurb about asking the server for the entree specials. There were two specials, so we ordered one of each. The crispy skinned trout came with roasted potatoes, shallots, and dill oil. The fish was fresh, oily, and cooked to a perfect medium rare. The skin, however, was not crispy. The other special was a vegetable lasagna with a root vegetable beschemel sauce. It also had mushrooms and tomatoes. It was delicious, and I think the pasta was made fresh. 

It will take about 10-15 minutes from the time you order a cocktail, and it's put on your table, so plan ahead accordingly. Even a glass of wine took ten minutes, probably because it was behind a few orders. The server was at our table a total of three times: to take our order, to drop off our checks, and then give us our receipts. It was obvious he had another section in the other part of the restaurant, but we had to order our drinks from the other waitstaff who were clearing our plates and glasses. 

Overall, I think this is a great bar, but not a great \"sitting down\" restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here because I thought it was Tinder Bar and would be a human, live action, Tinder app replication. I would have \"swiped right\" on our server, Brynn. The high ceilings were nice and created the feeling of space and reminded me of the internet. My friend attempted to charm some girls at the bar, the way people did before Tinder came out. They swiped left on him and said nope. The cocktails were great. I was pleased to see a small tiki section. My stomach was upset and the bartender concocted a nice ginger based drink with other gut friendly ingredients. Brynn gave me an awesome tiki version of a Straub lager."}
{"text":"Here's the thing, I want to love Tender. It has a lot of aspects to it that would scream my name. It has a cozy, unique atmosphere with cool decorative accents and our waiter was very helpful especially when picking one of their many options in cocktails. You will get your money's worth, their drinks are delicious and strong. 
Now it was Pittsburgh Restaurant Week so we had a limited menu. I got the sweetbread, scallops and I honestly don't remember the desert. All of it was good, not great. I've had better.. That's the problem. At the end of the day would I go back to eat? Probably, just to give it another shot with the full menu. Would I go back for a drink? Cheers!"}
{"text":"I live within two blocks of Tender, so it's a pretty regular spot for post-workday drinks with friends. I like that they have a huge selection of craft cocktails (including an entire page of house drinks plus another page of classics) and the bartenders really know their stuff. I'm a fan of gin cocktails, and I can say that they do a great job with the Aviation, The Last Word, and the Corpse Reviver #2 here. I have also tried the Bear Trap off of the house cocktails list, which features bourbon, honey, habanero bitters, and a float of pinot noir. All of this is overtop of crushed ice and garnished with honeycomb cereal (which I thought was funny and unexpected). It's a very tasty combination of flavors.

I haven't had too many experiences with the food, but those that I have had have been good. I split a cheese board with a friend a few months back, and though I can't remember the specifics of what was featured, it was all very good and the server was knowledgeable about the selection. I've had a few of the appetizers as well and everything has been enjoyable.

It's a unique spot in a former bank, and there are some remaining references in the classic decor. The main room of the bar features a giant wall of liquor, and you'll see bartenders periodically sliding the ladder across and climbing up to retrieve something. Definitely has the look and feel of a much earlier era.

Definitely worth a stop when you're in the neighborhood and looking for a couple of quality drinks."}
{"text":"Well this is a neighborhood spot that I assumed would always be there. Have been a couple of times and alway enjoyed myself. The apps are good; loaded potato skins and the caramel popcorn are nice snacks. 
The cocktails are amazingly good. It really seems like such love and care goes into making them.
Mango Cooler and Roman Holiday are the two drinks I've ordered in the past.
Saddens me to see their doors will be closing 4-22-17. I made sure to grab a reservation to say goodbye."}
{"text":"I had heard the hype about Tender and had been looking forward to my reservation for over a week.  As I counted down the days, I reviewed the cocktail and dinner menu online.  I was partially hoping that they had updated the menu since their opening since it seemed somewhat eclectic and not cohesive.  I was slightly disappointed upon my arrival that the menu hadn't been updated and that we were being seated in the room downstairs (otherwise known as the basement).  Despite my misgivings, the decor was creative and reflected the owner's vision of a speakeasy-style bar/restaurant that incorporated the history of the building (including the vault) into the design.  As an aside, the space was probably my favorite part of the experience.  We ordered a few rounds of drinks (which were slightly odd but intriguing) and a bottle of wine.  The wine selection was not complete in terms of variety nor was it priced appropriately (as I found was generally the case at Tender).  I'm more than willing to pay for a good bottle of wine, but our server couldn't answer any of my questions about the choices.  The first round of plates, we ordered the deviled eggs, lobster rolls and city chicken.  The lobster rolls and deviled eggs were tasty and simply prepared but the city chicken (which is really pork) was dry and tasted like fried panko. It reminded me of something that I could've gotten at a bar or fast food restaurant.  My boyfriend, our friend and I were quite hungry when we arrived (which is something that I would not suggest) so we were disappointed when our server was less than attentive and seemed to disappear after we ordered our first round of drinks and food.  To be fair, other tables around us seemed to be getting great service from someone who was able to expound upon drink and menu options with ease.  Our waters were not being refilled and, at one point, we had to call another waitress over to place an order for more food.  After trying the mac and cheese, more deviled eggs (I think that we had three orders), turducken and beef on weck, nothing stood out to me other than the lobster roll and deviled eggs.  I wanted to love Tender, but the food (selection and preparation) and service left much to be desired.  

After dropping way to much money on a dinner that left all three of us only partially satiated, we went upstairs hoping to explore the space while having another drink or two at the bar.  We were greeted by the maitre d and told (very nicely and apologetically) that we couldn't have a drink at the bar unless we could find three seats together.  Really?? I mean, what is going on?!  The bar is huge and is easily the best part of the whole space.  This was a laughable moment for the three of us since we should've paid our check and ran instead of trying to spend more money.  We nicely said to the maitre d that we would go across the street to Industry Public House.  I so wanted to love Tender, its design and to support new local restorations in the Burgh but I guess that Tender and I were just not meant to be. I *may* go back to Tender and try to get a seat at the bar but, until the menu is refined, I don't think that I'll be going back for food."}
{"text":"Tender... I tenderly write you this...

I love love love the interior. The walls, the curtains, the furniture... beautiful! You can absolutely tell that Jeff, the owner, puts a lot of thought into how he wants his restaurants to look (also the owner of Verde). It's just gorgeous and I would love to have my house look like this!

Beyond that, the focus is meant to be on the craft cocktail. I think it's really cool how they highlight the different bartenders with their names and signatures next to the drinks they've concocted. Making them like artists crafting a beautiful piece of work. Which, essentially they are, with delicious tasting cocktails! I ordered the Penny-Farthing both times I stopped in. The first time it was made by the Sarah herself (the creator) and it was like heaven. With Gozio amaretto, Zaya rum, lemon, orange, egg white and sparkling wine. It even came in one of those cute little cocktail glasses. The second time I got it Sarah wasn't working and I have to say, it wasn't the same. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad by any means, just wasn't the same consistency. I also had a punch from the classic cocktail list (which is in super small print in the corner of the menu) and it was stellar! I think they're definitely on the right track...

The food. We ordered 6 plates:

Lobster Roll - #1 stand out. Fresh and that bun... oh lord. Freshly baked in house. Buttered to perfection!
Fluffernutter - Good. But I like the idea so much I want more! The peanut butter is made in house! I wished there was more fluff and more nutter. And I was confused why it wasn't in the dessert section? Is that just me?
Mac n' Cheese - very distinct taste. There was one specific cheese that was mixed in that made it that way that's escaping me, but I liked it. Plus, it was extra smooth and creamy, just the way I like it!
Poke - very good, very fresh.
Hush Puppies - a tad too salty for me.
Potato Salad - slices of red potatoes. I did like the dill vinaigrette but I'd opt for a second portion of the Lobster Roll...

The thing you have to keep in mind is that the plates are √ºber small and pricey. We split all of this between 4 of us and we were all still pretty hungry after. I think I'd come here for either pre-dinner apps or after dinner dessert/snacks. I wouldn't come here just for dinner. My wish/hope/dream is that they offer bigger plates. I think what they have going on is fantastic and interesting. Plus, I love the atmosphere so much that I'd love to sit down and enjoy a nice filling meal here. 

I will most definitely be working my way through the cocktails! And dreaming of making my house look like the inside of this joint..."}
{"text":"tl;dr: Go here for drinks only, NOT food. 

Tender Bar and Kitchen deserves one star for the food, but I gave them two because the cocktails were awesome. They pulled us in with their brilliantly stylized menu, awesome sounding cocktails, and great photos of the restaurant online. The inside of Tender looks amazing, and the selection from the bar is impressive. The service was excellent, our waiter was very helpful. Our drinks were great. 

However, the food was awful. The flatbread appetizer was a nice try, but we kept an open mind about the entrees. As soon as the server brought our plates, my husband and I gave each other a look of terror because we both knew that the food was going to be disappointing by the way it looked. My husband had the lamb cassoulet, and I had the roasted chicken breast. The lamb cassoulet did not seem very fresh. The chicken breast was very dry, brussels sprouts under-cooked, and the prosciutto was just off. 

Overall, a lousy food experience, not worth our ninety-five dollars when I could make something better at home."}
{"text":"Wow - what an incredible (and much-needed) addition to Lawrenceville! Tender successfully does what Industry Public House may have tried to do before they decided to cater to the general masses and become just another rowdy bar with slightly above-average artisanal cocktails. Tender manages to maintain a classier and more sophisticated feel while still welcoming everyone and offering a great menu of dining options and of course, fabulous cocktails.

Before I talk about the food, I just want to note that the venue is fantastic. It's a perfect spot for dinner or drinks or both. They did a great job remodeling the Arsenal Bank Building to cater to the needs of the restaurant while maintaining touches of the building's history - be sure to stop and see the checks on the wall facing Butler. The ambience is true to the era - I absolutely love the piano in the lounge and the occasional live music. There are 2 more dining rooms in addition to the lounge, each with a slightly different feel but the same level of service. The wait staff is incredibly friendly and willing to offer suggestions, which are much needed since it is tough to choose from such great options.

Initially, I didn't feel like the menu did justice to the food itself. Maybe I am just used to restaurants trying to talk up every item on their menu, so at first I thought the menu understated the complexity of the ingredients and the flavor. However, after thoroughly enjoying the first few items, I learned to appreciate the simplicity of the descriptions and just trust the chef. We tried the Shrimp and Grits, Lobster Rolls, Mac and Cheese, Deviled Eggs, Yaka Mein, Meatloaf, Oysters, Poke, and the Moon Pies for dessert. It was all exquisite, but the Yaka Mein and Meatloaf were my favorites.

As for the drinks, I'd start by letting telling the expert bartenders what you like and letting them suggest something for you. The cocktail list makes it hard to decide, and they are good at matching your preferences and mood with the perfect drink.

I can't wait to attend one of the special events or to take one of the mixology classes here. I will update the review once I do!"}
{"text":"Prohibition speakeasy ambiance? Check.  Incredibly friendly, hip, knowledgeable, and helpful staff?  Check?  1920's hair, and outfits?  Check?  Interesting craft cocktails, and delicious reasonably priced food?  Check and check!  For an added treat, check out their tenderpgh website with a very fun retro stylized vibe.

I had a great experience at Tender and I'd go back in a heart beat.  My only criticisms are, the food menu while tasty is pretty limited with less than a dozen options at the time of my writing this.  The portions are pretty small (think tapas bar tastes) though they are prized accordingly with most dishes between $5-$8.  

I suspect Tender (Short for bartender) makes most of their money on the drinks, most are in the $10-$15 range, so 3 drinks will easily cost you over $40 with tip.  That's a bit rich for my blood, but I'm the first to admit these are not your everyday libations.  They use top shelf ingredients, and hand craft each drink fresh for you, including rare ingredients like rhubarb bitters, blood orange marmalade, and clove infused cucumbers.  They also support local PGH businesses with ingredients like Wigle Whiskey and Heinz Simply Ketchup, which as a long time burgher I love to see.

I'd go back for the nibbles, service, and atmosphere any day, but I'd save the craft drinks for a deserving occasion.  i.e. Taste on Tuesdays, but save the sipping for special Saturday celebrations!"}
{"text":"Love Tender!  I've been here a number of times (including a holiday party and NYE) and had take-out. 

Service - top-notch.  The hostesses, servers, bartenders, and mgmt. staff are all super-friendly and efficient.  

I love the vibe in here and d√©cor (Tender is a renovated bank).  They even found ways to use materials from the bank - check out the wall of old checks in the front lounge area.

Tender is first and foremost a bar, and a place to eat second. I enjoy their food, esp the burger, but don't expect go here and leave stuffed.  They tell you right in their name - drinks are a priority, food is secondary.

But the drinks.....oh my.  Sooo yummy.  I'm slowly working my way through the drink menu - so far I've enjoyed the Immortality Juice, the USS Richmond punch (served in the cutest little pewter cup), Swizzle Me Timbers, the Sally Draper, and the Jet Pilot.  Every drink I've had I enjoyed, but my fav is the Sally Draper - very fragrant and smooth.

Their spin on Happy Hour is called \"Bankers Hours\" offering 2 bucks off all cocktails 5-7, including Saturday.

Parking can be tricky in this section of L-ville.  There is a pay parking lot right next door, if you are lucky enough to find a space."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and their cocktails are to die for. They remind me of a place I used to frequent in Chicago. It's nice to have this kind of creativity with the drinks in Pittsburgh. The food is also exceptional here. 

Also if they're serving the wings. YOU NEED TO ORDER THEM! They are PHENOMENAL!

The only reason this doesn't get a perfect five is that the main part when you walk in is a bit strange to me. The low seating isn't my favorite."}
{"text":"Boring.  Our first time trying the location for a meal was also our families last time eating there. Made a reservation for a party of 6. Siblings, parents, myself, husband, and 1 kiddo. 

I made a reservation. I don't know why. The dining room was empty when we were there. EMPTY. 

When we arrived the restaurant was a ghost town. Which was weird considering the neighborhood was celebratory.  We explained that one person needed to order right away due to being diabetic. We. Explained that we planned that they would order and the rest of us would dine at a leisurely pace and order appetizers. When we didn't order alcohol, the waitress seemed annoyed. She took my parents & sons order for food. And didn't return. Other wait staff delivered our meals. We couldn't add appetizers and more to our initial meals even though we expressed that's what we had planned. 

Not good. 

It seems like food is a complete afterthought. We genuinely felt that since we came in as a group of 6 and weren't drinking liquor, our waitress just didn't care about our table. She didn't bring our food out or return to see if we needed anything for our food. Or even try to add more sales. 

My mom asked for a condiment from another staff member after her meal arrived. They snottily told her they don't provide anything additional to meals they serve because 'it would ruin her palate and the chef prepares everything perfectly the way he sees fit.' I believe she asked for mayonnaise or mustard. The response she was given was just shocking.  The experience was surreal to the point that we didn't want to be there. 

My son had a burger and fries that were cold. No on came to check on us for a considerable amount of time. I literally ordered take out to be delivered to my house from my phone while sitting with waiting for the check. 

So we spent about $70-80 for 3 meals. And then everyone went home to eat. 

We've been back to meet friends who picked the location because it's a super cute place to meet a friend for a drink. But I would never recommend the food menu

I genuinely can't remember having a meal as uncomfortable as this one."}
