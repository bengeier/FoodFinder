{"text":"decent bar with decent food service is good but nothing that will blow you away"}
{"text":"Not much variety for lunch/dinner menu, but the food is tasty.
Brunch is awesome, lots of food for one of the best prices in Liberty village.
$4.00 build your own Caesars for brunch.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Been there twice.  Food was okay.

Service wasn't the greatest either times.  Took 30 mins to get waiter's attention just to order, food took long, then took forever to flag down wait staff to ask for something.  Nobody asked us how we were doing during our meal.  Then when the waiter cleared our plate he dropped a fork & knife on my partner.  Aweful."}
{"text":"Considering I've handled dozens of my area condo & loft sales here, I likely owe the pub a cut of my commission. Actually..scratch that....I've spent a good deal of money there. The best patio in the area for sure. A must before the FC games."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! I've gone several times since i found it two years ago. I've held a couple of events there and they are very accommodating when it comes to large parties. The food is always good and the service is friendly. The only downside is that they took the White Peach Sangria off the menu but other than that I'm satisfied every time I visit."}
{"text":"Good wings, good size, good sauce. Great fries, automatically came with two small cups, one of smoked ketchup (correct me if I am wrong) and the other of mayo.  Mayo, neglected in so many places but goes so well with fresh cut fries.  I was impressed with these small details, it shows care and emphasis on good quality pub fare, which is forgotten in so many pubs across our city.  I would imagine the rest of the menu may be done well, but have yet to try anything else.  I am a local, so I will be back here for dinner one day.  Decor is nice, nothing extravagant, service was great at the time, but place was empty, plus, hard to make a very good judgement just being here once.

3 stars for good pub experience. 4 stars for the wings and fries."}
{"text":"I am so sad I have to give this place 1 star. When it first opened it was awesome. Service was great, food even better. I don't know what happened. Maybe they got too confident that they would always be in business. I live nearby and rarely go anymore. We just visited again last week and nothing improved. Wrap was soggy, eggs overcooked. Just bad and tastless. We complained in the past but if things don't change, what is the point of doing it again. As it stands, I don't recommend  this place for food at all. Drinks maybe. Such a shame."}
{"text":"This place has a lively atmosphere. It's a nice spot to come for a few drinks and to watch the game. It's much too overpriced though. It's about $9 for a pint of strongbow which is ridiculous. The food is ok but again overpriced. The situation was different when Brazen Head was the only spot in liberty village but now there are loads more pubs and restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Food is ok, beer choice is quite poor for today, but 
UNBELIEVABLY SLOW SERVICE!!!
We went on thursday lunch from work, June 30, and waited ! 1 HOUR ! before first entry arrived, even first beer we waited for halfhour. 
Never going there again. Ever. 
Shame, shame, shame! Zero stars, zero tips."}
{"text":"This place gets a single star because the food was fairly good....that is, after it took almost an HOUR to arrive.

Short and sweet version: 

Went to Brazen's before the Toronto FC game for some drinks and food.  Like the experience of many other patrons here, we were attended to quickly by the host when first arriving but after that service was nowhere.   Drinks took forever.......others who arrived after got their food first........while we were waiting for an hour for food to arrive - no one attended to us.  Need I say more.  How much worse could it get.   


NOTE TO BRAZEN HEAD---IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO HANDLE THE ORDERS FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT A TIME DO NOT HANG UP A GIANT TFC BANNER OUTSIDE YOUR ESTABLISHMENT.  In fairness, we were given a free side order and discount on our meal.

Still not worth it in my opinion.

Least to say, I will never be returning to this place.  

Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"What can I say about the Ol' Head?  I really do like this space but every time I go I realize that the menu is overpriced and the food is mediocre at best.  I get that it's attempting to be an upscale and trendy Irish inspired pub but the fact that it's in Liberty Village doesn't mean that they need to charge an arm and a leg for food & drink you could easily get elsewhere for much less $$$.   Checked out some nhl and nfl games there and they wouldn't even put the game sound on in the bar?!"}
{"text":"Went here fairly often in the past.  Food was decent but it's really gone downhill with the new menu.

Chicken and waffles are nothing more than chicken strips, congealed chicken gravy, and soggy waffles.  The first time in a long time that I have had to send a meal back, anywhere!

Liberty Village, as a rule, has been declining in terms of its food offerings.  If bland food is what you want, then the Brazen Head is at the lead of the pack in the Village (along with Williams Landing and the absolutely horrid Local Public Eatery)."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times now with friends and family for dinner. The decor is typical Irish pub and it has always been clean. We have found that the food has been consistent (I've tried a few different options) and the servers have been friendly. Typically food arrival has been slow, but the restaurant is always busy. The patio areas are great, would recommend trying to sit outside whenever possible."}
{"text":"Was a fan of this place when I lived in King West, but upon my return years later I was ignored for 25 minutes, watching three tables get served near me during that time, and hearing waiters gripe about who gets what table next for tips. Was waiting on three friends to catch up on life, so we took our dinner and drinks business over to the rooftop bar across the street instead. The least they could have done was offer to take a drink order.

Also, I made an attempt to secure patio seating but was told there are no spots available. Although, upon peering in, low and behold, at least two tables were available.

An insincere attempt was made to slow me out the exit when leaving, but I had made up my mind not to fork over my money to Brazen Head that day nor another in the future."}
{"text":"31/2 stars. The Brunch Bunch tried this place out this past weekend. I read many reviews about bad service but our service was friendly and on top of things. They have a great patio to hang out on to drink their $4 caesars. Yup 4 bucks !!!!  They were tasty too . The food was just ok. It is a pub afterall so dont expect too much. I would go back again for the atmosphere and the  brunch caesars. 
I have been forewarned though it is a big TFC hangout pre and post games so be aware of that. Dont expect fast service when the place is jammed  with footies. Bet its great fun on those days though."}
{"text":"My nachos were short of restaurant quality, especially for their price. Scarcely placed cheesed on a bunch of plain white tortia chips with a drizzle of beans and salsa with some guac..... Boooo. But good drinks though of course"}
{"text":"Good place for some summertime drinking, but only part of the patio gets any sun and that part fills up fast.  There's a rooftop patio too, but it's got the same issue (and you have to wait forever to get up there, because it's only accessible by elevator).  On TFC game days they have a reduced menu so they can accommodate the crowds, but it's got all the standards, so you don't feel like you're missing anything."}
{"text":"Brazen Head is Great!  We really enjoyed our meal & the atmosphere!

Our last night out here in Toronto we decided to head out to the West end of the city, and try out Brazen Head.  It is a fairly new Irish Pub - definitely follows the \"Irish Pub\" theme - it serves beer and pub food.  Done!

We had great service, and one of the managers - Charlotte - stopped by to make sure we were doing well.  Our server (Lindsay) was excellent as well, and made sure that our drinks were fresh and that our food came on schedule. Danny did a lot of work getting our food out together (for 6) so no one was waiting for others to be served! The Braised Rib was fantastic, as the meat just fell off the bone.  Our guests had Fish & Chips and the Jambalya was HAWT! :-)  We would definitely go here again.  

One of our guests had the Guinness, while the rest of us had Caesars - which were made to perfection.  Caesars are not an easy drink to make, so having a bar staff that can do them fast and well is hard to find.  Strange to have great Caesars at an Irish Pub... But who cares!  :-)  Drink Up!

Parking is easy!  There are a lot of spots all around, and across the street, there is a parking lot for Metro - that also has paid parking.

The pub was moderately full, no wait time for a table.

... oh, Thanks to Kat F. for the great review I read which helped me in making my decision to go here!

I gave Brazen Head 4 stars!"}
{"text":"This was a great setting for a birthday party I had this weekend.  They were able to accommodate a party of 20 and we were sitting up on the 3rd floor balcony with access to a gas fireplace.  The staff was nice and friendly and the drink prices were reasonable.  The food was ok - sweet potato fries and calamari were good but the artichoke and spinach dip was a bit bland with stale pita bread.
I have to add that they even took a drink order over the phone from a friend who was stuck at work and a 'mega shot' was delivered for me for my birthday.  A nice touch.
Overall, a cozy and quaint place to hold a celebration with family and friends."}
{"text":"Good Atmosphere
Decent food
Beer is beer
Reasonable prices for the location
Not any more than most Irish Pubs I go to"}
{"text":"Overpriced and unoriginal pub. The only reason it gets 2 stars is because of the patio.  Service is slow and the menu is boring. The bathrooms are usually foul when the crowds are there for the TFC pre-party. I'd recommend Foggy Dew instead, it's only a few blocks west on King."}
{"text":"I dont leave 1 star often, unless its deserved. Im reviewing this based on 4 appetizers, nachos, wings, spinach dip, and calamari. 

I'm willing to lower expectations for pub food, but this was pub food that resembled hot garbage. The wings were ok. The calamari and spinach dip were not edible. 

Premium prices for bad microwaved Sysco food

Decent beer promos though."}
{"text":"I decided to try the Brazen Head after walking by a bunch of times and.. well I was very disappointed.

Service was shit.  I sat down for 10 min before my waiter came to see me.  He recommended one of the \"Daily Features\" which I ordered.  He came back 10 min later saying they ran out of some of the ingredients.  I ordered the portobello quesadilla instead and a soup- My soup took 20 min to get to me, and the quesadilla's were greasy and flavorless.

I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"You should definitely hit up this little bit of Liberty Village for the drinks and the decor and not for the customer service.  I have used the Brazen Head a number of times for events because frankly they are a ton better from a Management standpoint than Williams Landing, they do have a great building and a good menu (even catering to the celiac), but their Wait Staff leave a lot to be desired, they very often forget our orders and one large party left a member of their staff in tears while we watched, food orders are often mixed up and sent back as well....if they work on those issues they have a chance at being a solid event destination."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars I would. Took 1 hour to get our food, bare in mind there were only 2 of us, both getting the same thing. Our food came out stone cold. The waitress was nowhere to be seen. Literally the worst service I have ever received. I used to tell everyone about the amazing breakfasts at this place, I certainly will not be doing that again."}
{"text":"Excited about Taking in the Brazenhead this morning before the TFC game I headed off super early to get a spot on the patio for some breakfast and a couple of pints before the game. Unfortunately this lead to disappointment as I found out on game day that they run a condensed menu and breakfast is not available. Damn. I'd been before and the breakfast was fairly tasty. Oh well. Went with the Fish and Chips and a couple of rolling rocks. Service was fantastic, friendly, and efficient. Fish and Chips were tasty but too much for my stomach at 12:00 on a Saturday. Patio is a nice one in a very hip and growing area of shops and restaurants in the Liberty Village. Definately a good spot to hit before a TFC game but damn it please serve breakfast"}
{"text":"For real, if you are writing this place up and your friends didn't force you to go here prior to an FC game. Hit the bricks. This place sucks. I am embarrassed to say how many thousands of dollars I've spent here on the initial resurgence of Liberty village. Why? It was the only spot for a long time.

  I've won free appetizers here in a raffle for a group of up to 20 people only to have the assistant manager tell me we weren't drinking enough booze. 
I've been made to wait outside in the rain on a week night by some shitbag rent-a-cop when the place was empty just to create the optic that it was busy. 
If it didn't upset me so much to rehash the type of shit this place does for its customers I would bore you to tears. I'll try to summarize. After years of going here, I'll go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"An Irish Pub?  I think not.  Just another cookie cutter \"theme\" restaurant in a city already full of them.  The food is overpriced, mass produced and boring; the beer selection is predictable, and appallingly expensive; the service is slow and disinterested.  The only thing this place has going for it are its 3 patios, and half the time in the spring and summer they haven't even got them open!  Cooking everything in a guinness-based sauce doesn't make you an Irish pub."}
{"text":"A busy Irish pub with the expected decore. The menue has traditional pub fare and decent International draft beers. Service was good."}
{"text":"Nice patio, but the worst service I've had in awhile, unfriendly. Food is average."}
{"text":"Well, I never thought I'd see the day when I'd give an Irish pub outside of Ireland five stars, but here you go.

This place wasn't our first choice (in fact, it was our third, but Local Public Eatery was packed and Bar Vesta's menu looked bleh), but our decision to come here couldn't have been better!

The pub is huge, yet still cosy. There's a fireplace, Irish style and plenty of varied seating - booths, sofas, barstools - the works. The atmosphere was fantastic! Much more vibrant and bouncing than a lot of places downtown. If I were to settle in Canada for good (and if I was loaded), I would so want to live in Liberty Village. There's tvs for the sports fans, but the volume was low enough so that those uninterested could happily ignore it. 

I was surprised to read reviews below complaining about the staff, because I thought they were fantastic. The hostess was sweet and didn't put any pressure on us when we asked to see a menu before making a decision to eat there. Our server was really friendly and fast, which went extra appreciated as it was a very busy night, and another table close to us were whining to our server about their food which probably didn't add to the quality of her night. 

The menu has all the staple pub grub fare, as well as traditional Irish food and other random dishes (chicken Rogan Josh, lol) thrown in for good measure. I went with the veggie burger and the bf had the Irish stew. My bf knows his Irish stew, as it's one of his favourite homecooked meals to have back in Ireland. Like a lot of Irish people, he's usually sceptical of ''Irish'' food abroad, but he said this was one of the best stews ever! With both lamb and beef, at just $9, he was delighted, and loved the mini scones that came accompanying it.

The veggie burger and Yukon fries I had were to die for. I admit, whenever I have a burger of any description combined with fries, the first thing I do is a) reach for the ketchup and b) reach for the salt. With this dish, there was no need! The chiptole mayo on the black bean burger was divine - the flavours complemented each other so well. The sauce came with just the right amount of hotness so the black bean burger could be tasted, and came in just the right amount. The fries were hot and fresh, and required no extra seasoning whatsoever. The portion was huge enough to ensure I couldn't finish either the fries or burger, despite both of them being totally delicious (and despite me arriving starving). 

Our soda refills came aplenty by the attentive staff, and although I wasn't drinking alcohol that night, their selections of craft beers (Liberty 504!) and cocktails were really tempting. Nothing was as tempting as their homemade apple pie though, which sounded yummy. Unfortunately, I was too full to even think about it!

Overall, I just loved my experience here. Extra kudos for the pub making a genuine effort to make the place authentically Irish. The Brazen Head is devoid of kitschy stereotypes and I loved how the menu came with with a history of the pub's connection with Ireland. 

On our way out, the hostess gave us a flyer telling us about their Christmas party, and encouraged us to return soon. We definitely will!"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place.   Their patios are great.  The food is good.

What i can't deal with though is the service.

I don't know what kind of ship they run at this place, but i'll tell you one thing.  I see a LOT of new faces..... or maybe i should say, i NEVER see the same server twice.  I realize they have a lot of staff, but i go there a lot.  The turnover there must be ridiculous.  

maybe it's because of the constant stream of new people... i don't know, but the service the past few months has gone down the toilet.   Food will take sometimes an hour to get to you.  Drinks will quite often take 45 minutes to get to you.  Your entire table will long have had empty glasses before the server thinks to come back and see if you'd like another drink.

These aren't random occurrences.   I frequent this place because i live near... but  the past 5-6 times have left me so angry because of their poor customer service that i do not think i will go back."}
{"text":"This is a great bar if you only want to have one drink. After one drink the servers don't seem to know what to do. Plus side I generally get a free drink for poor service. Unfortunately it takes about twice as long to get the drinks as it does to drink them. I'd rather stab myself in the eye than ever lay foot in this place again."}
{"text":"Our office is in the same complex as the Brazen Head, so we've had company lunches here many times.  It doesn't seem to matter how busy they are, the service is always terrible.  On our most recent trip, it took more than an hour for our food to come.  It's not like they have an overly complex or interesting menu either.  The food is generic and below average even for pub fare.

It's an all right place to have a drink or hang out, since they do have a number of large patios, but never, ever eat here.  Especially if you expect to get served in a reasonable amount of time.

Bottom line: We wouldn't come here at all if it wasn't literally 25ft from our office."}
{"text":"Was there yesterday for drinks. I am not sure if the tables have ever been properly cleaned. You just can't put your hand or elbow on the table without it getting kinda stuck; so my friend and I put the napkins on the table. And we both had a good laugh when we tried to remove the napkins, it was like Velcro. I wish they would clean those tables properly. Can't imagine the amount of bacteria on the surface."}
{"text":"CUSTOMERS:
Watch out for their filtered bottle water. They will serve it to you open but is actually tap water. 
They tried to pull a trick on our table with it and they laughed it off saying 'haha the boss is always trying this'

They messed up our orders several times, sometimes forgetting to include a key ingredient such as the noodles for Thai Salad. Again, was laughed off ..

Drinks are way overpriced. 9$ for an oz of alcohol no matter how it's served.

Food isn't great either. Had the calamari which out of a group of 12 no one finished. I was told the burgers weren't very great either but hadn't tried them. Fish and chips were meh, wouldn't eat it again.

Only real benefit about going to this place is the patio.

I see a lot of corporate events here but I get the feeling that they worked out some deal such as \"You get us a group of x amount of your employees and  we'll give your company a deal\""}
{"text":"Our dining experiences at Brazen Head have never been fantastic. It's a two minute walk from our front door, and thus an establishment we frequent quite often, mainly as a gathering spot to hang out with friends / neighbours and to watch the happenings of our lively neighborhood. The food is alright; our food orders frequently get messed up;  it is uber-loud in the dining room on pretty well every night, and the service is not always the best (it's been the pits the last two times we've been). P.S. Lamb seems to be extinct from The Irish Stew. Sshhh, you didn't hear it from me."}
{"text":"Came here the first day I moved to Toronto, overall experience was great. Our server was very friendly and knew the menu well, she was able to answer all of our questions when ordering. 

The atmosphere is a typical pub, lots of tvs with sports in the background. The beer selection was good too! I tried a Belgium white beer and found it very good. 

The food was quick to arrive, my group all ordered club houses or sandwiches and found them to be very good and filling. 

The only reason for the 4 stars was because of the \"corny\" attire for the waitresses... But some guys like the school girl look (short plaid skirts). 

Will return for the great service and the food :)"}
{"text":"Burger was terrible - the bun was chewy and the meat was charred. The sweet potato fries, on the other hand, were the best I've ever had. Crispy, fragrant, just the right amount of seasoning. So good I skipped the mayo / aioli I usually have with my fries. 

Great casual atmosphere, I'd definitely go back there again, though I will certainly not be having anything that is not deep fried."}
{"text":"I've put off this review for a while and thought now might not be a bad time to re-approach it.

I came here with my girlfriend during a lunch break and the overall experience was disappointing.

To start, it took way too long for the waitress to take our orders. The place was less than half full. Furthermore, it took 25+ minutes to finally get our food, which consisted of nothing more tricky than a couple burgers, some fries and a salad. Most of our lunch break was spent just waiting. When we finally got our food, we had no choice but to wolf it down as fast as we could. It tasted fine, but we were in no state to savor it. I also noted that the prices seemed a little high for something of that quality. It wasn't robbery by any means, but it was a 15 dollar burger that tasted like an 8 dollar one. 

Lastly, because we were so short on time, my girlfriend asked for a take-out box to bring the salad with her. It must have taken close to 15 minutes for the waitress to finally bring it. 

To make things even worse, she was in a huffy mood for pretty much the entirety of the meal.

It may have honestly been one of those freak bad days, but I couldn't help but have a sour taste in my mouth after the whole experience."}
{"text":"Totally average food with average staff. Nice building and ambiance lots of beer on tap and a few ol wines too. Not a bad place and little other competition in the area, but don't go out of your way to find the place."}
{"text":"Un pub assez nouveau dans un quartier qui l'est encore plus, pratique pour les rencontres d'affaire ou rendez-vous avec de jeunes informaticiens ! Rien de très remarquable outre une grande terrasse et un service agréable et efficace."}
{"text":"There are a few local pubs near BMO Field that are considered to be clubhouses for Toronto FC season ticket holders, but 'The Brazen' is my favourite one. 

Some fans find it a bit snotty/clean/preppy/pricey...whatever. I prefer it over the others because, the food is really good (I highly recommend the fish & chips), the Guinness is always flowing, and the crowd is always hyped for the match. 

I've been there at other times when I wasn't going to a game and have always received good service so you can go any time, but the atmosphere is always killer before and after a game. 

TFC !(clap, clap, clap) TFC !(clap, clap, clap) TFC !(clap, clap, clap)"}
{"text":"After my brother and I found out that the Gladstone was out of chicken wings we hopped over to Liberty Village to fill a chicken wing fix as there aren't to many places in the area.

We waited for a little bit, had a few of the servers and staff walk by us and didn't seat us so we walked in and grabbed our own seat.  The place had people in it but was far from packed.  After a few minutes, someone came by to see what we wanted and we asked for food menus.

We ended up getting 2 lbs of wings with honey garlic and jerk chicken wings as well as their award winning cottage pie.

We got the wings first and they were cooked decent.  Honey garlic were exactly that and not overly sweet like some places.  The jerk chicken was not what I expected.  They tasted like honey sauced wings with a little bit of spice which I couldn't make out what it was from.  They were ok for a wing that you didn't know the flavour but for jerk chicken wings they sucked because it did not remind me of a jerk sauce at all.

The cottage pie was good though!  I'd definitely try that again but for some reason I thought it was slightly in the oven for to long.

I hope the service isn't like that most days and honestly avoid the jerk chicken wings because it's not what you might expect.!"}
{"text":"Brazen Head Irish Pub is *the* Irish Pub in Toronto to check out.  I dropped by for lunch today to see what all the hype is about.  The pub was spacious with ample interior seatings; there is also three levels of outdoor patio seating available.

Food wise - they have descent pub food; prices are a bit on the high side for pub grub.  I had the burger, it was descent but I have had better elsewhere.  Their selection on tap is average with some interesting and unique blends.

Service was above average, mind you, we were the 1/2 dozen patrons after a long weekend having lunch.  I have heard that service levels diminish as it get busier.

Brazen Head is a good place to check out in the Liberty Village area if you are looking to grab a pint or pub grub."}
{"text":"This is a totally normal pub that is reminiscent of the time I've spent in suburban pubs. It's pretty much within spitting distance of our condo, so we've been more times than is probably warranted. But, whatever! It's fun and totally fine.

Tips:
-The fish and chips and Guinness deal on Fridays is pretty decent.
-Half price appetizers on Tuesday between 4 and 8."}
{"text":"Great place for finger food and watching the game! Their nachos are unreal. They're stacked with many toppings and are generously sized (I ordered small nachos with a friend and we couldn't finish them). 

The music and vibe is pretty cool. They play top 40s and Irish music and the decor resembles a typical, quaint Irish pub. 

Service is fast and friendly. 

Two thumbs up! 

PS They provide a discount if you come with a club or team that's larger than 7 people"}
{"text":"I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich which was absolutely delicious. However the service could be better. We had initially sat at our table for quite some time before being waited and the food also took time to arrive. It may have been due to the high volume from TFC game. Besides that, great food, great price, great environment!"}
{"text":"This place is in an amazing location and the look/layout is very nice. The food is only so so and really should have at least the basic pub fare but doesn't. The prices are a little steep considering but I guess they figure they are in a trendy area so they must be as well?

I have actually never had problems with service myself but a lot of people I know have complained of it and said for that reason would not return. I work within a few feet so it is very handy but if it's my choice or I have the time will travel to just about any pub and know I will do as well if not better for price and quality. Plus with all the great choices in the area why not?"}
{"text":"Great place and atmosphere. Hip pub with a variety of organic food and drinks. We had the veggie burger (mushroom burger!) and regular burger with fries. We were happy with the food. My only complaint is that they allow smoking on the patio which is extremely bothersome."}
{"text":"*Just a recent update*

A friend recently moved to Liberty Village so we decided to hit this place up today for a late lunch...
The place seems pretty cool, it has a great location and pretty good variety of beverages. 
We didn't spend a lot of time here but it has a pretty busy social scene going on.
As far as the food goes, I had the Fish and Chips with gravy as suggested by the waiter. I prefer a crispy batter over a doughy batter so I wasn't too impressed with these \"tim bit \" style batter balls..they were really small portions considering the two piece was $18, the serving of fries was pretty small (in a tiny bowl) and the gravy was room temprature. 
My friend had the steak on a bun \"special\" and was very impressed with it so I would suggest you try that out.

Service was pretty good considering the waiter seemed overwhelmed with a large number of tables to look after.

I'll go back in a while to give it another chance."}
{"text":"I have only really ever popped in here for drinks and have always had a decent time, especially when they have live music. 

Going on a Friday for after work drinks and food this place did not fail to please.

First best fish and chips so far! 
Okay so the chips were still the crappy fries but the fish was awesome, better than anywhere I have experience in the city and a really chunky piece of cod.

The pub is pretty large so they were easily able to accommodate the 14 of us without much of a wait. That is not to say the pub was not busy as it seems to always be busy whenever I have been and way to busy on a TFC game day.

The pub is very nice inside, wood all over the show but with a nice country pub ambience on the non-game days. 

From the get go I could not fault this place, the service was awesome with one guy tending to our whole table we had our drinks quick, and our food orders collected. 

They have a very good pub style menu, and each day one of the dishes is on a special so the day I went was Fish and Chips for $12.99. 

The food came out a bit staggered but it was no biggy since there were so many of us but for those who had to wait the few minutes it was not a problem because of the COMPLIMENTARY OYSTERS! 
Yaah you heard right, on Fridays, between 5 and 7pm they bring out oysters.  

Must have had ten oysters on top of the fish and chips I had so I left this place a happy chappy. Overall a great place in Liberty village."}
{"text":"This place is good for drinks, not so much of food. Chaotic service due to holiday. Minimal menu selection. Kitchen was really hold back. Waited for an hr plus for my chicken Burger and it turned out fries being too burnt and bun of the Burger was still cold. Seems like just randomly thrown onto a plate. Our server wasn't quite friendly, probably due to busy tables turnover. In general, I would choose another patio to sit in."}
{"text":"We were staying in the area on our trip to Toronto and this place was right across the street. It had a very standard Irish pub feel and the menu was the same. 

I got a beer from there very limited beer selection and he ordered a caeser...(TIP, if they ask you if you want to spice your own caeser, say yes...) 

For my lunch choice I ordered the corned beef sliders. They were actually pretty good, nothing to rave about but still tasty and satisfying. He ordered the club sandwich... same deal.

Service was friendly and our food was fast and that's a wrap!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Brazen Head in Liberty Village for Pre-TFC soccer game drinks since the team inception. It never really crossed my mind that this fancy lookin join could possibly serve any other purpose other than wetting my soccer hooligan whistle!

It's hard to describe BH's aesthetics. When you walk in it feels very Irish Pub. You know low ceilings, dim lighting, lots of wood fixtures (oh and staff in kilts...huzzahh!) However, venturing in a little further you'll find elements of design sophistication that exceed your typical Pub style ambiance. Instead this place is basically and Irish pub representation of Liberty Village itself. Sheik!

Visited on a Wednesday night to meet up with a friend and was pleased to find that it was \"Wines of World Wednesday\" which meant that any glass of wine could be yours for a mere $7! Hmmmm, is that a challenge? Well I accept even if it isn't!

After about $28 of the best the world had to offer at BH I opted for the cobb salad with chicken breast. I was happy with my selection until our server made a great little recco to sub goat cheese for the blue cheese in the salad since the dressing was already a blue cheese based dressing. Interesting....

And what a recco! That brought my Cobb experience to a whole nutha level and I enjoyed that more so than I had any other in a long long time! Score one for WOW Wednesdays and Score another for the keen suggestion of our server!

As I mentioned this is a great spot for TFC pregames but with hockey season back in session I'd stop in for a pint and watch a game anytime (their on tap selection is on point). It's also a great live music spot when they bring in acoustic acts in their large room call them for details and get a seat early - really great venue for it AND the acts always perform fireside (next to the fireplace) which is very cozy in the winter!

Lastly my fave feature of this place is their fab 2nd floor patio with a great view of liberty village, the Toronto skyline, and the waterfront. Makes me yearn for patio season or at the very least their St. Patricks Day party which spills out onto this patio most years!

Eatcrest out!"}

{"text":"Perdu dans liberty village, oui je dis ça car l'arrêt de bus pour regagner dowtown est à 10 min de marche ce qui est très loin pour Toronto, le Brazen Head offre cependant une ambiance de fou surtout pour la St Patrick. Les canadiens savent définitivement faire la fête : avec un service commençant à 11h du matin et 2 shifts qui s'enchaînent jusquèà 2h du mat.... Vous retrouvrez les valeurs sûres comme la Guiness, la Kilkenny et la HARP. ajoutez quelques Irish Car Bomb et vous aurez la recette d'une St Patrick réussie.
Tout le monde vient avec un élément vestimentaire vert et idéalement un chapeau de leprechaun ou des stickers sur le visage.
Le bar en lui même est au top, patio en bas, patio en haut, grande salle pour les groupes et serveurs courant partout efficacement.
A recommander donc si vous habitez dans le coin.

//Lost in Liberty Village, yeah the closest bus stop to go back to downtown is at 10 minutes walk which is quite far for Toronto! Brazen Head has still that crazy spirit that shows that canadian people know how to party. Starting with a good pint of Guiness, Kilkenny or Harp at 11 am and keep on going during two full shifts, congrats to the staff.
Everyone comes here with a green shirt or whatever or event the leprechaun hat or stickers on their face.
The bar itself is awesome with 2 patios, huge main room for groups and in the middle of all this waiters who run around with the orders very efficiently.
Definitely a place to try if you live in the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for brunch, lured in by the sign saying $4 build-your-own-caesers and mimosas. We waited a couple minutes to be seated even though it wasn't very busy. We ordered drinks and my mimosa was delicious (though it was made with Brickworks cider and not champagne) but my boyfriend's caeser was seriously weak. We both ordered eggs benedict and it arrived within a reasonable amount of time. The eggs benny wasn't spectacular but whatever, it was the tater tots on the side that caught our attention. They looked like tater tots from any McCain bag you can buy at the grocery store and heat wise were room temperature at best. We were ravenous and didn't want to complain, service was pretty slow (can't count how many times staff walked by us and didn't look in our direction) and we didn't want to make a big deal just to have to wait another 20 minutes to eat. Ultimately the food was edible just not particularly pleasant. We won't ever be going back."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here often for the great environment and their nachos. I don't know if their chef changed but our nachos were very disappointing. 
-bottom of the bag chips
-practically no cheese
-sour cream drizzled all over... with a scoop of salsa and guac in the middle... whatever happened to having it on the side? 
-one layer of chips... What happened to the mountain of nachos? 
I put it on social media and someone came over and asked us how our food was and ended up not charging us for the fail nachos. She also said that we should have told our waitress instead of putting it on social media. HOW RUDE! Our waitress was so MIA to the point where my friend had to get up and go to the bar to order a drink. We're never going here again especially since there are so many other places in Liberty Village."}
{"text":"Arrived to a slow lunch service (2 other tables and possibly the manager on the bar). Servers switched out after our order was taken - girl to guy. The girl recommended a stout burger for my partner, I had the regular angus. Calamari app was greasy and under-cooked. Burgers came - nothing tasted like stout, and the burgers were hockey pucks. Server stopped by once, long enough to NOT offer another beer or ask why food was nearly untouched. Asked for a bill with food still mainly untouched, presented with no questions. Paid full price. This is our second time here (the first was last summer). We won't be back. Too many better places to spend $65 for lunch."}
{"text":"Place is pretty big, lots of seating and many TVs. A prime spot for TFC. Great beer selection. They offer local and imports as well as rotating taps. 

They've got good specials as well. The Halibut and Chips was fantastic. Thin batter, thick cut fillet and fries to die for. Even the coleslaw was excellent. 

Service was great as well. Didn't abandon us, but didn't stare us down. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times as its close to office. Honestly the food is not great but one thing that stands out are the mini burgers. Should try them."}
{"text":"This is a really convenient, nice pub close to the exhibition grounds. Approximately 5-10 min walk from the GO Station.

This was my second time here. On event nights, they have a more restricted menu but it is  enough of a selection to satisfy the palates of most picky eaters! The food was above standard pub fare with a unique and varied menu. The Cuban tacos were my favourite - delicious!! 

The service was fantastic. I don't remember the servers name but she was sweet and attentive and prompt, even with the place being a full house. 

Lots of room. Great patio in the heart of Liberty Village! No complaints!"}
{"text":"I've come here a handful of times now. I think they have some of the greatest fries in the village (which go great with the spicy mayo vs ketchup.) I had the fish n chips last time I went in and it was very tasty. Crunchy on the outside and soft fish on the inside. So good. However there was lots of batter on that fish , maybe too much for me. It is fried after all. They have great live music sometimes and it's always a fun place to go to."}
{"text":"I am torn between giving this a two or a three star review. 

I liked the ambience. Brazen head is a modern take on a traditional pub. Hardwood floors instead of busy patterned carpets, thick maroon drapes, bathrooms that had Irish words for Men and Women -- cute. The music was just loud enough to hear, the TVs were on mute. The female servers wear kilts. 

The service wasn't the greatest. We were seated right away and then had to wait about ten minutes for somebody to take our drink order. Thing is, servers walked by us and paid us no heed during those ten minutes.

We had: 
Chicken ceasar salad - Generous portion of chicken, real bacon, creamy salad with a perfect amount of parmesan.

Kale salad - Good if you are in to kale (which I am!) This salad comes with 4 chicken skewers and a tsatziki sauce like dressing. I got the dressing on the side to use as a dipping sauce, and requested a balsamic vinaigrette for the salad. This blend of flavour made more sense to me. 

Ahi tuna burger - This is where they lost me. This burger was so fishy I couldn't even swallow it. Seriously, I went to the bathroom and spit it out. I strongly advise against it. 

I may return to Brazen head if I am in the area. The salads were good, but the service and fish burger left a bad taste in my mouth. Literally."}
{"text":"I actually worked here as a bouncer many years ago when it first opened but please don't take that as a bias because I haven't worked there in years and haven't had a connection to the place for a LONG time!

From what I remember, as pubs go, the food here was GREAT! Every time I find myself at a pub, I'll always think back to the Brazen Head as my gold standard for Pub food. Unless things have changed drastically, you'll eat very well here!

You should note that I don't drink at all but I assume every pub serves the same drinks so what's to judge in that department?

Lastly, I have no idea what the service is like now but when I used to work there, the staff were the funniest and happiest crowd I had EVER worked with. That kind of work culture tends to stick to a place so I'm hoping it's the same these days.

I'll close off by sharing a great laugh I had one evening.

One of the servers came in with a cast on her hand one day and I asked her what happened? With a perfectly dead-pan face she explained: \"Oh this? Just a freak hand-job accident.\"

Oh, so funny! :D

Enjoy your visit to the Brazen Head!"}
{"text":"Try to get a seat by the fire. Great spot to catch up with a pal. I can't stay away from the pulled pork tacos Mmmmm The staff are consistently friendly and can make decent recommendations. Prices are reasonable and the food is better than what you'd expect."}
{"text":"I love coming here. The atmosphere is very relaxed and fun and I've always found the staff courteous and friendly, which can be rare in liberty village. My only gripe is that they can be a bit pricy and that they don't take debit. I mean what year is it? You don't take debit?  Also, my bottled water has always been fine from here."}
{"text":"Very large, typical Irish pub environment but they have a decent selection of beers on tap. They have two big patios (ground and roof) for all of you patio lovers. 

Food is really good and affordable. I had the Ahi Tuna burger and it was delicious. Only $15! 

Service is mediocre, but I don't come to a pub for amazing service. I just can't expect that. 

Definitely a great place for an after-work beer if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Hostess did not ask if the table she sat us at was okay or let us know who our server was. She also didn't let our server know we had been sat. 
Server was nice. 
Food came out in a reasonable time. 
I ordered Huevos thing - super greasy and hard to eat due to how it was arranged. 
My dining partner ordered the ribs - they were boiled which neither of us like. Sauce was just okay. Fries were good. Gravy was super watery. 
Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I was craving ribs and decided to try them here, but I was disappointed. The ribs were cooked great and falling off the bone. However, I found the sauce too sweet, and it overpowered the taste of the ribs. I wouldn't order the ribs again.

My boyfriend ordered the paella, which was again ok. If you are looking for something in the area and close by this is good for a drink. I've heard their wings are good, so I might try that next time I come. But I won't be back in a hurry."}
{"text":"Came here for late night drinks and appetizers.  This is a large restaurant/bar with indoor and outdoor seating.  Their sweet potato fries are DELICIOUS.  Large selection of beers and wines."}
{"text":"Keep giving the place a chance. Used to enjoy going there for work lunches. Bad/slow service keeps happening. Last Sunday was the worst experience. Post-Marlies crowd during a Leaf game. Not only did we not get served food for 1.5 + hours, no tables around us had any food. We left. Who knows if the food was every ready, but couldn't waste our entire night."}
{"text":"Came to the pub on a sunday afternoon right after visiting the furniture stores in liberty village. Standard pub menus here, although the menu is outdated since two of the IPAs I wanted were already off the menu. The the red sangria is pretty good?however you don't get any fruit pieces unless you order the jug. There are some parking in front of the pub but the issue is it's 7 dollars on the weekend, and 2 dollars for half an hour otherwise, which means you are spending big bucks just to get to the place."}
{"text":"It's what you expect from a pub. You can count on it and be happy.
Not my first choice to eat here, but it is reliable."}
{"text":"A lot of us at the office likes to go here, but I think it's only because it's near enough and we're just lazy to go elsewhere beyond our parameter. We always complain about how expensive the drinks are, yet here we are again, drinking and drinking and drinking...

I don't mind the food here; I ate here a couple of times and they were alright. Not bad, but I'm not crazy about it. 

But the service is nice, no matter the size of the group...big, small...heh. Giggle. Snort."}
{"text":"Je ne recommande franchement pas, les serveuses ont la tronches jusque la parterre, tu n'as fini ton verre qu'elles viennent te demander si tu en veux encore...  Et cerise sur le gâteau, le supplément de guacamole pour les nachos tiens à peine dans une cuillère à soupe..."}
{"text":"Service tonight was actually great which is more than I can say for most nights. Whoever does the menu writing needs to get a brush up on effective marketing. Maybe mention there's meat in the cottage pie or find a better description for a burger than \"upchuck\" (NOT lol - that's actually gross). Whatever happened to \"Thank Guinness it's Friday\" with a pint for $5. I feel sorry for the staff there. They could make more money on food if management did a better job scheduling shifts, anticipating peak times and creating an appealing menu."}
{"text":"I've been to Brazen Head a few times this year during the World Cup. Every time this place was crowded and I've had to stand a couple of time. And every time, the service has been incredible and the food has been consistent. 

These guys know how to run a high volume restaurant! 

I've had a few of their menu items, and I would order each of them again. The sweet potato fries are delicious and just what you need during a game! And to top it all off, great beer selection and awesome servers."}
{"text":"I love this pub but frankly, I'm tired of such terrible service. It seems as they're unable to manage large groups or sporting events which seems illogical. 

I waited 20 minutes for the Caesar I ordered and an additional 10 minutes for the side of horseradish I requested. My Brazen Benedict's were quite tasty but unfortunately arrived quite cool. 

To top it off I've been waiting 15 minutes for the bill now... The waitress has since handed bills out to other parts of our table but mine seems to be nowhere. So word to the wise: if there's a sporting event or you're looking to come with a big group he prepared to wait and wait and wait..."}
{"text":"I like this place ... I gave it three stars because pubs shouldn't get more than that in my opinion.
I live next door so this place is a great no brainer watering hole.
Food is ok and if you go on the right day of the week there are great specials like half price appetizers on Tuesday's etc.
Beer selection could be more extensive in the craft department.
Brunch was ok. 
Patios are great in the summer.
I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The place is very nice and very big. The patio is awesome. I was there on a Saturday night and the patio was busy, but not packed. The problem is that I found it bo be expensive.

A pint of Stella for $8.50 and regular nachos at $16 doesn't work for me (without any add-ons). Spinach and artichoke dip for $13 is also not very welcoming. The food was good, not great.

I had no problem with the service, my waitress was very nice and kept checking back to ask if we wanted more beers.

I don't regret going there... it was good getting to know a new pub. I just think it's too expensive to keep going back regularly."}
{"text":"The food is ok, overpriced pub grub with mediocre portion sizes for $17. When I walked in, I turned to the host and was given a blank empty stare. I had to stop and bluntly say: could I get a table or... No hello, greeting, or question \"bar or patio?\" I thought it was very snobby and made me feel strange. It seems basic etiquette training has gone awry and I probably won't go back unless to grab a beer."}
{"text":"A great example of what a pub should be. 

The service is always friendly. The place is always busy and lively without being so packed. There is usually a 5-10 minute wait at lunch, but nothing extreme. 

The food is great. Some of the best pub food I've had. Their sandwiches are excellent and served on fresh bread. The fries are fresh and not frozen. I've been pleased with everything I've ordered. 

Perfect Liberty Village lunch."}
{"text":"I have defiantly had better service. I came with a friend and ordered the fish and chips. The fish was burnt, and full of grease. Naturally, I asked for another piece. When the arrived it was massive! I was excited to chow down!! To my surprise the inside was soggy and the batter wasn't cooked...Ugh, so I scarfed down my fries leaving a nasty feeling of grease inside my stomach.

When the waiter approached me and ask how it was I said I don't like it. He asked why. I said it's disgusting. He then gave me the dirtiest look and grabbed the plate almost hitting my nose.
What also ticked me off is that he charged me for the meal! I had to insist that I would not be paying for the fish causing him to roll his eyes and getting a manager. 

Perhaps I shouldn't of said it was disgusting but I was super annoyed. I didn't eat all day and just wanted to have a decent meal, especially because I upgraded to the halibut which cost $20.

I was planning on giving him a tip. He wasn't the one who cooked the meal but he ended up being quite aggressive and down right rude.

The servers name is Pat and he needs a seriously attitude adjustment."}
{"text":"Been to the Brazen Head a couple of times, after TFC matches, to grab a pint and complain with other fans, about how poorly TFC is doing. Win or lose, a pint always helps out. 

Today however, I dropped in for brunch, after playing a soccer game at nearby Lamport field. Having skipped breakfast in order to make it to the game on time, I was starvin' marvin' and was excited to try out their Brazen Benedict, which had salmon and potato cakes instead of the regular peameal bacon and english muffin. The server was quick to take our order and the kitchen was just as quick at sending it out. This was impressive, since the place was packed. After getting my order, there really isn't much to say, it was \"meh\" to say the least. The hollandaise sauce was a miss and that just sort of through everything off, including the salmon. The meal also came with a bowl of salad, but it left much to be desired and I was still hungry by the end of it. Luckily the Shoppers by my house was having a sale on Ben & Jerry's ice cream, $2.99!! Reg. $6.99. So, I picked some up to help fill the void until dinner.

If this rating was only based on the food, it would have been two stars, but since its an overall rating, it gets three. Since it would have received four stars for being a great place to grab a pint after the matches, and also having that warm pub like feeling, service and atmosphere to go along with it.

So in conclusion, great for pints; Not so great for brunch."}
{"text":"Good beer selection and typical greasy pub fare.  Lotsa wood and kilted servers are the only things that really make this an \"irish pub\".

Pricey and mediocre quality food, I tend to only go here when someone else is picking up the bill.

Note: I've had the steak frites here that was such a poor cut of meat I sent it back... TWICE IN THE SAME SITTING!"}
{"text":"A place to have fun, chat and wait before the TFC game start.. tons of variety of drinks and as every pub is a good place to hang out.. 

Food average 7/10
Environment 9/10"}
{"text":"This Irish pub is located in an expansive wasteland in the King West area, next to a giant Dominion grocery store and a blockbuster - not exactly the trendiest locale for an up and coming eatery. However, the Brazen Head seems much more popular as a watering hole than a fine dining establishment. 

The place is HUGE - two separate patios upstairs (and an elevator to take you there). They also have a downstairs patio and tons of seating on several floors inside.  

It's a great place to drink - many different areas to enjoy the somewhat bleak view from. And like other Irish pubs in the city, this one also requires the waitresses to wear ridiculously short kilts, so that, I'm assuming, they can serve your food more efficiently. 

But if it's delicious food you're coming to enjoy - you might want to head back to King West. I've eaten here a couple times and I've never been overly impressed. I had mussels on \"all you can eat mussel night' and we waited about an hour for our food. When they came, they didn't bring any bread. When we ordered our second round, it took pretty much just as long to get them. I've also had a lamb burger here and their sweet potato fries and none of them have been overly tasty. 

It might be because they've only recently opened, but the service and the food at this place definitely sub par. But as a drinking spot, The Brazen Head is pretty great."}
{"text":"Been going regularly to this pub since I've moved to the Liberty area early this year.

As everyone else has noted, there's 2 great patios (upstairs and street level) as well it's massive inside.  I've always had a good experience with the food including a bizarre peanut butter-bacon-banana flatbread most recently that was surprisingly tasty!

Never had a problem with the service, all though I wouldn't call it speedy.

Word to the wise - avoid late night weekends when there's always a line up (who waits in line for a pub?!)."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday, which is half price wings night. Ordered 3 lbs, and wings themselves were delicious and very large! We were required to get a drink with each order, but even an order of water sufficed to get the deal.

Other than that, the atmosphere was charming, even for a Monday night."}
{"text":"Love this place!

Too bad its out of my neighbourhood. They pour really good non-hangover draft (HARP is especially tasty at Brazen) and the food is very, very good for this style of restaurant.

Really cool old building as well with many levels and patios. The clientele is more 25-plus, which limits the riff-raff, whilst still encouraging tomfoolery. The Bison burgers are amazing! 

Also- great for large groups or Holiday gatherings. Free parking in the back (if you can get a space..)

Highly Recommend if you live near Liberty Village. Fun, cool atmosphere. They serve an incredible brunch on Sat./Sun. as well- Irish Fry is decadently delicious!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy sitting at a table with no one serving you, but want a different scenery than your couch, brazen head is the place to be. Wish I could give this place negative stars for the lack of eye contact or service from our server or any server or worker there. Wasn't even busy. No excuse for any of that crummy service. Don't waste you time or money here."}
{"text":"I think the neighbourhood of Liberty Village is great. I was given a tour of these neo-modern/ post-industrial area located just on the outskirts of the more populer King West area. The reminants of factories have been turned into luxurious lofts and condos. Then, out on the corner, is this two storey pub. 
It reminds me a lot of some of the pubs in Chicago, and the laid-back attitude is similar. The bartenders were friendly and accepting to make me \"custom\" called shots, the people varied in ages, but were slightly a 30+ crowd. I only went into winter, but I can imagine how much fun it is there during the summer with the HUGE outdoor patios. 
I definitely recommend it for a casual date or to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"we began our bar/pub/lounge hopping night in Toronto's Liberty Village, neatly tucked away in a cute social environment, my compadre and I decided to try Brazen Head irish pub for starters. 
Great place to sit back, and have a beer whilst listening to a live band on a saturday night.
I had a glass Chiani while my buddy had a pint of Leffe.
For food we ordered their nachos which I give a 4/5 for taste, quantity and bang for buck.
Secondly  we decided to try was their Turkey burger sliders served with coleslaw.  Though this had flavor, the meat was quite tough to chew.  As a result this was worth a 3/5.
Overall experience 4/5 The ambience, and decor has a cozy and welcoming aura, and the endless amounts of people coming in, makes this place a popular hang out for many locals."}
{"text":"I actually really like the Brazen and am surprised by the bad reviews. They are always sweet to me and my daughter, a few of the staff have even come over and coloured with my daughter or talked to her and she loved that and felt important. Service is always friendly and fast, and the food is good (regular pub food). Great outside seating area. I come here for or dinner quite often with my girl because it's right behind my building!"}
{"text":"Went with work colleagues, restaurant was almost empty and lunch still took almost 2 hours-total. New menu was overpriced and quality of food across all our meals was below average. This area has comparable prices but their food is way better quality - kale salad, fish tacos, burgers. Lunch special was $15 for macaroni. It's unfortunate I have to write a negative review, you could do better Braizen-raisin!"}
{"text":"I went for brunch with my girlfriends. The server was very friendly and nice but our food was taking forever - she explained that the kitchen was slammed. We asked her to please check on it and turns out the kitchen had lost the order. She took our orders again and we weren't served our food until 1h40m into our arrival. I got the nachos with a Diet Coke which cost about $25 with tip. The nachos were some of the worst I've ever had and I would never order them again. I'm supposed to go next week for a family brunch for 10 people and I think I'm gonna suggest we go elsewhere. I don't want to pay that much and wait hours for my food and then it's not even worth the wait."}
{"text":"I decided to check out this pub in Liberty Village for a lunch snack. I can you tell you right away this is a sort of meeting place for TFC games! The patio was 90% filled with fans having lunch and whetting their appetite before the game.

I ordered the jerk chicken flatbread and lager (forgot already which one, sorry!). The food was satisfying. It was the right amount and good seasoning. I have a small stomach so something light is mighty satisfying for me.

Great and friendly service."}
{"text":"It's an Irish pub, they have beer and pub food. 

When you go to places like these you don't expect much other than that but Brazen Head showed me more. They showed me a nice decor with lots of dark wood, plently of natural light, high vaulted ceilings, wall height book shelves, friendly service, plenty of flat screen T.V.'s in the bar, and multiple patios. YES multiple patios! I have yet to go here in the summer but I definitely will just for the patios in a nice quiet neighborhood.

The beer on tap isn't the longest list but it also isn't the shortest, it does the job. The pub food is not bad it is your basic fair with the exception of the Bucket O' Bangers, battered slices of sausage deep friend to a crunch and served with some type of mayo dip. Sounds disgusting, I know, but you gotta try these at least once because they are very good. Be sure to order them when in a group of friends because 2-3 slices are quite enough as it is fairly heavy. Brunch here is pretty reasonable and they have your standard brunch lineup ready. Food quality is good for a pub. 

The staff, albeit friendly, is quite scarce and can take a while before you palce an order or receive your order. The location of the Brazen Head is odd as there isn't much surrounding it other than a Metro and Blockbuster, it isn't really accessible to those wanting to take a stroll and pop in. You definitely have to trek to the Brazen Head. The lack of surrounding neighborhood may also be quite a drawback as when you are done here, there is nowhere for you to go besides the furniture store located behind.

Overall it is a good pub in a fairly quiet location. Prices for brunch are very reasonable, as well is the prices for the main menu. Seems out of place in this locale but for a nice pub experience and good food at decent prices it's a place to check out. Just be sure you plan on staying because you have no other option."}
{"text":"Pros:
Fair pricing
Easy menu
Good selection of beer
Great patio
Nachos
Calimari

Cons:
Noise level

Summary:
Friendly staff, good cx service and great for any kind of occasion."}
{"text":"Poor service and incompetent staff. The staff couldn't / wouldn't answer our questions properly."}
{"text":"This place is close to my condo so we keep coming back out of convince. The truth is it is average and nothing special. I have yet to find anything that I would order again, but we seem to continue to come back and I keep trying. I find this is the case with nearly all Liberty Village restaurants, people come back simply because it is convenient. They do have decent specials so you don't mind paying for OK food when the prices aren't too bad. It is what it is."}
{"text":"Love the chicken wings here! 50 cent wings on Mondays!"}
{"text":"So the good thing about gentrification is that you get all kinds of facilities close that are easy, familiar, and comfortable (e.g., liquor stores, grocery stores, Blockbusters).  The bad side of that is that EVERYTHING that comes in is easy, familiar, and comfortable.

Enter into the neighbourhood the Brazen Head with a franchised British menu, the usual suspects for taps, and a brunch menu that couldn't have written itself more than if you had walked in on it writing the words \"Eggs Benedict\" on its belly.

It's another friendly-staffed tartan-skirt franchise, with multi-levels that despite the fact that there are three patios available, it can't seem to manage space.  Three of us showed up for dinner on a week night and could not \"find a spot\".  Yes every table was filled on the main level, but the main dining area has so much unused space, your entrees could have been brought in by the RiverDance touring company.  Waste of space appears to be a theme."}
{"text":"Have been a few times. mostly because of proximity to Enercare Centre or because friends chose it. While it's never been bad, it's never been great either.

First visit here I had the Fish and Chips. It was pretty decent. Fish was nicely battered, and the fries are good.

Next visit I ordered the Double Burger. Comes with lots of cheese, bacon, some tasty mayo and a fried egg on top. A good looking burger and arrived straight out of the kitchen, and tasted as good as it looked. Nice fresh kaiser for the bun. Fries were some of the better than most I've had in the city, but it loses points for the patties being frozen and not handmade. For a joint in Liberty Village where snobbery reigns supreme, they could do a fresh patty.

Service has been good both times, but not great. Last visit the waitress disappeared for longer than necessary a few times, but was friendly and for the most part attentive.

It's one of only two pub options around the area, so the choices are slim pickings, but I'd say you won't hate it if you go. Like I said, not bad, not great. Just watch out for the d-bags. They are everywhere.

Worth a trip. One."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and not once have been overly impressed.  Most recently, my husband and I dropped in for lunch on the patio on a hot July weekend afternoon.  Before ordering, I asked the server if the \"Veghead\" black bean burger was any good.  (I am not vegetarian, by any means, but I often enjoy black bean rather than meat-based burgers when I'm out.)  I ordered the burger upon the server's recommendation - she told me that it was definitely better than your average veggie burger - and ended up being quite disappointed.  The burger was clearly pre-made, and the patty was physically tough to eat.  I had to add an extreme amount of ketchup for flavour.  When the manager came by to ask how everything was (she was going from table to table), she seemed somewhat taken aback when I told her - nicely - the truth.  And I didn't even take that opportunity to let her know that the fries had come out of the kitchen cold.  I hate it when businesses ask for feedback with no intention of doing anything if/when it comes back less than optimal.

The Brazen Head has a great feel, with a good patio.  But it's definitely overpriced and generally \"meh\".

(For the record, the black bean veggie burger at The Craft Brasserie and Grill down the street is AMAZING!)"}
{"text":"amazing patio. great service i had the most amazing angus burger i ever had and a delicious toasted bun it was perfect!!! definetely going back when i will be in the area again!!!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. First they remove the Irish Stew which was the best item on the menu (this is an Irish pub!!) and now they removed the Taco Thursdays when you could get a taco for $3!! What gives ??? 
I had their \"new\" triple decker sandwich and was mightily unimpressed. The bread was the regular sandwich variety you buy at Metro and the cold cuts were of the cheapest kind. Three pieces of bread, some cheap coldcuts and  even cheaper  cheddar and - voila $16. Not again, no thanks."}
{"text":"Terrible! Undercooked fries,over acidic dressing, old fries and a waitress with an attitude. The only family in the pub and it took 40 minutes to get the food! We ate because we were so hungry, but really a feeling of disappointment. It hurts to pay the bill. I guess they expect you to get drunk so you won't notice the awful food and a server who gave me a lecture because I change my choice of beer."}
{"text":"Cool upscale pub- interesting decor in an industrial space, lots of windows and a patio for nice weather days.  Drink specials, large portions and large menu at this Irish-y pub locale."}
{"text":"This was a great place. The server was very intiuitive and proactive, me likey!

I am not sure if the concept of \"happy hour\" exists in Canada, but their \"Happy Hour\" is from 4pm-8pm for half priced appetizers. Drinks are all regularly priced. 

Wine is sold by 6oz and 9oz glasses and by the bottle. Our server assumed we wanted 9oz which was $2-$4 more expensive. Make sure to tell them what you want.

Nice patio for those who like to dine al fresco."}
{"text":"Good food indeed. Tried so many things here and all was great. Sliders are awesome so are the fish and chips. Cold beer is always a plus! It can get a bit noisy but then again, this IS a pub in its truest form. 

The service was prompt and courteous. The place was clean and easy to navigate. Loved the old tavern feeling of the place.

Good place to visit if you want a pint and some fried pub foods. 

Tried a new micro which is always a bonus!  Black Bellows was a great wheat beer locally brewed in Collingwood ON. Bar tender recommended and I would drink it again. 

I will repeat for sure next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"I actively avoid going here. Every time I decide to give it another try- because they have a DYNAMITE patio- I am disappointed again.

I feel like they are always out of the beer they \"carry\" on tap- having excuses like \"Well, we are out of these 4 beers on tap because our delievery is in 2 days\"....You're a pub! Sort that out! Order appropriately! My server shouldn't start out by saying \"Okay, let me tell you all the things we don't have first....\". If it was a one time thing, I'd get over it but there's always something! Poor service is also a standard here.

Big no-no; They advertize a vegan burger on their menu and when I ordered it a few months ago, it was served to me on a bun that had been egg-washed making it NOT vegan. 

I'm not giving it any more chances- Williams Landing across the street also has a great patio, great service and good food. And, they've always had what I've wanted to drink in stock...Imagine that!"}
{"text":"I have in the past visited Brazen Head for corporate events and I decided to visit tonight due to the nice weather and desire to have a pint of beer on a patio. Upon receiving my bill, I noticed that my full credit card information, first name, last name, and expiry date was printed electronically on your receipt. Ironically, the customer copy only had the last 4 digits of my credit card and my name.

This obviously drew a red flag for me, so I decided to ask my server Rebecca why my personal information was printed on the Merchant Copy of the receipt. At this point, she became very condescending and sarcastic with concerns that I felt were legitimate; not only as a customer, but also credit card holder with a $25,000 limit. I was not being rude or angry towards her, I simply presented my concerns in a logical manner and had this discussion with her at an appropriate time (when she wasn't serving customers). At this point, she became defensive and annoyed and said she didn't have any time to deal with this situation. She said that if I wanted to, I could speak to the manager.

I requested to speak with the manager and she rolled her eyes and was surprised I would actually be brave enough to ask for her manager, as if I had somehow won a game of truth or dare. The manager on duty arrived and she was very professional, calm, logical, and rational. I can definitely see why she was running this establishment. The rationale she provided was that that, there are instances where the credit card transaction may not go through your POS system and that the waiters/waitresses may need to at a later time manually charge the credit card in the event this happens. This is why the full credit card information is printed on the receipt, as a reference if this were to happen. While I understand the merchant has the right to post credit card transactions a day later, this does not grant Brazen Head the right to charge my credit card at some foreseeable future in the event the transaction does not go through the instance I give you my credit card. In fact, if this is how your POS system operates I would definitely evaluate at better options. Again, this is simply based on the logic that I was provided.

I think a reasonable person would deduce this presents a very large security flaw, especially since this methodology relies on the honesty of all individuals who works at Brazen Head. As you are well aware, credit card fraud are in the billions of dollars per annum across merchants in North America. As a customer, I am not uncomfortable with having this information left in the hands of the merchant. In fact, I would say all your customers who use a credit card at Brazen Head is very susceptible to credit card fraud, more than the protection it offers your establishment. The logic behind what the manager on duty conveyed to me while rational, appears to be a flaw/glitch in the point of system that you have purchased. In she explained it correctly and I understand it correctly as well, there should be absolutely no reason why a credit card transaction does not get processed at the time the card was swiped.

I urge that Brazen Head re-evaluates the practices and settings in their point of sale software so that the customer is not exposed their entire credit card information.

I have sent emails and left voice messages to their management team with no response. I will be taking my business to William's Landing instead."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and the experience is always mediocre to meh...The staff all seem to be a hot mess, where no one knows what they are doing, and all seem quite dazed and confused. On one occasion, we were sitting on the patio, being blasted by the sun for 2 hours - where we had asked to be moved to a number of other tables on the patio - and they waiter kept saying he had to ask, and then either forgetting or just not doing anything about it. We finally opened a large umbrella on the patio, to which he replied, \"oh, i probably should have thought of this sooner...\" -_- I have no words...

The soup and sandwich deal for lunch resulted in tepid soup, and a soggy sandwich, and the cottage pie was all gravy with very little of anything else (don't get me wrong, I LOVE gravy, but i don't want my entire dish to be and taste salty brown). 

I've been told that pints at this place a good for UFC games, and that the upstairs patio (when it's open) is nice. But all in all, Liberty Village has so much more to offer, I wouldn't bother with this place."}
{"text":"I went to the Brazen Head on a field trip in one of my classes in Waterloo. It's a really hipster-y place that fits very well with the Liberty Village scene.

My group rented out the whole top floor for lunch (we had a group of about 80). We were served veggies (carrots/celery) and wings, along with Irish beer. Overall nothing too special, though the wings were quite decent. 

Since the prof ended up paying for everything I didn't expect much from it, and it did satisfy my hunger at least."}
{"text":"Horrible service! The guy didn't bring napkins and the food was on the table for over twenty mins. The burger was horrible and the hummus dip looked nicer but most likely it was bought from metro and brought over. However loved the patio on the sunny day with the red merlot. Foodwise horrible"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in liberty village because of its wide selection of beer and food. Their patio is great for summer days and their live music is great too! Give it a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I just recently visited this place with my boyfriend after hearing for sometime about it, we were planning on going to Williams Landing across the way however it was so packed we didn't want to wait for a table so we meandered across the street. 

We were very promptly greeted by a friendly server adorned in what seemed like more traditional Irish attire and sat at a cozy table in the large room on the main floor. I wasn't able to make a tour this time but the space looked clean and spacious with antique furnishings and aesthetics. They have several patios on various levels but by the time we had arrived it was dusk and a little chilly so we opted out of the patio this time around. 
Our server was knowledgeable and pleasant, she made great recommendations, even the food runners were incredibly courteous and helpful making our dining experience all the better.

They had an abundance of Irish beer on tap; I was able to try a beer that I ended up liking very much, Kilkenny Cream Ale; a darker but smooth and creamy beer I would never have thought I would have liked.
They didn't have a large menu but an intriguing one making it initially hard to decide what to go with but we ended up ordering the Jerk Chicken & Mango flatbread as an appetizer which was fantastic! Usually I am not a big fan of flat bread but it was a unique fusion of flavors that worked really well, sweet and savory. The added touch of greens drizzled with dressing finished the dish perfectly, Ideal for sharing or a light appetizer before your meal.

For Entrees I ordered the Guinness Burger with Caesar and my boyfriend the Grilled Reuben with Spinach Salad and both were beyond incredible. I tend to be very picky with my burgers and this burger was I have to say one of the BEST burgers I have gotten while eating out in a long time.... perfectly cooked, juicy and flavorful without tasting to greasy or gamey. And the Caesar, although simple was spot on and with the perfect amount of dressing and real bacon. I was so busy with my burger that I didn't accept the offer to try his Grilled Reuben which looked ridiculously good with marble bread and piles of house made corn beef... drooling..... but I did try the spinach salad with strawberries and candied pecans, it was light and sweet, something I would definitely order again.

I am honestly surprised we had any room left for anything after this but we ended up inquiring about dessert, they apparently have the best home made apple pie with ice cream but it takes 20min  so we decided to go for the peanut butter and chocolate cheesecake I believe it was... anyway it was obviously tasty but what cheesecake isn't?! This however was a generous portion I will admit but next time I will remember to order the apple pie in advance"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner just before a Toronto FC Game. The place was very busy...lots of fans before the game. They had a draft beer for sale. Small pint for $5.00. Not bad considering it was a busy day. For an appie we had the calamari...it was good but a little greasy. For my main it was the Fried Chicken Sandwich. This is where they excelled for me. The sandwich & side salad were very tasty. The fried chicken was delicious. Great size as well. It was a filling meal. Why I have a 3-star....service was very slow likely because of the crowd. I look at it this way...if you have the seating you SHOULD have the service."}
{"text":"I went with eleven of my friends to Brazen Head for a lunch time brunch/drink at around one o'clock on a Saturday afternoon. When arriving at the place, the seating area was packed, and thus we had to wait a good ten minutes before a table was ready for us. When seating was arranged, we were split into two groups, considering they could not accommodate a seating of eleven. 

The food was quite tasty at the pub. I had the chicken sandwich, while my friends opted for food off of their till 3pm breakfast menu. No one had any complaints about the food, but I felt the service at the restaurant was a disaster.

The waiter took forever delivering everything. Our drinks came after a ten minute wait, and our dinner did not come till a good half hour had passed. I feel that if the service was better, or if more staff were working, I'd give a higher rating."}
{"text":"Solid pub. Killed it with half priced apps on Tuesdays, so with beers and seven apps for four of us, we still only hit $100. They have the only acceptable-tasting non-alcoholic beer I've had in this city, and decent selection otherwise. Decent space to catch the game, too."}
{"text":"It's a very low key, local spot. It has an Irish pub feel and had a live musician. It's a shame it was dead on a Saturday night. The beer on tap and bottled beer were  both decent."}
{"text":"Good local pub- service is ok, food is alright.  Nothing spectacular about this joint but it's super convenient and relaxed.  Summer is good for the rooftop patio and the view.  Good selection of beers on tap"}
{"text":"I'm not a HUGE fan of this place....it's good in a pinch, or if the boss is buying.  I find this place over priced for what you get.  I had a burger that was $17 alone!  That's insane and it wasn't that spectacular.  They don't offer to many beers and seem to be out of things wen I want them.

The layout is a bit cramped and the washrooms are upstairs.  Their patio is nice, and they have a second rooftop one - but I've never seen anyone on it.

I will say that the Fish and Chips on Friday (Deal of the Day) and the Jambalaya are great!"}
{"text":"I've been to Brazen Head three times now. Two times were okay, hence two stars. The third (and my last) time were horrible. The main floor patio was pretty empty and three of us quickly were given a seat. Since it was a nice day, we asked if we could switch to a seat in the sun. The waitress was VERY cold: no smile, unhappy when we switched seats although it was only one over, was eager to take our drink order as soon as we just sat down and didn't glance at the menu. Her energy was so awful we decided to immediately leave and plan to never return (and we live in Liberty Village!). We went down the street to Local instead where the service was 100x better! (Better to spend your time and money there or William's Landing across the street!)"}
{"text":"Gord and I had brunch this morning at the Brazen Head Pub.  It's been a while since we've been there.

Before the Toronto Wolfpack games, people apparently meet there.  Gord and I have been to most of their home games, which are played nearby at Lamport Stadium.  The Wolfpack are now in the Super 8s (playoffs) and were playing an \"away\" game today in the UK against the Workingtown Town.  We thought it would be fun to don our Wolfpack gear, go for brunch and watch the game at the Brazen Head with other fans.

Gord and I both ordered \"The Weekend\".  Gord got his with bacon and I got mine with peameal bacon.  It was a good breakfast.  The tator tots were a fun surprise.

Rather than watch an \"away\" game at home as we usually do, it was fun to watch it with other fans (plus have someone else make breakfast).  There was cheering and clapping when the Wolfpack scored and/or made great plays.

The Wolfpack had their first loss of the season last week so it was good to see them win today (68 - 0)."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Patios in Toronto, also in one of the most gorgeous neighborhoods in Toronto.

I went here for the first time with an office party last summer. I got a taste of a lot of their food and a TON of their alcohol as well. Serve staff were great as we reserved one of their patios and we partied on through most of the night as the sun went down.

They make one hell of a G+T and their beer was cool and crisp. The view is fantastic off the patio and I felt that summer had finally come as the night progressed. It's a bit out of the way but worth it.

Never going to turn down a trip there....EVER"}
{"text":"I don't really write many reviews but I really wanted to take a few minutes to compliment brazen head for the perfect service, and good food (food was perfect as well) calme here for food and some drinks with my wife, mother and my young baby, we were so well received, I was actually very impressed, the entire staff smiles, and the drinks and food came nice and quick. It seemed like it was going down for some time, but everything was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Not sure if my review will even be noticed but here goes...

First time here, waitress placed us into what could be described as a nice quaint \"booth\" like corner on the patio that gave us some privacy, away from the other tables. Sure the waitress didn't have two menus, but this place was so busy and clearly adorned by others, who'd care. We didn't. This place rocks. Clean, professional staff, old fashioned feel in an upbeat newer area, great food, quick service, and good sight lines.

Don't expect to find parking easily in the area. Not their fault they seem so good."}
{"text":"Food was very good .We sat at the front restaurant seating. Crab cakes excellent. Fish and chips were right on target.
Food took a long time due to a Lge number of people at the same time.
Bar area smells bad. Needs a good cleanup. 
Staff are friendly ."}
{"text":"Best pub in liberty village! Great for breakfast, lunch,  dinner or late night pints. atmosphere is relaxed, and servers are always friendly and the food is great."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's the neighborhood bar. It might not fall within the highest echelon of pubs, but its certainly above par. Even on busy Friday, you can usually snag a seat. 

$5.00 Guinness nights, always has the game showing, and tons of patio space, you really can't go wrong. Food is pretty decent, especially nachos and wings. Whether you're a local, pre-drinking before a TFC game, or just passing by, it's not a bad place to grab a pint and a bite."}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times as we live in the area..
We've loved the food in the past- even the service..no matter how busy, everything's always been consistent. After tonight I wonder if they even give a damn in there anymore!? 
My husband and I ordered a burger and a salad and right off we noticed the portion sizes have been reduced noticeably..I'm sorry but that mini takeaway box you put a side order of fries in isn't going to disguise the fact you're clearly cost cutting. Portion size would have been no big deal if the food quality was there. My salad had soggy, rotten lettuce, and my fish was painfully dry. I paid $16.50 for a salad that I barely touched. 
The server was by no means interested in rectifying the issue either- when I told him, all he said was \"do you want me to get the manager?\" 
You'd think since \"the local\" is next door and very clearly taking business from them they would try to compete instead of doing the exact opposite!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'd rather wait in line at the local for 60 minutes next time, or chow down at Bar Vespa (they have CHEAP AMAZING PIZZA!!!) then ever get fleeced at brazen head again. 
Brazen head, what we had was good, but we're over."}
{"text":"Popped into the Brazen Head pub after a Doors Open tour yesterday.  Cool space however such poor waiting staff.  Tons of people on the floor, all walking at a slow pace while eager patrons waited for them to get it right.  Confusion as to which server was covering which table.  Generally slow overall  (and not busy).  I ordered the veg burger which was good.  My friends had the fish and chips and the house burger... both said good.  It was my first visit and I of of course expected more. 

My friends said it's typical."}
{"text":"Literally been sitting here for 2 + hours waiting for food and the restaurant isn't even busy. We made reservations as well so they should've been ready. Food finally came and the Salad dressing was watery and food was only mediocre. Would NOT recommend. Awful. Go somewhere else unless you're desperate."}
{"text":"The nachos were excellent. i think the day staff are much friendly"}
{"text":"Brazen is an esthetically nice place but  not really an Irish Pub i my opinion!

Went for a few drinks with friends yesterday late afternoon  and even though they (my friends) were already in with a table and available chairs for me I have to wait 45 mins to get it because they had hit capacity.  

So lets talk a little about capacity while we are on the topic... this place has multiple patios and seating areas so as a result they make their customers pick a lineup and as Murphy's law would have it the one I picked didn't move. The Toronto FC had let out just before my arrival as as you can imagine the lineup was full of loud obnoxious drunk FC fans arguing with the bouncer and holding up the line! (thanks douchebags!)

Once in, the place was packed on the inside but pretty empty on the patio (go figures). We ordered the Calamari and the Mini Bison burgers both were very good. Our waitress was slow, didn't listen when you spoke to her and took 20 minutes to get us the bill!

All in all...good food bad service. Save yourself some greif and skip it if there is an FC game... unless of course you are part of the FC mob :-)"}
{"text":"I love Brazen Head. Its the *cool* pub in Liberty Village n King West area. 
It has 3 floors and HUGE awesome well decorated patio. 

The service is VERY SLOW! It has happened when I ordered yam fries, it took 45 min finally came at middle night that me n my friend were falling asleep lol. And usually would take you at least 15-20 min to get bill. 

They have 50 Cents Wings on Monday night! Their wings are actually VERY GOOD. 

NEVER BUY their Chicken Pot Pie.WORST chicken pie ever! It was a DRY pie with no taste! Should have sent it back. 

 NEVER BUY their omelet on breakfast menu!  The egg was so over done, it was hard to chew. I was expecting something slightly thin omelet with stuff in it, it came a HUGE THICK (prob 3 inches thick) thing hard dense with very little sort bacon piece in it. It just tasted like eating a GIANT PIECE of over cooked fried egg! I order it after running Half Marathon, it almost made me puke. it was really a bad dish. 

Their potato cubes that comes with breakfast are AMAZING!!! they are little tinny cubes browned n seasoned perfectly, when you bite into them, they are soft inside! 

They have very good turkey wrap with house salad. 

Their patios are HuGE, One giant Patio on frist floor, two patios on Second floor, another patio on Third floor. Their patio has amazing view from second floor, nothing on the way, so you see whole CN Tower glowing n financial district. Upgraded patio decor, lounge sofas, fancy (spice route style) fire lamps. One of the best patios at bars in Toronto. Winter, indoor is loud and buzy."}
{"text":"Love the patio at Brazen Head Irish Pub! 

Nothing beat having a drink on the patio after wandering around Liberty Village!

There are option of shade and full sun because of the size of the patio. I always opt for the half shaded as I get burnt really easily.

Service is efficient and friendly. Beer selection is meh but I do enjoy drinking my Hoegaarden. 1/2 price appetizer during Happy Hour, sounds good to me!"}
{"text":"This place has consistently been a better dining experience than many of the more expensive restaurants that we frequent. The food is nothing to write home about, but the main thing is that it's always edible, not too greasy and served with a smile. Much better than William's Landing across the way if only because the servers aren't overtly grabbed by managers at this pub (and I've never found hair in my salads here either- bonus!). 

But seriously, this is a good establishment and a nice place if you need options for everyone. The servers look happy here and the atmosphere is just what you'd expect from a well known pub. Kudos to Brazen Head!"}
{"text":"I was here for lunch and had a great meal on their patio.

The entrance to this pub (really cool space) is rather obscure and it's funny constantly seeing people walking around the building trying to find a door. 
Being a breakfast lover, I was happy to see that they were still serving breakfast at 1pm. I had their Brazen Benedict which is a smoked salmon benedict on a boxtie patty which was very tasty. It was served with a side salad which was also good but a bit heavy on the dressing. The prices are also very reasonable and the staff was very friendly.

My only gripe is that the patio and inside the restaurant needs a good sweeping. The floor was littered with discarded paper napkin rings, empty sugar packets and other small pieces of debris.  On the patio I saw the same but was disgusted to see scraps of pickles, bread and fries left on the ground (it was very obvious) where a few pigeons were there to peck away at it in the presence of other customers.
The mess was probably from a busy Friday the night before, but come on! Spend a few minutes, pick up a broom and sweep it up (the restaurant was actually not busy at the time). The mess was ruining an otherwise very nice patio space.
The bathrooms needed some tidying too.

I would give this place 4 stars if it wasn't for the litter & mess."}
{"text":"Great place for friends/family to go out and eat...but they don't serve Corona's and my bf does not like that lol.

All in all - I like the food...I like the service..."}
{"text":"It's an okay place to hang out with friends in Liberty village. They have different beers on special ($4.5) every night of the week. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't so loud in there every single time we were there. They have the sports going on TVs and a live band singing at the same time; the noise level became overwhelming making it very hard to chit chat with friends during the game.
Nachos were disappointing. It's $15 for basic nachos and $5 for meat and $3 for guac. I don't like how they mixed in the salsa, sour cream into nachos making it very soggy. Normally, you get salsa and sour cream on the side. I paid $20 for my nachos and there wasn't enough cheese and it was soggy.
I would suggest getting anything else on the menu but nachos. Wings and fries are good.
We were there during Blue jays game. And we got to pick a player, and our player hit a home run so we got free pitcher of beer (or you can pick an app). So this was nice"}
{"text":"This is the go-to bar for Toronto FC pre/post drinking and is somewhat of a staple in Liberty Village. I've been here for a few patio birthday celebrations (and shared many a creepy elevator ride - don't ask me why this happens, but for some reason every time I take the elevator up to the patio there are total alienoids in the elevator chatting me up and trying to be pals). 

Three stars for serving Sobe ARush (my energy drink of choice) instead of the standard Red Bull. This is the only bar I've ever been to that had Sobe Arush on hand! Quite impressive."}
{"text":"Pretty average pub, and I frequent it quite often. It's a safe and cool environment, with really great music. The waiters are hilarious, and really fun! The only problem I've noticed is over serving some of the patrons. I think almost every time I've been there, there's been a drunk British guy trying to pick women up. Makes a lot of people feel uncomfortable. Otherwise, great pub! The summertime is the best, because they have three patios!"}
{"text":"Fear not, Yelpers. Bro culture is alive and well in Liberty Village. 

This neighbhourhood, man. It's clean and a faux, like a movie set. Beautiful old brick buildings turned into everything one could need sitting below towers filled with bros, yuppies and young families that crush on the condo scene. There aren't quite enough businesses (yet) to handle the amount of people living here, so everywhere is always smoking busy. Brazen Head is no different.

It was the first day of American football, so my friend and I who had earned lunch after some aggressive furniture shopping were surrounded by jack asses while we dined. Be smarter than us, and google if it's a heavy sports day before heading into a pub in Liberty Village with TVs. Oy. 

The above being said, this place has a lot of redeeming qualities. A caesar bar where you can decorate your own drink during brunch, huge portions, fresh fries and a nice staff. Try the club of the fried chicken sandwich with side salads if you are hungry and enjoy big pieces of chicken and lettuce with whimsy."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to hang out pre and post a TFC game, you can't miss places in Liberty Village.

The crowd, noise, and plenty alCOOL makes Brazen Head quite a place to be.  

I've eaten here on a previous night out and was not impressed with the food - maybe an off night.  Choose your food wisely - basically have whatever everyone else is having.

Staff is super great and managers are great too.   If you're claustrophobic - might want to hang somewhere else.  You will be nose to nose and cheek to cheek (top and bottom) with complete strangers.  Hey!  Make new friends!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and it never fails... Anytime there's a special event, their staff crumbles.  From their wait staff panicking and getting all flustered to receiving incorrect orders, they just can't handle the busy events (i.e. Olympics, Stanley cup, St. Patrick's Day, etc.) This time around it was the World Cup and it took 45 mins for just 1 order of nachos and it didn't even come out correctly. 

It sucks cuz they have good tasting food here. Go here on a regular day/evening cuz you may be SOL on an event night. 

The problem? Some days it feels like they're taking advantage of their great location. No matter what, they'll always get business... So, on busy days it feels like they don't care about every single customer because they know, due to the growth in Liberty Village, it doesn't matter that one customer leaves unsatisfied because another one will be along shortly. Should I really be leaving this pub with that type of impression?"}
{"text":"Went there the first time today. Liked the fact that they had Sam Adams on tap. Their tap selection is good. The Bartender was good. The environment was good.
I ordered wings. The chicken had an after taste. As if it wasn't fresh. Did not like them."}
