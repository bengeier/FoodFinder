{"text":"This place was ok, I went at lunch with a guy who had never had sushi before, he kept  asking me \" where is the flavor\"? I had to agree with him, I have definitely had better sushi at other places, the staff was really nice and quick too"}
{"text":"My brother and I had a sushi craving for weeks and cured it by going to Masa Sushi. For an AYCE sushi restaurant the quality of fish was above par, and the service was impeccable. The owner over saw our order cards and place the order. If you pay by cash you also get 15% off, which isn't so bad either. I would highly recommend Masa Sushi."}
{"text":"Service: 5/5
Food: 2.5/5

No idea why people like this place, food was very very average. In fact it's a place for people who dont crave for better quality food. Sashimi wasnt very fresh, the rolls are the worst. I can only recommend the hot items, like pan fried udons, sirloin steak, dumplings etc. But in a japanese restaurant i expect better quality japanese food especially AYCE places are so competitive. Wont go back again. Price: $22/person on friday, 10%off with yelp discount, total with tips we paid $50."}
{"text":"The food is good. It could be better, but honestly for the price you pay, it's good sushi. Have ordered there plenty of times, always pick up. Never had a person get sick or complain. Food is fresh. The decor inside is not really something to brag about which is why I personally order for pick up and a great discount for cash payments.i continue to go there and order and would recommend it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this place through a Groupon deal and loved it so much we went back a second time the following week. We're both sushi fiends so we go at least once a week, this particular time was the 3rd time in the same week just because we were craving it so much! It is a close tie to being my favourite all time AYCE sushi place.

Masa deserves 5  stars because of their great service, the selection of food (they literally offer everything for you to choose from), the quality of the fish that they purchase. We were actually so impressed by the taste quality of the salmon shashimi that we asked the owner how he goes about selecting it. You can tell that a lot of time and care is put into the preparation of the sushi rolls (unlike many other AYCE places) because the portion sizes are just right, there isn't too much rice stuffed in and each piece doesn't fall apart as it makes its way to your plate, soy sauce and finally into your mouth! It's unfortunate that more places don't actually take the time to ensure these things are met because it actually makes a world of difference! I have to say also that I was particularly impressed with the salmon rose, I say this because most places either don't offer it or royally mess it up by making it far too large and overstuff it with rice. Most times it falls apart before you can even pick it up so I was really impressed with the salmon roses at Masa for getting it just right!"}
{"text":"With the price, you can pretty much get this kind of quality anywhere. $12.99 is a good deal for lunch but you can only get full, not satisfied. Add $1.50 for unlimited pop. Not a lot of customers so service is fast. Apparently kitchen was closed when we went at 3:30."}
{"text":"My friend brought me to Masa sushi for the first time and I'd have to say that I will not be returning; mainly because of service. First of all, the outside was unattractive. The banner /sign looked a tad cheap. We had the AYCE dinner and there were four of us. When we entered the restaurant it was empty, there were only about 3-4 tables that had customers including ourselves on a Saturday. None the less I kept an open mind. 

Like all restaurants there are some good items and some items that are just okay. Most of the food was decent. The bacon wrapped shrimp was delicious as well as the coconut shrimp. I was disappointed with my teriyaki salmon; the cut was too thick and dry. The rolls were okay, nothing special but not terrible, I would probably order them again with the exception of the deep fried spicy salmon roll which wasn't spicy and the fish was dry. Also, behind the crunchy layer was a mushy dough layer then came the fish. I did not enjoy the mushiness. Other than that all the other items are just as decent as other AYCE sushi places. 
I didn't think my meal was worth what I paid because I've been to many sushi restaurants with much better food, excellent service, upscale atmosphere and I paid the same or less than what I paid at Masa Sushi. 

We tried very hard not to over order and we liked it that they had the option to order single pieces and we aren't forced to order 4 per orders. At the end of the meal we had 1 coconut shrimp, 2 salmon sashimi (my clumsy friend dropped 1 sashimi on the table by accident), 1 butterfish, half a salmon teriyaki and majority remaining of the deep fried spicy salmon roll left over. We were now ready for our ice-cream dessert.  We asked the server if we could order some ice-cream. She started mumbling unhappily and pointed to our remaining food. Her facial expression went sour. She told us that they do not waste food and asked us to try to finish. We ate the remaining sashimi except the one that dropped. We told her we were very full and tried to finish what we could, we didn't like the roll and she said' if you didn't like the roll it is fine but what about the other food\" and then started pointing at each individual item. My friend explained she had dropped one and that we didn't like the salmon. I did not like it that she pointed out each item and questioned us. I felt as if we were being interrogated and belittled. It was awkward and uncomfortable; the waitress also looked very unhappy and upset. She walked over to her co-worker and I am 100% positive they were talking about us. If you are going to talk about your customers, be smart and talk in the back. She was not polite. I do not appreciate going to a sushi place and worrying if I'll be questioned about every item I cannot eat when I ate 97% of the meal.  There are better ways to address leftovers and I understand if she had said something if there was a huge quantity of food left but there were only a few items. At this point our bill was $100 and there was so little food left. It made me feel like the restaurant was cheap. 

My dinner was ruined because of servers who aren't polite and have not been taught proper etiquette. If I was a server I would never want to make my customers feel uncomfortable and I would always want them to leave smiling."}
{"text":"I have lived all over the city and have tried numerous sushi places and I can honestly tell you that Masa competes with any AYCE option in the city. 

I love that they don't pack a whole bunch of rice in their rolls and their nigiri just to fill you up. The bacon wrapped shrimp and garlic beef are quite amazing. Their pink lady rolls are a great improvement on a spicy salmon roll. Not often would I order take out from a AYCE place but we order from Masa at least once a week. 

The service is hit or miss but for the most part, it's great for an Asian place."}
{"text":"Masa has grown to be a very pleasing place to go for a la carte and AYCE. I've since taken over 10 people there and they've loved the food! At the beginning, the service was a little meh, but they've since stepped up a lot. The last experience I had with the take-out and staff was certainly displeasing but the staff I've been helped by are really pleasant and courteous. I ordered take-out again today and the order was done promptly and tastes awesome as always. The girl that took my order and cashed me out today was very pleasant. I'm happy they've stepped up their customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered take out once,automatically they asked what i wanted and asked me if i wanted water while i was waiting... The sushi taste good but very very pricy. Then wanted to come in with my brother on a Saturday for an all you can eat, we stood and waited for someone, and we even went to the front desk where the cashier is. She didn't even ask what we wanted and we waited in line for some man to order something to ask the lady if we can have a seat and while in line she acted as we were invisible and called the man standing behind us if he was ready to pay... I let that pass and waited for another 7 minutes and still nobody comes to help us or asks us. Then waited a little longer and just left..."}
{"text":"This is one of the better AYCE places. The salmon was fresh and cut thick. The dinner menu selection was large and the presentation was satisfying. The staff were also attentive and food came out in a timely manner. Also, if you pay with cash, you get 15% off - although I'm unsure how long this will go on for. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Well I live in Chicago, so let me tell you, there's nothing like this in Chicago.  Chicago, a city for having a wealth of amazing food.  Still nothing like it.  

Therefore, every time I come to Toronto (where I was born), I put this on my checklist.  I come here with my family, the service is decent, the food is unreal, and if you come very hungry, its all YOU can eat!  

I think they underestimate to power of hunger sometimes, or just me and my family because they \"can't count right\" every once in awhile.  However, guess what, its all YOU can eat.  Just order more. :)"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 6 adults for AYCE.  It was very confusing when our orders arrived and we had to reorder items several times because they just didn't deliver.  We ordered gyozasa three times and they never arrived.  We ordered 6 spring rolls which never arrived.  We ordered again and they brought 2.  It was a frustrating experience.  I wouldn't recommend and I won't return."}
{"text":"This is my favorite All-You-Can-Eat Sushi place in the city! My friend and I bought an amazing Groupon to try it out and ever since that first time we have been hooked. The fish is extremely fresh and the menu has some amazing options. The rolls are creative and very stuffed.

I love that the place is clean and cozy. There are a couple different seating areas so you don't feel like you are surrounded by a million people and the service is so fast! Probably one of the top Sushi places in the city and there is always parking!"}
{"text":"Still the favorite for our family. Even including as far as Niagara Falls area our new home, though we still come by when we visit"}
{"text":"The rolls were old and mushy. Everything else was below average. The wasabi was like play dough."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious and well presented sushi. Good service.  Restaurant is run down and patched up in places, but good experience for the price."}
{"text":"Great place to go for sushi, the fish is always fresh and brought to the table fast. The service is great, always on top of the orders, and filling up your drinks. 

Very affordable dinner date for Vaughan sushi"}
{"text":"Very good service, Very delicious food, Sashimi was fresh and came as exactly ordered. Good portion and the teriyakis was seasoned and sauced to stimulate all my tastebuds. 

Thank you"}
{"text":"We have ordered sushi from here a few times now. The sushi has tasted fresh and delicious each time. The delivery is also very prompt. Would definately recommend."}
{"text":"Food was just up to standard, but not satisfied with their services, I ordered tea twice but never came, also forgot my dessert ordered, seems don't care customers, will not go back."}
{"text":"I decided to try here on friday and I love it so much I brought back the family on Saturday. Very affordable and very tasty. hot fresh teriyaki and great sushi rolls. 
great presentation.. Best of luck I will certainly come back for more."}
{"text":"Best sushi we have had in awhile. They even let us have the Jays game on! It was very fresh sushi, did not all come at once. Really great. I would come back for sure. Nothing bad to say. Nice atmosphere with the music as well."}
{"text":"Poor presentation, and lacks flavour. Poor English (read the owners intro and you know what I mean). What pissed me off the most, they kept delivering chicken skews and skipping the sushi orders.. We had to ask multiple time until they dropped it at our table...  Definitely my first and last time here. Highly not recommended."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi restaurant in Vaughan. There's amazing decor, staff and friendly service amaze me! One or two of the girls could smile more often, which is why I'm giving them four stars. I've been here with my boyfriend many times and often I'm impressed with the quality of their food. Still in love with the banana sushi rolls. Yum, can't get enough!"}
{"text":"I work a 5 minute drive from here. I order over the phone every now and then for pick-up. I get about 16 pieces of rolls for 7.90 cash. Service is quick especially when you just want to be in, out and back to the office!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday after a day at Wonderland and were we impressed! We were welcomed to a spacious, clean restaurant by the enthusiastic staff there. I have never seen the number of items or variety on any ayce sushi. They had so many unique items that you won't find anywhere else like a salmon sushi roll with banana on top (it was really good!) and deep-fried maki rolls! The price was normal for ayce sushi and it was totally worth it. All the food was prepared very well and the items were very tasty.

I wish I lived in the area so I could go back more, but this will definitely be my first choice when I'm around Vaughan."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a decent AYCE in the Vaughan region for some time now and stumbled upon a review of this place, so I decided To try it out.  This is my second time and the service never disappoints. For $24 bucks for two at lunch you couldn't go wrong. My girlfriend and I tried dynamite, spider, spicy salmon, and green dragon rolls and they were delicious. In addition to that we ordered a few off their teriyaki and fried section and the miso soup. All in all the food was great, service was excellent, and the price was reasonable. This is my spot in Vaughan if I ever crave sushi."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time and it's great, but got delivery today. It was dry and overpriced. Not impressed."}
{"text":"This place is a nice surprise, they have very fresh food. We had lunch AYCE for 12.99 before tax. They actually put a lot of fish inside all the sushi rolls and little rice so it's really worth the price. Highly recommend the spider rolls."}
{"text":"My first impression was great. Considering the price, it is really nice inside. However, my girlfriends yam tempura had a hair in it and that was her first bite. Secondly, the service was not that great. The waitresses hardly checked up on us. The sushi itself was average. Overall, the food came fast, but it wasn't the best. For its price it was just OK."}
{"text":"This is a average AYCE sushi place. Don't expect anything special because you get what you paid for. We were not bloated after we left and that means the food was ok. And we were not extremely impressed with the ambiance, service and sushi quality all together. 
Would I go back there? yaa maybe."}
{"text":"My go-to for take out sushi. Quick service and great cash menu make for an affordable family dinner"}
{"text":"Love this place. Decor is simple and plain but guys equalize that with fresh and tasty food. All guys friendly and would recommended something special. I am here at least every month and always leaving happy. Plenty if parking spots on plaza. Affordable prices. Will recommend to a friends."}
{"text":"One of my favourite and one of the best AYCE sushi establishments in the area. 

The food is always very fresh and come out very quickly. Fresh sashimi and tasty sushi rolls, and nicely seasoned food. The portions are not too large, which is a common problem I find in AYCE restaurants. The service is exceptional - friendly staff, drinks are always refilled and plates are cleared promptly. 

Reasonable prices for the AYCE sushi with the vast variety of choices, as well as reasonable prices for takeout.

Will definitely return and recommend!"}
{"text":"So driving down Weston I was on my way to another ayce restaurant. 

It started downpouring so we decided to just pull into that one ... 

We get there 11:50 & they open 11:30, we get seated and see huge ayce menu for lunch. 

$13.95

So we ordered and than the waitress tells us the chefs were running late and so we said it's ok. 


We got our food & than finally the chefs come and cook quick. Got cold spring rolls it's ok. 

Since we were the only people in the restaurant our waitresses just stood beside us and staring at our table the whole hour we were there. 



It's like she wanted to join us! 

Anyways they were nice , the sushi chef was rolling sushi and on the phone with the other hand , also when taking the syram wrap he used his mouth ... v unsanitary. He probably goes to the bathroom with that phone .. 

Anyways wouldn't go back , but nice to try something different"}
{"text":"four star sushi? 9200 weston rd vaughan? all u can eat?  9055538886? Happy Mother's Day?"}
{"text":"I always like coming here. The portions are quite big for a really reasonable price, and the staff are really friendly most of the time. The place is clean and quirky, having a vibe that it's been around for a while and people love it. It could use a couple of updated in my opinion, as the kimono mannequin is a bit cheesy and the white, sterile fluorescent lamps in the chandelier take away from the overall luxe appeal of the fixture. The rolls are also fresh and yummy, but lack aesthetic appeal. Otherwise, it's a great place to dine in and take out (they offer a discount menu for pick up/cash I believe. It's one or the other, don't quote me on that ;P) I usually get the silver bento box with chicken (teriyaki or katsu if I want something crispy and fried) and it comes with a full California roll, fried calamari and other tempura, and the usual rice salad and soup."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night. Sushi was good and reasonably priced. However, we did not have a good dining experience. We arrived around 9:45 PM, more than an hour before their 11:00 PM closing time. Right from the moment we sat down we felt VERY rushed to order. The server seemed annoyed when we told her we needed a couple more minutes to look at the menu. Our food was served hastily and carelessly. While eating we were approached 4 times by several different servers asking if \"everything was good\" but it sounded like we were indirectly being told to quickly finish our food and leave. By this time it was still only 10:30 PM. Then a server came to present us our bill and proceeded to turn off the lights in the section where we were sitting!!! At that point we got up and left as we felt extremely uncomfortable. On our way out we were gawked at by a group of employees sitting in the restaurant. Needless to say the staff was very unprofessional. If you decide to come here make sure to come AT LEAST 2-3 hours before closing time if you want decent service."}
{"text":"I think this is a great AYCE sushi place.

The servers are always so nice and so sweet with our toddler son.

The food is fresh and consistent, with a good variety of things to choose from.  I love the pink lady roll, which has tons of salmon!  Sushi & rolls are very good, \"pizzas\" are served hot, not cold like alot of other places.  Tempura is fresh, piping hot, and crisp.  They also have tasty dumplings, rice and meat dishes.

Masa is definitely a great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Have been regulars here for a while now. Although we don't typically eat inn, we prefer the take out menu, and that they deliver. The food quality is very good and always fresh.  The delivery is very quick. They have a huge selection in rolls, sushi/ sashimi a la carte and so on! 
The cater to my gluten free needs, and always make exceptions for substitutions due to food allergies!!!
The interior could use some updating, and al bough order takers are fine in the phone, it's still not all that easy to communicate so I get my hi. Y to do it lol, other than that great place"}
{"text":"There are too many AYCE sushi buffets in Vaughan. Heck, I think there are more AYCE sushi than there are sales at Vaughan Mills. Thus, it's difficult to find an establishment that offers a memorable experience over another when menus are homogeneous. With mixed feelings, I give Masa Sushi a 3 of 5.

The sushi here is actually quite splendid; good selection and appropriate filling to rice ratio. They offer your typical sushi, rolls, tempanyaki... you know the deal. My favourite item on the menu would be the salmon skin hand roll, teriyaki beef, and spider roll. Price is more than reasonable and food quality is top notch!

But why 3 of 5? The decor and atmosphere is repelling. I felt like I walked into a someone's poorly decorated home - in the 70's. Seating is unnecessarily divided into two rooms, it's dim lit, japan-themed pictures that have no relevancy in modern day sushi, and worst of all, sorrowful mandarin music resonated throughout. 

Does anyone else agree with me on this one?"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and it is a decent sushi place for the woodbridge area. The AYCE model goes over well as you get to try different things. 

Some very nice servers as said in other reviews but the sushi rolls (teryiaki beef and chicken) did not taste fresh at all and they did not even bring my spicy red snapper rolls which is always a theme in AYCE places but also always a turn-off

The cooked food selection was decent, which is important to me as I can not only eat sushi, the mango chicken, spicy chicken and teryiaki beef were all good.

All in all it is a decent place if others are packed (as was the case on my last visit) but I would not recommend otherwise as there are at least six plus other options within a 5 min drive"}
{"text":"We got a party tray B today and it tasted totally awesome! 
It took them only 10 minutes to make it and we got spring rolls as a gift! 
The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is clean, sushi are absolutely delicious! 
They also did a renovation and now it looks better than ever! 
Thanks Eric and staff for this amazing experience"}
{"text":"Best sushi!!! This place offers the same if not better service and sushi in Woodbridge/Vaughan. 

It's slightly cheaper if you pay with cash 

I always get the lunch all you can eat and it's worth it!!! $15 ($20 with tip) 

Good place!!!"}
{"text":"I come here every so often with friends to get a quick sushi lunch fix, however that is all. I will never come here for dinner or for any other occasion. Service is terrible, although we write everything down in the menu they give us, we receive only half of what was asked. They'll mix up our orders with another table more than once. I was watching one of the waitresses as they had food in their hands, and they looked so lost as to where the food was supposed to be served. Honestly if you do plan to come here, just come for some quick sushi and that's it, otherwise don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Terable experience miniature sushi like food,unprofessional stuff,dirty washrooms. Terabale terrible  never again."}
{"text":"4.5.
This place was highly recommended by my coworkers. I stopped by here for lunch. I only had an hour. I'm happy to say I left STUFFED. :)
The service was good, my glasses were never empty, they were great at refilling my tea which I appreciated.
The place is pretty big.
I liked the food, it took a while for the rolls to come out though.
The seaweed salad and spicy tuna and salmon were my favourites.
I would highly recommend the deep fried banana with chocolate sauce. So good!!!!!!
They did forget a few of our orders (nigiri) but it wasn't a big deal. I was really full anyway.
I'm sure I'll be back here again."}
{"text":"No frills, basic AYCE Sushi joint.

Menu is not as extensive as other All You Can Eat sushi places.

The decor is very plain with no decoration style whatsoever.  Put anything on the wall and drop in some tables type of place.

The sushi menu is extensive in the rolls department.  They copied some of the rolls from 168 Sushi.  There are a few cool rolls in there that are recipes from the chef himself.

The service is border line rude,   They keep asking if you are finished after the 2nd ordering.  

 Finally the price is that of a higher end place.

Take my advice.  Go to 168 Sushi or Spoon and Fork.  Way better, larger selection, great ambiance for the same price.

By the way, their \"Yelp 10%Special\" is full of it.   There is a big sign that if you pay cash you save 10%.  When asking about the Yelp special, it is only for cash payers.

Save your money.   Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Get delivery from here often. It's good. They deliver in short time, the sushi quality is good, everything is done well.

Only problem is any hot dishes you order show up lukewarm-to-cold even with the short delivery times.

That's not a problem for me as all my dishes I get are sushi/sashimi/salads, etc but for my wife, who only wants hot dishes like wings, terriyaki chicken, yakitori, etc she is constantly disappointed.

So in summation - great place to get delivery from, just don't order any hot dishes and you'll be very happy."}
{"text":"There's only a few weeks to go before I can have real real real sushi, with raw fish, but that didn't stop me from coming here with a few coworkers for lunch.

First things first, it's super affordable.  At $12.95 per person for AYCE lunch, it's a steal.  I didn't see sashimi on the menu or lunch, only sushi.  I had the veggie sushi pizza (topped with avocado), yum.  The gyozas were tasty, the rolls were excellent and not made entirely of rice, which happens a lot at AYCE places.  

The fish looked fresh, one table ordered a massive plate of just salmon sushi.  I was jealous.  It was still tasty and offered very good value."}
{"text":"Multiple times I've eaten here I've only received half of what was ordered, sometimes they won't bring stuff out until you're almost ready to leave and then get mad that you didn't eat it and try to charge extra for it. It's ALL YOU CAN EAT not pay for the all you can eat menu and then pay extra for leftovers they're going to throw out anyway. The servers are always rude. If I'm going to pay $25 for sushi I want a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Good place for take out ordering 
Size ratios have always been consistent meaning not too much rice more meat when ordering sushi rolls"}
{"text":"Update: this has never happened to me before and that's why I'm updating my review
It's shady but it's true.I've actually gotten threatening PMs from people who claim to have eaten here and it's the best ever and how dare I pick on lack of sanitation/ambience?!? When I go into their profiles conveniently they have no pictures, no friends and no reviews? 
Very unprofessional. If you get a negative review, try to fix what's wrong instead of intimidating people.

Please stay away from this joint
_____________________________________________________


We decided to try this place a few weekends ago and food wise I cannot complain.

While the food is good, the service is good too. Why the 2 stars then?

The interior is very very dated and disappointing. This area of Woodbridge is full of new homes. Everywhere you go, commercial retail or restaurants they are brand new with latest decor, dishes, platters etc. 

You eat with your eyes first, then your tongue. If the food arrives on a round plastic plate at a sushi place you've successfully killed my appetite in a heartbeat. Also the view from the both we were seated in didn't help- it was a mop and broom out in the open next to a cash register. Please.. I know this place is old but the least you can do is clean and organize. I wanted to leave as soon as I was done eating and for an AYCE sushi place we didn't order much. Everything was coming together to kill out appetites.

Will not return."}
{"text":"Very reasonable price for lunch.
Service was attentive, and although not every item ordered was brought out, the three of us left full.
Spicy chicken was fantastic... Great heat to it. 
Only disappointing part of our meal was the edaname...not salty enough.
Quality was excellent.
AYCE lunch, with 2 pops, came to just over $50 and change (tax in)."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I love the spicy miso soup, and how they put cucumbers with their seaweed salad, I honestly order from here 4x a month.  Sometimes more"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi place in Vaughan! Love it...the food, the service, the price is also very reasonable. We go at least once a week and is go more if I could! They accommodate for our diet, always greet us politely and go out of their way to make us feel welcome, as well as ensure we leave feeling content. I am so grateful they are minutes away from our home and I have to say after two years of continuous service, they never ever compromise the quality and integrity and their food and services! Give it a try! It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Found this local gem right here on Yelp. It was Friday night, we were driving home from Mississauga, and this spot just happened to be en route home. We called ahead to confirm they'd serve us (the place was closing in 45 minutes). 

When we came in, I looked about to pick up some clues about what to expect here. To be honest with you, quite a few things told me I shouldn't expect much here. 

A huge bar serving all kinds of alcohol.

A lot of open space for....hm....dancing? Yup! And here's strobe lights and the 80's disco ball hung from the ceiling to complete the picture.

Two TVs playing sports channel.

A big group with kids celebrating a child's birthday, balloons and everything.

And the clincher: The all-you-can-eat menu.

I tend to stay away from all-you-can-eat places because, almost as a rule, their food is subpar and most of the time sucks. But it was too late to try to find another place at that hour. So we decided to stay and let things unfurl. 

We did ask for the a la cart menu though. And sure enough, it was like 20 pages long, with some newer items written in by hand.

When it seemed like nothing could possibly redeem this place, our food arrived. 

And everything fell into place. I realized why Masa has so many and so devoted fans on yelp.

We ordered two specialty maki rolls and a 5-handroll dinner special, that came with miso soup and a small salad. The total bill was under $40 including tax.

All the dished were excellent, on par with my favourite a la cart restaurants. One roll in particular, named \"Tuna Amazing\", was $12.95 and was a large 8-piece roll with three different kinds of tuna in it. Amazing it was. Most rolls there would be quite a bit cheaper though, anywhere from $5 to $11.

Another plus of this location is that it's so close to highway 400 (it's pretty much on the corner of Rutherford and Weston.) 

I'm sure we'll be back. I may even give their all-you-can-eat menu a try."}
{"text":"Thanks to a coworker, this place has turned into my go-to sushi resto in Vaughan for both pick up and dine in. 

The staff here really appreciate the value in time and don't mind if you're there to lounge around for a couple hours, get in and out for an hour away from work or pick up an order which was promised to be ready in 15 minutes. 

They host a world of unique flavours such as the peanut roll (avocado & peanut), the ABC roll (avocado/banana/cream cheese), Weston roll, maple roll, summer miss roll, etc. They are all so good! My favourites are the Alaska roll, the pink lady roll and their sashimi. Masa has really improved the size of their sashimi cuts too - nice and thick!

The price is decent and although some items don't quite make it to your table, they have no problem giving you another sheet to fill out and to order from. You're best to confirm whether or not more is coming and ask for a page accordingly. It's really not that big of a deal when you think about it... 

The reason why I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars is because they remember their customers. My friend Christina R is gluten free and has to use a different soya sauce then the one they serve. Every time we visit, they whip out her personal soya sauce bottle and bring it to the table before a hello is even exchanged. They are that good!"}
{"text":"Always good - no complaints! And for the non-sushi people, the cooked food is awesome too!"}
{"text":"This place is absolute crap. Service is terrible, layout sucks, food is nothing special. 

This is my third time being here and every time I leave thinking \"no f'n chance I'm coming back\". This time I'm not joking around. Received less than half the ordered items (how do they miss stuff if it's written down?) and what I did get took forever and was plain jane sushi at best. 

They also gave me a hard time about the 10% off yelp coupon so I left $20 for a $23-something tab and took off. Do not waste your time."}
{"text":"Me & my bestfriend have been eating sushi for a long time. We've been to ALOT of AYCE sushi places & I gotta say Masa sets the bar for great AYCE. Sake Sushi on hwy 7 was also amazing but gotta give slight edge to Masa. There sashimi is cut just right & is extremely fresh it melts in your mouth & I believe great sashimi is most important for good sushi experience. There rolls & cooked foods are all good as well & the cheese wontons are amazing I gotta order least have dozen just for myself everytime I go. There are lots great non AYCE places out there like Kogeni in Vaughn, but as far as AYCE sushi places go Masa is my favorite & i'd recommend it to anyone looking for great sushi experience!!"}
{"text":"When I showed them the 10% off coupon from the app, the \"boss\" first said \"it must be for the downtown location\"; and when I show them it is their address, he still refuse to honour the coupon. After a bit, he sent the server over to explain the coupon must have been from when they opened a year ago.
The seaweed salad was decent, the kani salad is on the spicy side, but their special salad is GOOD.
The sushi/sashimi are fresh, but their fileting skill needs improvement. The seaweed used for handrolls are fresh. I also appreciate the fact that they are not trying to stuff us with rice in their rolls. Their rolls are done properly with just a thin layer of rice.
I can't fault them on the taste of the coconut shrimp, but they are not using the proper batter for it. The crazy part is that their tempura batter is the right type, though.
The overall experience is good, and if they have honoured the Yelp coupon, I would've given them another star.

Post-visit note. The owner quickly contacted me to apologize for the mistake by his manager and staffs, and offer a discount on my next visit. It's not going to be easy convincing my wife to give them another chance, though."}
{"text":"Whats so special about this place? I have no idea.
It seems like any typical sushi place. The food wasnt bad but wasnt great. The service is better then any place for sure. The owner is out helping his employees which is nice for a change. Water is always refilled. The food is a bit of a wait. But again isnt great. Would be okay with going back but wouldnt suggest this one first."}
{"text":"First thought was this market is becoming saturated with AYCE sushi shops. 

This place was above the rest the presentation was pleasant and the manager or owner came around and was very nice he asked how we came across his restaurant and was very welcoming. Which was on par with the rest of the service staff. 

The food was plates nicely and was in good portions. I have found that some other AYCE places make their maki rolls smaller than regular, that's not the case here. I didn't feel they were trying to cheap out on their AYCE orders. Although we weren't given an option for a regular menu I would imagine you don't have to do AYCE if you don't want too. But at $19 it's a good value since other in the area go up to $22. 

Well worth the money, the portions were good, the food was fresh, the atmosphere was casual but somewhat eloquent, and the service was very friendly and pretty quick.

The only thing was I would have at least seen a regular menu."}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE and wasn't really impressed. The sushi didn't seem too fresh, and it didn't have a dab of wasabi between the fish and rice as usual for the nigiri. I also wouldn't recommend any of the deep fried rolls. My friends loved the squid sashimi here though."}
{"text":"We came here tonight because the sushi is good and we enjoy eating here. We come here twice a month. Maybe more. 
Tonight, the food was great, everything was fresh, clean and well prepared. Up until the end of our meal, the service was flawless. Our drinks were brought out fast, as well as our food. Our glasses of water were always full. Everything was perfect. 
But when they came to clear our table at the end of the night, the waiter got us in trouble for not eating all our food (we had about 7 rolls left over) and told us to order less next time. His tone was very demeaning and he said that he was going to charge us, but decided not to. 
I did not appreciate the tone of his voice, I felt like a child being disciplined for not finishing my dinner. It really turned me off. It was rather embarrassing. 
It's an \"all you can eat\" establishment. And that is exactly what I did. 
What a shame for a place that serves such good food to have such bad service. It was very unprofessional. I do not know if I will be back."}
{"text":"After reading Tasha's raving review, I have now been to Masa twice. It's a regular AYCE sushi restaurant that's hidden in an outdoor plaza. The food here is really good and the sushi is very fresh. I really like their salmon and butterfish sushi. The handrolls are also excellent, as well as the shrimp tempura. The edamame is really good too. The rolls are nothing special. Lunch does not include sashimi, but it does include ice cream. For $13 + tax and tip, Masa Sushi is a really good deal."}
{"text":"Not up to par with kyoto sushi across the street. service was good but not amazing."}
{"text":"Service was very poor. The sushi was extremely slow to come out and didn't taste as fresh as I would have liked. I found the overall taste of the food was poor.  I was constantly trying to get the attention of our server for water, napkins, wasabi, etc. 

Also, we were one of the only people in the restaurant and still struggled to get decent service. I have had much better food at AYCE places and I suggest you go somewhere else. It felt like priority was given to the people coming to pick up take out as opposed to the customers eating in their restaurant."}
{"text":"Masa sushi is a typical AYCE sushi place; offers sashimi for dinner, sushi rolls and cooked foods all day. I had went here for dinner, the sushi and sashimi were warm and the rice was somewhat dry. The cooked food were warm and meats were dry. The staff were okay; when asked for something, it usually comes. However, the attitudes of the staff seems like they have better things to do than provide service to their customers. From all the AYCE sushi joints around the area, I would come back if it would be the only viable opinion in terms of transportation and time."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend today for all you can eat lunch. We don't love all you can eat as we find the quality is much better when it's not, but we were really hungry and talked about doing this for a while.

Originally, we had our hearts set on trying kaka in Markham which recently opened but we found out they didn't do AYCE lunch. We were at Vaughan Mills so we were just gonna head east to Yoshiko at Bathurst and Steeles (my personal fave) but decided to give a new local place a try :)---big regret!

I was kind of unimpressed right off the bat from the menu, I know AYCE lunch menus have less on them than dinner but I just felt like it was lacking something! Very limited side dishes. They did have red tuna rolls though which I haven't seen on many all you can eat lunch menus.

Normally when I go for sushi I order a ridiculous amount of food because I just want everything. In this case, there were only a few things I was even willing to eat.

The miso soup came first, watered down!! So was the thousand island dressing they used in their green salad. 

My friend ordered a nestea (which costed $1.50 extra) we saw the nestea cans but made bets that they'd bring it in a cup- bingo!! They did, and it was watered down. He asked for an actual can and the waitress just walked away to get it, didn't even reply- busted! I ended up sipping on his watered down drink for the rest of the meal.

The rolls were nothing to write home about- I consider myself a dynamite roll connoisseur and this one had the most miniscule amount of shrimp I've ever seen, the spicy tuna was meh, and the California was meh. My friend really didn't like his sushi pizza and I wasn't crazy about my beef teriyaki- too thick pieces and very peppery! Oh and the best part, he tried to order spicy chicken- it was literally chicken pieces cut up and soaked in like Sriracha, totally could have made that at home and saved myself $15 lol!

At the end we decided to wash down our joke of a meal with ice cream but realized they didn't even have dessert on the lunch menu! (it was one of those check off menus) my friend asked the waitress about it and she handed him a small check off menu- all I could think was what the hell, if he didn't ask they would not have offered this- then I thought of all the poor people who never got any dessert with their lunch because they didn't think to ask!!

The dessert is the only thing I give them props for because they brought the ice cream and fried banana AT THE SAME TIME!! Bless.

I really feel bad writing bad reviews but I'm about to get to the best part..

The bills came and my friend and I both had a charge for pop on our bills even though he was the only one that ordered one. They tried to charge me for sipping on his watered down mess! No thank you! They tried to argue it but there was no way in hell I was paying for that- heck if I wanted to order a pop I'd take a diet coke over Nestea anyway!

I usually am very generous with tips but didn't tip amazingly for obvious reasons.

Will NOT go back. Anyone who gave 5 stars either had a completely different experience or does not go for sushi and appreciate it nearly as much as me!!

Me and my boyfriend's one year anniversary is coming up and we're planning on going for fancy expensive sushi downtown to celebrate, it will be like a vacation compared to Masa! The only reason I gave a second star is for the tuna and ice cream!"}
