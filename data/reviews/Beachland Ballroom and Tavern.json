{"text":"milieu of older established folk & young hipsters coming together for best music scene in greater cleveland... & super reasonable tix prices!"}
{"text":"As my husband says, \"This place just keeps getting better!\"  The brunch cocktails are to die for and anything on the menu us super tasty, very creativeand fun! The prices are affordable and the service is, as always, great.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great live music venue.  The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, the staff are friendly, and shows are reasonably priced.  The tavern carries a nice variety of beers, liquors, and hard ciders all priced fairly.  The Beachland Ballroom and Tavern is one great venue for live music."}
{"text":"Updating this with a few more details from my last couple visits there a couple months back.  First of all:  I finally checked out the shop in the basement on a couple visits.  If you're into vintage kitsch, old vintage t-shirts (especially with Cleveland themes) or possibly old records it's worth a visit.  The non-t-shirt clothing selections are not great.  The prices are a tad high, in some cases way high (like 25 bucks for a small tchotchke, 20 bucks for a vintage magazine you can find on eBay for less).   The guy who usually mans the downstairs is very nice.   Second of all:  I would consider giving this place another star if they simply would do like most other clubs I know and either post a time when bands would play (as in, \"Band X at 8 pm, Band Y at 9 pm, Artist Z at 10:30 pm\") or start shows at a consistent (late) time (like no earlier than 8:30 or 9 pm).  In one case, there were about four bands on the bill at the Tavern, at least one local and a couple from out of town.  I assumed the two out of town bands would headline since both of them had lengthy track records.  For some reason, one of the out-of-town bands was put on at like 7:30 pm.  That is WAY too early and while I fortunately was there to see it (just), several of my friends who didn't show up until a more reasonable 9 pm hour missed it.  It wasn't because the band needed to play early and leave either as they hung around all night.  Another time we showed up on a weekend night to see a show in the Tavern, got there about 11:30 thinking we'd see the last set, and found everybody already loading out.  and just a few drunks left dancing to the juke.  again, if the venue would just post the band start times or leave them in a voice message you could call, it would avoid a big waste of time and gas getting out there only to find you have missed whatever and it would make me more likely to go back.   Finally, as for the drinks sitch I recommend paying for each one as you consume it rather than trying to run a tab there."}
{"text":"Not only do they consistently book awesome bands, but the brunch is superb in every sense. I visit the tavern fairly often, usually opting for the chicken and waffles paired with a well-mixed cocktail (the mimosa and the \"Neil Diamond Cuff Links\" are among my favorites). While I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan, I respect the number of delicious options they have for those who adhere to those diets. The menu is unpretentious and rustic, which complements the atmosphere quite well and adds an extra benefit to an existing wonderful environment.   Don't just chow down - enjoy the DJ sets. They are ALWAYS worthwhile!"}
{"text":"We went to see The Head and The Heart on October 2 at Beachland. I had previously been to Beachland years ago to see Sleater-Kinney and remembered it as a small and personal venue. The sound was absolutely perfect and even standing in the rear of the ballroom we could still see the stage pretty clearly.  The parking situation is not as complicated as I thought it would be. We found free on-street parking very easily and didn't feel unsafe at all (aside from the skunk staring me down when I got out of the car).  We walked about a block to Beachland but there were plenty of closer parking spots had we arrived earlier.  The staff was super friendly and I loved that it did not feel pretentious at all as it sometimes does at smaller shows. I wish we lived closer because I'm positive we would be there often."}
{"text":"I went to the beachland today for Sunday brunch with a friend. We got there around 12:30pm and it was pretty packed with people of all ages. The beachland has a way of attracting a wide variety of people (both for brunch and shows) which is refreshing. We got a small table on the stage - before today I've only been to the beachland to watch bands, so it was kinda neat to be on stage. Here's what we got:  1. Turkey sandwich - They ran out of chicken and waffles. *gasp* so I got this with a side of collard greens. The sandwich was scrumptious and rich. I particularly loved the rye bread it came on -- crisp, hearty and fresh. The veg de jour (collard greens) was slightly oily for my taste but I enjoyed it nevertheless.  2. Farmer's breakfast -- My friend got this with a duck's egg, hashbrowns, and a side of portabello mushroom. The hashbrown had a wilty, purplish hue to it. It tasted ok but was a bit disappointing.  The mushroom was a nice alternative to bacon or sausage, especially if you are vegetarian. The biscuit is buttery, warm, delightful with jam.   Overall, the food was very good but not great, but I would come back for the quaint atmosphere and comforting menu. It's definitely a vegetarian-friendly place. Next time I would love to try the chicken and waffles and maybe some drinks. A pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Okay venue, terrible restaurant. I attended the Beachland's annual Morrissey Brunch this past Sunday, and I have to say... it was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. We waited over an hour and a half to be seated, but hey, I live in Cleveland, I'm used to that. What I'm not used to is waiting two hours for my food. There was a point where the lobby was full of people waiting to be seated, and those that were seated remained without food for (not exaggerating) two hours. The servers were kind and did what they could, so kudos to them. I did notice Cindy, the owner, sitting at the end of the bar the entire time just watching (or perhaps ignoring) the madness. If I was a business owner and could see that my employees were clearly struggling, I think I might have helped at least a little. Our server informed us that this breakdown in service had been going on the past FOUR Sundays, so this was not an isolated incident. Our server was nice enough to take our drinks off the bill because she felt so bad that we were having such a terrible brunch experience. I have had brunch at the Beachland many times before (the food really is delish), and there always seems to be some kind of issue (typically in the kitchen) that prevents everyone from getting in and out of there in a timely fashion. Get it together, Beachland. Get some bodies in the kitchen. Do SOMETHING."}
{"text":"As a music venue, Beachland is excellent. It's just that right size where it feels intimate, but not small. The sound is good, and the adjacent bar is well stocked. The only thing that annoys me is for quieter concerts, people still throw their glass bottles into trash cans right next to the stage, making a huge clatter. Even the artists notice. Still, this place actually has quieter bands, unlike say the Grog Shop.  The food is also very good. The Pizza Bread is perfect bar food. Many people have raved about brunch at the tavern. We finally went, and it was decent. The Breakfast Burrito was excellent, as were the Bloody Marys.   Sometimes the Tavern and Ballroom have different shows with different tickets. Other nights, you can walk in and out of the Tavern without a problem. In that case, the Tavern bar has a lot more beers on draft, and faster service."}
{"text":"The Tavern is kind of a dive but the people that work there are nice.  Not much draft selection."}
{"text":"The fried chicken biscuit sandwich was the best thing ordered here. I think it was the 6th entree ordered for a table of 4, but we were hungry and some of us were hungover. The other stuff was ohhkay. The pricing is pretty good, but the portions are on the smaller side."}
{"text":"I dislike the fact that I have to give this place 3 stars because it's one of my favorite music venues in all the lands. I'm doing this however, based on an experience I had Friday night at the boombox show, and have had once or twice there before. My issue is with the bar. It's in a separate room, it's small, it's understaffed. At one point I waited, along with many others, over 30 mins (not an over exaggeration) to get a beer and shot. I missed about 5 songs of a set I paid $25 dollars to see. This can be pretty easily rectified by staffing a few more bartenders. They should also consider putting someone in the main room with a big ass barrel of beers and a couple bottles of liquor on nights with busy shows. Just my opinion tho. :)"}
{"text":"One Star for the supposed vegan/vegetarian friendly brunch on Sunday, December 29, 2013.  Took my brother and his wife there and both ordered the tofu scramble, which turned out to be the most pathetic version I've ever seen.  It was plain, uncooked and unseasoned, tofu, chopped into bits and served with some slices of un- or undercooked bell pepper.  Seriously, that was it.  Re-read that, because I am not exaggerating-- that was what was served on the plate.  My brother had a few bites, then had to set it aside.  The only flavor in the dish was a slight taste of vinegar-- it was not even salted.  My sister-in-law trudged her way through most of it, but only to be polite.  Everyone in the kitchen should be embarrassed that they would even let something like that go out.  Sorry.  Cool and comfortable atmosphere, great staff, but don't advertise yourself as a vegan/veggie friendly place if you can't make a vegan/veggie meal."}
{"text":"Best music venue in Cleveland period! The boutique shop downstairs has some fun kitsch. The tavern is good for a small show. The weekend brunch is a lot of fun. The food is very hit or miss. I suggest keeping it simple. The ballroom is the best place to see a show in Cleveland. Standing only but the stage is very high. They often host rock'n roll flee markets and lots of fun stuff like that."}
{"text":"The best nightclub to see live music in Cleveland. I have been attending shows on the Cleveland concert scene for close to 40 years now and this place ranks up there with the original Agora on E.24th St.  The Ballroom hosts acts up to around 600 capacity. The tavern is for shows with less than about 100 people.   Most of my favorite bands and artists play here. Got to see the Drive-by Truckers play an impromptu midnight show in the tavern last summer. Three hours of entertainment I will never forget.   Nice choice of beers and a limited menu of tasty tavern food. Great owners and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I went to the tavern for a concern by Bass Drums of Death. The beer selection is very good with Yeungling and Brooklyn. I had the Beach land burger. What a surprise. Thick, juicy and good. The venue is a tough neighborhood, but isn't all of Cleveland? I found the people friendly and $10 for a concert a deal. They really have the best indie and local lineup."}
{"text":"Super average.  Completely don't understand all of the four and five star reviews.  The biscuits and gravy were tasteless.  Biscuits were hard and gravy was blah.  The homefries were blah.  The chicken and waffles were dissappointing.  Chicken was rubbery and waffles were like frozen waffles."}
{"text":"Great spot for a music venue. Bar food is not too bad considering how many people they cater to at one time. The bartenders are pretty good and efficient when there is a crowd. Get there just before doors open so you can get a seat at the bar while you wait for the first band to play. They have decent drink/beer specials and a good selection of beers on tap! You need to order your food at the bar, which is not too bad considering how busy they get."}
{"text":"i hadn't been here enough to feel like i could review it, so i waited it out.  but now that i've come to enough shows here, i can say:  yes.  a show at the beachland is gonna be good.   the ballroom is a great space.  has a bit of a school gym feel to it, except you wish you school would have had a conjoined bar on its side.    friendly staff.  i think i make a friend every time i go.  the tavern is a decent space, too.  really cool to see such great acts right in front of you.  drinking their beers.  jammin like it's you and your friends on a friday night.  i caught the margot  and the nuclear so and so's show last night, and was decided that i had to yelp the beachland, finally.  one good experience after another here.  an all around great place.    and the shop downstairs is one of my favs too."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much from a bar, but I ordered a small chicken tenders basket and it was surprisingly delicious! It was real pieces of chicken, the batter they used to fry it in had a great flavor, and it came out hot and fresh. The fries also tasted like real potatoes. I'm currently in my third trimester of pregnancy and the small was enough for me. Only $6.50 and it definitely hit the spot! Since I'm pregnant and can't drink I can't comment on the alcohol, but the bartender was really nice and helpful and I appreciated the lemonade she pulled from the back for me. We were there for a show, but the food was a great experience!  I didn't take a picture because it was too dark in the tavern side, but it was good!"}
{"text":"Went here for a show last night, and had a pretty good experience. Good thing I had my ID in my pocket, even though I wasn't drinking, because everyone had to show it to prove they were 21 or  they had to pay $2. The guy screamed this at us as we entered.  I was intrigued by the Tavern part of this establishment, where another show was going on, but we saw a show in the main ballroom. The opening band was crazy and not very good, so we stayed in the bar adjacent to the ballroom until about 10 minutes before showtime. This worked out fine because we didn't really care about getting a good view, and we got to sit down for awhile.  The bathroom was surprisingly clean; however, there are no locks on either of the doors. That accounts for one star I guess, especially since I had to pay multiple visits. Also, I was really lucky that the girl in front of me in line for the bathroom didn't projectile vomit all over me, because that's what she ended up doing in the stall next to me for like 5 minutes. I felt sorry for her, but...not really. When did I get to be too old to be at a show where 23-year-olds are getting wasted? It was sort of depressing.  It also got really hot, which I guess is to be expected. However, there was a gigantic fan towards the back that took care of that for me but I had to leave our spot to get to it.  The sound was very good. They made the band sound great - unless they're just the type of band that sounds better live. Either way, I enjoyed this aspect very much.  I don't know...I guess this sounds a bit lackluster. It's just that I kind of dislike going to shows in general, and I didn't really know this band too well before going. I will do a review update if I ever see one of my \"favorite bands\" there, if that ever happens. I'd say 3.5 stars for now."}
{"text":"What an interesting place int he Waterloo neighborhood. We were there for the burlesque convention. There was an art gallery a few doors down with beautiful photography of previous burlesque events. This place has a great venue for live music or parties. There is a tavern/restaurant. They also have a vintage boutique in the building. Everyone was so friendly and interesting. There was a long line to get in, but it was work the wait. if you are in the area, stop in. You never know what is happening but you can be sure it will be a great time."}
{"text":"Out of all the music venues, I tend to frequent this one the most. I like the intimate feel of the concerts, the affordable prices of the tickets and drinks. I have been here for many concerts some larger named shows and some small name shows and this place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Great show, dive bar, reasonable priced beers, good beers, no table service, but nice staff that worked their butts off during intermission to provide drinks for the crowd.  Could have used more hired help, but how do you bring in people for a 20 minutes span between shows?"}
{"text":"The Beachland is still a great go-to for live music. I can't say I've ever had a bad experience here. The shows are personal and they consistently bring in fantastic and affordable acts.  My update, though, has to do with food. The Beachland has scored itself a fantastic kitchen staff and a wonderful menu. I've had the pealafel bites (falafel made with peas), which are super spicy and delicious. The texture is crunchy and creamy on the inside and they're SO good. The seasoned popcorn is also a great treat, since popcorn is pretty much my favorite food. I always have room for popcorn.  The brunch is another fantastic story. I had the fried chicken and waffles and a bloody mary. So. Tasty. We had a large group gather here and the staff was incredibly accommodating and prepared for us. We're not generally a difficult group, but can be a little...let's just say some of us are a bit easily distracted, so wrangling everyone is a challenge that our waitress accepted with grace.  Overall, I can't stop singing the praises of this place and I can't wait for the next opportunity to return."}
{"text":"Perfect bar for a music venue. The drinks were very fairly priced at $3-4 for a tallboy (Heineken included). Definitely a dive bar atmosphere. One thing I really enjoyed was the decor. A wide range of older, trendy signs and posters that I would have loved to take home with me.  The venue is a bit smaller but in my opinion it was the perfect size. The show we went to was sold out which I thought was nice because they weren't trying to squeeze out every dollar they could by cramming way too many people into a building. The sound could have been a bit better I suppose but I love the band I saw so I knew about every word anyway.  I did not have any of the food but my friend didn't seem to be complaining about what he got, the wings I believe.  I would highly recommend this venue/tavern for anybody that wants to see a band/musician/performance they enjoy.  Drink prices: 5/5 Food: ? Atmosphere: 4/5"}
{"text":"I went there for my graduation brunch yesterday and it was amazing! They were able to seat my party of 8 with no wait and the food was phenomenal. i had a fun rendition of breakfast nachos, and the rest of my family enjoyed chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy, and burgers. Our waitress was very good as well and never left s coffee cup empty! Will be going back soon"}
{"text":"I was here last night to see Pete McDonald's band. I say I was there to see his band because I know the bassist so that was the draw. However, I left a fan. They totally upstaged the headliner and I would be back to see Pete McDonald and co. anytime.   Anyways, it was another phenom experience at the Beachland, complete with shopping in the basement. My gentleman caller picked up a few items by the Waitresses including a little cute pin that I had better see him wear."}
{"text":"The Beachland draws the biggest variety of acts in Cleveland. Everything from bluegrass, jazz, experimental music, rockabilly, dance, pop, blues, psychadelic rock, folk, rock, and I think Mastodon even played a show there.  Theres always a few other events going on like breakfast, and the infamous Dr. Sketchy's Anti-Art School.  The bar is decent, and loaded with lots of Cleveland schwag. More character than quality, but hey, they got woodchuck.  One particular thing about the Tavern in general is how the artists actually just chat with concert-goers way more than at say The Grog Shop."}
{"text":"Cutting edge venue that all the big names pay tribute to. Hips me to new great bands, Saw Deer hunter, Run boy run, Bro Dylan and Ohio Weatherband there and listen to them daily. Positive uplifting place and great food too. Vegan fryer make me so amazingly happy  (Pumice oil) I love Jenn, She is the best cook/server anywhere and brings the best food with a quickness!"}
{"text":"Visiting from philly and this place made me feel #hometownclevelandpride. The diviest dive bar ive ever been to. Had mayor mimosa and biscuits and gravy!  Delicious! Loved the vibe, the back to the present future vibe. Either take it or leave it vibe.  Love it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best place (along with the Grog Shop) to see music in Cleveland.  It's an old Croatian hall, so the main Ballroom is beautiful, if a little dated.  The tavern is a bit more cozy, but that's also where you can order food and sit at the bar and still see the show.  Drinks here are pretty cheap, and when shows aren't sold out the ballroom is great to see national acts."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in town for live music. ( The Grog Shop a very close second) The Tavern is the smaller of the two rooms for shows, it's tiny and you'd be hard pressed to find a bad vantage point in there. The entire staff (owners included) are some of the nicest people around. Books a huge range of acts and the Mark and Lawrence dj nights will make you weep over your own record collection. Decent beer selection, although the taps are lacking...the bartenders pour a heavy shot and the food is pretty decent now that the Grovewood Tavern took over the kitchen. Neighborhood is sketchy- but if you get there early enough you can park in the lot behind the venue. Do not park at the bank next door. It is not safe. Visit \"This Way Out\" The vintage clothing shop downstairs for some fabulous finds a la Pete, Dave, and Debbie."}
{"text":"Purely from a concert-goer perspective, this place is a great venue for shows. The people who work at the bar are pretty friendly and the music choices are generally pretty good. The food isn't that great, but it's a bar and music venue... what do you expect?"}
{"text":"As venues go it is okay but nothing much but they do get some great talent to play in this place.  Ballroom is more of a oxymoron than what you would expect because it is seriously small. You really don't come here for the ambience you will come to hear some great music! There is WAY too much talking while the band's are playing....why pay to see a band when all your going to do is talk! Relax and enjoy the show!"}
{"text":"The Beachland is exactly the kind of venue that Cleveland needs.  Cool shows, cool employees and a cool bar in a cool location.  The place was originally built as the local Croatian home, so the \"Tavern\" is the old bar and the \"Ballroom\" was the event hall.  The stages, therefore, are not exactly purpose-built rock venue stages, more like a platform in the back of the room and a theater stage from a middle-school gym, respectively.  I've never had any complaints about the sound in either venue, though, and both have a great ambiance and local flavor.  The drinks are reasonably priced, especially for a music venue, and the Tavern is as cool a bar as you'll find to hang out in on the East Side, live-music-or-not.  The whole place kind of oozes authenticity that makes me wish I could come back to Cleveland for ten or twenty more shows a year.  If this place was located in Chicago, it would rank among my top five venues.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place whether one of your favorite bands is playing here or if you're just looking for a place to hang out for the night and hear some live music or a DJ.  It seems like there's always something going on here and the entire Waterloo Arts District is cool as hell, so, also worth checking out.  Three thumbs up."}
{"text":"I have been to the Beachland a number of times.  This is about BRUNCH.  Sunday brunch at the Beachland kicks some serious cheek.  Mmmm.  What a treat.    Its still chill as the Beachland, quite moderately priced, and set up in the Tavern.  Good beachland drinks, friendly staff.  The food is AWESOME.  The homefries are just right.  Right now I can't remember what I ate (I was there like a month ago and just thinking about it) so I will go back and give you more.  If your browsing this page looking for SUNDAY BRUNCH, just get in your car and go.  Just do it.  Stop wasting your time. Go.  Come on.  You can do it.  Its not as far away as it seems."}
{"text":"I have given a previous 4 stars rating, not b/c I don't like the Beachland, but b/c I get annoyed by hot sweaty places.  When you see a 'big' show in the ballroom, that is what you get.  However, seeing a smaller show in the tavern is a bit of a different experience.  It's great for chill local bands b/c you can have a seat and enjoy yourself.   I also enjoyed shopping in the vintage store, however I found the clothing items to be pretty ugly."}
{"text":"The anchor of the Waterloo Arts District. Cindy does a tremendous job of bringing great acts to the area. Quite frequently kids are lined up starting at 9am in all kinds of weather waiting to see their favorite artists. Great staff, great music, great food. A real diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Great place but one bad experience with the red head bartender ruins everything.   Spills my drink and still charges me full price and disappears with the tip.  Really. Classless. Ruined an otherwise good night."}
{"text":"The Beachland is an institution here in Cleveland. Tons of bands, both local and from all over the country, perform there nearly nightly and the place has a history that is as grand as its name. I've been to live shows there for years, but this review is not just about the ambiance and the great music...it's about the food.   A while back, my wife and I were introduced to an amazing, hidden element to the Beachland, the fact that they do an amazing Brunch, as well as have really great food nightly. Their menu includes an eggs Benedict with Gruyere and home made home fries, chicken and waffles with home made syrup, and a breakfast sandwich (chicken, in this case,) with a home made mustard and even home made pickles. The chefs here take their food seriously, just like the Beachland takes its music, and it is a truly great experience.   Add to that the great staff, who are really nice, helpful folks, and the fact that great food is a short walk to great music, and you have a recipe for a good time. They also have a full bar, and the environment is very casual, which makes it all that much better. I'm a fan, and I think this place, despite the fact that this club's a little out of the way, it's worth searching for; treasure always is:)"}
{"text":"Sunday Lenten brunch. delicious.  I have retired from sordid niteclub elements. The Beachland Tavern and Ballroom may be fairly well known for glam boys, punx, heshers, and other garden variety nihilists however I wanted to hug everyone. I was motivated to break out my Tom Petty Full Moon Fever tour tee for the excitement. Cleveland - I am ready for some brunch and roll.  I had solo brunch and Jesus was smiling because I was immediately seated by the proprietor and served green tea. My waitress was perfect, her name is Barb. I ordered buckwheat pancakes, fresh fruit, hash browns, and vegetable du jour. Everything was brought out timely and delicious. I was tempted to have a Bloody Mary Sunday. however last time, I woke up in the sandpit of my neighbor's swing set with small bruises, presumably from the hands of children.    I wanted to request a platter of Roxy Music Avalon, I was in that great of a mood. The brunch tavern was loud and crowded. I could tell conversations were lively and spirited on a brisk February afternoon."}
{"text":"Atmosphere left a bit to be desired--there are divey places, and then there are places that replace ceiling tiles with cookie sheets.  Food (brunch) was just fine--fried chicken and waffles were good, but the chicken isn't chick fil a. Staff was very friendly and courteous. Value was decent. A little disappointed they didn't have a jazz band or musician given that they've got a stage."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the ballroom. I have been here multiple times for shows and it's always a good time. It has a very intimate feel to it, almost like I'm in someones oversize living room. The staff is super friendly and efficient. I just wish the stage was a little higher somehow -- it can be very difficult to see sometimes."}
{"text":"This is for the Sunday brunch. Beachland as a concert venue is a whole different story!  I came here with friends for their Sunday brunch, thanks to an awesome groupon. When we arrived, there was a lot of hustle and bustle with lots of diverse patrons. I've been to the tavern for a few concerts, and it looks totally different during the day! It's so divey that it's endearing. The brunch specials looked delicious. I had the biscuit & grits (with the sausage gravy - it's so good if you eat it with the grits!) Friends got the eggs beachland, buckwheat pancakes, and smoked salmon and latkes. The guy who got eggs beachland loved it! The smoked salmon and latkes looked really good, but it was a little on the blander side (which is ok for breakfast, I guess.) The buckwheat pancakes were GOOD.   I liked the biscuit and grits, it was just really heavy for the morning--a little too much on the salty/creamy side. We had a new waitress so service was slow, but we wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt.  I liked it and would probably go back to try the chicken & waffles!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite to see (bands) and hear music in Cleveland.  Built in what appears to be an old Solvenian meeting house, the Beachland is spare with a stage and large space for general admission audience.  There is no fancy balcony or anything like that.  The Tavern to the side has a decent selection of beer (including 20+oz Pabst) at good prices.  There is some food (including PB&J), pinball, and free jukeboxes (for when the band is not playing)."}
{"text":"wow. This is like going back in time to an era when ballrooms were spacious with real springy wooden floors and the dancers were everywhere. There are two bars here - a smaller one in front and a larger one in back. The food is incredible. The drinks are super strong and cheap and the staff is hip without being conceited. They have an AWESOME vintage store downstairs from the bar with amazing vinyl and great clothes and accessories -- very affordable. I love playing this place. its like stepping back in time."}
{"text":"Huge props to the Beachland for what they do for Cleveland. They pulled off yet another great Lottery League with what seemed like ease. Everything was highly organized.   We're truly lucky to have such a great venue in Cleveland (and for Collinwood/Waterloo in general). I'm lucky to live less than a 10 minute drive away.  Also worth noting: they have the best beer selection for any music venue in Cleveland. Hands down. The HOB - in all of their chain glory - should be ashamed at that one."}
{"text":"The 1st time we went to the Beachland Ballroom and Tavern was to see Bobby Keys, saxophonist, sometimes for the Rolling Stones. He was amazing. The burgers at the Beachland Ballroom are good. There didn't seem to be enough seating to watch concerts/live music and mostly standing room. There doesn't seem to be working air-conditioning.  The restroom is small and not enough stalls. The Vintage store in the basement is interesting. We had brunch next door we had sandwiches and shared gourmet mac-n-cheese."}
{"text":"Went to see a friend's band play Sunday night.  Wasn't thrilled with the location (or the female junkie who almost accosted me and another car as we were trying to pull away, for money!)  It is not in the downtown area, but in the seedier but soon to be up and coming outskirts.  Surprisingly-this little dive has GREAT bar food!  I order the fish tacos and they were fresh, hot, and awesome!  Very friendly attentive bar service (then again, I AM a chick, LOL)  Nice size venue, standing room with a few tables off to the side.  Good acoustics.  Plenty of parking. Yeah, I'd go back!"}
{"text":"We went to brunch this past weekend and had a great experience. We brought our 9 year and 1 month old with us. Also, my senior aged parents met us there. My father who is a vegetarian was pleased with his menu options for him. My 9 year old was pleased with his pancakes. I had the potato latkes and they were tasty! I got to try the chicken and waffles too and they were awesome! It was a fun atmosphere and liked the music playing. (Also with children, they can make noise and the music drowns out the kids being noisy). My only complaint was my Bloody Mary was extremely spicy... I think I got my fiancés instead on accident! But after a few sips I was ok with it. Great service and great food and great prices!!!"}
{"text":"Small venue, relatively clean, nice character (Ballroom). The floor goes right up to the stage for a very intimate experience. I was impressed that they had three different kinds of cider (my beverage of choice) including Crispin and Strongbow. Score! Beverage prices were quite reasonable for this type of venue/bar. The men's bathroom was very tiny although lines were surprisingly not bad. This was my first time at this venue and I have to say, I would take this over the House of Blues (the last place I saw this band) any minute, any hour, any day of the week. Easy to drive to, less than five minutes off the highway, free street parking. I would definitely come here again for another show."}
{"text":"My favorite music venue. You can hear great music for very reasonable price. The bar is a more quaint setting. Many different genres represented as well. My only improvement would be to make sure chairs are available in the ballroom for those of us who have difficulty standing for 4-5 hours."}
{"text":"Tribute to the Roxy.....Thank you, Beachland, for bringing incredible talant to Cleveland!   Miss Peggy de Lune is amazing! Please more shows like this!!!!!"}
{"text":"If only there were more places like the Beachland.  I don't know how they do it, but they get some really great, somewhat obscure, bands here. I've seen some great shows in both the tavern and ballroom. The beer selection rocks. If you're lucky, you can catch the band in the bar area of the ballroom after the show.  Ahh, memories of bottoming out all the way to Tremont with The English Beat and a couple friends in my VW Beetle in 2003.  I love you, Beachland!"}
{"text":"ok the breakfast, i forget what i got, but it was good, pretty delish. why did i forget what i got you might ask? well because... the kicker here really was the drink. i got something off the coffee drink list, and about five sips in, was like woah, i am really feeling it here. i ask the waitress, what's in this?! she says, oh, it's just baileys and vodka. what the $%!@???? you could have warned me i'm just drinking straight up liquor for breakfast! no complaints, it was fantastic. i did have to drive home though so i asked her to add some actual COFFEE into my COFFEE DRINK. hahaha :D will be back soon.. so amazing."}
{"text":"Give me a Stella, and a couple of cute rockers and I am pleased. I saw Okkervil River and the New Pornographers last night. I love both stages here, but was grateful we were in the ballroom. I have not been to the ballroom in years and I fell in love with the old-fashioned feel and the stage lighting.  I felt like I was watching a band at my elementary school's multipurpose room that had a stage with about the same lighting. Perfection."}
{"text":"Bryce and Mia are amazing!  Food was wonderful!  Great service and bright personalities!"}
{"text":"Trish was amazing on point. Thank you. Cindy owner was really nice.   Hostess Lucy was awesome.   Food was great one of the best brunches in town."}
{"text":"Beachland is pretty sweet for being in Cleveland (haha). I like that it is in the Croatian neighborhood and surrounded by sausage makers and suchlike, and that it is almost like being in a legion hall.   We went to see Roky Erickson here (omg omg omg) last night, so we were waiting around for doors in the smaller bar to the right when you walk in. One thing I noticed immediately that I thought I would like but that actually made me slightly uneasy and made me realise how Midwestern I've become is how beat-up Cleveland people seemed - it's a for-real industrial working class affect here, one that I grew up with in New England and am by no means insulting, but one which is much less polite than the farming mentality that you find in central Ohio. I was bumped into and shoved aside countless times without so much as an excuse me, which was disconcerting, and reminded me of why I had such social anxiety as a teen growing up on the East Coast. But anyway. People, not so much Venue, yes. The first bar was okay. But then doors opened at 8, and we got to hang out in the main stage/bar area, which was way better.   The bar near the main stage is great - it's kitchier, cooler, and the bartenders are more rock n roll. It got crowded as it got later (Roky Erickson!!!), and many Columbus people showed up too, which was nice. The service was very good for being so busy with so many out of towners. The main stage area is really cool, too, if you can imagine like a VFW hall or something, that's basically what this is like. It's big and open with a large but not huge stage and very good sound. Great experience, just crowded enough to be crowded, etc. There is also a decent merch store downstairs. I got a Beachland shirt because I wanted a shirt that says Cleveland on it, but it was fairly expensive (18 bucks), and I wouldn't normally do this. Good experience, I'd like to see more shows here but I'm not such a fan of the Cleveland 'tude."}
{"text":"The Tavern has limited seating. The bar seating gives a good view of the stage. The bands are local and national(Chicago and Nashville were there) There is room to dance or just move around(my style).  The Staff are very friendly. The menu has a variety of food made fresh. Check out the This way out area for Vinyl records and clothes."}
{"text":"A cool place to see a rock concert. It's very possible to be close to the stage, and there's a separate club for smaller acts. Not to mention the cool bar and that there's a sweet music store a couple doors down (Music Saves)."}
{"text":"We were so excited to come to the Rock 'n Roll brunch this morning. The music was great but the service was blah at best. My husband ordered eggs, bacon, sausage and toast and waited 30 minutes after the rest of us got our food. The waitress didn't seem to offer much apology beyond her removing the charge from our bill. We'll try again another time but today was a bit of a let down."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing live music venue ! Get there early as seating is general admittance sooo first come first served ( but to be honest its a small venue so there really isnt a bad seat in the house),Drinks are decently priced and the bartenders are friendly and fairly quick.We havent tried the food yet but are looking forward to it ;)"}
{"text":"I moved to Cleveland after living on the west coast my entire life and can honestly say that the Beachland kept me sane during my 2 year stay here in Ohio.  The music, the vibe, the HEART, of this place!  Wow. It's truly a gem.  I made friends with people who worked there, all super friendly, wonderful people and had a great time every show I went to.  I will miss this place and wish it and all the people who support it the absolute best.  Music is truly medicine and we all need more of it!  The food is AMAZING too!  Love you Beachland.  Thanks for getting me out of my house during the winter, to dance and smile with a bunch of strangers.  You hold a very special place in my heart!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!!!!!!!! Saw Pete Yorn here the other night. Tavern has a huge selection of beers and awesome burgers!!"}
{"text":"The ballroom, tavern, and This Way Out are always stops for me when I visit home.  The neighborhood is sketch, but...eh.  Don't go to the ATM alone.  Try not to park too far down the side streets.  Better still, take a cab because they'll drop you right in front and you're going to get tanked inside.  The tavern is *perfect* for small, local acts, and the ballroom is almost perfect for larger acts, and for Barack Obama's campaign to roll through the night before the primary.  I've even been to a wedding reception there. Decent food, Sunday brunch, cheap booze, friendly (if you're friendly) staff... *sniff*  I miss you so."}
{"text":"It was my first time going last night to see Xavier Rudd & the United Nations.  Wonderful  concert btw. Anywho, we tried to eat at the bar before the show. *sigh*  There was three of us - me, my husband and my friend. My husband and I ordered first (Cheesesteak wraps) and then my friend (fish tacos). My friend's food came out first. It took about, at most, 10 minutes. With that being said, after checking in 3 times with our server, my husband I finally got our food, mind you just the wrap because dare us pay $9.50 for a [small] sandwich and not receive at least one chip, about 45 minutes later. Our server comped us for the issue but that was only after trying to appease us with free beverages.  Apparently they're working with a new ordering system (good job apple). That may be true but it's mighty funny that everyone else who ordered food around us received their order in a timely manner and it took 45 minutes for ours. Yes we tipped our server but next time I may be a bit more timid about ordering food. PS. I thought the wrap was good but my husband felt that he could have gotten the same thing for a lot less elsewhere."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was when Yo La Tengo came to perform.  I stood 10 feet from the stage, and was hazy in love with the music.  Other memorable performances include a shamefully underpromoted Metric concert (underpromotion thanks to its crappy sponsor, Jack Daniels, it didn't seem to be Beachland's fault), Josh Ritter, Andrew Bird, Hold Steady, Hem, Daedelus, gosh so many others that I can't remember...  The Good: The stage is well-placed.  I don't think there's a bad view most anywhere in this venue.  Staff and clientele are chill.  The burger and the spiced fries here are quite good.  Especially with a cold PBR.  The Bad:  Area is sketchy.  I'm ok with that, though.  If it comes down to Grog Shop vs. Beachland, I'll take Beachland.  It's bigger, and the stage is higher up."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch and I was blown away.  The biscuits are the best I have ever had.  There were 5 of us who went around 1 and had no problem getting a table.  The menu is extremely vegan/ vegetarian friendly, plus I love that they serve local food.  One of the best brunches I've had in my life."}
{"text":"Beachland is awesome for a concert or a burlesque show! I've been here several times and I've always enjoyed my experience especially so now that the road out front is finished! I've never had a problem finding close by parking on the street and staff has always been pleasant when I call in to order tickets for a show (cheaper than buying online). I have not been here for brunch, so I can't really speak too much on the bar food, but the bartenders are great! Last night my friends and I chatted with Mike and he introduced up to this delicious beer called Shiner Holiday Cheer mmm.   Anyways, even though this place isn't sparkly brand new, it has tons of character and history! I definitely suggest checking out a show here!"}
{"text":"My friends and I arrived here right before brunch began, so we were in a queue of about 12 parties. They transform their Tavern into a surprisingly cozy dining room with country kitchen table cloths and diner-class mugs. As expected, service was a little slow as they triage the rush of eager brunch goers. Our server, John was nevertheless warm and diligent with refilling drinks, checking in and joking with us.  I like their coffee very much. It's smooth and easy to drink. I had their Beachland Eggs Benedict with poached eggs and Canadian bacon over a biscuit and a gruyere cheese sauce. It was tasty and sophisticated. My friends ordered their chiliquiles and tofu scramble. What I enjoy most about brunch here is so many of their options are available in making your meal vegetarian, vegan or gluten free. It's a very safe place to dine in this regard. Their chiliquiles were slightly dry, but had nice flavor with heat, but not too spicy. The beans added texture and flavor that's often overlooked in vegetarian dishes. The tofu scramble was saucy and hearty. Their home fries are crispy and delicious, too.  I really enjoy the hi-low interplay at brunch here. It's a converted tavern with a diner feel, but the food is made with local ingredients, has slight edge but not pretentious and the staff is incredibly nice. I'd very much like to brunch here again."}
{"text":"Very solid brunch. One of the better bloody marys I've ever had (by the pitcher!). Nice smoky flavor to it."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing, The veggies and kale salad is great .. chicken fingers amazing... Drinking selection is good as well as the staff is pretty cool. The shows are good as well... make sure you check out brunch on sundays."}
{"text":"Best Sunday Brunch in the CLE.  Period.  If you are looking to spend $30 or more, be surrounded by pretentious people with classical music playing to set the mood, this is NOT for you.  This place exudes CLE culture at its Sunday Brunch.  Hours are 10 AM - 2 PM.  Highest price menu item is $12.  People attending range from people wearing their Sunday best, people with families and small children to people trying to work off the hangover from the night before.  Add a DJ spinning classic vinyl (OK, it is a bit loud) and you get the picture.  Great menu including pancakes, omelets, latkas, muffin sandwiches and the absolute best chicken and waffles you will find in the area.  And most, including the chicken and waffles, can be prepared gluten free.  Then there is the drink menu.  There is a long list of items on the drink menu that should appeal to most tastes, starting with an absolutely wonderful Bloody Mary.  You can add bacon strips to it for $2 - everything IS better with bacon, after all.  Then there is Summer in A Glass.  Forget about having a Mimosa, this tops it.  You can order the drinks by the pitcher as well.   Yes, the table cloths look like something that your grandmother threw out (because they had holes in them).  Yes, there is tape patching the vinyl on the chairs.  It ads to the charm.  Service is wonderful and very friendly.  This is a HIDDEN GEM.  Reservations are available.  I recommend making them, although if you get there before noon, getting a seat doesn't seem to be an issue."}
{"text":"My home away from home. Best place to see a show in the 216!  Douche bag free zone for the most part. No chairs. Stand and dance, good grub and self serve water. A must, for any show where  you have to shake your ass! In my humble opinion one of the best concert venues in the US of A.  Wow, I still run into people and they never heard of the Beachland Ballroom. I am so baffled. Unless you have lived your whole life in Mentor, this is an inexcusable atrocity or testament to supreme lameness. WOW there goes my zen!   I like it man , it feels good I love it!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great, just as good as the grog shop. I would say they're about the same in my book. I've never had a bad time at either one."}
{"text":"Every major American city needs a divey bar that's large enough to hold great national acts.  Cleveland gets the Beachland and they should feel truly lucky.  Rock clubs need multiple bars and cheap drinks. They need great sound and competent staff. Ideally they also have a place to get away for a second if the band starts playing a song you don't like, or if the people next to you start making out to a song about suicide and if you don't walk away someone might say something inappropriate and rude. Beachland checks off all these boxes.  I docked a star since parking is no fun and the location is just out of the way enough to be annoying (there should be a hotel within walking distance of the venue, then things would be perfect.) But don't let these triffles stop you from enjoying one of the great concert experiences out there."}
{"text":"My 16 yo daughter and I had brunch here today.  Great vibe, music and food.  Service was very good as well.  Price acceptable for the experience."}
{"text":"Yay! Beachland Rules. Great shows, sometimes 2 in a night (one in the ballroom, one in the tavern) and shopping in the basement.  Perfection!"}
{"text":"I love live music, and the Beachland Ballroom is the best place to see a concert in Cleveland. If an band you know has a gig there, by all means GO.  This place used to be a Croatian hall. Since it became the Beachland Ballroom, the décor probably hasn't changed. But that's not a bad thing - the artwork on the walls has a genuine retro feel.  The tickets are really quite inexpensive! The most I've paid to see a show there is 20 or 25. But that's for bands that could easily pack the House of Blues for $10 more a ticket.  Pay attention to where the concert you're considering is. The ballroom is larger, probably about 50 feet x 50 feet that looks up to a stage. There's a bar in a room along the right wall as you look at the stage, and the selection and the prices are the best that you'll find at any venue in town. I've also never had to wait longer than a couple minutes to get served.  The Tavern also features shows. This is just like seeing a show in a bar, but the Beachland Ballroom and Tavern has been able to attract some pretty big names, even in the Tavern. The Tavern also has seating and tables so you can sit comfortably while enjoying the show.  Beachland also offers food, although they don't offer it for shows in the Ballroom.  I've never had any so I can't rate it one way or another.  Parking can be an issue, especially when bigger acts come to town. They have a small lot but that fills up pretty quickly.  Street parking around the area is okay but the neighborhood isn't really safe - I'd advise parking on Waterloo which is well-lit.  Peruse their calendar for upcoming shows that you might like to see. Go, and you'll be glad you did.  http://www.beachlandballroom.com/calendar.asp"}
{"text":"Don't be a fool.  If you don't ever visit the Beachland for brunch, your life will lack meaning and purpose.  Probably not, but you will be missing out on something great, that's for sure.  While I do enjoy this place from time to time as a concert venue, I'm here to talk about the Sunday brunch.  Simply put, it's freaking awesome!  This is now a top brunch spot for me and, as a West-sider, it's worth picking up my passport and heading east.  On the plus side, it's also a paradise for gluten free diners.  If you got celiac, consider this a must-visit brunch spot.  Upon first entering the tavern area, you are greeted by the usual Cleveland dive-bar appearance: wood paneling, an outdated look overall, band posters, etc...  Only now, the place is buzzing with tables eating great looking food of solid portions.  You'll notice right away that this is East-side hipster, but with a diverse secondary crowd.  What's that mean?  It means you'll see less mustachios and beards, but a lot of 80's rock and punk influenced folks.  This even shines through in the music selection (which is great).  But there were aslo a few stereotypical moms and pops and grandparents.  The environment was actually quite fun and inclusive.    I sat down with my friends who had already arrived.  Our server, Nadine, greeted me right away with a water in hand.  She passed me a menu and I was amazed that every form of drink they offer comes in a pitcher.  You want a pitcher of mimosas? Done.  You want a pitcher of a bloody marry? Done.  You want a pitcher of some sort of cocktail? Done.  That was awesome!  Now, I'm sober skipper for the moment, so I just got a coffee and I asked for a pitcher of soda water.  She brought me a whole pitcher with a large straw and a ton of sliced limes on the side, along with a cup.  I liked having the option to pour the stuff or drink straight from the pitcher (I opted for the latter, of course).  The menu itself begins with a very lofty statement that they make everything from sustainable, local, fresh, and from-scratch ingredients where possible.  While lofty, they seem to execute this goal quite well in terms of the menu items listed.  They even make their own HFCS-fee ketchup.  Not only did they have fresh-baked breads, home-made waffles and pancakes, and fresh food galore, they had gluten-free options for most everything.  They even had vegan and vegetarian options for half the menu.  Now, my dietary restrictions unfortunately have me avoiding any and all grains or grain-like foods and sweeteners of all kinds.  It sucks and it's really hard to eat-out right now.  But score! Nadine handled it like a pro, as did the kitchen.  I told her what I couldn't have in my diet and she took care of me without flinching.  I would say this is the most accommodating I've ever felt given my current dietary issues.  The menu asks that you not make substitutions, but they take care of us folks who can't eat like normal humans!  I ordered the duck egg French-style omelette with a heaping pile of bacon and a double side-salad with lemon and olive oil dressing.  Bacon is always good and they didn't burn it.  The duck eggs were cooked perfectly and wonderfully rich--these things tasted fresh from the farm.  Salad is salad, but it was a nice mix of incredibly fresh greens for sure.  I wanted the sausage, which has no fillers and usually no sweeteners, but Nadine was careful and checked--maple in the grind kicked that option to the curb for me.  I'm very glad she looked out for me.    My friends had breakfast sandwiches with regular and gluten free bread.  I couldn't tell the difference between the two breads by appearance.  These guys are getting great bread!  Not the super dense GF supermarket bread.  If you are eating GF, you can get something that, as I'm told by my friends, offers a bakery-quality that you just don't get most places.  This leads me to believe that the waffles and the pancakes are equally good for GF eaters.  The sandwiches themselves make me jealous.  The poached eggs looked skillfully made and the overall quality of the meat and veggies seemed great.  It was as if they unloaded a farm delivery truck that morning.  In scanning the restaurant, everyone's food looked great.  I need to touch upon the service a little more.  My friend spilled a bit of cocktail out of the pitcher.  Nadine came by within a minute to pour a fresh cup of the cocktail back into the pitcher to make up for the loss!  We actually never had to ask for a thing.  Someone was at our table with coffee refills before we had to ask--the same goes for water.  This, combined with everyone's incredible willingness to handle my stupid dietary issues to an expert degree, I have to say that I had a 5-star experience in a dive-joint.  The food, the service, and the diverse crowd makes this a must-visit Cleveland brunch spot."}
{"text":"Oh Beachland, you never let me down. Service was great. I'm the type of person that likes to get to the point. Meaning, take my order, bring the food and drinks and try not to hover.  I just like to be able to carry a conversation without having to stop constantly. This place let's me do that.  Their food is fantastic. I LOVE their biscuits and gravy with the sausage gravy and home fries.  It's a lot of food, I'm usually unable to finish it. However, today I was able too. Lol! The atmosphere is bar like. The music is a bit too loud, but at least it's good music.  The staff is always friendly and happy. We'll most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Never ate here, but have seen a couple shows here.  Great place to see a band.    PBR  24oz cans!"}
{"text":"Best Sunday brunch in Cleveland hands down. The food here is really good. The Beachland has a nice setting for bands to come in and Jam out at night with an attached lounge area. By day on the weekends the lounge turns into a little restaurant that features local farm food. My wife and I always stop in when we're on the area and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"What a terrific venue! I enjoy the intimate reasonably price concerts so much!  I use a wheelchair to get around, so I was concerned about how accessible the old buildind would be. I called ahead and the staff was terrific: they put cones out to save a parking spot JUST for me, they gave me very specific instructions of the venue layout, and they even let me in the side door a little early. the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the bathroom stall was not big enough for me to get my chair in; the room it's self was plenty big enough to extend one of the stalls to allow a wheelchair to fit. Other than the bathroom not being accessible, this venue is a treasure."}
{"text":"Best music venue in the city for the size, and well everything else.  The set up with the ballroom and tavern next door is perfect. No frills, but some of the best bookings that come into Cleveland come through this venue.  Easy to get to and park.  Cool vibe.  Do I have to drag you from your warm houses to see the greatest small club bands of our era!?!  Well do I?  They have great food for a good value at the tavern.    \"Let's face it. Rock and Roll is bigger than all of us.\" - Freed   \"Come on out ya cheap bastards.\" - me"}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.  If you happen to know the owner or have a conflict of interest, please don't review."}
{"text":"Open for over 10 years now, the Beachland Ballroom & Tavern is so much more than just a hipster's paradise. It's become an iconic place of sorts. One that appropriately characterizes the surrounding North Collinwood neighborhood. The Beachland has become THE place to check out the latest hip indie band while also moonlighting as one of the best places to find mass gatherings of skinny jeans with kids swilling tallboy cans of PBR. But don't let all those hipster traits fool you. This is a place with a lot of soul.   The two-part venue survives mainly on music with larger shows playing in the Ballroom and more intimate acts relegated to the Tavern. The beer menu is as extensive as they come and the food offered is appropriate and reasonably priced. On Sunday's, they offer a brunch between the hours of 11am and 3pm.  What makes this place better than the other venues such as the HOB? It's less corporate, less expensive and more intimate with a much more sense of community. If there was a show to be played, the Tavern is my venue of choice."}
{"text":"This is probably my single favorite place to see a show in the diaspora of Cleveland. Built in 1950 as the Croatian Liberty Home, it was converted to a place for rock shows around 10 years ago. Some of my favorite memories of live events, from a recent packed Jonathan Richman show to a sparsely attended Camper Van Beethoven one, are located within these walls. Apparently they do a pretty bitchin' Sunday brunch as well, but I've never been, mainly because the time of week I least have my shit together is Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch and we were all blown away by the food.  I ordered the house made veggie burger on a biscuit with a side of their mushroom gravy.  It came with a side of home fries.  It's not an exaggeration to say that it was one of my favorite brunch items that I've ordered anywhere.  The husband had the chile quilles which he loved.  Someone else had the biscuits and gravy and I can't remember what the fourth person had.  Honestly, this would be a 5 star review if the service was better.  I'm fairly ambivalent about service.  I enjoy it when it's good, but don't really care much if it's not.  As long as the food is good and there is booze at my table, I'm happy.  However, our server was not very heads up and barely ever looked at our table to see if we needed anything.  I understand being in the weeds, but we tried on several occasions to get our servers attention, to no avail.  The water not being filled was irritating, but not that big of a deal.  The big problem was the booze.  It's brunch and my family tends to drink like fish when we are together.  We had to get our booze from the bar after the first round due to the fact that our server ignored us.  We still tipped well (20+%) because the server was so in the weeds.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went to the ballroom to see Yob on Halloween. This is a great place to see a band!!! The bar was cool with some older saloon related decor."}
{"text":"Updating my 5 star review for the Beachland Brunch and as a club itself.  They just had the Sonics play an aniversary show here and that alone was worth 5 stars.  And as far a brunch goes I know it no easy feat to give up half of every Sunday to wait on people who dress like they were on the show Blossom and whine about the dietary restrictions they put ON THEMSELVES.  If you look at the low-star reviews its from vegans and Morrisey fans..I would be miserable too.  Dont take it out on the employees that you suck.  These people work hard and people who have never worked in the industry should realize you cant have your ass kissed all the time, sweetheart.  In this day and age when every little mousy, college kid had some crazy dietary limit its hard and daunting to be a server.  But the food and drinks here are solid and I always have a great time and leave buzzed and full.  Try the scrapple.."}
{"text":"Came for the 2011 Deep Blues Fest at the ballroom and had a blast.  One of the best smaller music venues I've been to, and this isn't even taking into consideration their tendency to feature indie gems and up-and-coming artists off the beaten path.  Good acoustics, small enough for an intimate show but big enough to fit 100 with room to dance, bar with decent food and good beer selection, dive-y, gritty but super chill atmosphere, free parking in their small-midsize lot, strong ventilation/AC, fairly clean bathrooms, and even a coinslot breathalizer machine: remember kids, buzzed driving is drunk driving!  Not sure if it was particular to the festival: the crowd was eclectic but enthusiastic, consisting of older folks, ordinary folks, and a surprisingly low number of obvious hipsters.  Score!  Not sure if this was also particular to the fest, but there were even small tables and chairs set up in half the ballroom so that we could sit down if we wanted during the show (which we did because THAT never happens.  Winning!).  Had an order of fries with their garlic aoli, chipotle and curry sauces--all of which were pretty tasty!  Only hitches encountered:  A) Disruptive, wildcard old gent in the audience who was rocking out a little too hard for his own good and kept stumbling out of his chair, knocking over empty bottles, running into people and rolling on the floor.  It was obvious he was a little unstable when he began dry humping one of the speakers.  Strangely, nobody attempted to kick him out or sit him down, so I'm guessing he might be a tolerated regular.   B) AC was blasting on high the whole time over the seated area so we were freezing our balls off after fifteen minutes of sitting down.  Beer helped, but not that much--believe me, I tried.  So tip: bring a light sweater or something to cover up if you're going to be there for a while.  It gets chilly fast!  C) Slightly creepy amateurish murals/artwork of eastern European bucolic scenes staring down at you from the ballroom walls.  Probably less creepy in the daytime when the room isn't so dim.  All in all, the Beachland Ballroom's a great venue for a more intimate show.  Can't wait to go back when another awesome act rolls into town!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch on a steamy Sunday afternoon. There was a really eclectic crowd noshing on delicious looking breakfast and brunch food. Hipsters. Bikers. Families. Old people. I was impressed to see so many different kinds of people hanging out.  I'd made the trek to brunch to try out one of the many vegan options. I got a vegan scramble which consisted of tofu, greens, tomatoes, and some home fries. The tofu was a little bland, but I added a little hot sauce and presto, change-o, my meal was delicious. I also got some whole wheat toast. It was great. Not sure where they get their bread, but I could have eaten a whole loaf.   My boyfriend got the pancake of the day, a sausage biscuit, and some home fries. He  enjoyed absolutely everything he got and was impressed by how good everything tastes.   Be forewarned, though. This isn't your grandma's foo foo brunch spot. (unless your grandma is a surly old Clevelander from Collinwood) Yes, the furniture is old. The AC doesn't work all that well. The servers and bartenders are down to earth folk. But...the food is so good, who cares about the ambiance.   Definitely worth checking out! There's a reason why this spot wins for best brunch in multiple city polls."}
{"text":"I don't even think I could list all of the awesome bands that I have seen in the Tavern or the Ballroom over the years.  Heck, I probably couldn't list all of the awesome shows I missed over the years.  That's a testament to how great the Beachland is.  A great place to see a show and the fact that they've helped bring economic development to that street is just icing on the cake.  Take your crappy, corporate run venue that rips fans off and shove it.  I'll take the Beachland any day of the week."}
{"text":"Spectacular venue--arguably the best place to see a concert in the city. Intimate without being cramped, acoustically marvelous without being too cavernous, and suitably grimy without being sticky-floor gross, the Beachland is a Cleveland mainstay for a reason.   There are two bars, the eponymous Tavern and a smaller bar in the back of the ballroom for quick drinks between songs. Both sport a superb beer list and liquor selection, so long as you aren't looking for anything too snooty (there is no dedicated cocktail menu, for instance). The Tavern fills up fast before a show so get there early. The food is tasty and they have a more than adequate vegetarian menu (try the house-made veggie burger with Swiss--melt in your mouth amazing). When I was there last, the service was a little slow--it took upwards of an hour for our appetizer to arrive. The bartender was accommodating, however, and gave us two free drinks for recompense.   If you need a respite from the bar or the ballroom, venture downstairs to the in-house thrift store. Well-curated and typically affordable, there are some interesting treasures to be found there. Don't expect modern records, but their selection of vintage vinyl is great.   In sum, the Beachland has it all. Definitely worth checking out for fans of live music."}
{"text":"Incredible atmosphere, amazing ownership, and great diversity! Never change - you guys keep the blood pumping in this city."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my time at Beachland Ballroom when I drove down to see Nada Surf play a week or so ago. The venue is a nice size without feeling too huge or too small. Some of my favorite venues have a similar size/feel about them (Schubas in Chicago for one) and this one joins their ranks. It was hot as hades outside but inside it was actually almost cold which I appreciate (especially since our venue of similar size in Detroit is NOT air conditioned. Holy hell). Every spot had a great view, the sound was fabulous, and the staff was out of control nice!   I walked up to the bar and asked the bartender for a G&T for myself and a \"tasty local beer\" for my fella who wanted to sample some of Cleveland's finest. He asked me a few questions including what kind of beers he liked to drink and handed me over a tasty double IPA from Great Lakes Brewing. As he was handing it to me someone in line behind me started chatting me up about how great that beer was and before too long we were all in a lovely conversation. So nice! I love the midwest. Everyone else I encountered at the venue was equally as lovely. Usually at shows I want to throttle at least one person around me for being a jerk but here, most everyone was pretty chill and fun. A few shouters but nothing crazy. I actually left without my blood pressure rising. Thumbs up!  Excellent venue that I'm sure I'll be visiting again the future, especially since it's surprisingly not that far (about 2.5 hours) from Detroit. An easy trek if someone you really want to see is playing there."}
{"text":"Great setting in the old Croatian home, and an eclectic and fun venue for live music. I've seen lots of interesting acts here, and it's the right size for an intimate but boisterous show. The bar on the side has a small stage as well, and I recently enjoyed the musical genius and religious rantings of Glenn Schwartz there, which was an ideal spot for him. I haven't eaten the food often, but it's always been tasty and creative. As a westsider, the Beachland manages to keep drawing me back."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Cleveland venue, long before we (Shoparooni) became neighbors!  The Tavern is my preference...I like seeing small bands in a small bar, and the Tavern is perfect. Easy to get a beer (they have Schlitz!), and you can see the band no matter how many people are in there. The Ballroom is pretty rad, but I'm a tiny-venue kinda guy. Plus, a cute girl totally grabbed my ass in the Tavern once, so I have fond memories of the place. The bartenders are easy on the eyes, the beer is damn cold, and they always get the coolest/strangest bands.   *thumbs up*"}
{"text":"5 stars for it being a music menu and for the awesome vintage shop downstairs. I've been to several shows and it's always great music and cheap drinks.   2.5 stars for brunch. I like the concept (brunch and music) and staff is nice but the food was meh. We tried the salmon and latkes and the chilaquiles. The lakes were like a salty undercooked pancake and just ruined the rest of it. The other dish was fine but nothing spectacular.   So... In conclusion, Just come here for the music."}
{"text":"The gf and I went here for brunch today. It was super cool. The only thing was it seemed like we needed a reservation, but it wasn't necessary.   We sat at the bar. And were greeted by a super friendly girl.   For our first round of drinks I went for a champagne cocktail called \"Neil Diamonds cuff links\" and my gf got a spin on a Bloody Mary called a bloody Maria. Both were super good.   For our second round I went with a Bellini and my gf got the beachland buzz. So so good. I highly recommend getting their brunch cocktails. They are super delish and really reasonably priced.   For our brunch entrees I went with the Deep South biscuits and sausage gravy and my gf got the pinto bean chilaquiles.   All in an all it was a great experience and some great music was getting spun."}
{"text":"My personal experience here is that the grumpy staff sour what would otherwise be an awesome experience every time...although it's not bad enough to keep me from coming back.   Entering one weekend night to watch a friend's band play, and encountered a doorman that either couldn't speak because of a disability, or refused to speak because he's just a jerk. Either way, we tried to hand him cash for the cover fee, but he wouldn't take it, but he also wouldn't say why he wouldn't take it. Then we figured out he wanted our IDs first. Which is fine, but why be silent and akward and weird about it?   Brunch is amazing, great music, great drinks, and hell yah for the vegan and vegetarian items. But the bartender wasn't warm and friendly either. And it wasn't just me, a witnessed another patron come up and ask to borrow a pen, and the bartender's response so was unfriendly that the patron actually APOLOGIZED to the bartender.   The place is packed for brunch, so I'd recommend making a reservation, although couldn't tell whether that went any quicker than it did for the people who just showed up and put their name in. Also possible to snag seats at the bar without having to wait for your name to be called."}
{"text":"This place is a neat venue, but is run by poor management.  It was -10 degrees and we had to wait hours until we got in.  They only have one person taking tickets.  I will never return to this venue. Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"This review is not for the music, but for the breakfast brunch served on the weekends. We went there today to give it a try and we were very pleasantly surprised. I had the potato pancakes and salmon and a Bloody Mary. I really don't think I've had a better breakfast in the Cleveland area! I actually wanted to lick the plate."}
{"text":"Really all I have to say is, meh. I haven't been here in a while, but I don't remember it being so dingy. I've honestly never experienced so many different smells in one place before. The lobby smelled like sewage, the thrift store smelled like musty moth balls, and the bathrooms smelled like sour milk. My nose had no idea what was going on.  Now I do think this is a nice venue for what it is. Small with a vintage feel to it. The sound was a little off but that didn't bother me. I was also happy to see some ciders in the cooler. Not too many places carry Fox Barrel. I also like the idea of the thrift store in the basement, pretty unique. Also, ladies you better sit down for this one, they changed the toilet paper roll! It ran out halfway through the show and a woman came in to change it. I know! Unheard of!  I guess I would just like to smell some nicer things next time I see a show here. That is all!"}
{"text":"Literally my favorite brunch in Cleveland the sausage gravy and mushroom gravy with homemade biscuits are better then grandmas! Go there not in a rush and you won't be disappointed in any choice the ninja Bloody Mary is also delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, didn't seem worth the wait time.  Always good to try new place but will not repeat."}
{"text":"This is not a BRUNCH SPOT!!!!  WTH!!  After Yelping \"best brunch in Cleveland\"  It was Beachland was returned.  2012 & 2013?  Really? Who is voting on this stuff.  We choose Beachland after our Sons Confirmation on Sunday afternoon.  Knowing that I have a very picky group I thought I had done my research.  Upon entry my wife was already complaining that the smell in there was that of an old ashtray.  While I would never agree just to move forward this place has the smell of beer soaked floor and cigs that were snuck in last night.  I will say that we were seated rather quickly and were put at a table between what appeared to be 2 disheveled kids who were obviously there to soak up the good times from last night and another group of 4 who crawled out from the gutter at about noon.  the chairs are cheap banquet chairs that were literately ripped to hell.  the table cloths I will go out on a limb and say that they have never been cleaned.  Our server had more holes in her face than Waterloo road and asked if we could helped.  The kids asked for milk,,,,,,,ummm nope we dont have   milk!  Really?  how do they make the waffles?  Well that's for the waffles she replied.  My wife asked for Decaf......Ummmm We dont have decaf she replied.  With that my daughter notices salmon on top of pancakes and my son sets his sights on chicken and waffles.  These are 2 kids that will eat just about anything and have had the fortune of eating around the globe.  This is not the best brunch!  Do not go for special occasions.  Do not go if you want decaf.  do not go if you want milk.  Do not go period"}
{"text":"Great venue and being an \"eastsider\" it's nice not to have to go all the way downtown or over the river to see great acts. I've been meaning to try their brunch, I hear it is fantastic."}
{"text":"The Beachland is great. Which is lucky, because it is pretty much the only place in Cleveland hosting indie rock concerts. So you could either go here or stay home. I mean, they could just be terrible and you would have to put up with it. So, Hooray Beachland!"}
{"text":"I am not rating the food as we have not tried it. We have been here a couple of times because our grandson plays in rock n' roll bands here as part of a program sponsored by School of Rock. It is a great venue for kids to perform in a professional setting and really develop their skills. This place is perfect for performances of this type."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. When I first heard that I would be attending a concert here I was a little uninterested. However, after getting there and seeing the vibe of the place I fell in love. We stopped in to see Cities & Coasts on a Saturday and it was a great time. We didn't get anything to eat, just a few beers. The venue is great, pretty clean, big space. The crowd was really awesome. We will definitely return to this place."}
{"text":"Brunch Review: This review is specific to my experience today. We had reservations for 6 at 11:30am, and weren't seated until 12:40pm. One person in our party had to leave without eating, because she had somewhere else to be and figured that 90 minutes would've surely been enough time to eat! While the staff was incredibly apologetic and did comp us a round of drinks, the wait on top of very mediocre food means that we will likely not choose to go to the Beachland for brunch again. I had the biscuits with sausage gravy, and there was barely any gravy on the biscuits and the bottom of the biscuit was overcooked, making it difficult to cut. The portion of home fries was very small, and the seasonal fruit consisted of 4 blueberries, 3 small quarters of grapefruit, and 5 dried apricots. I honestly would be hard pressed to think of a worse brunch experience in the area. Some may feel that I should give 2 stars because the staff was truly sorry, but at some point that cannot make up for waiting over an hour when we made a reservation, and having really terrible food."}
{"text":"Beachland Ballroom & Tavern is a great place to catch a concert in a very intimate setting.  The coordinators always bring in exceptional talent to take the stage.  Great price, $10 a ticket for great quality entertainment.  Most of the time I don't know who's playing and always leave pleasantly surprised.  I love me a good dive bar as well and the old Croatian Home feel adds to the experience."}
{"text":"Beachland is not only a great venue, but an almost surprisingly good place to grab some bar fair as well. Although I shouldn't say surprising, like I said before...its a great venue. Their mac and cheese is incredible, and not just with a drunk buzz either. Try this: whiskey smoked cheddar cream sauce....yum! Other veg friendly options as well as offerings for those partaking in the carnivorous side of things. Definitely a great place to be in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Love the DJ brunch they have on Sundays.  Delicious, creative cuisine in a fun atmosphere.  I've never had to wait for a table, and the service is great."}
{"text":"Amazing Brunch.    I have only had the luxury of dining in for brunch one time, but it was unlike any other brunch scene at noon on a Sunday.  No wait to get a table and no crazy servers running around in chaos.  Service was a bit slow, but we weren't in a hurry and frankly, this isn't a restaurant so I'm not blaming.  The food was amazing, and there were options for everyone.    I chose the turkey sandwich after seeing the man at the table next to me enjoy it as poached egg dripped on his face.  Sold.  Turkey, bacon, poached egg, tomato and avocado.  Served with hash browns and deliciousness on multi grain bread.    The Bloody Mary was garnished with pickled veggies; green beans, cauliflower, and a carrot.  It was a nice twist on the classic.  They also feature ginger infused vodka which gives a kick to their house made Bloody Mary mix.    I will surely be back for more.  Also, their vintage shop downstairs (This Way Out) was very nice and reasonably priced.  Vintage clothes, records, jewelry, patches, and some awesome knick knacks.  A lot of local goods.  Perfect to look around in while waiting for or digesting your delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"I've seen thousands of rock shows and concerts in my short, but fabulous life, dahlinks, so I can say without reservation that the Beachland is the best place in town to see a show.  If you are a parvenu, plush bottomed, yuppie miscreant, you may be horrified to find that the Beachland is in an old and slightly rough neighborhood and that the pissoirs are similar to those found in actual rock clubs as opposed to that paeon to commercialism known as *gag* HoB.  If you are even remotely cool, you will find that the Beachland is a well run club that provides great music at a reasonable price and offers a fine selection of top notch beers to make the evening sparkle and shine.  Oh yes, dahlinks, they have Shiner Bock.  THE MUSIC:  The Beachland does not cater to the teen and early twenty-something crowd, unless members of said crowd are indie rawk or alt.country affcionados.  No rap, no emo, no screemo, no pretty pop stars, no pre-recorded tracks.  Most bands are from the indie, alt.country, and eclectic categories.   The club does put on a few local acts, but only those that have an established regional following.  (Hit the Grog and the Symp for locals.)  The bands start and finish on time.  The sound (with the glaring exception of last night's Matthew Sweet show) is done as it should be-- before the show.  No, you won't have to listen to some enormous sound guy blather \"che-che-check  pah-pah-pau-pau\" into the mics for hours.  The bands are treated respectfully by management and are actually paid what they are promised.    My favorite shows:  Peelander Z , Brave Combo, Robbie Fulks, the Flatlanders, the late, great Paranoid Lovesick and this week's sublime offering-- Matthew Sweet.  Aside from the inexplicable interstatial sound check performed by two clueless, disorganized wastes of denim, the show was as close to perfect as a girl could hope for on this plane of existance.  Matthew retains his perfect pop voice and still sings the words that my battered, lost and forlorn heart still has the naivetee to want to hear and believe.  His guitarist-- Phillips-- made that heart pause and sigh with his complex, scinillating, subtle and perfect groove.  The rhythm guitarist/ back up singer tied the whole thing together with his lovely harmonies.  THE VENUES:  One side of the club is the old social hall for a Croatian ethnic club.  There is a stage, a wooden floor for dancing and a bar  in the other room.  The walls retain their painted scenes of idyllic slavic bliss.  There are a few tables on the right. Come very early if you want one.  The Tavern is a great old man bar-- lots of vinyl and neon.  The Tavern plays host to the psychobilly portion of the schedule.  THE BEER:  SHINER BOCK, Y'ALL!!  Yeah, you hipsters can have your PBR, but you want to try their selection of local and micro-brewery bbeers.  And did I mention they have Shiner Bock?  THE FOOD:  This is the one area that has not improved with age.  The food used to be spectacular.  I always hit the venue an hour early to grab dinner before the show.  The burgers were juicy, meaty hunks of happiness.  The fries were flavorful, crisp, hand cut spears of glory.  The sammiches rocked.  Now there is a tiny menu-- a burger, a burrito, fried PBJ and some nachos.  NO FRIES.  All are good enough, but a shadow of the former deliciousness that was the Beachand menu.  My burger was fresh, medium rare, but small.  My compadre's burrito had lots of cheese and beans.  Good, but meh.  Oh well.  STUFF:  There is a vintage shop/record store downstairs that bears visiting.  The band and crew often spends their time there before the show.  I met Peelander Yellow there (we talked about Suzi Quatro).  Hung out with El Vez's band (they are as silly and sick and one would hope).   Bands sell their own merch in the hall.    LOVE IT:  The space is relaxed and comfortable.  The music is great.  The staff is cool.  So go already."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Both rooms are great venues to see shows, and the neighborhood continues to bloom with new and interesting places.  That said, this review's real focus is the Sunday brunch.  I've been to the Beachland Brunch three or four times, and it's usually a pleasant experience.  Nice funky atmosphere with friendly service, and despite it being a bar, it's actually pretty kid friendly for brunch.  The original menu had sort of faltered but I understand that a new chef is handling brunch duties, and the change is noticeable.     Gone are some of the more ambitious items (strawberry risotto, deep-fried scambled eggs) but the new items are welome replacements.  The Blue Hawaii Burger (blue cheese-stuffed burger with pineapple and sriracha mayo) was outstanding!  The breakfast items (eggs, bacon, potatoes, etc.) are also solid, and the vegan chili seemed to go over well too.   Depending on the day, it can be kind of crowded, so be prepared.  You can always check out Music Saves or Salty Not Sweet if the wait is longer than expected."}
{"text":"What else can I say about the Beachland that others haven't already? This place is awesome, and so uniquely Cleveland. Most of my favorite memories of seeing live music are from the Beachland. The Beachland is one of those places that I like going to see live music, no matter who is playing. My favorite show at the BB was the Smoking Popes a few years ago. It was weird how small the crowd was, but it was still an amazing concert.   I can't wait to spend New Years Eve there this year!  Parking sucks, but I've never NOT found a spot. Some spots were just sketchier than others. Buddy system is a good idea here."}
{"text":"I still like coming here even if the one dude who works here is not cool at all. I like Tavern shows a lot more than Ballroom ones."}
{"text":"The BB was my favorite place to see unknown bands and reunited dinosaur rockers when i lived on the east side. I saw some great shows like Love, Mr. Airplane Man and the frequently playing Helper T-Cells. Now, maybe I'm just getting old. Maybe I'm sick of standing next to dorks in faux-thrift store clothing. Maybe i'm sick of paying $4 for swill beer when i can get drunk at home for about that much. But i don't really go there to see shows anymore. I love the basement record store and the jukebox. Don't really like the neighborhood. I will always have fond memories of boozing it up there. Who knows, they might start booking good shows again."}
{"text":"I have a lot of love for the Beachland.  It's a great place to go see a show, and with both the Tavern and the Ballroom they're able to accommodate bands of different sizes.  The sound is always good, the security is good and unobtrusive, and the place is cleaner than many other venues.  The food is also very good, although a little more expensive than it needs to be.  I'm a big fan of the Beachland burger, the white bean burger, and the fries with garlic aoli.  My only real complaint is drink prices.  I'm not a beer drinker, and the prices for a jack and coke or similar drink are more expensive than many others.  It's still a bargain compared to the House of Blues, though.  As long as they keep bringing in good shows I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"So I admit that I have, in the past, complained about the admission prices at the Beachland.  Especially in comparison to say, oh, the House of Blues.  Imagine my shame after I read the story in Scene about the owners of the Beachland and how they have barely been able to keep this place in business and about hit they took after the HOB opened.  No worries, I will never complain again!  I have no problem supporting people who have done so much for this neighborhood.  Such a cool story, if you haven't read the article - Google it!!  With that out of the way, I have to say that this is a really cool and unique concert venue.  And if you have read any of my reviews, you know I love my beer and this place has an excellent selection!"}
{"text":"First time I went to beachland ballroom was for a concert. It kind of reminded me of a high school gym. No douche bags, cheap beer, has its own parking lot. Today I went for brunch which was in the tavern portion. No wait, lots of seating, service was accommodating. You can order a variety of Bloody Mary's and of course some mimosa style drinks. You can buy a pitcher for cheap and get like 5-6 drinks out of for like $20! Food was good not stellar. I had the turkey sandwich which had an egg, avocado and bacon along with some home style fries. Wasn't greasy I was pretty full. All the while a DJ is spinning vinyl in the background but no too loud so you can still hold a conversation"}
