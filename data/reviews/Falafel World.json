{"text":"Felafel Friday! We used to eat here every Friday when we lived in the neighborhood and now make the trip across the city every few months to enjoy the excellent \"Felafel Plate\" dish.   I've eaten felafel in many countries around the world, and this is definitely my favourite - crispy felafel balls and creamy textured tahini along with really fresh tabbouleh and lettuce/cabbage salad. I like a little hot sauce on top also. Mmmmmm  They don't always have it available, but they used to serve a bread called \"Manoush\" (sp?) which was a round bread with Olive Oil, Za'atar (I think that this is an African or Middle Eastern type of Thyme and possibly Sumac (can't quite recall). Excellent and very unique flavour so if they have it....try it."}
{"text":"Twas a sad day when I moved out of the \"villah-je\" and nearer to mediocrity in mid-eastern cuisine.  This was the first place I tried a Shawarma, so I simply assumed that this is what tahini slathered chicken with turnip and onions in a chewy wrapper tastes like the world over. Boy was I wrong.  This is the best shawarma in the city. No lyin'. And you can get chicken breast in your pita! (breast meat for my wife; personally I love the various shades of tanned meat raining down from the confines of the rotating spit that I can't help be mesmerized by).  Seriously, eat here."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, the service was super friendly and very approachable. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate.  I asked for no tabbouleh and was asked if I would like to try a lentil salad instead (very tasty), otherwise served with fresh hummus, salad, a small side of pickled radish and whole wheat pita bread.  Tasty meal, cost was good - would like to try the falafel next!"}
{"text":"This place is very down to earth, if you're looking for trendy decor, it's not for you.  However, if you're looking for tastey middle-eastern pita sandwiches I think you'll be very happy with the food they serve.    It's basically a fast food lunch type of place, but the food is very authentic and very good! The service is fast, efficient and friendly and their prices are reasonable. I've had falafel all over this city and am very happy with this place and keep going back for more.    I've eaten in (even though the eating area could use a reno) and also had their take out. My son is very fussy about his shawarma and eggplant side and he's always declared theirs to be delicious!"}
{"text":"The best, Jerry, the best! Everything's good, but the hidden gem is probably the Janina."}
{"text":"Falafel World is a great family-run restaurant that serves tasty shawarma, falafel, and other Lebanese food. The owners are so friendly to everyone who comes in. They seem to know a lot of their customers, but even if they don't know you, they'll welcome you as if they do. The prices are very good for the quality of the food, and if you go late in the evening, they'll sometimes include a bowl of their lentil soup for free. There's a shawarma place on almost every block in Bloor West Village, but this is now the only one I go to."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken shawarma plate to go. Received massive dollop of salty hummus, bit of tabouleh, and big portion lettuce/cabbage salad with dehydrated salty chicken on top. (Not fresh from the rotisserie but scooped from a bin). Disappointed there was no rice, no potatoes, no pickled vegetables. Perhaps this plate should be renamed 'chicken salad'? Should have gone to McDonalds in the hood instead - theirs' is at least edible, less salty, tastier, and half the price :("}
{"text":"The janina sandwich is unbelievable. I'm so sad I can't find it elsewhere in the city because when do I ever need to come to Bloor West village?  If you like eggplant and lentils, and even if you normally don't, try the janina sandwich. Outgoddamnstanding."}
{"text":"I have been going to Falafel World for years.  The chicken shawarma is incredible and is a very nice change from the bland alternatives available around the city (in my opinion).  It is important to note that the shawarma recipe is different than what you would find at the other chain places and I think it is amazing.  I regularly make the trip to bloor west village just for shawarma.  Also, falafel is incredibly tasty and make sure to try the baklawa (the one cut in the diamond shape, truly addictive)"}
{"text":"FOOD MADE WITH LOVE   . . . one of the best falafel sandwiches in the city!!!!!!   HIGHS  * freeessshhhhhhhhhh * perfectly crispy falafel * punchy spicey flavours * in-house hot sauce * in-house tihini sauce * tasty-shmasty toasted flat-bread * fun, friendly lady behind counter (co-owner) * prices very reasonable  LOWS  * hot sauce could be hotter  (i\"m a freak . . . hotter the better!!!!!!)   Wonderful food, wonderful customer service . . . OVERALL -A"}
{"text":"So I am by no means the absolute authority on all things shawarma or falafel but I know good eats and this place is very good eats (Lebanese style). I have been coming here since oh about 1988 and it is still the same family run business and I hope it never changes, although I did notice the other day when I went past they did repaint the the name Falafel World on the front window I hope there are no bigger plans int he works. I have had this type of food all over the city of Toronto and from different cultural backgrounds and without a doubt this place does it the best. The veggies are always fresh, the meat dishes are spiced perfectly and are juicy and flavorful portions are perfect, not small and enough to fill you without leaving any behind. Pricing is right on point you get a great meal for a fair price and I have always been satisfied, the staff are always friendly and helpful and it feels like I am going to see a friend when I eat here.  I am sure anyone else would enjoy it also."}
{"text":"I like to take out a pita from this place, as it is fast,  cheerfully served, reasonably priced, and delicious.  The staff are friendly and efficient.  My pita is always warmed, a big plus as I loathe cold pitas.  I would like to try everything they have, as it all looks so appetizing,  but always seem to revert to my usual."}
{"text":"The food is best experienced takeout.  I've been eating here for 15 years.  One of the best chicken shawarma in town.  The original owners are absolutely lovely.   The brother or in law who is fat and balding is destroying this place.     He serves white people ahead of minorities who are standing in line.  He clearly has a complex.  He also adds extra charges at his whim.  My frequency is getting lower due to him.  I don't mind paying $3 more for a plate than a similar place a block away for the white meat.  They should not charge extra for replacing 1 salad for another.   When I see him at the counter I leave.  Very sad decline due to 1 terrible individual."}
{"text":"I keep going back here, because I think I have some fascination with falafel in general.  The service is excellent, they're very polite and friendly.  That being said, the falafel dish is kind of a let down.  Good falafel I suppose, but the dish comes with two different salads (neither of which has much flavour).  The hummus is somewhat tasteless too.  It's nice if you're hungry (big portions), but surely there must be better tasting food for this price."}
{"text":"I work at Royal York and Bloor.  I love Falafal world so much I will pay $3.00 subway fare to buy my shwarma and then another $3.00 to go back to work.  I have done this many times.   This family owned business has been around a long time.  I used to eat there while I waited for my daughter to finish dance class..  They are beautiful people.  Very polite and helpful.  The food is all wonderful...I love all of it!"}
{"text":"After so many rave reviews about this place, I took my family there (husband, 2 year-old, mom and dad).  We don't live in the area, but were in the neighbourhood because of the cherry blossoms in High Park.  We had the chicken shawarma plates (one regular and one with rice and potatoes instead of tabouleh), falafel plate and combo falafel and shawarma plates.    While the servings were a good size and the service very friendly and the restaurant itself was clean and had adequate space (we had a large stroller with us) the food itself was a disappointment as my husband and I have eaten at at least half a dozen other places wth much better food.    Cons: Falafels were NOT freshly made .. the guy picked them from a pile that was fried up some time earlier -- they were no hot.  The chicken was very salty  The potates tasted like boiled potatoes in canned tomato sauce  In general the hot food was not served hot  Even though the place was quite busy, the food wasn't very fresh   I wanted to like this place because of all the high reviews, but I don't think we'll go out of our way to return"}
{"text":"BEST CHICKEN SHAWARMA EVER!  I have been to many shawarma places around Toronto and none of them come close to this. Great people too!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best, highest quality, healthiest middle eastern (Lebanese) food you can get for a reasonable price. Blows Ali Baba out of the water. Awesome service. Food tastes great and you get only the best and freshest ingredients (unlike others who give you dark reformed meat). Long time fan of this established Bloor West Village jewel!"}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of great things about this place so I finally decided to check it out with my sister.  Since they are known for their falafel and hummus we both ordered falafel wraps. So good!!! The falafels were a good size and the wrap was packed with delicious ingredients (cabbage, turnips, lettuce, tabuli etc.). They are really generous with toppings so the wraps were a pretty good size.  We also added hummus as an extra topping. There is a small charge for it but it's totally worth it. The only reason I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is that I would have preferred the wrap to be a bit warmer. Placing it under a Panini press would have made it so much better. Overall, everything we ordered was quite delicious and I will certainly be coming back! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Worst Shawarma I've ever eaten.. it's literally just baked chicken not shawarma chicken.. dry with no sauce! Never going there again!"}
{"text":"I love Falafel World because its right beside Jane station! So when I'm coming home from school super hungry I stop by for my 5 dollar student special. It comes with a shawarma wrap a can drink and a side of your choice (fries,batata,etc) in all honesty I don't find it THE BEEST shawarma, but its pretty good. They make their own special garlic sauce and for me thats a bad thing, it just doesn't taste the same. I also don't like how little toppings they put. They put a wide variety of stuff but very little. Overall though the owner of the shop (you can tell its him because he has pictures of himself proud at work in the restaurant) treats his customers very kindly and I love when he takes my order. Falafel World has very great customer service and they keep the place is pretty clean."}
{"text":"One of the best shawarnas in Toronto. Meat is nicely done, veggies are fresh, sauces are home made. I'll be back"}
{"text":"The people are super friendly,  the restaurant is old looking but very clean.  But Damn it was cold in there!  It felt as if we were sitting outside (it's December)  and the food was also ofcourse cold. We ordered a  falafel plate and janina sandwich.. The taste was good but again it was cold and we were cold which made it hard to enjoy.  After reading some of the raving reviews,  I was really looking forward to Hot crispy falafel fresh out of the fryer... But I didn't get what I was looking for."}
{"text":"This place is one step up from your typical get in and get out (or take out) middle eastern eats.  The food is delicious and the price is right! I almost always get the falafel plate to share. Portions are big and around $6-9 for the plate. The wraps are around $4-5 I often find myself there around closing so sometimes there is an item missing (like the rice or tabouleh). The owners always fill my plate to the max with another item to make up for it. Which is fine by me!   Writing this makes me want to eat there tonight......."}
{"text":"My new favourite place after moving to the area, food is soooooooooooooooo good, the family that owns the place are amazing, always smiling, and the food is incredible (I know, I repeated, making a statement here)... and honestly, for size and quality and freshness, you won't believe the prices... 100% my go-to place in Bloor WV"}
{"text":"Got a chicken shawarma, meat was pre cut in a basket and not cut off the spit, the pita rips on contact from the first bite, very little ingredients and to top it off they don't press it in the grill to keep everything in tact.   This place is terrible and an embarrassment to the word shawarma, save your money and go to Shadi Shawarma down the street east of Runnymede and Bloor."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now, and I've only ever gotten the Janina, but it's amazing, super fresh and tasty. Everything across the board is super reasonably priced and the staff are so friendly every time I go in."}
{"text":"Great food and incredibly affordable prices. Plus, there are lots of great add ons for sandwiches.  We got the Janina, a cold lentil and fried eggplant sandwich for $4 with potatoes added for 50 cents; a falafel sandwich with cauliflower added; and a spinach pie plate with homous, salad, tahini, and tabouli. Everything is delicious and we got all of that for $21.50.  My only regret is not getting those hot pink pickles in the falafel and ordering a side of pita. The plates come with pita, but apparently not the spinach pie one.  A lot of the food appears to be vegan and the owners were very kind."}
{"text":"Ate here again today and am hard pressed to figure out why I deducted a star in the first place.  This is falafel at it's finest.  Read my original review...it all still applies.  Their food and service have been consistent over many visits.  That earns it the extra star!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Ive eaten here many times and Ive never been disappointed. Delicious, good quality food, GIANT portions and very reasonable prices. The owners and staff are super friendly and they really go out of their way to make you feel welcome and satisfy your hunger.   YUM!"}
{"text":"An unassuming name, a delicious experience.  I usually get the combination plate (falafel, shawarma, and sides), but it's worth trying a few things you aren't used to, as well.  Despite the bland surroundings, couples and families make this a spot to sit and enjoy dinner -- although it primarily comes across as a lunch or takeout spot.  It counts as one of many definitions of what it means to \"gwup to Bloor\" if you live in High Park / Swansea. In this case, Swansea, south of Bloor, and hence the \"g'wup\".  The fact that they only accept cash is annoying at first (their ATM is mega expensive), but after awhile I realized it's just a way of weeding out the pretenders. Bring cash. :)"}
{"text":"Falafel World is a good spot for shawarma, falafel, and baklava.   The atmosphere is much more warm and comfortable than other similar places in the neighbourhood. You are always greeted with a smile by the employees.   Everything I have eaten there tastes fresh and full of flavour. I highly recommend the beef shawarma, make sure you add hummus and tahini as they are especially tasty here."}
{"text":"The best decision I made today was to get a chicken shwarma from Falafel World! This place is hands-down the best shwarma and falafel place in the city, and it has stood the test of time, having fed hungry Bloor West Villagers since the 90s! Run by a friendly family team, they always remember old and new customers alike, and will make your day with their smiles and out-of-this-world food. For authentic Lebanese food at its finest, check out Falafel World next time you're in the west end! :)"}
{"text":"Scrumptious falafel, delicious chicken warma. Friendly staff, added a free ball of falafel."}
{"text":"Consistently great falafel schwarma combination. I don't make it to this neighborhood often enough. If I'm within 10 miles of this place around lunch time, I will go out of my way to get one."}
{"text":"I drive quite a bit out of my way to come here. The foods reminds me of being in Lebanon."}
{"text":"Went there May 27th, 2013, and got a fantastic meal for an inexpensive price. Staff was extemely friendly. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Legit I would have to say the customer service is better than the food itself.  I personally enjoy falafel quite often and don't really like it to be sitting around for god knows how long.    It was a generous portion, but the falafel itself was cold.    Spicy sauce was OK.     Lots of competitors in the general area."}
{"text":"This was a let-down. Love me some shwarma and hit this place on the way home from work last week. Should've kept walking.  I was served pre-cut chicken from a container, not freshly cut.  Meat was so dry, even with the hot sauce there wasn't much going on with flavor.  Was it edible? Sure, but this was the worst shwarma I've ever had.  I'm sure it would've been a solid one had they cut from the skewer and grilled the chicken like at every other shwarma place I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Service was really friendly, and personable. Other than that not sure how this place got some of the high reviews though maybe it was an off night when I went but it was a pretty sad chicken shawarma plate. Just didn't have that much flavour in the garlic sauce, hummus or chicken. I'll give it another try someday since I live so close I really want to love this place."}
{"text":"Excellent Falafel, Shawarma, etc. And they have a great variety of other foods too. The platters are HUGE!  Owners are very friendly!"}
{"text":"Chicken tasted like boiled cardboard. I am not sure how others found it amazing. I would suggest not ever getting chicken at this place."}
{"text":"One of the oldest (for a reason) and best in the city.  Lot of falafel available these days (lot of it not good).  The staff is friendly.  My complaint; update the debit machine; it's old and the buttons don't work very well, I know they clearly (verbalized it) prefer CASH but nowadays cash is secondary to plastic (bank fees, using/finding a machine, etc).  Also remove the ADD TIP function to debit/cc process; does everything have to have a tip option nowadays!??!?  expensive enough to eat out but now a pressure to tip with every coffee, take out meal in the city??  One good thing about Timmies/McD (they don't bother you with that annoyance)."}
{"text":"There was almost no wait time. I Ordered beef shawarma on a plate. The plate part made no difference whatsoever since they still served it with pita. No rice or other sides. Just he beef, tabbouleh, hummus and plenty of lettuce. The beef was stone cold and rubbery. definitely not $11 worth...."}
{"text":"First time at this place. It was nice, clean, and friendly staff. Food was really good, the Kibbeh, and the Beef Shawerma was very good."}
{"text":"I've been going here for decades, and it's still amazing!  The owner is an absolute gem.  I remember when I was little, he told my dad in the days he was starting out, and not many shawarma places were around, that a woman came in during the winter, and was obviously a little bit sick.  While she sat down, he made a tea, and brought it to her free of charge.  She was so thankful, and the next week, she bought her entire extended family.  His hard work and quality has paid off.  It's still my favourite Chicken Shawarma Sandwich in the city, and all others pale by comparison.  It's the crunchy cabbage salad (I hold the lettuce) that makes it for me.  It's also filling!  One sandwich and I'm full.  Most other places, I feel like the Chicken is a second class citizen and I need at least two.  I'd also recommend the Eggplant Sandwich, which is an amazing contrast of creamy eggplant and crunchy cabbage that is so good!  I often have trouble deciding between the two sandwiches, and more often than not buy one of each for my next two meals.  If you want to be satisfied for the entire day, their shawarma plate will fill you up really good.  I often order their Baklava for parties, which is so good!  Grab a sandwich.  You won't regret it!!!  PS - I'm allergic to Fava Beans so I can't comment on their falafel sandwiches, but the owner once made one with only chickpeas minus the fava beans and it was GREAT!  I'd still stick to the Chicken or Eggplant or both sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken sandwich. Received cold salty and dry chicken and cabbage salad in a pita. Overall sandwich tasteless and bland. Wouldn't come back at all."}
{"text":"Best chicken schwarma in Bloor West Village, hands down. The meat is always juicy and cooked to perfection. I have yet to be disappointed by their delicious chicken. The service is always kind and accommodating to any requests I may have (more hot sauce!). And to top off the whole meal, the baklava is a real treat!  The only downfall is that they are closed on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Falafel World! The trusty west end standby that never fails to deliver!   Fast, cheap and tasty is the name of the game. The standouts on the menu are the chicken shwarma, falafel and the janina (lentil) sandwich (invented during the big Toronto blackout a number of years ago). The spices they use on their chicken are unique and the optional extras can really add to the sandwich. I always load up with Tabule (the queen of salads) and grilled eggplant.  Drop by next time you're looking for a quick meal. Just don't forget the flaky and sweet Baklava dessert (and get extra for the road... it's too good to pass up)."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great people.  The is a mainstay in my take-out regimen.  Service is fast and friendly and the food is fresh."}
{"text":"I love the janina sandwich.  If you haven't tried it and are a fan of eggplant I highly recommend it.  It's so moist and flavourful - yummy!  I have cravings for this.  I've been coming here for years - the husband grew up in the neighbourhood and was in the Falafel Flames hockey team when he was a kid.  It started with him bringing me here to show me pictures of him with his team (they're still there, hanging above the cash register) and then I quickly developed a love for their food.  Janina is my favourite thing here.  A close second is the combination plate which is half chicken, half falafel.  Their hummus is a must!  I find the falafels can be a little on the dry side so I usually smother them in hummus and all is good.  Did I say you should try the Janina sandwich?  Because you should!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Friendly workers (mom and pop feel), good value and tasty options. Tried the chicken shawarma (really moist & tasty but FYI they choose the toppings), eggplant, and falafel with hummas. Highly recommend the falafel which is has a crunchy outside and moist centers."}
{"text":"Happen to be in the neighbourhood today, looking for a healthy meal. I noticed Falafel World which offers Lebanese food, which I enjoy very much if it is good. I checked on yelp for help, am I glad I did as I ordered the \"Janina\" eggplant/lentils sandwich after reading the reviews, it was delicious! The woman behind the register told me the business has been there for 34 years! Too bad that I do not live in that neighborhood, or else I would be eating there often."}
{"text":"Basically a party in your mouth, served with love. Family has been in the neighbourhood for yeeeeears, and took great care of our stomachs when we had a house fire. There's a solid reason nothing has changed about the place in decades."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years, really great people, the owner is such nice guy, makes a little plate of few potatoes & some rice for our little girl, when me & my wife grab dinner. Food is great & it feels good to support a family run local business that is a staple in Bloor West Village. I seen an Osmows is opening in the area, I've had Osmows & there is no comparison, just another chain shawarma place. Falafel world has always been & will always be our go to in Bloor West."}
{"text":"Ok. I'll admit it. Before today, I have never eaten a falafel. That's right. I have just lost my falafel virginity. And, I'm sad to say, it was nothing that blew me out of the water. The place hasn't changed in about 25 years. How do I know (I'm 22)? My dad used to own that very restaurant... But it was European fare and didn't do all that well after he sold it. Oh well. The decor is old and in desperate need of some TLC (or a renovation). Despite this, the place was packed when I walked in around 6 pm. You have your standard options, almost all available as a sandwich/wrap or a plate/dinner. I had the chicken shawarma sandwich, no garlic sauce, with hummous. The good: it was warm. The pita was yummy, the chicken was flavourful and moist. The veggies were fresh. And the falafel was huge. Really huge and filling. The bad: the falafel itself. Maybe it's because the flavours were layered and not mixed. Maybe because the hummous made the pita soggy by the end. Or maybe because I don't know falafels. I mean, if I just wanted tabbouleh, I would have ordered just that. Oh well. The ugly: the soggy bit of pita at the end. It was icky. And messy. I will give falafels another chance, to be sure, but I will only come back here once I've had several other falafels."}
{"text":"worked in the Village for many years and this is one of Bloor West treasures. Schwarma plates beef, chicken, falafels tabbouleh, cabbage salad, hot sauce all are excellent value and great interesting flavours. The hummous is my favourite and there is so much more to try. The staff is excellent never had a problem or seen an issue arise while I attended regularly. Now it is a treat to have something different but excellent to expand your menu of choices beyond burger, pizza etc. A west end Must Try it , you wont be hungry when you leave."}
{"text":"Excellent food with friendly service! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"what a great place. the guy behind the counter was so fun and generous. my friend and i were arguing about who should pay, and the server pointed at me and said   server: \"in my country he [me] would have to pay, so i think i must make him pay.\"  friend: \"but i know you, i have come here for so long, and i want to pay.\"  we argue for a little bit, but my friend seems to be winning  server: \"fine, you insist, i will let you pay, but next time he [me] must pay. and he must take good care of you.\" me, to the server: \"what about your country!\" server, pointing at my friend \"she is more important than that.\"  so smooth! and so right!   anyway, we get the falafel plate, and the falafel and that little salad that comes with the plate are excellent. the hummus is only so-so, which accounts for the 4 and not 5 stars. hummus is key, in my mind.  after we finished our meal, the server, who i think was enamored with our cuteness, gave us two free desserts and beamed the most winning smile. the people here are fantastic. i will be back."}
{"text":"Falafel World is where we generally pick up dinner when we're too lazy to make anything or just need something quick.  Food is always fresh and tasty.  Pricing is super affordable for the expensive Bloor West neighbourhood.  Stuffed falafel and swarma sandwiches priced from $5-$6 and combination plates under $10.  Baklava ($1.50/piece) is awesome...so crispy, so flaky!   Service is kind and friendly.  It's a place that you want to come back to over and over again."}
{"text":"Solid chicken shwarma place, fresh vegetables and chicken isn't as fatty or salty as most shwarma places."}
{"text":"The shawarma sandwich was SUPER salty. I wish you could choose the toppings you wanted. Just chicken and the lettuce mixture doesn't feel like a real shawarma to me."}
{"text":"Eating a falafel as I type this, which reminds me to buy an iPhone cover, I am pondering the merits and flaws of this restaurant. Seeing that I am making a mess, an employee brings me over a few napkins, making me feel extraordinarily messy, but also cared for. The customer service is great here, the food is just about average. The falafel itself is moist and flavourful, but not freshly cooked. The pita is fresh but not warmed. My favorite thing about shawarmas and falafels is when they are pressed and get all toasty and warm. The toppings are fresh, the service expedient and the price reasonable. A pretty good falafel place but nothing to set it apart from other places."}
{"text":"False advertising. They said it was a chicken shawarma plate. That would have been amazing! What I got was a dry, flavourless and seemingly old chicken breast drenched in bland hummus and not hot at all hot sauce. Throw in the lack of rice or potatoes on the plate and the slimy tasting mango drink, it was simply the saddest shawarma I have ever eaten. (Being not a shawarma at alll"}
