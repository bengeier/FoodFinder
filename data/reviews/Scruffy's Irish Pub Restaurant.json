{"text":"Went to a together here ; not sure why they picked this place but ok.   The place was understaffed with only one waitress on a saturday evening...which blew my mind. That being said, the wings, burger, and pepper poppers were great. the fried mozzarella sticks not so much. The appetizer portions should be bigger for the money."}
{"text":"While Christmas shopping at Square One, I popped into Scruffy's on the way home for a quick bite to eat. I'm very torn on my experience.  The inside is very warm and welcoming, and while the bar area is a little small, the dining area is nice, and while the area I was seated at had only enough seating for maybe 20 people, there is also an upstairs area that I didn't venture into. TV's are also well positioned to be viewed from every table, and a nice variety of non-intrusive music is played low in the dining area. It should also be noted that they have a very spacious patio area for when the weather isn't so cruel.  I felt bad for the lone staffer there. He was a really nice guy, but having to deal with the kitchen, tend bar on the main floor, and also take orders/check on customers on 2 seperate floors is terrible. Needless to say, he rarely came to my area to check on the customers. In fact, I saw him twice: when he took my drink order, and when he took my food order. I had to go finding him at the end to pay. Not his fault, but it was really annoying, especially when I couldn't even be bothered to seek him out to let him know I wasn't given utensils or a napkin at any point. The couple sitting next to me were sitting there chatting through most of my time there, and I thought they were just regulars hanging out. I came to find out that they were waiting for their bill for almost the duration of my visit, which never came, and they went down to find the guy at the same time as I did.  The menu is typical pub fare, and they do have daily specials, and karaoke every Saturday. I guess the top floor must be spacious, because I shudder to think of them trying to squeeze a crowd and a singing area into where I was seated, or the bar area. The menu also made me chuckle. I'm not sure who's genius idea it was to use a black font for the food details on a dark brown background for a dimly-lit pub, but man, it was hard to read in spots. Anyway, I opted for their Thursday Burger Special, which is basically their regular $11 burger on for I believe $7.50.  The burger itself was above average. Not a 'set off a burgasmic depth charge in my loins' situation, but good enough. And at the risk of sounding like one of Yelp Forums sad-Troll transients, the fries reminded me very much of Swiss Chalet fries, and that's not a bad thing at all! Well done!  Scruffy's features great relaxing atmosphere, good food, and is in a decent area. It's just a shame the major understaffing kept my star-rating lower."}
{"text":"Frequent Disappointment.  This is yet another perfect example of a non-franchise establishment not being aware of their customer and thus dropping the proverbial ball.  Apparently under new management, there has been no change in food or environment despite the new management.  They have a no children rule after 9, which alienates them from potential customers who would order food and possibly imports and keeps the 5 patrons instead who continue to drink their bottom barrel domestic.  I don't have a real big issue the kids after 9, but they turned away a party of 20 twice who were hungry and thirsty and instead catered to the 3 patrons at 9:00 PM on a weeknight.  Well done.  They carry the name Irish Pub, but it's obvious they've never been to Ireland.  They are after all a family environment big on community.  The food is sub par and easily attainable at any of the neighbouring establishments and quite frankly better tasting.  It's quite hard to screw up a pint so they do have that.    Back to the business plan drawing board."}
{"text":"Scruffy's is the very definition of grungy pub. I work pretty close to this pub so my meeting with this pub was bound to happen.   Let me start of with the good things about this pub:  -Layout: Scruffy's has a great layout, it is cozy enough to be a stop for a first date and large enough to accommodate large parties of 20+ guests.  -Servers: they are polite, will take your order and get it right more often than not (!!) which is surprising for a pub and even crack a joke once in a while  -Prices: drinks are cheap, assuming you don't want anything too fancy ....grungy pub = cheap (local) drinks  That is unfortunately where the good things end. If you're going to Scruffy's for food, you will be disappointed. There's no question in my mind about this fact: their food sucks. To top it off, it's overpriced. There are countless other places with better food in the same intersection.   Finally (this is the big reason they lose points), the service here is the WORST. You're probably thinking, \"David, you said the staff is great. What gives?\". Well dear reader, although the staff is wonderful, the process this pub has set up to transfer food orders into food is very bad.   Story time: Went with some work buddies (about 7 of us in total) for a quick lunch and drinks. Ordered our food and began our never-ending wait. We get our drinks a little late (~15 minutes after ordering). We finish our drinks, and we're told the food will be right there \"just order another round\". We order another round. Finish the 2nd round. No drinks. It's been ~45 minutes by this time. Finally, almost an hour after ordering our food/drinks, all of our food arrives (together thank goodness). Our quick lunch+drinks turns into an hour and a half of waiting/  All in all, Scruffy's is a great place to go for a quick drink, maybe some dirty food ....and that's it.   TL:DR: cheap drinks (nothing fancy), awesome layout, garbage food and horrible process flow"}
{"text":"I like this place because they have a great patio with a good vibe. I have never had the food as i usually crush a big bowl of pho of some manakeesh at paramount before hand.... YAH HEARD!"}
