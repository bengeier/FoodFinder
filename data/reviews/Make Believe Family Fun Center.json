{"text":"We have been here several times and we still love it! It's very clean with lots to do for both little and bigger kids. Breanna helped us out during this visit and made a fun afternoon even better!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and dirty restroom.  The \"ballocity\" is not a good fit for kids under 3 year old.  That was the first and last trip."}
{"text":"Ok spot to kill an afternoon with kids.  Definitely pricey.   The premium package which gives you access to all attractions was $30 per person.  It really annoyed me that they made you purchase these bracelets for an additional dollar so the kids could wear the cards around their wrists.  Just package it together Make Believe!    Best for kids under 12.  My 12 year old was over it after about an hour and was ready to leave.    The bumper cars were fun but we spent about 20 min in line waiting."}
{"text":"This place is trash. Went twice on our own and once for a birthday party. It's so over crowded. They don't have enough employees or they're not trained enough. Waited 20 minutes to cash in tickets for one cheap slinky. Also not made for toddlers. At all. Don't plan on ever going back. Maybe make it in a better location other than Parma."}
{"text":"Calling all children (or children at heart - you know who you are)!  I finally had a chance to take my son (he's 9 and might be more mature than I... the jury's still out on that...) to Make Believe Family Fun Center in Parma, and what a fun day we had!  The venue is clean and spacious with just the right amount of activities- and for approximately $30, you get unlimited access to all of them for 3 hours (starting from whatever time you arrive), plus $5 towards arcade games.  They also offer other packages, or you can customize one of your own, but the all-encompassing one gives you the most bang for your buck.  Activities include laser tag, bumper cars, rock climbing walls, a huge play area - Ballocity (for younger children - i.e. around my son's age - think 12 and under), mini bowling, and an indoor ropes course high above ground (rest assured- you are safely harnessed in).  And of course - there's the ever-popular Dragon's Breath offered at the snack bar (which serves hot food, cold treats, and even alcohol for the parents).  This sweet and crunchy concoction consists of corn puffs frozen with liquid nitrogen (be careful - its very cold)!  And when you eat each puff, smoke emits from your mouth and nose!  Who doesn't want to be a dragon for a short while!  The facility is also equipped with free wifi, free lockers, and a nice lounge area with tvs for those moments when you want a quick break.  So if you're looking for something fun to do with the kids on any afternoon, take a ride over to Make Believe and let the adventures begin!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. It's small as hell and damn sure not worth $25 per kid. That's how much you have to pay to use the majority of the stuff (or the $30 price to play everything with the ropes course). So the two kids I brought played a game and won a bunch of tickets. The rubber band broke on the group of tickets and they wouldn't redeem them tickets. What kind of shitty as rule is it that they can only accept the ticket rolled up and secured with a rubber band. I rolled them back up but they wouldn't accept them. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Well spend our moment at Dave and Busters or the new 75 entertainment place."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Lots of places to get out all of your kids energy! It is extremely clean and well structured! They have bumper cars, rope walls, lots of things for all ages. I brought my two-year-old and my thought you're old and they both had a blast! My only complaint about this place would be the cost! The cost is pretty expensive! I don't think that there is a membership that you can join and you can only play for three hours. That part of it kind of sucks and that will be limiting our time to spend here or come back to this place but otherwise everything overall is pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Wasn't too crowded, so the kids were able to navigate to each attraction easily.  My son is 10, his favorite was Ballocity.  Staff was friendly, especially the crew on the rope course. Clean facility.  A great place to spend a few hours and do something different. Lots of energy spent here and when it was time to go, they were tired.  The price was decent, 30.00 per person for the ultimate package but there was a lot to do for that price.  My boys had a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Kids 7 & 10 love it here!  While it can get pricey, I don't see it being more than Chuck E's and it has more activities by far.  Bumper cars, ballo-city, arcade, laser tag and bowling...plus some beer & grub for the parents with a nice lounge area. Good for a night of fun!"}
{"text":"Highly and Truly disappointed! I live legit like 10 feet from this place so i was like a kid in the candy store while it was being built. I allowed myself to revisit my childhood memories of arcade days and chuck e cheese, discovery zone and iplay america's back on the east coast....sadly this place falls short.  I know what you're thinking, im 28 why am i even here? I have two little ones, and i live for fun with them. We've been searching NEO for fun indoor play, the jump yard, skyzone and others have hit the mark, so i was truly amped about this place.  For starters, you have to pay per hour to enjoy play...WHAT?! i understand admission fees by all means, but you get 3 hours of play and thats it? Perhaps make it so you pay as you go, so that in the event you dont get to everything in that 3 hour frame your money isnt wasted.   Secondly, the arcade games are ridiculously prices. Back in my day i paid a quarter, but no really the prices are insane.   Its bright and colorful inside with tons to do, but really it isnt geared toward children 5 and under. they have a toddler area that is cheesy, a bowling alley..etc.  They have a bumper zone and laser tag which were clutch for my little ones, but honestly i think they could have did a hell of a better job putting this place together. Originally i believe it was set to open in 2017 and i truly feel like they rushed to get it open for winter and in the process missed the mark on some things that were crucial.  Its convenient so i will be back but i really think the owners could do so much more."}
{"text":"My best friend's daughter had her 11th birthday party here. It was busy but not terrible. The staff was super attentive & Brian, our host, was great with the kids. He seriously was on top of everything. The birthday girl had a skirt on & he kindly pulled Mom aside to ensure she had on shorts under it since their were climbing /rope course activities. He warned kids when their shoes were untied. Birthday girl's brother has autism, & Brian asked informed questions, wanting to ensure he had an amazing night too. I was impressed with everything. The pizza was pretty good. The party rooms have disco balls! There's a super cool lounge area with leather seats for adults & craft beers on tap. The kids had a fantastic time. Way cooler than Chuck E Cheese. The package was all inclusive too, so the kids got to play with everything. I was also impressed with how clean it was. All in all, great experience!"}
{"text":"Staff are super nice and helpful wish there were more options for older kids other wise this place is awesome"}
{"text":"Lots of fun for kids of all ages. Spacious, CLEAN, and lots of comfortable chairs for parents. Bring your credit card. It ain't cheap, but worth it."}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience because of the staff i took my wife and kids and some family members and we where getting treated like hoodlums like we didn't pay a lot of money to be there.They where checking to see if we paid for certain things switch we did and showed them because they came up to us and asked and they where not nice about it and being rude for no reason some staff more then others.I have been there four times and spend about 150.00 each time not no more its a nice place but the workers and manger make it bad because there not people friendly more business and money hungry like we don't matter."}
{"text":"Save your time and money they again don't honor there specials here on Tuesday before six bought a package and don't get kids free pizza!! Place is small and for the fee could of went to scene 75 or DB a lot bigger there. And this is the response you get from the management"}
{"text":"I took my little sister here for a birthday party. Little did we know the party had already left. We decided to stay and check it out. A lot of the activities were for younger kids, but surprisingly there were quite a few things for adults to do as well. The rope climbing thing was kinda freaky! It was really neat to be above everyone trying to balance on teeny tiny ropes!  The best part of the entire place was the laser tag. It was unlimited for however long you were there! We played like 7 times and each time was a blast. The arena is super cool! Two floors and tons of things to keep you hidden and on your toes.  Overall it was a fun afternoon out with my sister and plenty of things to keep us both occupied."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced, and very limited on games and attractions. I think they could've done a better job. I honestly believe chuck E cheese is better lol heck even swings n things. There was a miscommunication problem with my sister and an employee and when she tried to get a contact number to make a complaint she kept on getting the run-around with the manager and said employee. But the manager kinda handle it ok but still felt like something was off."}
{"text":"This place is ghetto. Patents cutting kids in the bumper car line. And nobody working paying attention. Really loud which is understandable.  Food is pricey. People came in smelling like weed. All of it is ran by teenagers without supervision.  Good thing the soda is unlimited.  My kids had fun for the most part but it's basically like an expensive Chuck e cheese."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  We went for a small birthday gathering.  The kids were 7, 9, and 11.  They each had a great time.  The place was clean and well organized.  The staff was attentive and patient with the kids.  And they really made sure that safety was taken seriously.  The activities were fantastic.  The kids loved the air walk obstacle course, bumper cars, mini bowling, laser tag, ninja wall climbing and all of the arcades games.  The espresso was excellent and there were several comfy places for the parents to sit and watch the kids have a blast.  We all had a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"Went with my girls to spend time. Both of them had a blast. Definitely recommend this place to all dads that are looking to spend a quality afternoon with their kidos. My oldest had to be dragged away at the end lol."}
{"text":"Very clean. A lot of fun activities: laser tag, bumper cars, mini bowling, etc. Got extra 20% off on snow day."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations! Super fun! A little pricey, would be nice if they had a family pack or something."}
{"text":"This place is fun, but the worker are the most disrespectful person ever, they didn't want to turn on ride when my kids want to get on it again because they love that ride more then the other, even tho we bought the package for unlimited play for 3 hours, they had lied to my kids told my kids that there's card hour ran out, when my kids came up to me and told me there time had ran out, which I knew I cant be, I walk out with my kids to the ride and ran our card in the card reader it had shown that all my kids card is still active, they didn't want to let my kids ride it, because my kids want to ride it the 2nd time and there no one line, the worker wanted to be lazy and didn't want to turn the ride on. I cant believe we drove 2 hours from Columbus for this place, and got rip-off."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. My thoughts, the staff is young but they are all very respectful and we're amazing with my 7 year old. I think the prices are okay...but other then that, amazing location. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My God the manager is a jerk. I saw the local police show up to check the place out and the manager says, \"You're scaring my customers.\" I heard the cop say, \"We're just seeing what it's like in here. Chuck E. Cheese doesn't mind us being there.\" So I heard the manager say, \"We won't have the clientele that Chuck E. Cheese has.\" I have doubts about a \"kid friendly\" place that doesn't want a police presence. Makes you wonder what their real intentions are."}
{"text":"Took the kids to Make Believe on this cold & rainy day. My son immediately bolted to the video games and played Jurassic Park for a while. Then I beat him in air hockey and I tried to let him win.  Honestly!  Then we played laser tag, which was great. You really get a decent amount of time to play a game. The little kids follow you around and continually shoot you with lasers. We didn't play bumper cars, but we did order some deep fried mac n cheese and some mozzarella sticks. They were very tasty!  They've got lots to do for the little ones and they serve local craft beer for the big kids.  We went to have fun and that's exactly what we did.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Something for everyone! It is a fun family friendly environment. The place is kept very clean, even the restrooms. The staff is great. There is a good price range too. We can can have a fun afternoon for under $20. But the more things you do the more expensive it gets."}
