{"text":"Finally!!! I have found not only a good Chinese here in Tempe, but also one that can deal with wierd food allergies without making you feel like you are a loser! Hot tea is offered if I am walking to pick up my takeout, and just all-around great (and properly prepared!) food as well as stellar customer service will bring me back again and again as long as I am living here!!!"}
{"text":"A great family owned restaurant that serves up some authentic Chinese food. As a vegetarian, I will have to agree with what I saw in other reviews - get the spicy eggplant. Great for takeout if you live in the north Tempe area."}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my family since I was a little kid. It is a family owned and run business by some of the nicest people you will ever meet.  The food is insanely good with the best dumplings and chow mein... The Mongolian Beef and orange beef are also like none other.  They use fresh ingredients and take pride in every dish.  The food is much more authentic than PF Changs or any other Chinese restaurant around. I definitely recommended this place.  They have crazy good lunch specials and the dinner atmosphere is nice and warm."}
{"text":"I got take-out with a friend about 3 weeks ago from here for the first and I got the Chinese Eggplant with Spicy Sauce with steamed  white rice(they don't have plain brown rice.) The menu does not state this, but the dish has little carrot cubes and peas, which added some variety that I have not seen in eggplant dishes at other Asian restaurants. I would say this is one of the better versions of eggplant I have had, though I wish they had brown rice.              The only problem that came up was that our order was mixed up with someone else's order at the cash register. So we paid for someone else's dinner and then had to void the transaction and repay. Also, it was about 8 PM when we came for pick up and the place was void of employees, so we stood around for a few minutes waiting for someone to help us.  In short, I would go back just for this dish, but otherwise, there isn't much else on the menu that is interesting to me."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Chinese near ASU. I have been a regular for four years and can't wait to come back after every summer. Fried rice is always a favorite, along with dumplings! Only thing I don't eat on the menu is the seafood due to my allergies!   Swani is the best!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been going here for the past year or so and are absolutely obsessed. The Orange Beef is a must, perfectly crispy and crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside, not absolutely drowned in sauce and overall just perfectly satisfying. We also frequent the chicken special, the house fried rice, kung pao and their crab puffs are the best in town. We're no slouches when it comes to Chinese either, she's from LA and I'm from a DC Jewish family that definitely upheld the Christmas tradition, except with a different restaurant ever year. All of this and Swani is the absolute greatest, always wonderful to speak to and takes care of her customers."}
{"text":"My husband has been coming here since he was just a twinkle in his mommy's eye. When he first brought me here I wasn't expecting much as I hold Chinese food to very high standards but one meal was all it took to have me hooked aside from the amazing customer service that Swanie and Eddie  provide the food is so good there is nothing I have tried that I don't like the crab puffs are the best I've ever had and they're always a part of our meal. I recently took a job with a new company within my field and I was delighted to find out that I am only 4 minutes away from this place needless to say this is where you can find me at least once a week and all my new co-workers that I've been bringing here can't get enough of it either"}
{"text":"Nice service, real Chinese people, nice interior - nothing special but nice.  OK I have lived in Sichuan Province.  Why they are Little Sichuan I don't know.  Please note I am spelling Sichuan Correctly using Pin Yin.  This place's food does not even remotely taste like Sichuan Food.  The appearance does not look like Sichuan Food, and the Smell is nothing like Sichuan food.  I asked them in Chinese if they could make my food Ma-La, which is numbingly hot.  I did not ask for La si ren (kill people hot).  Just if they do make Sichuan Food they would be able to do this.  OK, they could not do and I appreciate the honesty of their telling me.  I ordered Chicken Eggplant.  Nothing to it, not prepared correctly and the chicken was stringy and dry.  Yum YUm!!! OK I did not get sick + 10 hours from lunch.  Now I ordered some dumplings.  Well I took one bite and did not eat another.  The meat tasted strange and I thought someone has put soap in my mouth.  I have eaten dumplings in China all over the place, in USA and I have to say, those where .....no good.  When they would not give me my money back for the dumplings (cold, late, and soapy) i decided next time I'd go to the culture center...  For people to say Authentic etc. I'd just say, Sorry you don't know what you are talking about. More authentic than fast food places?  They do have Chinese Fast food places in China too.  Fast Food Hong Kong tastes like fast food Chinese in USA.    Go to the Chinese cultural center on the 40's block in Phoenix if you want anything even close to Sichuan.  I know some people will have issue with me on all this.  that is OK. You won't die here as far as I know, but clearly they are not even Little Szechuan.  yi dien dien Sichuan  (little little) Sichuan."}
{"text":"I ordered the combo rice and it was pretty good; and the service was great."}
{"text":"Chinese food in Tempe is weak. Little Szechuan is the only joint to actually achieve wok hei, and it especially comes through in their fried beef dishes.   Do yourself a favor and make cozy with the owner until she treats you like one of her own. I'm now at the point where she asks how my mom's doing, and she's never even met her. Every conversation is like a metaphorical punch card, and when it's full, you get welcome hugs and cookies on Christmas."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a first date. Skip Changs and go somewhere off the beaten path. I promise you won't regret it. The little Szechuan chow mein is full of greens, rich and delicious. Head over for lunch for less than the price of Panda Express. Support local cuisine. Super friendly staff and the place is magical. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"The taste is really good here. But I would suggest not to order anything to go. It is a mess. I never got anything exactly what I ordered to go. Today got egg soup instead of Hot and Sour."}
{"text":"I usually order take out here and usually it is good. I SAY that lightly.  Recently, I was craving chinese and figured hey- this place is usually good why not try it out as a sit down?  My boyfriend and I went on our long travel.. approx 5 minutes down the road and sat down.  The hostess was really sweet.  And got our drink order and refills quickly. They had a vast beer selection which the boyfriend LOVED. His  beer was ice cold just the way he likes it.  We ordered. We first got our soups. Mine was pretty good. He liked his. That is where things hit the fan. The eggrolls were satisfactory. I make better ones.  Secondly, the crab puffs which I asked intially if they used any or fake crab  they said- No just cream cheese which I thought was great until I cracked it open. Had FAKE crab, which will end me up in Tempe St. Lukes quicker than  Tempe PD arresting an underage drinker. Then our dishes arrived already hungry from the teaser of a soup. I got the beef and broccoli that was tough. My boyfriend got the orange beef which I thought was significantly better... even cold.  So over all everything minus the crab puff incident.  It was a 4 star place. But that definitely knocked it down a notch, and it would of been lower if I actually ate it."}
{"text":"I ordered a to go after work. Took more than 30 mins. Ordered a rice soup which was a serving for 2 people but after arriving home saw just a small cup of soup that was spilled by the time i reached home. It was in a paper cup without a proper sealed lid. Went there by reading yelp review. Very dissapointed."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Tempe. Family run business with great ambience and super friendly staff. And 10/10 that Mongolian Beef and their dumplings are so yummm!!!!! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. The owner is kind and respectful and little Szechuan is everything you want out of a small family owned business. I will continue to come back time and time again!"}
{"text":"This has become my favorite Chinese restaurant.   The food is amazing, and at a good price.  They are able to make some of my favorite dishes gluten free.   The staff is awesome.  I've been Going there for lunch twice a week for a little over a month now and have not once been disappointed.   Their Kung Pao chicken is on point."}
{"text":"I believe everyone been through this, where they have been going to the same favorite food spot then one day they just close up and break our hearts. Today this happen but after yelping found a new place to call home. Lemon chicken is juicy and tender as well as the sweet and sour pork.  Tasty egg drop soup and friendly service. Happy to find a new Chinese place to take my family."}
{"text":"I was searching for a new place to eat when I came across the raving reviews of Little Szechuan. I took the chance and ordered take out. Im so glad I did, the food was fresh, hot, and absolutely delicious. The wait wasn't too bad and the staff was helpful and extremely nice about everything. I say try it, I believe you\"ll be impressed."}
{"text":"Not worth the hour wait for gross dried out food that came all at once.  Was told everything is made fresh to order when I couldn't even eat it bc it tasted like old socks but then the chef came out and told is it's pre made that's why it's so bland and we should have given them more specific cooking instructions. So the food is pre made and microwaved essentially. Who knows how long it has been in their fridge. Not good, I would never go back."}
{"text":"cheaper than a pair of chop sticks.   food wise: I have been to lots of Chinese restaurants in NJ, MA, GA and NY, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. and this one provides food that we call it \"'Chinese food' for Americans\". Even on that standard, i give it a 1 out of 5.  service wise: the 5 of us were from out of town for a conference after which we thought we could have some snack food w/ beer back in hotel. therefore, we paid this place a visit. One of my friends is vegetarian so we ordered egg roll for him. we ordered 3 from appetizer menu and one dish. that takes them 30 minutes to make. Then before i left with my takeout, i checked the bag and there were only 2 pairs of chopsticks! I told the woman (mid-age) there we have 5 ppl. and she gave me 2 more pairs. I asked her for one more pair and she said to me \"you don't need chopsticks to eat egg roll,\" in referring to my vegetarian friend. Out of disgust, i asked her \"does one extra pair gonna cost you anything?\" and she replied w/ her high pitch voice, \"everything costs money!\"   I have never been to a restaurant which would argue w/ customers over a pair of chop stick."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal in this place. Quite the contrary actually, I've always had great eats in this place.  My girlfriend's family is a chore to go out and eat with, and my food allergies tend to compound this complexity even further. Her mom and dad have recently gone Vegan, she's a vegetarian, and I can't eat chicken or fish due to some pretty industrial allergies.  So most places just aren't options for us to all go out to eat. One of us will always slight the deal, making it so we can go get water as a group.  But Little Szechuan takes care of all of our various and complex dietary needs like champions. The food is delicious, the service is funny and gets the job done, and the decor is vintage 1970's Jewish Christmas.   If you want a great meal, and you like to eat as a group, drive out to Tempe and make it happen. Keep local business alive instead of going to a chain!"}
{"text":"This place is has the best food, at the best price, with the most fantastic service. Highly suggest you eat here if your in the mood for Chinese food! Don't get Panda Express!"}
{"text":"Food was great, staff was very friendly, low prices. The only downside is they were VERY BUSY and it took a long time to be seated. They have lots of tofu options which is great for vegans ect. Expect a short wait if you come for lunch, but great value and great food!!"}
{"text":"I came here because of all the great reviews, so maybe I was just unlucky.  The staff was hard to find and the food slow to arrive. I don't consider myself too picky and generally love every Chinese restaurant I go to but the food here was really, really disappointing."}
{"text":"Called and ordered for pick up on my way home from work, was told it would be 15-20 minutes. I arrived almost 10 minutes later, expecting to wait a little longer. I sat in the front for 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged I was there. Food came out shortly after, and I paid about $2 more than what I was quoted over the phone. Food was good, but the \"shareable\" portion size was small."}
{"text":"I don't see what all the rave reviews are about.  We weren't impressed by the service at all.  The waitress did not know much about the menu - couldn't answer basic questions about several dishes, my husband and I ordered a pot of tea but only got one cup and took at least ten minutes to flag someone down to get another cup, our family of six waited ten or more minutes between the first dishes and the rest of our order so the first people's food got cold, we finally had to ask for rice - not delivered with the entrees, etc., etc.  The food was OK but certainly nothing out of the ordinary.  We have been to China at least eight times and did not think this food was nearly as good as what we have there.  We did see the lady who seemed to be the owner walking around but she made no contact with our table.  We would not go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place! As a Tempe native that grew up down the street I have eaten here my entire life and am always excited to stop here when I'm back in town. My family still visits every week or two. I grew up eating the meat dishes and they were all amazing, but in the last couple years have switched to the vegetarian ones. My favorites are the moo shoo (veggie now, pork before), spicy chinese eggplant with this amazing sauce, and my absolute favorite is the spicy cabbage, it's truly a wonderful thing.   The service here is also excellent, the owners are really wonderful people that go above and beyond to make you feel like family when you visit. They are also incredibly understanding about any dietary needs and have a very adaptable menu. They have even made my family things off menu to make sure everyone had something delicious regardless of dietary restrictions.   I really can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Their ma-po tofu was excellent and I got take out for lunch."}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful!  We got take out from this place on our first night in the neighborhood almost eight years ago and it was really bad.  The other night, craving Chinese food, we thought we'd give them another shot.  We hoped they had learned something about cooking Chinese food over the last eight years, but unfortunately for us, they have not.  The hot and sour soup was all sour and no hot and just tasted bad.  The chow mein was made with super thick gummy  noodles, flavorless sauce and one slice of carrot.  The orange chicken was at least edible but was over-breaded and in a sauce that tasted like it was out of a jar.  And there was a false bottom of shredded cabbage in the orange chicken container just to take up space.  And what's with the decor?  Its like dining in the middle of a garage sale."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  I have been eating here for years since living in Tempe and now I drive my family from Phoenix whenever we want Chinese food.  The service is great--the business is local, family-owned and the owners are gracious and friendly.  The prices are very reasonable and the food is yummy.  What more could you ask for?  I am a vegetarian and I have eaten just about everything vegetarian on the menu.  They have several tofu dishes that I enjoy--try the Kung Pao Tofu or Spicy Tofu if you like hot.  The Moo Shu tofu is also a delicious dish if you aren't into spicy.  For extra spice, the owner makes a very tasty hot chile sauce from scratch.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the sauce!  Give Little Szechuan a try--you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Little Szechuan for years and I am never disappointed. I wouldn't say this is authentic Szechuan but it is actually Chinese food. This place is owned by a family and the parents moved to the States from China. The decor is cute and includes many art in the style of china, the food is pretty typical dishes of seafood, chicken, beef, pork, and vegetarian options. If you're a food snob, probably not the best place for you, if you want a nice warm meal and looking for Chinese, this is the place for you. Wide verity of options, only type of restaurant like this I've seen with Salads. That's right, salads. Soups, fried rice, many appetizers, and meal options.   I've brought many friends to this place to show off, and it's gone over well, they've all returned or gone with me again. The women who is always there is very kind and gets to know the frequent customers as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I stopped by Little Szechuan today for lunch with a coworker. I told him the food was okay, nothing spectacular or memorable. The food is so-so and we needed to kill half an hour. So we decided to eat here rather than Chili's down the street since he had never been here before.  I've been here about a dozen times over about 5 years. It isn't the first place I think of when I want Asian food, but it is close to ASU and the price is right for lunch.  Did I mention that the food was not memorable? Today I had a dish I won't soon forget for its insipidness and service that was downright abysmal.   Usually I stick with something straightforward here like Beef and Broccoli or Chicken and Vegetables. I thought I would try something different after hearing the person next to us order Garlic Chicken. I frequently order Garlic Chicken from Mr. Hunan down the street. But for some reason, I didn't think to go there today.  I usually order it as a take away from Mr. Hunan.   My partner ordered Teriyaki Chicken, of all things. When our dishes arrived, the chicken was generous on both dishes, but it was prepared in the same manner for both dishes. It was thickly breaded and deep fried chunks. His chicken was piled high but was bone dry. There was a ramekin of teriyaki sauce next to the chicken. The ramekin was half filled with teriyaki sauce--not enough to fully cover the chicken if poured over the chicken and not enough sauce to dip every piece of chicken. There were no vegetables, pineapple or anything else I tend to associate with Teriyaki Chicken. The plate had chunks of fried chicken, teriyaki sauce on the side and a pile of fried rice.   My pile of Garlic Chicken was the same breaded and fried chicken. Most of the chicken was coated with the garlic sauce and onions that was part of the dish. Some of the chicken was again bone dry. It was obvious that the chicken had been cooked separately from the onions and sauce. The sauce and onions were poured over the chicken rather than mixing the chicken, onions and sauce together in a wok.  And when I say onions and sauce, it is no exaggeration. The garlic sauce consisted of sliced white onions and 2-inch lengths of green onion. I took one bite of the chicken and it was crunchy and salty. It was the only bite I took of the dish. I lifted some of the chicken and onions to see how much sauce there was and the plate was visible beneath the chicken. There wasn't enough sauce to even give a thin coat on the plate. I pushed the plate away and sat there drinking hot tea while my partner finished his dish.  The waiter walked by our table at least 4 times and saw that I had pushed the dish to the edge of the table to be cleared away, but he didn't stop to ask if anything was wrong. In fact, he took a detour on one of the visits to the table behind us--it looked like he was trying to steer clear of our table. I purposely didn't flag him down. I wanted to see if he would stop by and check with our table, but he never did.  When my partner finished, we sat for a while at the table, but eventually we had to walk up to the counter to get our bill--not the usual practice here. They bring the bill along with a fortune cookie. We stood at the counter for a while and the waiter finally showed up to ring us up. He told me the total, but I told him I was not paying for my dish since I thought it was horrid. He took the charge off the bill without question. I did not leave a tip and we left.   I will go back to this place. Probably for my usual once a year visit. And I will order my usual nondescript meal. If you want Chinese food near ASU, you are pretty limited on choices.   Again, we should have gone to Mr. Hunan, but I never think of Mr. Hunan as a place to sit and eat. Their Garlic Chicken is really tasty. It has thin slices of tender chicken with a good mix of vegetables including  onions, mushrooms, water chestnuts, broccoli, and carrots. Their sauce is delicious. There is plenty of the brown sauce to drizzle over the rice and I find the rice and sauce combination to be as good a treat as eating the chicken and vegetables."}
{"text":"Everything was pretty good. Dont know if i would go out of my way but if i am near would go again. Wife loved the vegitable egg rolls and the beef on a stick was yummy. Kids also enjoyed tne sweet and sour chicken."}
{"text":"Home cooking at its best! I have been eating here for nearly 30 years eeekkk! The food is as good today as it was the first day."}
{"text":"Quick, tasty, and affordable. Restaurant staff and owner are super friendly."}
{"text":"Wow, I walked in around 6:30p Sunday and stood around for a few minutes waiting to be seated, but there was no employee in sight. I walked around the dining area, tried peering into the kitchen, and even walked behind the bar to see if anyone would come out and notice. And then... I just left, probably could have taken a few shots for the road."}
{"text":"My bf and I stumbled upon this place thanks to Yelp. We were skeptical of the 'vegan' part until we saw the menu and talked with Swanie. We love that they make pretty much everything from scratch. It really allows us to veganize most dishes. Point being, many dishes to choose from for everyone's taste, variety of what you would expect and some 'American Chinese' food for those who are used to that sort. Lovely place we will visit time and time again."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waitress' don't even speak to the customers. I felt like I had to tell them how to do their jobs. Never coming back again. Food was below average."}
{"text":"Pretty decent chinese food (by Arizona standards) at low prices. Friendly service, local charm, and while they do not deliver themselves, doordash does. They also serve beer.   As far as the menu, I would recommend the pot stickers, won ton soup, house chicken, and chicken or pork fried rice."}
{"text":"Great house-made dumplings and other tasty traditional and fusion-style Chinese dishes. The owner is exceptionally friendly, and is recreating recipes that have been handed down from her parents. We highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you like spicy food. Seems to a favorite among ASU students."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed. I'm really not sure any other way to put it. The food just wasn't as flavorful as I was expecting and this was my second time ordering from this place. I read all the rave reviews but ultimately, this place really fell short. My mongolian beef wasn't even full to the top of the box and it was the most expensive thing that we ordered- $10.75. Everything else was kind of meh. Sweet and sour chicken was okay, decent enough, not too sweet. The lo-mein noodles were just really big and thick but had no flavor. You know what they say- fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."}
{"text":"My husband I were looking for a place to have an nice date night dinner and we were pleasantly surprised to find this place. The staff was incredibly friendly and took the time to know their guest. The food was quiet good as well, portions size didn't disappoint, and price was reasonable.   The best thing about this place was the music and trivia games on the table. This provided us with something to engage in throughout dinner and more than anything it paved the way to a good conversation about funny and random things. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The menu here is hit or miss, but when it hits, it definitely hits.  I'd recommend trying the spicy eggplant and the veggie mu shu.  the mu shu remains my favorite of almost everywhere i've ever eaten - and i got around chinatown in chicago, believe you me.  the rest of the menu that i've tried is average-to-good, but those two dishes really are worth a visit, especially at lunch time.  the restaurant itself?  i love the unintentionally kitschy aspect of it.  the superfriendly staff have been there a long, long time, and have obviously decorated how they want to see it.  after ducking in there every couple months while going to school down the street, it started to feel like my second living room."}
{"text":"Little Szechuan serves delicious food with a home-like feel. The owners truly care about the food they serve and it's wonderful to see their passion. We spent time talking to them and grew fond of their personal story and success of a small mom and pop business. I have been hooked since the first visit. I genuinely look forward to my visits to Little Szechuan."}
{"text":"I go to Little Szechuan about 6-8 times a year. Always pleased with my meal and service. Buddha Delight is probably my favorite entrée on the menu. Crisp, fresh veg and savory sauce. Owner is delightful. Atmosphere is calm and relaxing. Nice environment to have a quiet dinner or catch up with friends.  My friends and family from out of town always enjoy this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of our valley favorites!  The spicy Szechuan noodle soup is a must with each meal.  Everything we have tried has been good Chinese food, although somewhat Americanized to entertain the palates of their customer base.  The owner is very nice and attentive and remembers our names and our favorite dishes despite the fact that we make it in only once a month or so."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic and the owner, Swani, is the sweetest lady! The building is nothing too flashy, very casual atmosphere. The service is definitely top notch here and the house chicken is always delicious.   They have a great lunch special, but make sure to check the hours before visiting, as they do close for a short period during the afternoon."}
{"text":"I think it was A-OK because we were REALLY hungry. You know, everything tastes better when you're super hungry. We ordered the Kung Poa chicken and some BBQ pork noodles. They were both alright...not something we would order again. The waiter never came by after dropping of the food. The drinks are incredibly cheap... So, there's that"}
{"text":"Both the soup and entree were VERY sour, and I have worked in a Chinese restaurant and been to China years ago. Sadly, I cannot recommend this place."}
{"text":"I used to eat here every few weeks and I really enjoyed it.  I'm no connoisseur of Chinese food, but this place is far and away more authentic, at least, than the American chain places, and the prices are really affordable.  The service is great and the menu substantial.    Try the Sun Devil Chicken, if they still have it on the menu.  A bit spicy, but I always enjoyed it."}
{"text":"We had a great time getting to know the owner Swani. She and her husband shared how they have been in business here in Tempe for almost 40 years. The food and service are top knotch! They were even nice enough to accommodate our huge party of 30 people.  Thank you for the great service and amazing food. We will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going here with my boyfriend for lunch cause its really cheap. It comes with very tasty hot tea and either egg drop or hot and sour soup and wontons (maybe filled with cheese and meat?) all for less than 10 dollars. I usually get their house special chicken which is very tasty but be sure to ask for extra yummy sauce since it tends to be dry without it. Wish their lunch hour would extend til 3:30 like most Chinese places. And its americanized Chinese. If you want authentic, go to the Chinese cultural center."}
{"text":"I love this place! The signage and building aren't flashy, but the food is always yummy and satisfying. My favorite is the hot & sour soup (good spice but not too hot, and a nice meaty flavor that is often lacking elsewhere), although I've had serious next day cravings for pretty much everything I've ordered here! The owner is super nice too. Previous reviewers have been wary of the place being empty, but usually when I'm there several people stop in to get their carry out too, so I think that's what a lot of their customers do. Mmm now I want to order more!"}
{"text":"Cute little space just off the beaten path, but still on a main stretch of University Dr. Locally-owned and run by the nicest lady ever. They make a mean hot and sour soup and have a lot of options for vegetarians, too. While their menu consists mostly of oily Americanized Chinese comfort classics, they still have their own touches of authenticity to them. Comfortable, casual, and tasty. Not my first choice for Chinese food in the greater Phoenix area, but so glad that they're there."}
{"text":"Service sucks! Waited 20 minutes with no service! Other people came in after us and had their orders taken. Servers disregarded the fact that we were ready to order and walked past us to clean a table that could have been cleaned after taking our order! Very white washed of a Chinese restaurant and not authentic from what was saw on the menu!"}
{"text":"These potstickers are lifechanging.  Seriously.  Swani is a sweet lady that seems to actually care about the food she serves people, and it shows.  Their spicy beef was actually spicy, the beef was cooked fantastically, the lo mein noodles on another dish were heavenly.  But those potstickers?  Those potstickers are lifechanging.  Hand-made, pan-cooked, THEY.  ARE.  PERFECT."}
{"text":"Having been new to community 3 years ago, walked in this restaurant and felt at home. The owners and employees are great and really care about your eating experience.  The food is fabulous and extremely full of flavor. If you have specific needs they will adapt any dish for you."}
{"text":"So friendly and welcoming.  The owner sent us some soup to enjoy while we waited for our order knowing we were from out of town and would probably never come again.  The food was a little better than most Chinese food in this price range outside of china town in any city USA. I had the moo shu vegetables and the pancakes tasted like they were freshly made, not the usual thin hard ones you get with take out.  Over all food was tasty and not greasy. The outside does look a little creepy, even my 12 year old commented on how unfriendly the door is. Well, maybe they are screening their clients.   If I was a local I would make this one if my regular casual dining  spots."}
{"text":"The employees are always always so friendly! Great service and food! They can do a bunch of dishes gluten free which is a bonus considering I have celiac. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Whenever I can recommend a good Chinese restaurant in the area, I have to mention Little Szechuan. I love their food, especially the chow mein! The owner is one of the nicest women I've ever had the pleasure to meet. Thank you very much for your smile and kindness---it goes a long way!"}
{"text":"Super busy, no staff, sat for 20 minutes before we could even put our order in.... didn't stay to find out if the food was good or not..."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and received only 2/3 of our order, with plenty of attitude. Had to ask for plates and napkins. Food is very average and a little watery. Hot n sour soup was delightful."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch was a little nervous because there was about 2 other tables and it was lunch time. I wasn't sure if it would be good but glad I gave it a try. The chow mien was very tasty. The noodles were cooked very nice and they had very nice flavor. I also had the orange chicken which wasn't as tangy as other places which I liked. The fried rice was ok, I personally like it with a little veggies but this one is just plain rice. The flavor was just ok. They do have coke products which was awesome. I think I would come back for lunch again the price was decent and for the size of the plates I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! Local mom and pop restaurant with fresh, clean, and absolutely delicious food. The owners maintain their passion for cooking even after 40 years of owning the restaurant. They specialize in traditional Chinese dishes with a unique and authentic flavor palette.  The quality of food easily surpassed the price.  This place is a must! I'd recommend the ma-po tofu."}
{"text":"This is the Absolute WORST Chinese food that I have ever had. Hot & sour soup was very sour and had a horrible chemical taste. The Kung pow beef was deep fried & stuck together all while being completely flavorless. This is the human equivalent of cheap dog food!"}
{"text":"Best Szechuan Noodle Soup ever!! Long wait for take out but worth it! They said this review was too short .. Looked cozy inside will be going back for a sit down dinner."}
{"text":"Consistently great food. Service can be a little slow but is worth it!  Definitely recommend trying the house chicken and their lo mein is a nice change from the regular.  Portions are huge! Expect to eat past full at least twice from a single dinner combo with some leftover!"}
{"text":"Egg foo young was good - the other dishes were average - waited 40m for check once dinner was done - will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for at least ten years. It's one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the valley. Their food is always excellent. The family that owns it is very friendly and welcoming. Their lunch and dinner combination plates are a great deal. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"It was nice and quaint. Delicious food especially the egg foo young pork dish. The owner was super friendly and fun to chat with."}
{"text":"Good dumplings. Takes a while to cook and receive but worth it. \"Homemade\". Dough very good and filling very tasty with a garlicky soy dipping sauce with a little kick. Very good."}
{"text":"I remember coming here for the first time with my boyfriend right after his apartment flooded due to his upstairs neighbors. His spirits were very low but we decided to come here so he could cheer up a little. We ordered takeout and the main lady (sorry I cannot recall her name) was so sweet and caring without having a clue of our situation. She even gave us cookies which my boyfriend still recounts! We loved the food and the considerate service here!"}
{"text":"Came here with some coworkers craving some Asian food, and was pleasantly surprised by both the quality and the quality of food. Most of us opted for the dinner combo, which gives you some appetizers (wontons and an eggroll) as well as an entree. I got the sweet and sour shrimp which came with a TON of chow mein and rice. It was honestly enough for three meals, and with tax + tip my bill came out to just above $10. We were all fairly impressed with the food - the only unsatisfying part was the egg drop soup, which was pretty flavorless.  Coming from California tends to make us snobby because we're spoiled with the best Asian food but it was a great value and a good experience."}
{"text":"I have been trying to find real dumplings - NOT potstickers - here in AZ for quite some time and I finally have. My family of 4 went for dinner on a Sunday at 6:30. I only went because their pictures looked like they had real dumplings and also, my family likes Chinese food so I figured we all win. We got shrimp fried rice, pepper steak, chicken with broccoli, chicken lomein, seaweed soup and the bobo platter. The dumplings were exactly what I wanted to find and all the rest of the food was fresh and delicious. We left completely satisfied. The place is simple but clean and the service was friendly and fast. I will def remember this place next time I'm craving dumplings. Cosmo was on point."}
{"text":"Ordered take out today for lunch. The food was fantastic. Very flavorful and the ingredients taste fresh. The environment in the restaurant was so warm and welcoming. It was busy with dine in and take out customers and they were still very quick and friendly. The owner, who was working, took the time to stop and make sure I had been helped and joked with me.  Wonderful place. Will recommend to anyone looking for good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Used to come here back in the day and glad to see it is still around. Love the food and the owners. Their Mapo dofu is the best I've had since coming back from living in Asia, and it's not even on the menu. They'll do things in Chinese style if you ask, or make it so it matches your idea of Americanized Chinese food (which my husband likes). Still glad they are around and still awesome."}
{"text":"First of all, cute spacious chinese restaurant. The older woman who seats you is an incredible PEOPLE person, talked to us almost the whole meal. Very nice lady. Food was really good, definitely high end on the fast and cheap chinese food spectrum."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for about 4 years and it is my favorite in Tempe! I always get the mu shoo vegetable with the plum sauce and it is really good. The best part is the woman who always seems to be working here. She is so kind and warmly greets me every time and puts a smile on my face! I love seeing her and coming to this place."}
{"text":"Best Asian food in phoenix, lady that owns the place has the best customer service. Prices are good and food is great. Defiantly worth a trip in."}
{"text":"I have had trouble finding good Chinese food in Arizona and this place continues my search. Let me also state that if you're Chinese this place will probably not suffice.   I ordered the Mongolian beef dinner combo. The noodles were alright, the rice was stiff, and the beef itself had good flavor but there was only 7 pieces of meat. However, the noodles and 2 pieces of meat made great leftovers the next day.  I also ordered a side of potstickers which was also very disappointing. It was very doughy and the meat was weirdly compacted. I've had potstickers before but I'm telling you the meat was like a literal golf ball in terms of consistency. Since I couldn't get past that I don't know what it actually tastes like.   The waiter was kind but service was very slow even though it wasn't very busy."}
{"text":"This place is decent. I wish there was soup covered in the lunch special, and an eggroll or crab puff included, instead of the fried wonton, but all in all not bad.  Normal pricing for this type of cuisine."}
{"text":"The food here isn't too much to write home about, but the service was top of the line.  Our server shared a very touching story in broken English after I mentioned I liked the crab rangoons. She pointed to a recently empty table and said that they couple were in the airforce and recently married and that Little Szechuan had made and gifted over 200 rangoons as a wedding gift for their service for \"our freedom.\" I wish I had recorded it because her broken English made it that much more memorable and touching.   I thought it was totally sweet and would support any restaurant with that kind of heart behind it.  Plus, the beers were flowing and our food fresh and hot even though we were clearly the last customers on a Friday night. Score!"}
{"text":"Real good Chinese food. Home cooking with great service and clean great food. I had the chicken fried teriyaki fried rice and soup.  Excellent"}
{"text":"Honestly this place is great!! Me and the Hubs stopped by here to get some food an hour before our movie. It was not terribly busy and they were able to sit us down right away. We ordered Egg Rolls to start us off. Which they were amazing nice flavor and decent size..   For the meal I ordered the MooShu with Chicken.  Hubs order the Kung Pou chicken  So we got our dinner.. the MooShu came with 5 rolled crepe burritos with MooShu sauce.. mouth watering goodness and it was a bite of heaven.   The Kung Pou chicken was good says the Hubs.. which by the way he downed and took my MooShu sauce. Ha   Would definitely come back and we made it in time for the movie!"}
{"text":"Two thumbs up for yet another dive here in town.  This little place is located directly across from Oreganos so the next time you find yourself waiting in an endless line there, look across the street and you'll find some delicious Chinese food!  We found this place after attempting to go to Oreganos and were delightfully surprised. It is a stand-alone restaurant--not part of a strip mall.  The decor is tacky and gaudy, but there is a warmth there because the family who owns and operates the place makes you feel welcome from the start.  The food was very good. I had the moo shu pork and my son had chicken lo mein. The lo mein noodles are homemade and are thick! The moo shu was well done and the owner hand wrapped them for me herself. We also had the BoBo platter which is their version of PuPu and it was the typical fare but just seemed more fresh tasting. Everything was served piping hot which as we all know is a rarity in restaurants these days. Everything was flavorful and delicious.   The service was excellent. The owner is sweet and kind and her son is the cook. They did great work and the next time I go to Gammage, I'm making a point to hit up Little Szechuan for our meal!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I skipped the restaurant scene for Valentine's day and decided to order carry-out later on in the night. I have heard good things about this place but was surprised to see such negative reviews on Yelp. It seems, though, that people review based on the most amazing Chinese they've ever had and tend to get snobbish about it... I love Chinese food but I am certainly not an expert on places in the area so we decided to give this place a try anyway. I'm glad we did.   The lady who took my order on the phone was very nice and courteous and seemed very warm when she greeted us in the restaurant.  I ordered the Chicken Chow Mein and my boyfriend ordered the Sun Devil Spicy Chicken. I am always weary about ordering chicken dishes from chinese restaurants because sometimes the chicken can be just weird and disgusting but I was pleasantly surprised at how good the chicken tasted in the Chow Mein. The noodles were really thick, which is just the way I like them to be and the sauce tasted awesome as well. My boyfriend really liked his dish and was satisfied with how spicy it was... usually he orders a spicy dish and it is no where close to being spicy.  Although we did not dine in the restaurant, we thought it looked cute and cozy, even though it looked a bit outdated. I'd like to see what it's like to dine in next time... and I will definitely be ordering carry-out again!"}
{"text":"Bad service and bad food. I ordered pickup from Grub Hub & a friend decided to join me to eat-in. When we walked in, we were seated by a disheveled looking \"hostess\". I start explaining that I've ordered my meal for pick-up on Gurb Hub but would like to eat-in and that my friend will order as well, but the \"hostess\" interrupts me rudely and says to tell my waiter. She said, \"I'm only the marketing person here.\" We were ignored for 10 minutes - no drink no food order. Then I told 2 waiters about my pickup order, both ignored me! My friend ordered the peppered beef, it was subpar with literally 4 pieces of beef and mostly onion and bell pepper. The egg drop soup was disgusting. I ordered the chicken Lo-mien and could not eat any of it. Only gem here was the hot and sour soup - delicious. I've been here twice before and never experienced such poor service and unappetizing dishes. Hope you guys can get your food and staff in order."}
{"text":"Food was not great at all. Go to CHINA CHILI for the best chinese food in town. Atmosphere not great either. Just dumpy"}
{"text":"They are okay, good service. Good egg soup. I really enjoyed their egg rolls. Chow mein isn't the best"}
{"text":"Special gem! Great small family restaurant, amazing food, terrific prices, and a very friendly staff. I went with a large group (20 people), we called at the last minute and they took great care of us. I would highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"I have only ordered takeout from here, and have not tried their new delivery service yet. They are a convenient place to go when I get hit with a craving for Chinese food. Very reasonably priced and I have always been satisfied with my food.   First time I ordered form here was on a Friday afternoon. I had some kind of a lunch combo with assorted vegetables, fried rice, and noodles. The portions were generous and the veggies were tasty. When I went to pick it up, I met the owner and she joked with me about how healthy I was ordering vegetables. She was sweet and helpful. There was no one seated in the place and I wondered if it got enough traffic.   The next time was on a Friday and I ordered pick up for me and my boyfriend. We ordered egg rolls, dumplings, chicken with broccoli and veggies with crispy tofu. I came in to pick it up and it was the first time I had seen people sitting down inside. I was greeted by the hostess and she said the food will be out soon. food came out piping hot, and everything was accounted for. I think it was about 25$ total. When I got home we plated our food and dug in. The veggies were super fresh and colorful. The sauce and the tofu was tasty. My boyfriend said his was good and shared a dumpling. I thought they were a little doughy but they looked hand made and not frozen. Everything seemed up to par with every other Chinese food place I have had. I liked my food a lot and will be back for future nights when I have a craving for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food I have ever had the pleasure of eating! Dumplings, beef and broccoli, and hot and sour soup were all fantastic. Swani, the owner, is one of the nicest ladies I have ever met. She took the time to accommodate us with everything (including free oranges upon request). She clearly is the mom figure to a lot of ASU students. Go here, support her, and get some awesome food!"}
{"text":"Food was alright. The rice was great, service was great, tofu was great, teriyaki was a little off (almost burnt) but I would give another shot!"}
{"text":"Little Szechuan is by far the best place to grab food in Tempe - not just Chinese food. Swanee (the owner) is the nicest, friendliest person in the world and will make you feel like you're welcome instantly. And the food is AMAZING. I come here pretty much every week (or even more often) with my girlfriend and sometimes other friends and roommates. My favorite is the Sriracha chicken - try it if you like a little bit of spice. The $5 Sake Bombs are worth every penny. You get 4 of them so it goes a long way, for an already incredible price. The atmosphere is very relaxing too, great little spot to grab food and drinks, not too flashy but not too casual. Come with friends, family, or strangers- you're going to have a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great meal! The food was delicious and served promptly. The older woman who worked there (I think she was the owner) was extremely friendly and you could tell she cared about the quality of food that was served in the restaurant. The wait staff was also very friendly and helpful. Also the drinks here are INSANELY cheap. I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We just moved in next door and we love this place! The owners are super nice and it's overall a wonderful vibe. Food is fantastic, our favorites are the fried rice, especially shrimp fried rice, orange chicken and lemon chicken. Would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Everytime I stop by Tempe camera I have to grub here. Their beef and broccoli is amazing and they know how to add the heat.  Very friendly staff too."}
{"text":"That place explodes with flavor and tje the environment has the feeling of China. I recommend thhis place highly!  Everyhing is made with family old school recipe. The owner goes to each family rable and asks you what you like. That is so incredible."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I ordered Chicken Chow Mein and the noodles were thick and delicious.  Though I'm giving it 3 stars because it looks like a complete dive - you cannot see in the windows from the outside and the door even is whited out. I didn't understand.  Inside it was good. We came about 2:15 and they were closing for a bit at 2:30 so I felt bad. The waiter was nice and friendly and prompt (for the most part) so that was assuring. Everything made my mouth water.  We walked here from College & University so it was a bit of a trek. I felt the staff (or the ones I encountered) were occupied since they were beginning to close. We were the only ones there due to the time and at one point - locked in. But hey, if I feel like making the trek again, I'll go back."}
{"text":"Swani is a nice lady. She always take care of me every time I came here and always gave me extra chilis since she knew I love spicy food.  But yeah sometimes you need to wait bit long to get your order especially during the peak time, so usually I order for pick-up."}
{"text":"I reather enjoy this place.  The food is overall pretty damn decent and it's not expensive.  The crab puffs are really good.  I wanted to crawl inside of it, camp for three days and eat my way out like a tarantula wasp larva, but I had work....  It goes without saying, but the service is incredible.  Everyone mentions it.  The lady who works there gave me soup on the house simply because my girlfriend ordered a meal with it and I didn't and didn't want me to be lonely and without something to eat.  That's rad.  As I was leaving she also gave us free cookies.  Fuck yeah!  Each time I've been here, there've been loud-as-hell people for some reason.  One time I went and there must've been, a World of Warcraft convention in town or something because there was a table full of kids with plastic battleaxes telling jokes with such punchlines as, \"Wookie bowcaster,\" and \"Purple light sabers!\""}
{"text":"One word: Meh.  Bland, poor service, just nothing to bring you here except maybe the cheap prices. Egg rolls and dumpling wraps were too thick, with more bland nothingness inside. Bland noodles and utterly tasteless fried rice. Main dishes slathered in greasy sauce. Even the fortune cookie tasted like paper!  Need I go on?   One redeeming quality: nice, if incompetent, service staff.   Close to ASU, so perhaps they survive on the poor college student budget. We'll certainly not bother again."}
{"text":"Get the chicken. It's the bomb.  Everything was so good and the service was very personal. Definitely a great local spot"}
{"text":"Always hot, tasty, fast and fresh!  The owners and staff are so friendly. A perfect neighborhood spot. Great bar too!"}
{"text":"Food was good...nothing over the top but FAR from disappointing. I would easily eat here again to try some different dishes. I got the fried rice (has peas and carrots) and the house chicken (a bit greasy) and both were very good."}
{"text":"This is the closest Asian food I can find in my area, I figure give it a shot.  I call in and ordered the chicken chow mein togo. For an order that's under $8 the portion is not too bad. I would like a little bit more flavor in it, but maybe I didn't order the right thing. I'm sure I'll try it again when I don't want to go far."}
{"text":"I had a craving for chinese and wanted something in a pinch.  I was looking for cheap but good.  I found Little Szechuan.  It was a short drive from my boyfriend's and still open on a Sunday night.  I think the price for the food was set high for the amount of food we got.  The service was also great.  The lady behind the counter was very nice.  She offered me water while I waited for my take out.  I didn't have to wait long.  I ordered chicken fried rice, orange chicken and crab puffs.  The crab puffs were a bit on the skimpy side, but tasted good.  The fried rice was a little dry and the orange chicken was cooked well.  There are a few other chinese restaurants I want to try, but I'll keep it on my list of possible places to go back to if I really want chinese."}
{"text":"If i could rate this place a 0 on here i would. Their service was horrible, they took forever to sit us down. Their place looks dirty and very disorganized, and that was just from the start. Then they sat us down and took FOREVER to take our order! We had to call a server over because they wouldn't come to us. I ordered the orange chicken dinner combo that came with side of egg drop soup, egg roll, crab puffs, and chow mein. The food was absolutely horrible! Super greasy and has zero taste, nothing that i got with my combo was good! I don't know why this place has 4 stars because it doesn't deserve them. It really deserves to be shut down for their shi*ty service and food!"}
{"text":"I'm so sorry because your service is rather friendly but I have to say:  Ew.   No.  Don't.  One star for food and one for service but I will never go here again. I've had my fair share of horrible American Chinese, but this I would not even finish. And there is never a time when I will pay someone more than once to make me food I will only throw away."}
{"text":"The lemon white meat chicken ($8), Mongolian beef ($9), and chicken fried rice were excellent. Had lunch here with my daughter and all the other reviewers are right--Swani is super nice and the service is friendly.   A pet peeve of mine involves Mongolian beef pieces that are too large for a single bite, and yet most Chinese restaurants only provide a plastic fork and no knife. Grrrrrrrr! The beef here was actually cut in bite sized pieces and they have REAL silverware, including a knife (didn't need it though). There are tables and chairs, one large table for larger groups, and a reasonably clean fish tank. Yep, you can be sure that your fish is indeed fresh.  I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really great food and awesome service! I was very impressed. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Always great food, and fresh! Especially the shrimp. Service is always attentive and through."}
{"text":"First of all let me start by saying I was excited to try out this new place that was recommended by a friend. I looked at the reviews and they seemed positive so today my husband and I gave it a chance. We went for dinner and although it said they opened at 5, the doors weren't unlocked until 5:10, that's okay no biggie us and a few other couples were waiting outside. Then we hear a click, and we didn't know if it was open or not because no one bothered to greet us or let us know that it was okay to come in. Once we entered there was a young girl who turned out to be waitress/hostess. They had a a sign that said \"please wait to be seated\" and as we waited the girl who never said hi or greeted us properly just told us which table to sit on. She didn't even take us to our seat, her words were pretty much \"you sit on the corner table to the left\". My husband and I politely sat down, she gave us menus and walked away. We were then greeted by a really nice Asian lady, who must have been the owner or manager. She really made us feel welcomed and was smiling and happy, however she only greeted us and took our appetizer order and we didn't see her until the end. Another young man brought us two empty plates we told him we were ready to order and we went to grab the other girl. When she came to our table she just stood there in front of us, didn't say a word so I gave her our order. She brought us drinks, never asked if we had questions. Once we were eating she was helping other people, she checked on the table next to us ask them if they needed anything else and never checked once on my husband and I. After a while of giving her the benefit of the doubt, I decided to call her since she was on a table close to us. As she was walking away after looking at us and ignoring us, I said \"excuse me\" she looked at me and raised her finger as if telling me to wait and walked away. She went back to refill other peoples drinks without them asking and she never once refilled ours until I asked her to. The food was decent, the owner was nice, but if I had any thoughts about going back I would never do if that waitress is going to be there. I am in the customer service business myself and she was not friendly at all and never checked on our table. If I wanted to see long faces, deal with rude people and be ignored for Something I'm going to pay, I'll just stay home and would not recommend it!"}
{"text":"Nice little place with a very nice staff and an ABSOLUTELY AMAZING lunch special. They have a bar and TV, but I have yet to experience that. So 4 stars.. For now! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food and better prices.Very affordable and they give you tons of food! Be careful with your spice level however as some of the food is very spicey!"}
{"text":"I have often enjoyed Chinese food from a variety of places but this has to be one of my favorites. The owner is almost always in the front of the house and friendly and attentive.  The food is pretty good and it is priced well.   Dinner is better than lunch and though I have never tried the take-out option i have heard it is excellent. The food is authentic and prepared fresh. There is a bevy of options and everything I have ever eaten was tasty.  If you are looking for good authentic, though slightly simple, Chinese food then Little Szechuan is the place for you. If you are looking for more Americanized style and are unwilling to give a small local owned business then there is a PF Changs at Mill and Uni."}
{"text":"Service was amazing and friendly, food was great. Not your cookie cutter Chinese food. Everything had a unique flavor and was delicious right down to the crab puffs and pot stickers. The mushu wrapped in crepes was outstanding and a nice change."}
{"text":"First time here, but never to return.  This place is Creepy! Got the runs the next day, ugh.  :("}
{"text":"We didn't get to order food for half an hour, and the food is slow as hell. But we are sitting at an almost empty restaurant, just keep people waiting like that is unacceptable."}
{"text":"The owner of this restaurant is the sweetest person you'll ever meet! I had a large number of dumplings and potstickers catered from Little Szechuan and the owner gave me her recommendations as to what she thought people would like. They were made on time, fresh, and tasted amazing!! She also includes a sauce that's to die for it's the best sauce I've ever had with dumplings and potstickers and I have dumpling making parties at home with my friends and family. If you're in the area, dumplings are the best thing to get here! The other dishes are Szechuan style and delicious as well! I will definitely be coming back wanting to try more."}
{"text":"The incredibly nice and funny lady who owns the place deserves 5 stars alone, just for being her charismatic self. The food is pretty good, the price can't be beat, and the service is second to none. If you ever feel that you are receiving service that's less than excellent, you will promptly see the owner pull aside that employee and give them a talk to remind them of her standards, cause she's got her eyes on everything. I like always being able to get a table, but it's a shame that this place isn't more busy. It's just easy to miss driving by and the sign at night is very dim. My one and only complaint would be that the hot and sour soup could be less sour and more hot. Otherwise, expect to see me here very often :)"}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese place to eat at. Delicious all around and the service is superb. If you eat here you won't regret it I promise. Lol"}
{"text":"Horrible every thing! And I am not pick about much. I love Chinese food and all types of Asia food but the Food taste nasty and like it was under heat lamps for a whole day. Service was slow and there was barley any other customers there. And the inside environment was off setting and not the best. I almost told the waitress I was not going to pay for the meal due to I didn't even eat it really. Will never go there or recommend it to any one ever!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Really, really bad. I ordered takeout, arrived at the correct pickup time, then sat and waited for 45 minutes only to find out my order was never made. I finally had to flag down a waiter and tell them to cancel and refund my order. When the manager arrived she apologized but couldn't explain why my order was never made and didn't offer anything other than a refund."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  I really had high hopes for this place based on the reviews, but it turned out to be pretty terrible. I ordered the General Sous chicken which was soggy although the taste of the sauce was good. The chicken appears to be pretty good quality but really soggy. The chicken lo mein was the most ridiculous of any I have ever had. The noodles are huge and gross. The chicken in the dish was good but the noodles were way too big. The vege spring roll was gross and tasted like it was frozen from a box. I will keep searching for good Chinese for here in Phoenix area, but this is not it!"}
{"text":"So, before heading out to Phoenix Zoo Zoolights, we figured we go eat dinner and usually that means Thai food.  But out of nowhere I had an idea to eat something else.  We narrowed it down to Chinese but not the usual places that I like or he likes.  We wanted to try something new, a little adventure in our relationship, lol.  I don't know how we decided on this place (searched Google) but we usually stay away from places close to ASU because sometimes reviews are from students who probably thinks anything above ramen noodles is a 5 star.  No offense, I've been there.  But off we went.  First off, I like the place once inside.  Asian lamps hanging, big mural masterpieces of Asian scenery.  Most tables have lazy susans which ahhh home.  The waitress/owner was great.  She was lively, funny, engaging and overall nice.  Before I get to the food, we noticed that alot of older people (meaning over 30, like me) came in and they all seemed to know the waitress/owner so we thought this place must be great if local patrons are coming in by the numbers.  Everything that we ordered was pretty good.  But I really loved my friends' dish which was the House Special Chicken.  When I go back I will def get that.  Yummy!    And to top it all off, the waitress/owner gave us a wrapped gift saying thank you for coming.  Wha-what?  A box of cookies for a gift!  Ginger cookies and they were good."}
{"text":"I've lived 1 mile from this place for 18 yrs.  Never tried due to the mixed reviews.  Feeling adventurous,  so tonight I ordered takeout.   The Lemon Glazed chicken is a big snooze,  with what appeared to be processed chicken.  The lemon glaze was highly forgettable.   Also ordered the BoBo sampler appetizer.  Which was basically a bunch of deep fried stuff that tasted like something you'd buy in the frozen food aisle.  To me, no different than Panda Express...just pricier.  Was kinda surprised by the indoor atmosphere.  No decor whatsoever.   Very odd. Expected more. The gentleman who I paid for my order was a nice guy.  Overall,  nothing enticed me enough to make a return visit."}
{"text":"5 stars for the amazing comfort-level Chinese food. I don't know what they put in their House Chicken but it tastes like how I imagine falling in love would taste. I always get the Lo-Mein w/ Tofu for just $6.50 and the noodles are almost as fat as udon! The dumplings (steamed) are my favorite appetizer there.  My boyfriend calls the nice owner lady his Chinese Grandma because she is just so personable and remembers her customers! She really is a sweet lady who will give you a fun, pleasant dinner.  Only bad thing I can say is sometimes there are too many people which backs up the kitchen, but that's just what happens when you find a truly great restaurant. If you happen to come at a busy busy time, just know it's worth the wait and Swani the owner appreciates your patience."}
{"text":"I would have enjoyed my moo shu pork if the pork itself had been remotely warm. I was suspicious when it came out prerolled and not prepared table side. The waitress offered to have it remade but the owner came out and refused to remake it just to take it off the bill. So I said I guess I can go without dinner tonight. Really not impressed really not happy with the lack of customer service. Will never go back."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a few years and have always had great service and great food.  Swani is always happy to see returning customers and pretty much greets everyone by name and she'll let you know if she hasn't seen you in a while!  If you like it spicy, my new favorite is the Sun Devil Chicken."}
{"text":"The food is best described as boring.  I've tried 3 different dishes and they all were below average at best.  One member of my party even walked out after taking a sip of his soup and a bite of his food.    Funny thing was that i went in on 4/20 once and the owner said \"remember!  4/20 today, don't party 2 much!\"    The interior is dated, but that isn't as big of a problem as the boring food.  I'm surprised they have been in business for soo long..  I wish I could give them 3 stars but I just can't :("}
{"text":"I had greater hopes for Little Szechuan over the nearby Mr. Hunan as the latter is simply a carry out joint. However, despite the nice colorful dining room, the food at Little Szechuan was fairly bland. I suppose theoretically these two Chinese joints specialize in the regional cuisine of their names, but there is little difference in menu or taste.   One thing I will say is that my waitress was extraordinarily nice at Little Szechuan. I was studying Arabic at the time and we had a really friendly, fun conversation about language. She helped make an incredibly dull meal an actually rewarding experience."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp in lobster sauce and it was delicious! I wish there were more shrimps and less green peppers though. Also the egg flower soup was good but it was spicy. I'm not used to egg flower soup being spicy. I also ordered the crab puffs and those were divine! Especially with the sweet orange sauce!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese restaurant in Tempe! The staff make you feel like you are at home every time you eat here. The food is delicious and the prices are great! You won't leave hungry! Swanie is so sweet and treats everyone like family.   Make this your new favorite Chinese food!"}
{"text":"This was a great place. Great decor and lots of light. We had the sweet and sour chicken and szeauchan shrimp, both were great. The Bo-Bo platter was great. The owner was a sweetheart and very nice. We will come back."}
{"text":"Im so sad to see so many negative reviews for this place!  Ive been going here for years. Its the best (decently priced) Chinese food Ive found in the valley.  I always get take out, but whenever I go in its empty. The lady who runs it is super sweet, she always puts extra hot mustard w/ my order. The real stuff too, not that packet disgustingness.  My wonton soup is always flavorful and tasty. They have the best chicken fried rice Ive found out here, and their crab rangoons (puffs on their menu) always satisfy."}
{"text":"Couldn't of loved the woman in charge more! She was out going, kind, and passionate about her job. I highly recommend the house chicken, it was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after passing it many times.  Glad I did.   The chicken was tender and delicious and the shrimp was cooked perfectly.   Plenty of sauce in the dish and just enough rice.   Had to try a Chinese beer for the first time.   If you want fast food Chinese go to Panda.  If you want really good Chinese served by a Husband and wife who have been doing it for years come here.   Got to meet the  Owner his wife and his Son all working there.   Live supporting these types of business."}
{"text":"The potstickers are delicious! And the noddles are bomb as well, I've tried a few other dishes such as the orange chicken and thought they were a little bland. The sake bomb deal kills the game though!"}
{"text":"Big Trouble in Little Szechuan would be too harsh a review  and  it's not worthy  of a great wail but  I was totally underwhelmed by the food on offer and food wise it seriously is   a step above the mall food court  but   even a Pei Way on a good day  is more than a match for this evening's meal.   Staff are great but  everything else is pretty weak other than the noodles which are really really good.     The spring roll, egg, hot  and sour soup and  the  kung pao all look the part but  it's all monotonous  with little variation in texture and taste.  E.g you could  make this from  Walmart  ingredients and get the same kinda shiny sauce for about the same cost     It's not going to kill you and for lunch at a reduced rate may get to 2.5 to 3 but  there's just way too many good places nearby to consider this as a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Ok...so again, after reading the reviews I was really looking forward to taking care of a crazy Chinese food jones that I'd been having for a couple days.  I don't know, maybe Aunt Flo was coming to town - who knows.  That said America, this place was soooo not up to its 4-star rating...no sir.   I got back to my hotel, got my bed reDy to assume the psuedo \"dining in, in my hotel\" position (life on the road can be so mundane by comforting too). Anywho, I started to open up my two orders and bam...right out of the gate the first dinner was completely wrong. Instead of the spicy shrimp, it was some chicken concoction, however, it was loaded with veggies and some jalapeños - cool right?  Negative ghost rider...it tasted like a shoe. :(  Then I figured, well, I'll just eat my fried rice. Fingers crossed, I opened up the second little container and bam...again!  Nope, not \"bam\" in a good way...no ah ah...nope...nada.  It was Fried rice yes, but it was a light grey in colour, and yep...you guessed it, this too had an odd smell. This little lovely however smelled like my drawers after a week of hunting. And America, that ain't nothing I'm proud of.    Well, I ended up having two cliff bars for dinner. I'll let you draw your own conclusion folks...I eat a lot of Asian food, especially on the road.  Still not sure why that is...anyway, I'd point you towards another place if I were to be totally honest with y'all. Sorry...the lady that took my order was very sweet, the place was cosy and definitely didn't lack character.  That said, character, cosy and kind people don't fulfill a Chinese food jones. :("}
{"text":"Pretty good food, god awful service. We came in at 6PM, waited an hour to even make our order, and another hour for our food to be served. What kind of fucking restaurant understaffs on a Friday night at prime time?   But the food was pretty good despite the service. We had the house special chicken, kung pao chicken, and the dan dan noodles. The meat was very tender and the rice was delicious. However, the pepper was a bit too excessive for my taste.  Basically, only go here if you are ok with waiting 2 to 3 hours for decent food."}
{"text":"It's always been great! Always smiling and they never forget your name! My favorite Chinese restaurant. I always get the kung pao chicken and potstickers!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant because I was craving good Chinese food and this place gets pretty good reviews on Yelp.  I got the teriyaki crispy chicken and my fiancé got the orange chicken.  We got this to go because we usually prefer to eat at home and I live just up the street.  When we went to pick it up the lady who checked us out was really helpful and nice.  I had read reviews about the owner being really sweet too and she was there and thanked us for our business.  The food was delicious and I like the way they bread their chicken.  It's not that thick breading most Chinese restaurants use for Orange chicken, General tso's chicken, etc.  It was more like the sweet and sour chicken breading.  My fiancé also said the food had really good flavor.  See you soon Little Szechuan!"}
{"text":"2 stars because it's cheap. Other than that, it was the worst meal I've had in a while...  Tried this place for lunch last week. I'm still getting over the separation anxiety from being so far away from my favorite Chinese spot. It was walking distance from my last office, but too far away now to do for lunch...It's been a challenge for me, but I'm working through it. So anyway, I come here with a coworker and we sit down. The place is pretty busy, which seemed like a good sign. It took a while to get our order taken, but once we did, the food was out in a matter of minutes. Not a good sign.  I ordered the kung pao chicken...It was awful. There is just no other way to say it. Wet, gross chicken drenched in a bland sauce with listless vegetables and clumpy white rice. Terrible.   Here's the thing: My dish was $5. The tab for the two of us was $12 with tax, so it's really, really cheap. Of course, you pay a pretty dear price later with the way you feel...  I will never come back. Ever. But, if you're looking for really cheap, really crappy Chinese food, this is an option that you could try. Hopefully you'll have better luck than I did."}
{"text":"My mom and I ate there for dinner and got the dinner combos! It's like 12 dollars a dish for so many sides (rice, veggies, egg rolls) and soup plus your entree! We both ordered shrimp with vegetables and you could tell the shrimp was good quality and the veggies were fresh. Service was super great and spoke English well so they knew what we were asking for! They also have trivial pursuit on the table! My new favorite Chinese takeout (or eat in) place!"}
{"text":"If you have not tried the Moo Shu Pork, you are really missing out!  I have been to this place  on a number of occasions and always left wishing I had a bigger appetite.  Every time I have been there, the service is impeccable!  This is my favorite place in town to go for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Best spot in Tempe! The owner was so amiable and even gave us free ice cream after a delicious meal! I've never had a bad experience. My favorite dishes are the Sriracha chicken, beef & broccoli, & pork fried rice."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan / vegetarian options. Clean, fresh, crispy, savory dishes and huge portions. Plus the owners are super nice and we are always excited to go there!  Our favorite is the spicy eggplant dish. Try it with cashews and broccoli! :) Definitely the best restaurant in Tempe."}
{"text":"I don't if they have had a change in ownership or management. They used to be an okay spot for a quick lunch, until my most recent visit: the food was simply BAD, and the service was slooooooow and unattentive."}
{"text":"I truly have tried to allow for room for improvement at this place because honestly the woman who must own this place is as sweet as can be.  I think her sons help run it at times and they are really nice too. BUT... personality does not a good Chinese restaurant make.  After various visits over the course of a year and a half, I find it hard to offer more than 2 stars.  My last visit sealed it for me as I was ridiculed by my friend whom I had earlier convinced to partake of Lil Szechuan's offerings. I have been banned from restaurant selection within the group as a result of my attempt to find more good than not here.    One thing I get here is the brown rice.  It is not really brown rice. It is white rice made to look brown by adding soy sauce.  It is good as a house special.  One of my girlfriends always gets the mu schu and swears its the best ever...I swear that she does not eat out much!  If you like won ton soup this one is just average...just nothing special at all about it. Yesterday, my friend ordered cashew shrimp in a \"delicate white sauce\". \"The sum of its parts are not worth more\", he murmured and tried to shovel a \"no thank you portion\" into his mouth while politely reminding me with his eyes that I had committed an epic fail.   Banished from my throne and unable to select food options for at least a month ( my own personal hell), I must bring a few more things up that need to be addressed here.  Never have a menu where its possible that the first three items that a person may ask for are \"no longer available\".  I ask that you always have coffee and tea available even if it is not immediately ready.  And don't play a squeaky radio with fuzzy reception from a back room against a competing television as diners are  baffling over their other senses of sight and smell.  So sorry. I need Tott's Asian Diner back FAST!!!!"}
{"text":"Still love this place. My husband and I recently celebrated our 16th wedding anniversary and we spent it here. I love this place and its owners and their family. We have come to know themselves the course of the last 18 years. We will never go anywhere else for Chinese!"}
{"text":"So all of us at work ordered from this place. Out of the 8 different orders we all put in not one order was correct. The food was horrible, 5 of us ordered the Kung Pao Chicken lunch special, talk about inconsistency in the meals.  Some came with handfuls of peanuts on top and others came with none. Ordered fried rice and got white rice.  How hard is it really to get the orders correct?  The food was bland at best.  Myself or any of my coworkers will never return. There are way to many other places that serve awesome food in the area."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a full 5 stars because they definitely earned it.  I must admit, though, that the food was not necessarily memorable. From what I can remember, it was decent and I felt perfectly fine the next day. Not sure what previous reviewers ordered there, but my stuff was fine! Unfortunately, it was not necessarily memorable either... Although I did have this cool rice soup (?) what was extremely steamy and came out sizzling! They had decent plum wine and hot green tea, too :)  What really made us enjoy this place was the service, though. We came for a friend's birthday, and her sister originally planned for Oregano's. However, when we all *finally* found parking at Oreganos, we found out that there was an extremely long wait time (it's always packed, and I don't believe they take reservations there.) Also, there was a huge fight between some customer and the staff at Oregano's, which kind of scared us away. Since we had a relatively large group, we figured it would pretty much be midnight by the time we actually got any food--and we were starving!  Luckily, our birthday friend is not a huge fan of crowds, so she pointed out Little Szechuan across the street. We all wandered over there to find that it was pretty empty, but it was also close to closing time (which we discovered later and felt very bad about--but they never complained or rushed us in the restaurant, and were nothing but kind to us the entire time!)  We had a great time and were able to relax and enjoy ourselves. There was no stress, and our server/lady who runs the place was extremely friendly. She almost became a part of our birthday celebration :) Very kind and charismatic lady, as others have noted on here.   Overall, we definitely enjoyed this place. The food was nothing extraordinary, nor was the restaurant itself in terms of space or decor, but it definitely had its charms and we felt very comfortable and welcome the entire time... even if we did stay way past the time they were closed. :)"}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food in a 25 minute radius. My boyfriend and I come here quite a bit and couldnt be happier. Pro tip, regardless of what youre hungry for.. order the House Special Chicken. So so so so good. Everything is made from scratch so dont get sad if there's a wait for your food. If youre lucky, Swanie (the owner) will come say hi. Support local businesses, especially this one because it will make you feel like youre part of the family."}
{"text":"We got food from this restaurants.  We started with the appetizers and soup which were really good.  I mean really good very well good..  Then we got to the main dishes which were like what happened.  The main dishes were covered in what seem like oil and salt.  I had kung poa dish which taste sweat but it spouse to be spicy not sweat.  We both could not get the main dishes. We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"The service here makes you feel at home. They are extremely warm and inviting and remember most of their customers. They make you feel special and happy to have you a customer. That alone makes me come back -- not enough places these days truly put customer relationships first.   I usually get their house special chicken, which is a fried chicken with amazing seasonings. Everything here is pretty tasty - you can't go wrong. Their vegetarian egg rolls are delicious. Everything is extremely affordable, especially if you order a lunch or dinner special.  Little Szechuan is a family-owned small business and it is a great part of the Tempe community. You'll enjoy your experience!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this restaurant is rated as 4 stars. I ordered takeout from LS 3 or 4 times and each time hoping it will get better as it's the closest restaurant to me. I'm never eating here again, they always confuse their orders, their dinner combinations contain almost no chicken and vegetables and almost entirely consist of noodles and rice. Also their fried rice just looks like slightly darker white rice, and their $5.50 large wonton soup is enough to fill half a bowl and is hands down the worst Wonton soup I have ever eaten. It's hard to mess up Chinese food but this place found a way to master that. Save your time and money."}
{"text":"Have ordered food from here a couple of times now and it has been hit or miss. The dumplings were fantastic but the Dan Dan noodles...are nothing like what they're supposed to be. Someone else in my party ordered the Egg Foo Young and it was okay. Price and service are good."}
{"text":"Little Szechuan is my go to in the valley for good chinese food. The food is great, and the staff is even better. They really make you feel like your at home, even if you've only been there a couple of times. Also they serve strawberry daiquiris which are both cheap and delicious. I highly recommend the dumplings (so tasty). I just wish they were open later to serve my midnight hunger cravings, but I'll forgive them because they are all family run."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY a great choice! I didn't really understand the online menu so I called and they were VERY helpful. I order takeout and I was told that it will be ready in about 15-20 minutes. In fact the order was actually ready within that time period. The food was exactly how I order it no complaints for it to be my first time try them out. Shrimp fried was amazing also there broccoli beef! Recommend this place for anyone that gets tired of eating PANDA EXPRESS!!!"}
{"text":"We called in a order for lunch to be pick up and it was not ready in fact it was not made they did not ask for a name so they did not make it  One person was running around helping four tables while the manager was talking about football at the bar while the server was running around   Will never come here again  and will make sure my client don't have to deal with this service. Then they did not have the correct order good thing I checked before leaving."}
{"text":"Even though I'm Chinese American, I'm not that bad of a \"Chinese Food\" snob.  I've eaten my share of \"bad\" Chinese Food at buffets, cafeterias, and even the garbage I try to make at home.  Sometimes, eating out is all about \"MPD\" -- Mass Per Dollar -- where can I fill my belly the most by paying the least.  Little Szechuan is the closet neighborhood Chinese restaurant, however I've been too scared to eat here.  Why?  From the outside, it looks like a porn shop.  (Can I say that here?)  It is a freestanding nondescript white brick building with all the windows blacked out, and no menu posted at the door.   I like to look thru the windows before entering a place, so I at least know what I'm getting myself into.  The only identifying thing about the outside of the restaurant is their sign.  They just installed a new sign, which looks exactly like the old sign, but different color.  But both signs exclaimed, \"Open since 1976.\"  Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Most Chinese restaurants are family owned and operated, with high staff turnover rates.  If you have a successful restaurant, you may move on to Bigger and Better things, fix up your old place, or sell your business to someone else.  Is this porn shop Chinese Restaurant circa 1970s some hidden Tempe gem of an institution?  And what does it mean that only one other Yelper has reviewed this restaurant in its 30 year history?  I finally convinced a friend to go with me.  He told me to get used to the porn shop aesthetics, because there are plenty of other places in AZ that look like this.  Its not about privacy, he assured me, its about that gosh darn summer Sun.   Thus, I was comforted with the inside of the building, because it had the look and feel of the Chinese Restaurants I know and love  in the SF Bay Area.  1970s wood paneled walls, \"Orientalized\" promotional knicknacks from Bud or Tsingtao, and other Asian artwork.  I chatted with the friendly server, who informed me that she moved to AZ from China to attend ASU in the early 1970s, and eventually opened the restaurant after graduating.  Indeed, there was history in this restaurant and on the walls.  The menu had a lot of choices, including lunch specials.  Did we find a hidden gem?  Our first dish, Mu Shu Vegetables were great, so we remained hopeful for our main dishes.  Then, our hopes were dashed.  The Hunan Beef was spicy (actually, too spicy for me, but I'm a wimp), but the sauce had a weird texture, flavor, and color.  Their House Special Chow Mein was very unspecial, and I forgot what was wrong with the homemade dumplings.  Needless to say, I did not finish my dinner nor did I bring leftovers home.  What a rollercoaster! --Looks bad from outside --Looks nicer inside --Food terrible --Service nice and friendly.  The restaurant seems to have regular customers, and I applaud them.  Maybe the restaurant makes some other dishes really great, or they like the ambiance, or whatever.  I may try one of their lunch rice plates someday if I'm desperate, but alas, I'm still hunting for the best hole-in-the-wall Tempe Chinese Restaurant."}
{"text":"Very friendly owner, simple place with very delicous food! Went to have a quick dinner with my boyriend and had the egg rolls, shrimp sauté and spicy fried rice. Felt like I was a home with the warm welcoming service and simple food!"}
{"text":"Delicious lo mein and vey friendly family owned place. Would definitely order again"}
{"text":"What a great \"mom and pop\" Chinese restaurant! The owners have been here since 1976 and make great food. The Hunan Chicken is nicely spiced and oh so good. The portions are generous!"}
{"text":"Great spot for dine in Chinese food. They have what I would say is not the typical menu, but with the basics too! It's one of my favorites for Chinese. The staff is always nice and the food is always delicious."}
{"text":"This place is deeeelish. Some of the best Chinese food I've had in Arizona. The potstickers are the best I've had. So fresh, not greasy and almost a bit of sweet taste. Chow mein ma soup was hot as the fires of hell but darn tasty. Kung pao beef was excellent, again not greasy, spicy but just the right level of heat. House made kimchee was perfection. Staff was very friendly and helpful and prices were reasonable. This is my new go to place in the area."}
{"text":"Great little place West of Mill on University. Went in late after a class and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Food was great and very well priced. I will go back."}
{"text":"Two stars for the service, not for the food. Chow mein noodles were weirdly thick and the chicken lacked flavor. I ordered from the yelp app and it was ready in 20 min."}
{"text":"Was not that great. Even for Arizona Chinese food standards... I had to put salt & siracha to add flavor. I try not to be so ruthless with yelp but honestly the ratings for this restaurant are so misleading. Crab wontons were over cooked and had barely any filling. My husband ordered beef & broccoli & I ordered the beef chow main lunch special the meat was so soggy & dis-colored it looked like pork. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I love the fact that the woman that served us, is so friendly.  I would guess she is the owner, with the care and attention she has shown us the three times we've been here.        The food is the most important thing to me, and it's ok.  I really would like business to thrive here, so it's really hard to say the food is \"ok\". (Blame it on the fact that I've gotten pickier over the years.)  I had a combo of mu-shu pork, egg roll, rice, cream cheese puff and chow mein.  The crepe for the mu-shu was too thin to pick it up (they were pre-rolled for the combo) without it falling apart. But I enjoyed it with the hoisin sauce.  The combo also came with soup.  I got the Hot and Sour Soup and enjoyed it with the fried chips.        I love love love supporting local small businesses.  The but, to that, is that small businesses don't always have the funds to redecorate and have everything look fresh and tip-top.  The outside is poorly designed and the inside looks like it needs a make-over.... but really!  What's important to me is the people and the food.  So, stop in and give it a try!"}
{"text":"I read the great reviews so finally tried this place. I've been driving right by for ten years and never noticed it. My loss.   We entered twenty minutes before closing and the host still greeted us with a smile and made us feel welcome. Great service, my son and I were both impressed with the quality of the food. Fresh and hot, the white sticky rice was perfect. Huge portions for a fair price.   It's now on our must-stop list when in the area."}
{"text":"This was not a bad dining experience. The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean. The water was not good which impacted the flavor of the rice, and food. I may be more sensitive to that as I am a water drinker and have the top of the line filter in my home but it did flavor the rest of the food and it was not that good of a flavor.  Worth trying but I may not be back."}
{"text":"I hate to say this because I see a lot of people love this restaurant and I was even referred. However today was my first time trying the restaurant, I ordered from postmates. I ordered shrimp foo yung, sweet and sour chicken, beef and broccoli and pork chow mein. Each and every dish was completely lacking flavor, the beef and broccoli was so watery, and the pork in the chow mein had NO moisture. Also the vegetables in the sweet and sour chicken seemed that had not been cooked at all, completely raw. I was hoping to have a good experience but not one dish was satisfying. Disappointed :(."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese place in Phoenix. Something that has stood out to me about Little Szechuan is that their food, especially the produce that they use is without fail extremely fresh and not cooked to death. Their food  just has this nourishing, home-cooked quality to it. The service is always quick and Swanie treats her customers like family. Also, Little Szech has the hook up on chili; this is the only restaurant who's number 5 I've sent back because I couldn't take the heat, at which point it was remade free of charge with a couple of sweet pats on the back from Swanie. The chicken wings are to die for.. The portions are off the hook.. I can go on and on!"}
{"text":"Little Szechuan has plenty of character inside and the owners/staff is super friends. Plenty of people have been harping on the food, but for me it's the only Chinese food I can eat. Most (if not all) Chinese restaurants are just so oily and salty (MSG) that it just kills me. Their food might not have the same strong flavors american's are use to form American-Chinese restaurants, but they do have a more balanced approach to their dishes."}
{"text":"Stuck in Phoenix for the night and we headed out to eat at a Mexican restaurant that happened to be closed being a Sunday. I checked Yelp and saw the reviews for this place were decent.   When we walked in the hostess/owner was very nice. The decor a little dumpy and the lighting bright so far from romantic or cozy.   Tsingtao beer was nice and cold. We were starving so ordered a combo appetizer. Pretty good but not great.  Than had a couple entrees.    Kung pao beef was brutally bad. Inedible. Shrimp in lobster sauce was decent.  A little bland but the ingredients fresh and the shrimp quality.    Overall if your in the area and craving Chinese I would give it a shot. Owner operated.  Lots of locals so maybe it's the only game in town and they know what to order.    From what I hear if Mucho Gusto is open across the street (Mexican), skip this place.  The Thai food place across the street is supposed to be good too."}
{"text":"great food owner and waiter are sooo nice :) Try the curry tofu and crab puffs!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was great. Don't know why I haven't been here. I'm about 5 minuets away from it. Highly recommend this place and definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Really good \"mom and pop\" Chinese restaurant. People tell me this type of food isn't actually Chinese, but if you're like me you don't care. As it's a small business, the decorating and the building itself leave something to be desired, although they've recently re-done the interior. But who really cares about decorating when you want to eat good food?"}
{"text":"It's just horrible, the worst food I've ever had in a restaurant.  It bears no resemblance to any Chinese food I've ever eaten.  And  I was dying for good Chinese, not having any in my own small town!  The decor is really just ugly, I can't even give credit for it being \"kitchy\", it's as bizarre as the food.   The place has a sticky dirty feel to it, and the food is really inedible.   I read good reviews somewhere, evidently not here.  They have to be ringers, no reasonable person would recommend this food."}
{"text":"The food itself deserves 5 stars. When you include the owner who is the nicest woman on the planet, I wish I could give more than 5 stars. She is so sweet and caring to all of her customers. Can't sing enough praises for this joint and I recommend it all the time for anyone asking for a good place to eat."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great! I ordered the dumplings & mapo tofu and had lots of leftovers for dinner another night. Also, the lady who owns the place is SO nice & sweet :) Will definitely be returning here for Chinese in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Great place! Food was awesome and owner came to see us and share some culture with us! Definitively recommend"}
{"text":"Yum! We had the broccoli tofu, eggplant tofu, and the chow mein. Tofu was all perfectly fried. The flavors for each dish were very traditionally seasoned. I really enjoyed that because it reminds me of home (San Francisco where the Chinese food is plentiful and ace). The noodles were thick and chewy - a perfect consistency in my opinion. The sodium level is moderate - which I'm a fan of considering many times, Chinese restaurants add way too much soy.   I love that they have plenty of vegetarian, vegan, and GF options. The prices are very reasonable, however the portions do match the reasonable prices. Our server, I'm assuming is the owner, was very friendly and struck up nice conversation. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch this week, this was my first time at this restaurant. I selected because of the Yelp Reviews.  Unfortunately, the food was awful. The hot and sour soup was actually egg drop soup with hot sauce and vinegar, i've never had hot and sour like this before.  The  rice was hard and undercooked. The service was good. I will not return nor will i recommend my friends to eat there. :("}
{"text":"A really great Chinese food restaurant to go to. U can get a great taste food for a very decent price. Sewanie,the owner,is a very nice lady and spent lots time in running the restaurant.  If u like Chinese food, this is the place u should go to"}
{"text":"Had a great take out meal here after a long day of travel. Food was great! Ordering over the phone was clear and prompt, restaurant was clean and cute, and the owner could not have been sweeter. Great prices - an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a side for 30 bucks. Sun Devil chicken was delicious and actuallu SPICY! Would eat there again in a heartbeat. Nice local place."}
{"text":"Found this place when I moved here from CA. This place has the BEST food in town!!! I have tried other places but none compare to this place. The Mongolian beef is wonderful, the shrimp with lobster sauce is also great. The hot and sour soup is the best I've ever tasted. Prices are reasonable the atmosphere is great and the staff is way above average. I will recommend this restaurant to all of my friends and co workers. Ate here 3 times this month!!"}
{"text":"I only started going to Little Szechuan about 4 months ago, I was working at a building about 5-10 minutes away near mill and rio salado. I refused to eat at the little cafe they had inside the building, and I didn't feel like paying 12 bucks for a salad and/or sandwich.   My friend recommended this restaurant and I was a bit sketchy at first, but when I got in there, the feel of the place is so homey. It's family run so the staff is incredibly nice and oh so attentive.   By no means does the food wow me by being ultra-delicious, but it isnt bad either. The egg drop soup is amazing probably the best I have ever had so far!   I usually order the lemon chicken or if it is a cold day or when it rains, I usually just have some crab puffs and a large egg drop soup to split with a friend. It's also pretty inexpensive!   I love this place, I have been back numerous times since i've first gone, and I will continue to come back because the service is amazing.   As far as people's negatives comments, everyone has their fare share of opinions, and sometimes the restaurant may be having an off day....   That won't change my opinion though, I just wish I worked closer..."}
{"text":"This is a nice Chinese restaurant with good food and a friendly staff. I have ordered take out here many times and the food is always ready when I get there, the ingredients are fresh, and the food always tastes good. Another thing I like is they will customize your meal if you ask. I am trying to stay gluten free so as an alternative they offer a white sauce that has no soy sauce or gluten in it. If you are in the mood for Chinese food check them out."}
{"text":"Stopped by while we were in town and had no idea I'd have such a fantastic time. The owner came out and it was as if we'd known each other for years. Very friendly, knowledgeable and superb level of service. Food was delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! People are so nice!! This is my go to when my Boyfriend is sleeping and I can skip making dinner :)"}
{"text":"I never review restaurants, I'm a waitress and know there are normally factors that effect service. But I called an order, they told me 20/30 min because they were busy so I came 40 and an hour and ten later my food appeared.  I give two stars because the kitchen came out and said sorry multiple times and said that the order just went in 20 ago and it's coming very shortly.  Front of house has a lot to be desired, the hosts barely said sorry.  Update: food is bland and so not worth and hour and ten min wait"}
{"text":"It pains me to only give this place two stars, because it's locally/family-owned, and it's kitschy decor is a time capsule from the 70's (that's a good thing!)  But man, it's just not anything special, and also overpriced. I'm a dumplings and hot/sour soup guy. Get those right and I'll forgive almost anything. They get neither right. The dumpling serving is meager relative to what they charge, and the hot/sour soup has no pork or chicken - then adding it is as an extra was crazy expensive!  They also don't have what other Chinese places call a \"diet menu\" - essentially normal entree options that you can have steamed rather than stir-fried with sauce on the side and brown rice. Not only isn't there a specific menu option for this, they declined to prepare a basic chicken with mixed vegetables for me in this way. Just \"no\" - even though the restaurant was basically empty and the kitchen was slow. Plus no brown rice.  Breaks my heart - I so want to like them -"}
{"text":"I am sorry to say, we did not eat here, my friend and I went in Saturday evening, we were waiting to be seated, and had time to look around...dirty...we left."}
{"text":"For average food this is probably a decent spot for the money. Pot stickers were ok but hot and sour soup was lacking a lot. Chicken and vegetables were decent with a healthy lunch portion. May give them another try in the future but not recommending as a 'must try'."}
{"text":"Service was great, very friendly and polite. However I did not enjoy the food. This was my first time here, just moved to Tempe from Phoenix and noticed there are very little Chinese food places here. Saw all the great reviews online for this place, so came here. Worst Chinese food I've ever had. I don't know how you can mess up or make bad Chinese food.. it's so simple. If you want extremely over fried/cooked, tasteless, raunchy food, come here. So disappointing, at least it was cheap. You get what you pay for! yet I've had 10 times better Chinese food around the same price. Chinese food in Tempe is weak, I will not be coming back here. To Phoenix I go for good Chinese food!"}
{"text":"I expected some good food from this place after reading the reviews but was very disappointed. My party and I ordered four Szechuan dishes and received mediocre food with no hint of spice whatsoever. The waitress was not friendly and did not pay attention to us even though we were the only people there. She was more concerned about folding napkins and placing mats on other tables that were empty. The worst things about our visit was my water cup with free pink lipstick on the rim and my friend's napkin that was stained and crusty before he used it. We will never be back for another visit!"}
{"text":"I will never go to another Chinese restaurant. I order take out from Little Szechuan's once a week and it never disappoints. They have the best chicken fried rice and the nicest people. You will not be disappointed if you're craving Chinese food this is the place to come."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I love the food, the staff and the owners.  The food:  I love the soups.  My favorite is egg drop soup.  Prepared hot and fresh.  Perfect food to start your meal.  My favorite entree's cashew nut chicken, spicy chicken egg rolls, orange chicken and peking dumplings.  All prepared fresh to order so yummy white chicken, crunchy veggies, great sauces.  It's all good, but those are my favorites.  The Staff, not bad to look at.  Attentative and efficient.  The owners are fabulous.  They've been around Tempe at this and their other location since 1976, when I first got to the Valley.  I've tried other Chinese restaurants in Tempe, but they are just the best, all the way around.  I like the new improvements they made in their dining room flooring, walls and seating.  Makes it more open and bright in the dining room.  I just want them to add a bar, so I can go have a cocktail and watch a game without leaving the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is really great food, great location right by the college, really affordable awesome authentic cuisine! The Kung Pau beef is my favorite along with the orange chicken... If your are vegetarian this is also the place for you with so many dishes ranging from noodles to soups to vegetable stir fry using only the most fresh ingredients.. Also my waiter Eddie request him awesome guy with a great sense of humor... Kept my drinks full and my food was hot and ready to eat in no time...this is family owned restaurant and they do only the best Chinese food in town!"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from DoorDash last night, so I can't speak to the atmosphere. The Cashew Chicken was made from thinly sliced white-meat chicken. A plus! The Eggplant with Spicy Pork was full of large chunks of Asian eggplant that soaked up the delicious sauce perfectly and balanced out the ground pork. The noodles in the noodle dish were slightly overcooked, but still tasty. The kimchee was the best I've ever had. So amazing!  A bit more expensive than our other go-to Chinese in town, but much better quality and more like SF Chinatown."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience I've ever had a restaurant here. The entire place was a mess. Eight people must have called in sick the way they were running around. The staff were all disrespectful to each other and the other patrons at the restaurant. The blonde one was even yelling at someone picking up food. I waited about an hour for my food. It really wasn't worth it. Go some place else for lunch. Definitely don't come here on your hour lunch break."}
{"text":"We were in town for Pat's Run and were craving Chinese good. It was between PF Changs and Little Szechuan. Glad we chose LS. Good, solid Chinese food at a very reasonable price. AND the owner/ hostess was very nice."}
{"text":"What a lovely little family Chinese restaurant. Food is excellent. Never had such a thick egg drop soup. Swanie, the owner, is friendly and fun to talk to.   I came in for dinner at 5 on a Wednesday and was there till 6:30. Lots of people came in for take out, but almost nobody dined in, which surprised me, as the food is excellent and the atmosphere of the restaurant is quaint. Nice little undiscovered family restaurant."}
{"text":"Truly a special restaurant.   This is what you think of when you think of a family restaurant.  The food is great and very reasonably priced.  The owner is what makes this place special because she treats you like a friend not just a customer.  My favorite dishes are house special chicken, moo shu pork, kong pao beef"}
{"text":"I found this place by chance and I am so glad that I did, the lady that owns this place cooks everything to order so everything is always super fresh. I tested this theory with her potstickers because let's be honest it's hard to find hand made fresh potstickers...well these are some of the best Potstickers I have had Period!! They are what I would imagine your Chinese grandma would make for a family dinner the type of gems that normal people never uncover Holy Smokes you have to find this place and eat the dumplings (potstickers) true Divinity !!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick dinner on a Monday night. I was on my way from the airport to my hotel and had a craving for Chinese food. I'm not a snob when it comes to Chinese food. I realize that what I like has been Americanized, but it's comfort food to me. This place was deserted at around 5:45 PM. Only one couple were seated, but a number of people came in to collect takeout food. This place isn't fancy but it is homey. And I enjoyed the music they were playing - basically pop music from the 1940's and 1950's. Big band type stuff with singers like Sinatra and Ray Charles. Although I wanted garlic pork or chicken, the menu was somewhat limited so I went with the kung pao chicken combination dinner. It included hot and sour soup, noodles, an eggroll, a crab puff, and steamed rice The soup was perfect with a great rice vinegar kick. Although I never order Chinese noodles, these were so great I ate them before getting into the kung pao chicken. The king pao was unlike any that I had ever had because the meat and vegetables were sliced instead of cubed. The flavors were spot on with just the right heat level. The eggroll was good but could have been crisper. All in all a very enjoyable meal and more food than I could eat.      Share review       Edit review       Delete review"}
{"text":"Ordered the potstickers, spicy chicken wings and chicken chow mien. First time in Arizona and first time at this restaurant. Everything was excellent!!"}
{"text":"If your looking for somewhere authentic and feels like a mom and pops type establishment, come check this place out. The prices are crazy low and the food is tasty. New bar which has sake bombs for 5 dollars"}
{"text":"I travel.a lot.  A lot.  And I am always looking for the hometown place for my favorite types of food.  Little Szechuan nailed it as the local, friendly, reasonably priced and delicious family run Chinese restaurant!  I met the owner Swanee who said they have been there for 42 years!  I guess that speaks for itself.   I had pan fried dumplings and Ma Po Tofu.  Both were great.   Wry flavorful and more than ample.  I try not to be my own worst enemy and eat too much when out.  So I didn't order their combo plates.  For $10-12 bucks you get the chosen entree plus soup,  tab puff, chow main and fried rice!  Yep for ten bucks!   I will be back in Tempe often and will be back to eat at Little Szechuan equally as often!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out after seeing great reviews and that they make their potstickers in-house. The potstickers are the BEST I've ever had! And the pork lo-mein is excellent (although I requested a 3 out of 10 for spiciness and my lips are on FIRE, so I'll be requesting no spiciness next time lol). I've been looking for a good Chinese place and had given up, but I'm really happy to have stumbled on Little Szechuan. Definitely ordering from here again."}
{"text":"As I arrived I waited to be seated like the sign said but I ended up grabbing a menu and seating myself. When the waiter finally came to me he just asked what I wanted and not the drink order first . When the soup came it was the wrong one and was just egg drop soup with vinegar . When I got my meal it was the wrong order completely. The waiter did not come over to see how it tasted but only delivered my dumplings while we're mushy and still had water that they boiled it in, inside the actual dumplings. If you like general Asian food come here but if you're looking for tasty original Asian food there are better places."}
{"text":"This place may be easy to miss, but it is so worth the stop. The food here is really great, and is a solid price point considering its Tempe. The owners are really friendly and the staff is super attentive. Not to mention fast service!"}
{"text":"Swanie is seriously the Greatest and Sweetest lady ever. Go visit her and some amazing food. Thank you for the amazing service."}
{"text":"A great little spot with a super friendly staff! Orange Chicken 4.5/5 Plus, Yao Ming's been here!"}
