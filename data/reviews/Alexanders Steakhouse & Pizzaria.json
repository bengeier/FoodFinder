{"text":"Good service great food very clean. Got the jambalaya it was really good. Diss appointed that they only serve sandwiches until 4 pm. Pizza smelt really good that's what in getting next time."}
{"text":"I think I had one of the best steaks in my life here.  I ordered the Rib Eye, which was around $30.  It was made exactly how I requested, incredibly flavorful, and I was determined to eat everything on my plate because of how lovely it all was. The stuffed baked potato was great, the caesar salad was extra fresh tasting, the service was on point.  Great experience here, and a lovely environment. I absolutely recommend this place."}
{"text":"everyones meals & deserts were excellent! & service was great, definitely will be returning, definitely a true chef preparing the meals"}
{"text":"1 star for service. Our waitress was very nice, however the food was terrible. Calamari was bland, Ceasar salad was bland, Lasagna bland, and the Pizza was undercooked with a doughy crust. We won't ever go back and would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Favorite place to go. Love the filet mignon, Caesar salad and the angry Mexican pizza. The Hawaiian pizza is also very good. Servers and staff always friendly!! Wonderful experience every time."}
{"text":"Just tried the angry Mexican pizza. Oh my goodness it's a spicy beast. Very very tasty, I will definitely have it again."}
{"text":"Food was great. Thier pizza with smoked salmon and shrimp was delicious. ( sounds gross but i gave it a try ). Serving was huge. Although the brunch buffet is expensive $22 if im not mistaken, for what they served. Tons of dessert options but they're always running out of food.  Will give it a try again."}
{"text":"Tried the pizza here. Awesome! This is our go to pizza place in Airdrie for sure! Really thick with tons of toppings and yummy cheese and sauce! 
Haven't had a bad meal here yet. Tried several things on the menu and my whole family agrees that this is one of our favorite spots in Airdrie.
Don't listen to Michelle cause she never gives a good review and her favorite spot is Rickys lol"}
{"text":"Felt thoroughly ripped off by the not so \"Large\", and not so tasty pizza they charged me $30 for."}
{"text":"So unhappy with this place . Went in 9 months pregnant didn't like anything on the menu it was 4.05 pm and I wanted to order a sandwich to which I was told they stopped serving sandwiches at 4 pm ! Like how hard would it have been just to make me one. The place was dead . So while my husband and kids all sat eating I had nothing . Menu choice awful , staff were rude and way over priced."}
{"text":"I just had the worst experience I've ever had at this poor excuse for a restaurant. I was asked to the leave the restaurant because I sent a steak back because it was tough. I asked why I was being asked to leave and the waitress told me that she had spoken to the owner and in her words: \"The owner will not make another steak because he cannot seem to please you\" I proceeded to ask her how the owner knew who I was because I had never met the mythical creature in all my time going to this place. \"From before\" she said. It took me a few minutes and I remembered that I had sent food back on previous visits. I should mention that I did sent food back and that she is correct. BUT I only did this when they did not cook the food as I had requested. 

Now I don't think that it's much to ask but in the world of customer service, when food is not cooked correctly or is quite tough, it's only correct to send it back. I would have been happy to  continue eating the steak, but she took it away before I could say another word. I didn't ask for free food or anything like that and would have paid for it. But nope, didn't even get the chance. To top it all off, the owner didn't even have the courtesy to tell me himself. He had to use his waitress...

Needless to say don't go here, there are better places in Calgary to spend your money. Caesar's and Vintage are much better choices."}
