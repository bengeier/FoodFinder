{"text":"this pasta is completely overrated and overpriced. Granted it is extremely high in protein, the flavour and texture are not very appetizing, and this was confirmed by a number of our guests.

the lasagna we tried as well was very poorly seasoned..

Also i did not appeciate the attempt to upsell me their canned Romano tomatoes stating they are \"san marzano tomatoes\". The brand is merely called that.. and after correcting the gentlemen (i actually know my food) he gave me his opinion on how they are the same (very untrue). Regardless of the opinion difference, an attempt was made to mislead me into a purchase."}
{"text":"Since More than Pasta opened its doors on the Ossington strip, I've had the pleasure of sampling a few of their offerings. 

They sell freshly made in-house fettuccine, linguine, capellini, spaghettini, lasagna and spaghetti plus a weekly chef special. 

It's more than pasta because they make it with vegetable protein, soy protein and vegetable fibres in addition to semolina flour enriching the nutritional quality of the pasta. They also decided to remove eggs from the equation, making their pasta products suitable for vegans, vegetarians, diabetics, etc. 

Gabriella, the owner, is very friendly and helpful. She has plans to make and sell fresh sauces in addition to the Sun Flower Kitchen's pestos they carry now.

You can buy More than Pasta at Fiesta Farms, The Health Shoppe and other locations around the city. I love cooking fresh pasta as quick and easy meal, and I like that this one is locally and conscientiously made in my neighbourhood and tasty to boot."}
