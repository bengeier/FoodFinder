{"text":"Today was my third time coming into Chica, My husband and I came on Tuesday for the lunch. We were looking for something different and Chica always popped up, so we decided to go ahead and try it. Our server was Adriene, she was knowledgeable and very funny. She made a few suggestions about lunch we had to try. My husband had the burger after going back and forth about it, our server insisted he would love it, and he did. I had the steak salad, and it was delicious, and not too much dressing which was nice. She (adriene) talked about the milk cake (I forgot what it's called) and raved about it, we took her suggestion and tried it, it did not disappoint. I came back Wednesday by myself, and my server again was adriene. She remembered me, my last name and called me by it, and asked if I'd prefer sparkling wAter again as we had the the day before.  You don't find customer service like this often and I told her it was because of the great time we had before that I came back. I asked her a few questions about the menu again, she said I should try the shrimp salad. The salad was exactly what I was looking for. Light and the right amount as I had dinner reservations in the night. Today we had john as our server, he was great, knowledgeable and just as friendly and helpful as the last. We are the chicken salad sandwich and chicken ceaser salad. Great ingredients but no dessert today. All around a great great place to eat and try different food from all the other places you are used to."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary dinner  with  high  hopes that we would be eating Latin inspired food and have a nice  dinner. however we were very disappointed with the service and food. Our waiter was not knowledgeable on the dishes being served and gave us wrong information. The sweet plantains were very disappointing in that they were not maduros and were very green and dry to eat. I really wanted to enjoy this place since I was excited to see some Latin food in Vegas but sadly it did not meet our expectations. Maybe if u don't know the food it would be acceptable. Would not go again due to service AND food being disappointing. Two stars!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately we were disappointed. The food was average nothing really special. The only thing I would go back is the watermelon daiquiri."}
{"text":"Loved the food, entire experience 
Services are exceptionally good. Servers went out of their way to ensure that we are comfortable"}
{"text":"The menu is full of new ways to eat food you're probably familiar with (or at least have heard of before) and you can't go wrong with any of the entrees, small plates or sides!
The waitstaff was incredibly attentive and knew nearly every single thing about each of the items and seemed excited to share them with us while making sure we got something we really liked.
Between all the people I ate with, no one had a complaint about anything and at the end we said that if we had to pick our favorite thing, it would just be everything we had eaten.
This is a great place to sit down and hang out with some friends or family to grab delicious food that was obviously prepared with skill and a true passion for food!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing, both food and service. Try the corn lollipop,  empanadas, and the Brazilian steak. Dessert is not to be missed. We will definitely be back..5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food,  with well thought-out ingredients in the dishes,  that blend well together. I ordered the shrimp and quinoa dish and it was excellent. And the customer service was excellent. People in Vegas to seem more professional at what they do and seem to enjoy their jobs. Where I'm from people don't like to work, all they want to Is work and go back to their life/family at home and seem to only care about how they're going to spend their weekend,  maybe relaxing out on some boat. And grumble when Monday comes again. I'm really. Impressed with the professionalism here in Vegas. It's not just certain people either it is everyone."}
{"text":"Wow my new favorite Latin restaurant in Las Vegas!!!! I cannot say one single bad thing about it. The decor was very tasteful and the ambiance with the salsa, merengue and bachata music playing at a reasonable volume where you can enjoy a conversation, but still jam to the music was awesome. For appetizers we had the empanadas which were filled with ground beef, rice, beans and plantains was phenomenal. We also ordered the chicken chicharrones which I initially thought was only going to be the fried skin, but it was not... it was like chicken wings that were flashed fried and it had an amazing spicy sauce to it. For our main courses we had the Brazilian style steak with grits and that by far was the best plate of the evening. The grits were very flavorful and the steak was so tender I could cut it with my fork without using a knife. My partner had the halibut with the plantains and the halibut came with a mango sauce it was so flaky and tender, I have to say I was one of the best fishes I've had this year. Save room for dessert, the tres leches and the buñuelos were to die for. When you go there ask for Monica to be your waitress as her service was beyond exceptional, she knew all the highlights of all the plates and recommended her favorites which is what we ended up choosing and we did not go wrong. I'm dying to go back and try their brunch all I heard from all the employees there is that brunch is even better than dinner. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're at the Venetian or you're in the mood for Latin fair. Even though this place considers itself Peruvian fusion food, I have to say that there were strong influences of Cuban, Nicaraguan, Venezuelan and Argentine flair to it. Staff is very nice and they made the dining experience so much more worth it. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The amazing food on a scale of one to ten hits 100!! Staff, cleanliness and menu is an A+ all around!! So impressed with this spot!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and dinning experience. The food was delicious and authentic. The service was attentive to our needs and friendly. Loved it!! Best meal in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had dinner at this restaurant last night to celebrate our anniversary. Very pretty restaurant and nice atmosphere.
When we first walked in the hostess was very nice and friendly and wished us a happy anniversary. We informed her that we would prefer to sit at the bar for drinks before dinner. At the bar I ordered a drink that tasted like syrup and after 2 sips I told the bartender that I couldn't drink it and would order something different. We sat at the bar for an hour and when we got the bill, she  charged me $15.00 for the drink that I hardly drank. 
We were then escorted to our \"table \" which was a high up seat in front of the restaurant and not the most comfortable by the way. We asked if we could sit in the main dining room instead and was told unfortunately nothing was available.  So we stayed where we were and ate our dinner. The food was good. I had no problem with that.
All in all we were not happy that we celebrated our anniversary there because they did absolutely nothing to make it special. Charged us for a drink that I hardly drank, put us in a corner high chair and didn't even offer us a free dessert like most places do. 
We visit Vegas 3 times a year and always stay at the Venetian. We also always celebrate our birthdays and anniversaries in Vegas. We love fine dining and don't mind spending money but to be treated so shabbily on our special occasion was totally unacceptable.  There are much better places to go to with much better treatment."}
{"text":"It was fine. We were expecting a lot more based on the reviews, but the food was mediocre. Maybe Friday night is their off night? The hostess at the front was rude because we arrived without a reservation even though someone on the phone told me walk-in is totally fine 15 minutes prior. Otherwise, the service was great and almost made up for the blandness of the food."}
{"text":"You literally have a zillion choices while playing in Las Vegas so coming from Hawaii, I carefully selected this restaurant since we have nothing like it at home. We've had Peruvian food before in New York and was excited to taste it again...ceviche and Pisco Sours here we come! We booked a 9:30 pm reservation after the LOVE The Beatles show at the Mirage and Chica was a perfect choice since it's located in the casino level of the Venetian Hotel, which is a short 5 minute walk across the street from the Mirage. We shared a variety of 5 tapas style dishes and everything was tasty and divine!!! It was a perfect amount of food, without getting overly stuffed. The cocktail list is also impressive and innovated. Hey what can I say, it's Vegas so of course it's pricey, but at least here, you get a delicious and unique meal rather than something standard. If you're like me, step out of the box and try something different from what you can get from home. Of the 3 restaurants we booked this trip, Chica was our FAV! Try it...you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Loved the variety of Latin cuisines and the ambience. The Chicharrón de Pollo is delicious with the most amazing sauce and a bigger portion for being an appetizer. The Corn Pops are a great appetizer/side. My husband wasn't a fan but I happily ate all four pieces myself. And the Brazilian Beef Tenderloin was to die for!!! The most tender, butter-like piece of meat I've had in a long time with great flavor. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed awesome impromptu team dinner here yesterday.  Wine list is extensive, we selected some yummy Spanish reds.  When the staff wanted to seat another group at our high top table, we were given complimentary bubbles as a thank you.  We enjoyed a number of dishes including the corn lollipops, tuna ceviche, empanadas, calamari, and guacamole.  I split the skirt steak with a teammate.  Lovely! Would go again!"}
{"text":"Been up in dis bad gurl twice. Made a lunch reservation but ain't nobody eatin up in huuuur. Dey not been open vury long. Service wuz gud but iz pricey up in hur if u gon drank booze.

{"text":"A big part of the Vegas experience is to try new restaurants and after reading some positive reviews of Chica, the new South American restaurant in the Venetian, our party of five decided to try it out on a Saturday night.  All in all, this was an amazing experience and Chica definitely won each of us over.  I will undoubtedly visit Chica again in subsequent Vegas trips and would suggest the restaurant to all friends and family.

We got there at around 9:30 and found the atmosphere to be lively, yet not too loud as to take away from the experience at all -- it was a trendy restaurant with a DJ playing but older crowds won't find this unappealing.  The decor in the restaurant was very well done and we were all enjoying the artwork throughout as well as the touches of plants and greens in pots hanging from the ceiling.

We were a very hungry group so we decided to order many small plates to share and honestly not a single one disappointed any of us.  Everything we tried was wonderful but a few of the standouts were the asado negro arepas, pulled pork tacos, empanadas, gaucamole, hoppin Jose rice, arepa basket and the sweet plantains.  Everything offered a new twist on dishes that most of us had previously eaten in some form or fashion but it all worked remarkably well and we left extremely full and content (at a much cheaper price than other Vegas restaurants as well).

Final part of the night: dessert.  Sara Steele, the Executive Pastry Chef of the restaurant, came over to our table to chat with us (completely unsolicited) prior to ordering and she helped us decide on a couple of the desserts while also talking to us about a bit of the history behind the restaurant.  To our surprise, Sara brought the desserts out herself, added two churro pops to the order (so everybody in our party of five could have their own) and also added some lemon buñuelos for us to try -- both on the house.  She then talked to each individual dessert that we tried and let me tell you, while they were all amazing, the churro ice cream pops were truly mindblowing.  Imagine cold vanilla ice cream covered in a shell of churro all on an edible, crunchy churro stick -- it was one of the best desserts I've ever had and the whole experience of chatting with Sara truly made the entire night special.  

Overall, I loved my experience at Chica (enough to feel compelled to write my first Yelp review) and cannot wait to plan a trip back to Vegas to eat again at Chica.  Go here and try as many dishes as your stomachs can handle -- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came in not knowing what to expect and wow it was amazing service and food. Jose's service was impeccable and The food was the best.  We had the chance to meet Cristian the executive chef, what a great chef.

Sam"}
{"text":"What a phenomenal place to enjoy elevated Latin food. Each and every menu item is presented beautifully and all is delicious. I sat at the bar for lunch and Bee could not have been more friendly,knowledgeable about the food and professional. I will definitely be back next time I am in Vegas to explore the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"We had an excellent pre show dinner. Staff were courteous and our waiter outstanding. Food was excellent, helpings quite large though, very nice mixture of flavours. I had the haddock and it was done perfectly. My wife had the kale and steak salad, excellent but large for a main and it was supposed to be an appetizer.
Prices were very reasonable, will visit again"}
{"text":"Nice new restaurant. Food was wonderful. Hoppin jose rice was the best. The atmosphere was great. Seating was comfortable and unique. Loved the decor. Sever Nichole was welcoming and friendly. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here.  Our waitress Nicole was over the top amazing.  The food was delicious and everyone at dinner was very happy.  I would definitely go back the next time I am at the Venetian.  We were without daughter who has a disability.  Nicole was patient kind and was able to accommodate all of her requests.  We left being a very happy satisfied family."}
{"text":"I am so happy this place opened! I am a local and have been looking for a new great restaurant that is easy, not over priced and yummy! Finally they opened something good at Venetian. The food is delicious and their menu has so many different options. I was very impressed and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised with the flavors of the dishes we ordered . We got the shrimp and quinoa and half grilled chicken. Both were extraordinary.. highly recommended"}
{"text":"Came in with a group of 9 from spending all day in meetings, just wanted a nice dinner with my colleagues and we all wanted something different than the steakhouses we always go to. The concierge suggested we try Chica , a Latin restaurant that had just opened up and had quite the buzz. We decided to give it a try and it turned into a wonderful evening. We were seated in some incredibly comfortable chairs in the middle of the restaurant next to a very interesting painting of a girl laying on her side. Service was wonderful, our waiter Georgio was very pleasant and professional and answered all our questions including mine that had to deal with my gluten allergy. This is what I was afraid of most but he explained in detail all the options and gave me some wonderful suggestions to combine to make my dinner a hit. His assistant Sean who was in charge of the wine selection picked out some incredible wines that we may have overlooked if not for his gentle prodding. Our appetizers came to the table to share , then our amazing dishes which were exploding with color and flavor. Then we tried some of their super special Venezuelan chocolate cake and a few other special sweets. At one point in the evening I got up to use the ladies room and when I asked Georgio where it was , instead of pointing me in the direction of the ladies room like anyone else would he put his arm in mine and walked me the whole way( this blew me away as I knew he was busy but stopped everything to take care of me!!!) The manager , a bearded gentleman stopped by to ensure everything was perfect and wished us a wonderful evening. Such attention was over the top and we loved every minute of it!!! We were graciously given the check and we left to go gamble. We will DEFINITELY be back"}
{"text":"Chica is a really good Latin cuisine restaurant in the Venetian.  Being in the hotel, it's more expensive than it should be.  But I won't hold that against the restaurant.  

First impression - I LOVE the ambiance and decor.  The greeters were pleasant and we were seated quickly.  We ordered cocktails, which were really tasty.  Our meal consisted of guacamole, steak & eggs, and chicken & waffle.  I enjoyed the flavor and seasoning of their meals.  It was a nice portion side.  Actually the chicken & waffle is pretty filling.  Overall a good choice for a late breakfast."}
{"text":"Dinner was outstanding! My husband and I shared 5 small plates which was more than enough for the two of us. Definitely try the octopus. It was cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"Meh. It's okay. Service is slow. Food is good. Rocks pours are terrible. But nothing is as terrible as these chairs. Who designed these?!?! So uncomfortable!"}
{"text":"This place was fine. Food was decent...we ordered the lunch skirt steak for dinner and it was delicious. The Mac N Cheese weirdly has no Mac in it...it wasn't bad but just unexpected when that was the name. The guacamole was worth coming here for. Do not order a Diet Coke. It came in a tiny bottle and was $6...ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in Venetian. Fabulous food. I would highly recommend the halibut , shrimp and quinoa, and the octopus app. The Rice pudding and coconut mango desserts were amazing. Cool decor, vibe."}
{"text":"Must have caught them on a bad night. They got my appetizer order wrong and waiter asked if I wanted to keep it. 

Instead I insisted on my original order of grilled octopus which was great!

The porchetta was disappointing, it was drier than I'm used to for that kind of roasted pork.

Then the service was long and I was given the check without being asked if I wanted dessert!

And the credit card system was down so had a long wait to get my bill.  

But the manager took the pork off my bill!

So 4 stars instead of three!"}
{"text":"TOOK FOREVER to get my drink! the restaurant wasn't busy at ALL! Ordered The breakfast steak and eggs tacos. The  Steak was COLD and the potato's were under cooked, hard and cold! NASTY! The whole meal was cold!"}
{"text":"[ First off I just want to disclose that I am a Team Member at The Venetian/Palazzo but this review is entirely my own opinion. I paid for the meal with my own money. ]

Chica was a great anniversary date night for me and my husband. We tried the meyer lemon chicken and the braised beef. Both delicious!

I wasn't crazy about the potato salad, but the chicken was very tender. The sauce with the braised beef was tasty but again the black eyed peas side dish wasn't my cup of tea. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant is beautiful! It feels like you're dining al fresco in Argentina. And I love that they give you plates to share food. Feels almost family style. :-)

However the item that stole the show for us was a basket full of fresh, warm flavorful mini arepas and Peruvian butter. I could eat those all day!!

Thank you to the Chica staff for making our anniversary special! We will be back for those arepas! :-)"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service.  Nicole, our waitress, was awesome and did amazing drink and food pairings.  Tapas style food was very flavorful - get the chicken.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a great find and not overly crowded on the night we were there. The flavors of all the small plates we ordered were intriguing and delicious. We had ceviche, salpicon,empanadas and mac con queso. The salpicon was probably my favorite, with the ceviche a close second. Interesting cocktails, too. I ordered a caipirinha and enjoyed it. The atmosphere is sophisticated and understated."}
{"text":"Believe me this place is outstanding with great ambiance and the hospitality is top notch. Our server(sorry forgot the name) recommended the standouts of chica and they all were truly amazing.
My wife ordered a ice coffee and he customized it as per our choice which doesn't happen anywhere at a place like this. 
We gotta give it for their drinks, chipotle chicken omelette 5* for this alone, Hash and eggs.
They have unique combination of sweet corn pancakes and I think it is the house special. 
A great Sunday brunch for us in Vegas and I recommend this place to everyone staying anywhere in the strip."}
{"text":"We came for restaurant week for lunch. We had some great choices we had the halibut ceviche and the kale chopped salad. We also had the calamari to start. All 3 were great, we get calamari everywhere. It's one of my daughter's favorites, it's was great I loved the breeding and the sauce was very tasty. We had the Cuban sandwich and the Meyer lemon chicken, both were great. The sandwich was full of flavor with great crispy fires. I really enjoyed the chicken. It came with a refreshing potato salad and a chimichurri sauce that went great with the chicken. The service was 5 star, Nicole and her bussers gave us great service. We had several managers that stopped to make sure everything was great. Chef Lorena graciously stopped over checking on us and talked with my daughter. She loved it. We are locals and have found a reason to come to the strip. The inside of the restaurant is charming."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new restaurant.  They have the best Empanadas that I've tried in Las Vegas!  The pork tacos were small but very delicious. Menu was comparable to Firefly but smaller selection.  The ceviche with Peruvian halibut was unique but left me a little underwhelmed as it lacked flavor. Overall it was a good dining experience with South American flavor and I would definitely recommend at least trying it out."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch this past weekend had an amazing assortment of authentic Foods definitely going to be trying to hit this one up multiple times.
The fried corn and torta were amazing! 
The churassca steak dish had great flavors too wish it came with a different side then then fries like it does though."}
{"text":"Stopped in mid-afternoon for small bites and cocktails.  

Now, over the past two years (and more) we've had cocktails all over Vegas, and we found this drink menu to be one of the best.  It looked very promising and after trying 4 of them, we found it lived up to our hopes.  The cocktails were really, really good--well balanced, interesting, and very tasty.  

The small bites we ordered were delicious.  I particularly recommend the grilled octopus--it was divine.  We will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent unique dishes. Great spot for brunch on the weekends. Great atmosphere for drinks, coffee or dessert. Brand new with an excellent famous chef. Ask for Randy!"}
{"text":"Came here for date night expecting good food based on reviews and food network. The food delivered above and beyond! The empanadas are amazing and are a must have! Far above the quality of food has got to be the service. By far the best service hands down of anywhere we've been on the strip. Adrienne was awesome and made our experience that much better. Our drinks were never empty and we left with our bellies full and happy. You have to try this place, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We went to Chica on a recommendation from a fellow traveler. Our table was ready when we arrived - no quick diversion into the bar to encourage us to purchase extra drinks. Drinks at the table were great, and prompt. Our server, Nicole, was fun, knowledgeable and prompt-seemingly unrushed on a busy night.  The food was equally terrific. We shared we were celebrating an anniversary and to our surprise at the end of the meal the chef (Sara) appeared with a special dessert that they have perfected for Valentines Day. You can't order it now...so we are the only ones who know how delicious it is! This was accompanied by two glasses of champagne. Virtually every waiter that passed by us wished us a happy anniversary.  Excellent food, amazing staff - don't miss it."}
{"text":"My husband and I had brunch at Chica on our last day in Vegas. We wanted to eat somewhere in our hotel and we were so happy we chose Chica. He has a gluten and cilantro allergy, which he generally just picks something without or asks them to leave it out, but they asked about allergies first and were very accommodating. He had the breakfast burrito in a bowl with corn tortillas. It was delicious! He really enjoyed the tortillas. I had the hash, which was amazing! The yuca was the perfect amount of sweet and spicy, with the seasoning they added. The whole dish was very good. One of the best places we ate and we definitely plan to return! Also, the decor was beautiful."}
{"text":"Chica has been named the \"'most anticipated restaurant\" in las vegas on every page i read about it. Tonight Chica lived up to that standard, we arrived with a warm welcome from the amazing hosts specifically Kamya who continued to check in on us. We got the tuna ceviche, mushroom quesadilla, and the amazing manager Leanne suggested the guacamole witch was to die for! Each dish we got was so different and a must try! As for our main dishes, the beef tenderloin witch was to die for and the halibut witch was a little spicy but just the perfect amount! We finished with churro fried ice cream pops which put the cherry on top! Special thanks to Kamya, Leanne, and Myya!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat
Nice pickled vegetables
And good chopped salad

Speed was only flaw 
But may have been a rare case
Since shifts were changing

Waitstaff was stellar
Since service was really slow
Meal was offered free (!) 

Dessert was given 
Dulce de leche was bomb 
Just like Adrienne ;)"}
{"text":"I don't usually do negative reviews but this place was way over priced, very slow service and the food was mediocre.   I'd rather throw $150 on one number on roulette and take my chance than eat here again.  The one thing we liked was the atmosphere.  But don't be fooled."}
{"text":"Food was disappointing. Nothing special. Trio salsa and chips bland and unappealing. Hamburger was good. I ordered a double margarita $22, came in a tiny glass and very weak. Overrated"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a trade show and popped into Chica for a drink and an app at the bar. I ended up ordering the grilled octopus and the arepas with braised short rib on top. Both were SO good. The octopus was crunchy because of the quinoa and the peppers had a great bite. The arepas were delicious and the short rib on top was sweet and juicy. 

I loved the meal so much that I ended up making a reservation for the following night for a group dinner. Yet again AMAZING. Everyone at the table said it was the best meal they had had in Vegas. We started with the empanadas (I would actually skip on these next time) and the grilled octopus. Next we each got a different entree, but everything looked amazing. Since I loved the arepas from the night before so much, I ordered the braised short rib. One of the best meals I've ever had! It has raw sugar in it so it's a little sweet and it has slightly crispy edges. It's on top three different sauces that I honestly am not sure what they are, but they're great!! 

The cocktails were just as good as the food and we finished it off with lemon donuts. I will recommend this restaurant to anyone going to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some drinks and dinner before leaving town. Was delicious! Nicole was an amazing attentive server! Will be back."}
{"text":"Overall really good brunch. Very nice staff, but they did bring us one incorrect order and we were charged extra for this incorrect order. We could have said something I'm sure, but we had a flight to catch. My huevos rancheros did come out correctly and it was delicious! Reasonably priced too. I would get the Bloody Mary again, too - very spicy but kind of expensive for what you get here."}
{"text":"This was a great find with Peruvian, Colombian, and Venezuelan influence.  Very cute vibe and aesthetics. The food was amazing. The sweet Corn Pops and arepa basket are a must! The chicken and waffles were huge and so delicious. This definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I ordered the egg sandwich and a latte for breakfast. The food was delicious! The atmosphere is really nice and our server was super kind! I would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"We tried Chica for brunch because it's neighbor (Yardbird) was busy. I think we lucked out, because Chica was great, and did not disappoint! We shared the breakfast burrito and dulce de leche french toast. The savory/sweet combo was perfect, and the bloody Mary's to top it all off were stiff, spicy, and flavorful. At the end of our meal, our plates were clean, and so were the ones from tables around us! Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I had a great meal at Chica.  I ordered the Lemon Rotisserie Chicken and it was delicious.  I also enjoyed the atmosphere of this restaurant.  The walls had a very interesting design; the Latin music was uplifting; and the Lady with the Daffodil mural really catches your eyes.  If you are ever in the Venetian, give Chica a try.  I think you will like it."}
{"text":"Invited to dinner here last night, and we were pleasantly surprised all the appetizers are delicious from the arepas to fries and salad everything is fresh.
For our entrees we had octopus,rotisserie chicken,swordfish and three leches dessert.
Good service and a beautiful ambiance made for a perfect evening."}
{"text":"Good place to do a tapas style light lunch or light dinner before a show.  Get the guacamole which comes served with arapas. The calamari was awesome.  They use buttermilk."}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch there. Our server Juliana was great, she recommended the Grilled Octopus, Ceviche, the Cuban and the half chicken, and everything was absolutely delicious. 

Great staff, tasty food and a fun laid back atmosphere, (loved the oldies tunes) Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a great experience for us!  We were staying at The Palazzo so this restaurant was in between the two inside. Being vegan we had to ask for some modifications to the dishes and they were very accommodating. We had the Steak and Kale salad without the steak and had them add other veggies and some beans. They switched up the dressing to replace the yogurt one on the menu and OMG it was wonderful. The fries are also fantastic and not oily. I can say they will do their best to give you what you want."}
{"text":"Wow! You will be blown away. Each bite created such sheer joy, I caught myself moaning, \"Mmmmm\" after every single taste of celebrity chef, Lorena Garcia's cuisine. 

I ordered the vegan tacos and really didn't expect much since it's not a full vegan restaurant. The tacos came and the smell was aromatic. I can easily say that these vegan tacos were the most delicious tacos I've ever had in my life. The flavors were bold, robust and vibrant leaving me wanting more after each bite. 

Now I know a lot of you reading this review right now are not vegan, so I snapped a couple of photos of my coworkers dishes for you. I went with a group of 13 and each person loved everything about their meal. 

Chica exposed me to flavors that I've never experienced before. I'm not even a little bit on the fence about this place, I highly recommend it and you'll thank me later for this. It's the perfect choice for a classy lunch or dinner especially if you've never experienced elevated Latin American cuisines before. 

Bonus: The service was just as amazing as the food! Thanks Adrienne!"}
{"text":"Blah.  I expected a lot of flavor but the food was very bland.  Ceviche was good as a starter.  My short ribs were under seasoned and lukewarm.  My wife's shrimp dish was okay but lackluster and was also served nearly room temperature.  Our server was friendly and the manager greeted us but people were seated inches away from us though the restaurant was nearly empty. $16 sangria was essentially white wine with a few bits of fruit thrown in for looks."}
{"text":"Concept of this restaurant is neat but the food was just OK. I would say the most interesting and flavorful dish was the lamb. That dress is very casual but the restaurant decor is pretty."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food! Our waitress was very friendly and gave us just the right amount of attention. I asked for the Yucatán halibut. However, this wasn't available but swordfish was. This proved to be a great choice with a side of cauliflower."}
{"text":"Chica was amazing! The service by Nicole and the New York steak with the mole sauce that she recommended was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Everything from the cuisine, service and ambiance was excellent! The Peruvian octopus showcased the most complex of flavors complementing the beautiful texture that only octopus can impart. The ceviche featured the freshest fish of the moment (Mahi mahi) and sweet potato infused in sublime flavors, absolutely divine. Do you like rotisserie chicken? Don't say no to this one. Highly recommend the Torrontes for a wine pairing. Beautiful Argentinian white that is floral with just the right amount of acid pairs well with all the flavors of the evening. It's evident the love and care put into the preparation, from selection of ingredients to the service. Thank you for an amazingly delicious evening!"}
{"text":"Stopped for late lunch before heading to airport. I was very impressed with the atmosphere, menu and friendly staff. Ordered the rotisserie chicken tacos... yummy. Flavorful on hold made tortillas. Had a great top shelf margarita. As I mentioned staff was awesome, food was great only bummer is the don't give chips in salsa.... you can order their trio of Salsa for $15. I kinda felt that was a rip off. I hope Managment considers free or lower cost chips
And salsa... I mean what's a taco Tuesday with out some tasty chips and salsa  olé"}
{"text":"Had Chica for brunch on Christmas Day and really enjoyed it.  There was no wait for a party of three.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and felt light and open.  The service wasn't as great from our waitress.  I felt that she was a bit slow to take our orders and it was hard to find her when we needed anything.  The food I thought was great.  We got the trio appetizer/shared plate which had the tortilla chips, plantain chips with three different dips.  All dips were flavorful and distinct and the chips were all freshly made.  My husband had the octopus and I thought it was just okay.  Wasn't in the mood for seafood so that may be why I didn't find it as enjoyed, but it is a small plate served with peppers.  For my meal, I got the Cuban Sandwich and thought it was great.  It came with a side of fries as well which had a nice seasoning to it.  The Cuban Sandwich was one of the better ones I've ever tasted.  The bread to meats and cheeses were a fantastic combination, very filling and flavorful.  I would definitely order that again.  I was only able to finish half of it and took the other half home.  Even after nuking it in the microwave, the sandwich still tasted as delicious as the first time.  Would definitely come back to Chica to try out some of their other dishes in the future."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in the Venetian! Loved the fresh guacamole and the octopus. Don't miss the steak with mole sauce and ask for extra mole...DELICIOUS! Kudos to Shaun the wine sommelier. Very friendly and informative on all of the drinks at Chica! We ate here twice on a four day trip!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I went to chica a week ago when I went to Vegas. I was looking for places to go eat and try new foods. My Uber driver actually recommended this restaurant to my friends and I. The way he described it, I was so excited to try this restaurant. When we first arrived I couldn't help but notice the music playing and it was some of my favorite songs playing so I was enjoying it from the first moment in stepped in that place lol when we made reservations they asked if we were celebrating anything (which we were; a friends birthday) so we are sitting looking at the menu and the server was so attentive! She was very nice and super friendly. She knew everything about the dishes and answered all of our questions in a friendly matter. She gave us more time to look at the menu and comes out with a few birthday mango shots so celebrate our friend! They were SOO GOOD!!! Ok ok now getting to the dishes; all of the dishes we ordered were DELICIOUS!! The chicken was so tender and juicy, the Salmon was perfectly cooked. The Peruvian ceviche has so many good flavors. Everything actually exceeded my expectations. They also even brought a pastry as a birthday gift for the birthday boy. It was so rich and chocolatey! Definitely coming back on my next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"All I want to say is Poutine Fries!!!!!

Poutine fries were so good! I felt like I was in Canada eating bomb poutine!"}
{"text":"Amaaaazing!  Don't pass up this stylish delish new spot in The Venetian.  It's latin food with an upscale twist.  
GRILLED PERUVIAN OCTOPUS~ Tender (which is rare), with shishito peppers, a touch of a rich sauce with a crunch of quinoa.  Our fave out of all.
ASADO NEGRO AREPAS~ Upscale arepas, with tender rib meat...so good.
MAC CON QUESO~ Interesting twist, with corn instead of macaroni; yum.
CHICA FRIES~ A misstep, but we can't be perfect.... I wanted to order something else, but my friend did not like that dish.
MARQUESA DE CHOCOLATE~Such a decadent chocolate square with fine and slightly crunchy espresso soaked graham crackers, with a homemade ice cream.  Crunchy, silky, rich, elegant.

Everything was fabulous, including the non-alcoholic minty drink!  The best was the phenomenal server, I believe Monica.  I live and mostly eat in S.F., one of the best cities in the world for food.  She is one of the best servers ever.  She described each dish in detail and with passion, so they all seemed enticing.  She was friendly, remembered everything and made excellent recommendations.  She would do extremely well in S.F.!  She knows her $#!^ !  Thank you again!  I don't  know if I will return to Vegas any time soon, as I'm not sure it's the place for me.  However, if I could transport to this restaurant, I would, as long as Monica was there.  This was only second to Elote Cafe, in Sedona; a high standard.  :)"}
{"text":"I reserve 5 star reviews for places like this. The food is outstanding. For brunch we had the corn pancakes (insanely tasty and light), Hash and Eggs (no words to describ. This isn't moms hash and eggs) and Huevos rancheros (perfect texture flavor combinations). We will be back. Such an amazing brunch."}
{"text":"Recently enjoyed an exquisite dinner experience here starting with the best ceviche dish we've ever had. My husband just returned from Chile where he ate ceviche daily-- he said it was better than the various fine ceviches he had there. Main dishes of Brazilian Beef & Yucatán Halibut were excellent.
Highly recommend the Marchesa de Chocolate for dessert! Totally delicious & decadent, especially with a touch of some nice red Chilean wine. Outstanding service from Juliana, cozy ambiance & wide wine selection. Ask your server about the story & namesake of this Latin-inspired restaurant... you'll be even happier to support them. We've explored a lot of the great restaurants Vegas has to offer over many years of travel there. Chica is now one of our favorites! Check it out, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant- the food was spectacular.   The service was spectacular. Our server Francesca was fantastic.  The manager Mark made sure that we had a great meal.   I am a local and would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to this meal since I heard this place was coming. Not disappointed. Beverages were tasty tasty. The food as tasteful as well presented."}
{"text":"How refreshing! Great Food, Great atmosphere, & EXCELLENT SERVICE!! Nicole is such a refreshing change from the typical service you receive these days.  she is personable, informative, & very nice. We have found a new favorite place to dine when we come to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was amazing I gave four stars because all my apps where better then entrees. Perhaps it was the way I ordered but I will say it's usually the other way around."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable pricing. Casual Latin vibe.
The octopus, Guam and churro lollipops are a must!"}
{"text":"Incredible food. We got to try it for Restaurant Week. All I can say, it's truly one of our fave restaurants in Las Vegas. The food packs so much flavor. The plating is perfect and the portions are generous. The staff is like a well oiled machine. Everyone pitching in and helping to make your experience enjoyable. The managers are going around and checking if we need anything. The Meyer Lemon Rotisserie Chicken with Peruvian Potato Salad was awesome. The chopped kale salad with sour apples, cranberries and croutons is so fresh and that lime yogurt dressing should be bottled and sold. It's like crack lol. The Short Rib is so flavorful and shreds easy and melts in your mouth. So much to say about the food, you need to experience it for yourself. The Tres Leches Cake is the best we have ever tasted. It was so balanced and flavorful. I should of took pics but we just tore into the food. On our 2nd time being there, we were fortunate to meet the incredibly talented Chef Lorena Garcia. She is so cool, friendly, and passionate about her food. I'm totally sold on this place and will go back again and again. Till next time......Let's eat!!!"}
{"text":"Chica was one of my favorite dining experiences in Las Vegas. Hospitality in Vegas is good, but the service here really set the bar high. The entire staff- from the hostess team to the servers, managers, and everyone in between- was kind, helpful, and happy to offer recommendations. We came in without our entire party and had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The hostess team checked in on us regularly and made sure we knew they had a table for us. They seated us in a private room, which was incredibly cool! 

The food was just as good, if not even better, than the service. We had the Corn Pops, tacos, empanadas, shrimp quinoa, plantains, and a few salads. It was all delicious and one of my favorite meals in Vegas. I wish I could've stayed another night to visit again. 

You have to try Chica. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We saw the mouth watering photo of Chica's octopus dish photo as we were entering the Venetian. We immediately consulted fellow Yelpers and found it's a thumbs up. We decided to try it and we were not disappointed. OK we were bummed that they were out of octopus, but we still had a wonderful lunch. We were so hungry that as soon as our classic ceviche arrived, we gobbled it down and were cured of digital addition - no photos! It's a mahi mahi with a little bit white corn, balanced with a little hot little red pepper slices. Spicy and tangy. Then when the pork tacos came, they hooked us and again, no photos were taken. The pork was juicy with a hint of smokiness that probably came from mole. The pickles on the side had a spicy sour kick which went really well with the tacos. Finally, I remembered taking a shot at the hanger steak with kale salad. It's tasted clean and refreshing, taking any eating red meat guilt away. Our waiter Jose was very friendly and attentive. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"WOW - simply WOW! The food is amazing! Tried the octopus, empanadas, short ribs, chicken chicharrones- everything was splendid, and very well prepared. Great wine selection. This could be one of my favorite places not just in Vegas but across the country. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Had the grilled Peruvian  octopus and hoppin Jose fried rice, my friends had  porchetta, lemon rotisserie chicken, chica fries and crab & shrimp salpicon. We were all amazed with the taste, the fried rice was the best i have ever had in my life! The flavors were just at the point. I could eat just the rice. Delicious! The octopus wad also amazing! And the prices are decent in comparison to other places at Venetian. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I can't praise this restaurant enough. They were amazing. We had to change out reservations at least 2 times and then last minute move the time up. They accommodated us and on top of that the service was superb and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"This place had such great reviews. But we were extremely disappointed in the flavors and the food was not hot! We ordered calamari , cheesy fries , Mac n cheese , and a couple of other dishes.  Head waiter gladly returned our calamari for a fresher one, but it was only warm on arrival.  Serve your dishes HOT! Hope the management reads this.  Flavors were lacking/ what a waste of a meal."}
{"text":"Stellar service. I just shared tapas with a friend. The pork chicharron was my least favorite. The Mac and cheese side was okay. Enjoyed the ceviche a lot. What pushes this to a four star was the octopus.... so tender and juicy."}
{"text":"My pastry and I had dinner here before going out and we're not impressed with the service or food. It is quite possible they had an off night as I've read so many positive reviews but that was not our experience. We had a reservation and it still took them over 10 minutes to seat us, even though the restaurant was not busy. They brought half the entrees out and we waited over 10 minutes before finally saying something. We were also not impressed with the food. I had the steak & kale salad and the steak was over seasoned. The lemon chicken was too dry and potato salad had no flavor. For a restaurant charging $20-$60 for plates, your food and service need to be on point. The runner bringing out our food also weren't train right, crossing over people and placing plates in the middle instead of in front of the person with the entree. It was a disappointing experience to say the least.

I will say that our waitress was great and the manager competed us the late entrees and bought us a round of shots. Thank you for rectifying the situation."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!!  Happened upon it while at a meeting at The Venetian and so happy I did. Latin American cuisine which is amazing!  The ambiance, the music, the service - wow!!  Highly recommend the crispy potato taquitos!!  O M G!!  The fish tacos - y u m. The Cuban sandwich ahhmaaazimgggg!!  Get the guacamole - comes with chips and plantain chips!!  You have GOT to experience this restaurant!!!A+++"}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat! Everyone is extremely nice! Food is amazing, especially the octopus!! Fish tacos are super good as well!"}
{"text":"I had eaten here before but didn't remember it well. Let me tell you. What a treat. Vast majority of the menu is Gluten Free. The servers. All of them, help each other, smile, and don't ever get annoyed of a ton of questions. 

The drink menu is so unique, the gluten free arepas are soooooooo great. But the chicken (I got the half) was just mind blowing. It was seasoned so perfectly, bone in, grilled. And it changed my life a lotta bit. I wish I would have got the whole. I did get the gluten free arepa basket, they swapped out half of them because I don't do cheese for the non dairy ones. I opened these mini miracles and put my chicken inside. 

I'm telling you, this place just gets it. Wow wow wow. Come here and you will be amazed. 

We sat on the couches which I usually don't prefer, but it was enjoyable. Especially with friends. They refilled water. Kept giving me refills of the unsweetened green tea. And recommended all the right drinks. 

Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I came here with my wife on a Saturday afternoon at 3PM. It was fairly empty. Waitress was pleasant. The food was good (french toast and pancakes) and the prices were fair. Clean and decorated well."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Amazing food and very attentive and knowledgeable servers. They really give you the passion of what you are about to eat! All the small plates are great and I had the churro ice cream pops for dessert! Thank you all!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday brunch and made a reservation. We started with the chicken chicharones which were so delicious and full of flavor. They came out hot and fresh and cooked perfectly. We had ordered espresso filled churros to start with but they forgot about them and ended up coming out late. I am a churro addict and I was not impressed with these churros at all. No one at my table enjoyed them. Lucky for us, because they came out so late they were free. The sweet corn pancakes were delicious, for some people they were too different in flavor but I really enjoyed them. They did not taste like cornbread at all and had the perfect flavor and sweetness. Dulce de leche French toast was probably my favorite thing we ordered, it was so delicious and one of the best French toast I've had. I had the lemon donuts which did not last at all because again, they were so delicious and fluffy. We also ordered pancetta eggs Benedict. The pancetta was way too crispy and almost impossible to cut through which kind of ruined the dish, but the flavor of the \"huancaina\" sauce was so good. It was kind of like a smoky chipotle hollandaise. But again it was hard to enjoy the dish because I couldn't eat it all together in one bite. you kind of have to pick the pancetta up and rip it apart with your teeth. My cousin got the steak and egg tacos, I did not get to try but she said they were delicious. My other cousin got the watercress Caesar salad and had to return it because she did not like it at all. In terms of flavor, I think this restaurant is a success. Their dishes are very unique and delicious. Price is a little steep for what you get, but not too bad for a higher end restaurant. We had made reservations for brunch on a Saturday which I do not think was necessary as the restaurant was empty the entire time. I had my mom and two sisters surprise me during brunch and the restaurant was able to accommodate, with limited menus which was kind of annoying that they could not order off of the same menu that the rest of the group did. I think if your group is above 9 they require a reservation and a $40 per person charge in a family style brunch, OR the option to pay $40 a person. The service was just OK. nothing spectacular. I felt like in the beginning everything was ridiculously slow. As the meal went on they were forgetting items and constantly having to be reminded. It was obvious to everyone in the group that our server was getting a bit irritated with having such a big group, and in turn his annoyance was annoying me. While this was delicious I probably would not go back, but I think it's a good place for everyone to try."}
{"text":"Been a local sometimes is hard to give a try to a place at the strip . I did and don't regretted food was delicious . Authentic flavors . 
Randy the server did an amazing job explain and giving suggestion ."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The food wad absolutely delicious and all of the staff superb Definitely recommend. The cocktails were impressive."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, I had the grits and eggs, the best I've ever had. We had to wait about a half hour for our food, so they comp'ed the entire meal. Awesome!! Great way to start the day"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday brunch and it was excellent. Make sure you get the side of \"arepa basket\", delicious different type of mini arepas with cream. Services was amazing and food was delicious, mix of traditional with creative Latin food. They gave us their \"celebration\" option of dessert with a Candle and a sample of sparkling house drink. If you have something to celebrate, make sure you make reservations at this Place. This place was our highlight of the weekend in Vegas. I was born in Venezuela and I can tell this is really innovative Latin food. A++"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I ordered the steak and eggs tacos. Delicious, the have 2 little \"sopes\" as the taco portion and the steak was delicious. We also shared the little corn lollipops. Very delicious. Our favorite appetizer was the ceviche, it was amazing  and refreshing. The drinks were also very good, my bloody mary was garnished with Oaxaca cheese, olive and a plantain chip. The service was nice, minimal but enough to get everything we wanted. I believe the manager even swung by to check on how we were doing. The decor is very detailed and beautiful. Overall great experience. Will be checking them out again whenever in town."}
{"text":"It was our first night in Vegas and I of course relied on Yelp for recommendation.  Came across this restaurant and read up on it.  As a Top Chef fan, I know who Lorena Garcia is and was intrigued about this place.  Many reviewers commented on the succulent chicken and boy, were they right.  We got the whole chicken and it was absolutely moist and tender down to the very last bite.  The chimichurri sauce was a good touch.  We also got the shrimp watercress salad and an order of plantain.  We really enjoyed the food and the ambiance was a nice touch.  The rice and bean costed $8 and given the small portion, that would be my only minor complaint.  Our server Edward is top notch and was very attentive.  I absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a Latin flare.  It is located right in Venetian casino!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch with wonderful server Jessica. Every dish was memorable and unique. Started with the octopus appetizer, signature margarita followed by Meyer lemon chicken, rice pudding dessert and local roasted coffee. Everything was great and loved each dish. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent food, customer service, desserts to die for. Jalapeno rice was delicious.  Ceviche also wonderful as were the steaks and halibut"}
{"text":"Definitely go to Chica when you are in Vegas or just go to Vegas so you can experience Chica. We tried almost every dish on the menu and loved them all especially the Meyer Lemon Chicken with Chimichurri and the Empanadas. There was one vegan and one gluten free guest with our group and they had wonderful dishes for them on the menu too. Try the Some like it hot Margarita with the Duke tequila and the espresso martini with dessert. If you are lucky Chef Lorena Garcia may come by your table and say hello. The ambiance and service were all 5 stars as well. Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Omg!!!! The most flavorful, rich food I've had in a while.  The customer service was 110% awesomeness. I was so glad I came to Chica for a great meal and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast right after they opened in the morning. I had the steak and eggs, wife had the french toast. Both were very good and not the usual variety that you see every day. The waitress was amazing, she was new here (we ate here in March 2018) and there was a problem getting the food out. But she was very friendly and kept giving us updates when we would be getting the food. We will be back to try the lunch/dinner offerings."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with great ambiance but ordinary food. The food was not bad but it was not great either. Pretty normal and average but of course at strip prices. You're better off checking other places out - especially if you're Latino and you know your food!"}
{"text":"Another great Restaurant Week choice for lunch is in the books with Chica.  

Chica has been on my radar for a while.  Luckily my friend and I opted to try it out.  We received excellent service.  I feel as if we didn't have one waiter as many of the other staff were over to assist in various ways.  Water glasses were always kept full with our many food plates out promptly.

We started by sharing the Asado Arepas and empanadas.  The little corn cake arepas are topped with a braised short rib. Wow.  The flavor bursting from this little guy was incredible.  The empanadas could've been a little better.  I felt as they were overcooked just a tad without a lot of filling.  

We then shared the Cuban Sandwich and Meyers Lemon Chicken.  Both of these dishes were delicious.  The half of rotisserie chicken is topped with a chimichurri sauce.  The chicken is slow roasted and so tender and juicy.  It's accompanied with the Peruvian Potato Salad which makes this a very filling meal.  Loved it.  The sandwich is stacked with pork, smoked ham, pickles and cheese.  It's all pressed in a sweet roll and toasted. Both entree plates were pleasing!

For dessert came their Lemon Doughnuts.  I felt as if they weren't so much a doughnut but more like a fritter.  It was more fried dough rather than cake like.  Almost a half and half of the two. Don't get me wrong.  They had a wonderful infused lemon flavor with berry and chocolate drizzle.   

I enjoyed what they offered for lunch which makes me anxious for a return dinner visit!"}
{"text":"Went here to relax and get a drink. Ambiance is cozy. It has seating areas if you don't want to sit at the bar.  Decor is trendy.  I didn't know any of the wines by the glass do their sommelier let me taste a few. His first pick was the one I went with. 
We also had a chip platter but the chips were plantains and cornmeal balls.  It really was different and tasty! 
It was a great place to relax, quiet enough to have a conversation and placed where we could watch people in the casino! 
I will be back! It's in the Venetian Hotel and it did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"We had a great time at Chica. Juliana was a phenomenal server who had a mastery of the menu and just delightful.  Food is a tremendous play on traditional Venezuelan food.  Amazing."}
{"text":"I didn't go with high expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised.   The food is flavorful and well executed.  We opted for 3 app dishes.  We started with the classic ceviche with hamachi.   It was very fresh and the acid was perfectly balanced.  We later found out that we didn't get the plantain chips that come with it.  My husband brought it to the waiter's attention and the waiter apologized and to make it up, brought us plantain chips with guacamole! That was really nice of him.  The second app was the asado negro arepa.   It was fried arepa topped with braised short rib.  It was good, but kind of sweet.   It would be great if it had a bit of heat to balance the sweetness.  The last app was the octopus.   It was quite tasty and the octopus was well cooked.  Some reviewers complained of the saltiness, but seasoning was well balanced and the octopus was tender.  Would definitely order that again.  For entree, we ordered the filet with red grits.   We ordered the meat medium and I would say it was a bit under, but no complaints there.  The meat was really tender and juicy.   I would say the red grits was at the edge of being salty. If they added another pinch, it may have gone over, but it was right there.  The creamy grits is a perfect complement for low fat meat like the filet.   My only wish is that it came with more substantial veggie than a couple of grilled shishito peppers.  For dessert, we ordered their award winning lemon ricotta donuts.  They are airy and light for sure; however, flavor wise, I didn't taste much lemon nor ricotta.   I liked the fact that they weren't too sweet. Just not sure if it's really worth $15, but they do give you several (I think 5-6) of these little donuts   I'd say they are 1.5x the size of DD munchkin.  They don't offer decaf espresso, which is a shame.  The waiter even tried to make a cafe au lait with French press coffee brewed strong, but it wasn't tasty and there were bits of coffee grinds in the coffee, which made it difficult to drink, so we opted fora cortado instead, even though it's caffeinated.   Anyway, it's much like a latte than a cortado, but it was fine.  I hope they will offer decaf espresso in the future and peppermint tea as well!  Overall, Chica is a welcome addition  to Venetian."}
{"text":"This has been my 3rd time to Chica since they opened. And really it's hard to go to ANY place twice in Vegas because there are so many choices.  But here are my new favorite things about it: 

Sitting at the ceviche bar. 

The rice pudding (don't forget to pair it with a Tojkai)

Adding chips to said Ceviche 

Free parking

My server Oscar

Oscar was AMAZING!! Not only could he tell that I was a bit of a foodie and a Wine-ie, but we just geeked out on pairings all night! He had some great suggestions and I felt so taken care of.  Really made the experience a stellar one."}
{"text":"Chica has a nice atmosphere with background Latin music, I was there with my wife, and we had fried Calamari's, Basket of Arepas, Empanadas, and Asado Negro with Arepas. Everything was so good and well presented. The entire staff, was well trained and knowledgeable about the dishes and what they contained. We both shared an Arroz con Leche as a dessert but did not like it as much, perhaps because it was not as creamy as it is supposed to be. Everything else was perfect !! and It is without a doubt one of the best Latin restaurants I have eaten in Las Vegas. I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Newer restaurant. Latin food pulling inspiration from Spain, South America and Central America. Beautifully executed. Great cocktails and the grilled octopus is perhaps the best I've had. Service was excellent! I WILL be back."}
{"text":"OMG can't say enough good things about this restaurant. I highly recommend coming here. We had the best Guacamole, Corn Lollipops, and of course Empanadas. The empanadas were out of this world. Our server Randy was super sweet. Will definitely be coming back here again and again."}
{"text":"Was there just the other Day and the food was amazing!! The only thing better than the food was our amazing server! Jen was absolutely OUTSTANDING, she really made our experience worth coming back for. I hope you can request a server because we wouldn't want to have anyone else but this awesome lady! 
Thanks Chica and Jen for great food and a great time!!!"}
{"text":"This was the best brunch I may have ever had. Each dish was sooo flavorful and intentional. My husband got the Hash and Eggs and I had the Huevos Rancheros, then we shared the sweet corn pancakes. The pancakes were out of this world with a homemade coconut cream on top. Great service on top of that. Their brunch is during the week as well."}
{"text":"Food, service and decor/vibe was awesome. We had the Octopus as a starter, Meyer Lemon Rotisserie Chicken and the Shrimp & Quinoa - all three were great dishes. Myya, our server was great! Highly recommend and prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"What a great meal. Chica did everything right. On walking in, the hostess greeted us with the big smile and made us feel welcome. Very shortly after we sat down, Felipe, our server, came to our table to get our drink orders and to explain items on the menu. This was our first time here and lots of items needed explaining ( it is primarily a Peruvian menu and none of us were familiar with some of the foods). Four of us ended up sharing three appetizers, two main courses, three side dishes, and two desserts. Nobody left hungry. For appetizers, we went with the grilled Peruvian octopus, green corn lollipops, and mushroom quesadilla. Each was delicious although the quesadilla was my favourite. It had charred mushrooms, blue cheese, string cheese, jalapeno pesto, and pickled onions. As an entree, each couple got porchetta with Crispy Yucca hash. It's a slow roasted suckling pig topped with Crispy brussel sprouts, fried Yucca, and pearled onion escabeche. Phenomenal! The side dishes we got were the Mac con queso (no, not anything like the Mac and cheese you get anywhere else - made with corn,  not macaroni), wild roasted mushrooms, and charred grilled cauliflower. Each excellent. For dessert we got churro pops and marquesa. The pops were delish. The marquesa was just ok. The service was perfection. And with free parking at the Venetian, I will definitely come back here for another meal in the very near future."}
{"text":"What a surprise! Amazingly healthy tasty food. Great environment, friendly efficient well trained staff. Definitely worth a visit when in Vegas baby."}
{"text":"We joined some friends who were in Las Vegas for a concert. The menu looked good enough but I have to say the seasoning and spices on everything just didn't taste good. Tried the grilled octopus not so good strange seasonings, the tuna tartare it had a bit of a creamy consistency and way too much lime. The swordfish was cooked ok but the sauce was just not good.  We didn't finish any of it. The chicken was ok but everything it came with tasted weird not in a good way. The service was just ok. I don't think I would ever go back. There are way too many good restaurants in Las Vegas, go somewhere else"}
{"text":"I came here while in town on vacation with my fiancé and his brother.  We LOVED the food and the rose wine was on point.  Easily my favorite meal of the trip.  I think their menu rotates but everything we had was tasty and flavorful!"}
{"text":"server could not get our order right. we didn't have a ton of time in between meetings at the IMEX conference in Vegas. Food was fine. The salsa was excellent."}
{"text":"Was so excited to see a new female chef enter into the Las Vegas dining scene! I enjoy Latin American food, and was anticipating the flavorsome cuisine to be something I would love. I was right. 

The restaurant took over the space the was previously DB Brasserie, located at the end of Restaurant Row connecting the Venetian|Palazzo. They did a fantastic job quickly transforming the atmosphere, relocating the bar/dining space & providing an entirely new interior. The lights are low, the vibe is fun, and it is an intimate but relaxed scene. 

My boyfriend and I decided to go opening night, which happened to fall on Mothers Day. We were quickly greeted and seated, excited to try all the new cuisine. Our waitress name was Carma, and she was fantastic. We brought our own bottle of Priorat 07, & she quickly introduced us to the Sommelier who provided us with a decanter. The corkage is $25 (we always go corkage first time), but the wine list looked extensive & well thought (will try off it next time).

We love to order too much food to be able to try all the flavors, and proceeded to order a wide selection from the menu! The menu is split up into a wide variety of small plates (hot & cold), a smaller selection of Latin inspired entrees, and a variety of side dishes. Off the small plates we got the: Chicken Chicharrones, the Grilled Corn Lollipops, the Trio of Picos, and the Watercress Caesar. For entrees we ordered Shrimp + Quinoa Cazuela, and the Asado Negro Braised Short Ribs. For sides we ordered the Papitas Chicas, after balking between that & the Mac Con Queso (next time).

The Trio of Picos came first, & were plated with Housemade Arepas, Plantains and Torilla Chips. The arepas came in a variety of flavors (cilantro, blue corn, beet) and were phenomenal. I also loved the plantains (sliced very thin/crispy) & I NEVER DO! The trio of picos were: Salsa Verde, Sweet Corn Poblano Pico & Fiery Tomato Salsa. They were all delicious (sweet corn = #1), but the Fiery Salsa had NO heat. Overall the dish was a great accompaniment, & would pair perfectly w/ one of their cocktails!

Next came the hot small plates: the Chicken Chicarrones, + the Grilled Corn Lollipops. The Chicken Chicarrones are not typical crispy chicarrones. We presumed they would be similar to the fried pork rinds we typically have when ordering chicarrones before. Thinking they would be crispy chicken skins, or thinly fried pieces. The dish came as heavily sauced bone-in wings, that were actually very moist, and difficult to eat in the setting. The flavors were spot on, but were so different from what we had assumed they would be, were not what we were looking for. The Grilled Corn Lollipops were also very different then we had envisioned, being a huge portion & unable to be nibbled on off the cob (the husk was braided for presentation vs. functionality). The balance of chile piquin, lime, butter and cotija cheese were so harmonious with the sweet corn though, the dish was devoured! We cut all the corn off the cob, and did not leave a single kernel behind.

Next we were presented the Watercress Caesar, that our waitress kindly split for us. The portion was XL, & perfect for sharing with 3+. I eat my salads bone dry, so the salad was overdressed for me, but perfect for my bf (dressing was well executed, I ate through it being overdressed). The watercress was SO DELICIOUS, & the croutons were seasoned/so fresh. 

Following the salad, came the entrees + side dish! The waitress did a fantastic job at coursing our plethora of food. I started w/ the Shrimp + Quinoa Cazuela, which came with Argentinian red shrimp as the feature. These shrimp had phenomenal texture, & you could tell they were recently caught. The beluga lentils within were delicious, but the portion of quinoa overwhelmed the corn poblano pico marmalade. We loved the top half of the dish, leaving the undressed Quinoa as a garnish for the phenomenal shrimp/pico placed on top.

Next I dug into the side dish of Papitas Chicas. OH. MY. GOODNESS. YUM. These are basically the most delicious house-made french fries you will ever have (so crispy & evenly salted), perfectly doused with creamy huancaína, topped with pancetta and scallions. These could NOT be more delicious!! Not overly sauced, not overly soggy. I dreamed about this sauce, and the perfectly executed crispy french fries. I will be back to get this dish, or would happily consume this for happy hour as my main.

Finally I tried the Asado Negro Braised Short Ribs. I could tell they were going to be phenomenal off the way my boyfriend was enjoying them. They were cooked to perfection, being so tender without the excessive fattiness. Paired with black eyed peas done two ways, with pickled onions (yum). I would definitely recommend this entree, & would order again to share!

We skipped dessert (so full), but ordered a glass of Tokaji, shots of espresso, & the French Press Brew. All delicious.

We can't wait to go back & try more!

{"text":"OMG, THIS RESTAURANT IS A MUST! I came here with a group of friends for dinner last night+ right before the club. For starters the server was amazing. Patricia had so much knowledge of the menu and she was able to make the experience. She was attentive, funny, and was a great menu guide. On her recommendations we started with the short rib corn cake. They were these bite size burst of flavors. Then we had the octopus and these crispy chicken wings. The sauce was just spectacular. For my meal I had the pork with yucca (I'm going to make these at home) and brussel sprouts. I wish I took pictures, but it wouldn't have done justice. There was so much flavor in this dish, my mouth is watering thinking about it. Hands down Chica has changed my pallet forever. I just want to eat there everyday. On my next visit for sure!"}
{"text":"Love the name, the food, the service. Cool vibe and decor, simple but plentiful menu, Oscar was our server and so hospitable and helpful-we wanted him to pull up a chair and join us. Had the guac, chicken chiccarones, octopus, empanadas, ceviche, roasted chicken and several sides. Food so flavorful, decent but not overwhelming sizes -just delicious and such an enjoyable evening. 2 birthdays being celebrated and treated to some cava and mini cakes with a candle -very sweet touch. As locals we will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Chica after reading great reviews.  I left feeling that the food was okay, mostly because I found everything way too salty.  

We ordered the guacamole which should be fine on its own with such fresh ingredients - the salt was overpowering.  Arepas were awesome, never had them before and loved the unique flavors - beet, black bean, cilantro and cheese.  The classic ceviche was overly \"limey\", so sour I didn't get to taste the flavors of the dish.  The grilled corn lollipop was tasty with its natural sweetness.  We also had the mac con queso, again too salty.

I ordered the Pepita Crusted Lamb.  Again way too salty but I appreciated the perfect medium rare more on the rare preparation per my request.  I couldn't really taste the lamb, just the saltiness of it all.  I did enjoy the crispy squash blossoms that accompanied the dish.  My mom ordered the braised short ribs and enjoyed it very much - perfect melt in your mouth tenderness, not fatty, not salty. 

The dishes are beautiful and the ingredients are so fresh, it does not require the heavy handed salt."}
{"text":"Chica's has such a great atmosphere from the moment you walk in.  The bar & lounge area is big and nice.  I could order a drink and appetizer and just hang out.  The service is excellent!  The staff is super friendly!  The food is above excellent!  The guacamole is a must.  It is fabulous with the plantain chips, I think they're better than the tortilla chips.  If there for brunch the sweet corn pancakes are a must.  They are so unique and different.  The coconut cream on top is so good and I don't even like coconut.  Can't wait to go back and try dinner next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the setting. Very swanky place with a nice vibe. We came here for an appetizer and drinks before going to the club. We enjoyed their guacamole alongside some of their crafted margaritas. Would definitely recommend the guacamole - it comes with these baby arepas - so tasty! Looking forward to coming back to try their mains."}
{"text":"We ordered the hash and egg breakfast, it was pretty good. Came with eggs, fried yuca, and some Brussel sprouts. We also ordered the french toast and cornbread pancakes for desert. Yum!"}
{"text":"So so good! We started with the chicharon and it was delicious. Then we had the short ribs and it was so tender and Delicious! The drinks were good too. Our waitress Beatriz was pretty awesome too. Def coming back for the dessert. I heard the churros were amazing."}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn writing this review. We just had lunch at Chica and the food is very good; guacamole was chunky and flavorful with a variety of interesting chips, Cuban sandwich was delicious, corn lollipops yummy, tacos delicious. But wow, very fully priced. Two tiny 3 bite shrimp tacos, a little side of black beans and marinated veggies were $18! My son's mini bottle of Diet Coke was $6. Iced tea $6. Cuban sandwich $18 (which seemed like the best value in our order) It's too much for a casual lunch and I don't think we'll return."}
{"text":"I had a great time at \"Chica\". The ambience and the music were great. I felt welcomed to join this restaurant. I was surprised of the small menu- limited options that can work either way (fast selection vs feeling that something is missing). We ordered an appetizer- Trio de 3 picos was delightful. The Steak with Chimichurri sauce was good with perfect portions. But the tacos were really tiny and had a different flavor that I'm not used to. Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this place on a whim and we were so pleasantly surprised by how delicious the food was! First off, the place is stunning! They  have a really great drink menu, there was something for everyone.  We started off with the octopus. the tuna ceviche, and a salad (can't remember the name but had shrimp and crab).  All three apps were insanely yummy, everything tasted so fresh.  For entrees we ordered the porchetta and the halibut.  The prochetta was not our favorite (skip I), but the halibut was perfectly cooked with a great marinade."}
{"text":"We really wanted to enjoy this meal...we truly did - as a few of our friends have been here and enjoyed it. We are locals here in town and once a week we like to try out a new restaurant in town and then return there again with friends if its good (so we don't run the risk of taking friends to a bad restaurant).
The greeter at the front was very friendly, but sadly this is where our experience went downhill. Our server was lukewarm at best - but our main issue (and after all the main reason why we went to the restaurant in the first place) was that our food was very 'meh'. My husband had the octopus for starters - it was very tough, and seemed like it had been overcooked. I had the Tuna ceviche - it didn't seem particularly fresh.
For our entrees we both had the halibut. There was nothing particularly wrong with this dish - it just was a bit small for the price we had paid and wasn't outstanding.
By this point in the meal we decided to skip desert as we figured it wouldn't be much better.
Maybe the kitchen was just having an off night. Or maybe its always like this?"}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant and I was not disappointed. Came in on Sunday Jan 21st expecting it to be crowded and busy but, the food was delicious, the atmosphere very welcoming and staff was knowledgeable and friendly. My server Adrienne was a rockstar, she helped me pick out the best items on the menu and made the experience very enjoyable! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Chica was a nice restaurant inside the Venetian Hotel in Vegas. Here is all you need to know about Chica....

Quality of food: the meal was delicious. I have to say that the appetizers were better than the main course. I would definitely order several appetizers over a full entree.... You get to try more and the options were better all around. The empanadas were delicious and so was the Mac and Cheese. 

Cocktails: I had a tamarind drink... It's the only one on the menu with tamarind in the name... It was a small cocktail with too much ice but very tasty. Wish there was more.

The ambience: the restaurant was just ok looking....very brown with little creative accents and decor. The side seems too large...a cozier, smaller venue would make the place more appealing. There's a feeling there's too much unused space.

Overall...good food ( nothing over the top and unexpected)... The service was excellent ( we had the best server)....good for a responsible night out in Vegas."}
{"text":"Outstanding Cuban sandwich and original cocktails with a story.  Huge and rare collection of mezcal.  Bartender Beau was really engaging and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"We just had the most unexpectedly wonderful meal here! It was on our way out of CES , we were hungry and had a plane to catch sooner than later, hey it was a gamble. Well, it paid off- great service, great food, perfect and innovative margarita ( \"Some like it hot\"). Try the Arepas- corn biscuits, really, with varied flavors. Shrimp and butter lettuce salad was great. The Marquesa for dessert- she had me at \" coffee-infused pastry and chocolate\". Excellent. Don't pass this place by on your way in or out of the Venetian."}
{"text":"Honestly, I've been wanting to dine at Chica the moment the construction walls were put up. This past weekend my wife and I had the pleasure of dining. We both ordered glasses of the white sangria, very refreshing. For appetizers we had the guacamole which had the perfect blend of spice and umami; with the plantains we were in heaven. The corn con queso was also a fun treat as were the carnitas tacos. You really cannot go wrong, we are excited to go back soon!"}
{"text":"This was the absolute best meal (and cocktails) I've ever had.  Chic atmosphere and great date spot. Do yourself a favor and add this restaurant to your Must Eats!!!

Our server, Brandon gave us the best recommendations and we couldn't have been more pleased with his service. 

MUST EATS: Trios of Picos and get the side of Guac. It comes with chips, plantains and arepas ... Chicharrones - my boyfriend said these were the best wings he's ever had! The onions and sauce made the dish!! For entrees, get the Braised Short Rib and Brazilian Beef Tenderloin. We both agree they were phenomenal. 

MUST DRINK: Chica-Rita - holy cow - the most amazing drink!!!! Not on the menu, but Brendon also whipped us up a Mezcal Old Fashioned, which was nothing short of perfect."}
{"text":"Well, I've had posponed this visit so many times but today was the day, let me tell you that the ambiance is really nice, the food is really good, and service was supreme.

I made the mistake by going on brunch time, they did not have the entrees ready yet so my wife and I ordered 3 appetizers, Chicken Chicharrones was kind of bland not too flavorful, Buffalo Wild Wings are better (sorry) then we had the Classic Ceviche, I loved it, I really hope it was real Leche de Tigre (which I know it's not) but it was fresh and tasty, the corn was a little bit undercook but it did not diminished the plate at all, maybe a little more peppers would do the trick, finally the marvelous, wonderful, amazing Grilled Peruvian Octopus, this one saved the review, the octopus is so tender and delicious full of flavor, the shishito peppers were on point, this dish is a must have, then my wife ordered their \"award winning\" Lemon Donuts, What kind of award did you get for this?  I can't say they were horrible but I can't say
they are worth the $15 we paid for them.
I will return on dinner time and will keep you posted I have faith in Lorena Garcia and her food.

I am not a chef so what do I know, I just love food."}
{"text":"Chica is so nice, I visited twice during Restaurant Week alone! The former DB Brasserie space has a fun mix of seating areas, furniture, styles, and textiles for a visually interesting space that also features multiple bar areas and grills where you can watch the food and drinks come together. Latin-inspired menu boasts hot and cold apps, meaty entrees, and a creative cocktail program. A dinner visit with friends allowed for sampling of several dishes and solidified plans to return for a lunch date.

APPS: I know everyone goes ape for guac, but the Mac and Queso is really the must-get option here, with Peruvian corn baked in a parm cream gratin. It's like a \"healthy\" mac and cheese due to the vegetables! After having this, the Grilled Corn Lollipops just didn't stand a chance. The fresh ceviches (options for tuna or halibut) are small but solid, with the empanadas arriving a bit overly charred and lacking moisture. The two apps I'd most been looking forward to, Grilled Octopus and Mushroom Quesadillas, underwhelmed. The former threw me off visually by matching the protein portion with so many shishitos and a surprisingly peppery sauce that overshadowed the tough tentacles, while the quesadillas were so thin as to prompt comments about whether the kitchen had forgotten the mushrooms and bleu cheese. The Chica fries were forgettable. 

MAINS: You gotta getta order of porchetta! Crispy skin, juicy and flavorful meat, sided with yucca, onion, and brussels. This was a great dish, but ask for a serrated knife because cutting through the skin was practically a workout in itself. Another standout is the Lemon Meyer rotisserie chicken (available by the half or whole), an explosion of juiciness and flavor, paired perfectly with an herb chimmi churri. The Shrimp & Quinoa Cazuela was surprisingly good pairing of trendy grain plus lentils, accented with cheese and several plump shrimp. Those favoring meat and potatoes will like the classic flavors of the Asado Negro Braised Short Rib, which unfortunately doesn't photograph well but was extremely tender. The lunch sandwichito Cubano was okay; a safe choice, not a standout

DESSERTS: Both of the dinner options we tried were visually appealing, but the Tres Leches was the favorite with a toasted meringue topper. The Venezuela Marquesa cake was nicely chocolatey with subtle coffee notes but not served with the crema ice cream I'd looked forward to. Lemon Bunelos from the lunch menu are tasty even without the berry and dulce dips, but not something I'd get again. 

 Service was friendly from bar to table and attentive both for visits. Notably, the sommelier took the initiative to come over after noticing Kevin L checking out the drink menu and his suggestions were spot-on for the requested flavor and budget preferences! 

I enjoyed Chica, finding it to be a great improvement over the previous restaurant. My only concern about dining here was the volume: it's noisy with all hard surfaces and much conversation had to be repeated or kept to those immediately adjacent, which is problematic for both group dining or a date night. Ultimately, I have to agree with Rod U, who declared this place \"impressive and fun\"!"}
{"text":"Not your run-of-the-mill restaurant (if there is such a thing in Vegas). The food was interesting and appealing, and Shawna's service was impeccable. The atmosphere was sort of a \"girl-power\" vibe (hence the name) without being in-your-face. We both had tacos (the fish and the pulled pork), and they were great. We'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"We went here twice! I really wanted fish tacos but they didn't have it on the menu. The waiter and team went out of their way to make me some fish tacos for dinner and they were amazing! You have to try the guacamole and chips too!"}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. Restaurant is small but trendy with nice dim lighting and some music but not so loud that you can't talk. Cocktails are truly unique with an interesting spin and delicious. I had the grilled octopus and seared steak kale salad. Portions were a good size, prices good compared to other restaurants and the service was excellent. This is one that I will add to my when in Las Vegas  restaurant list for sure."}
{"text":"Needed a small break and snack while gambling. Late afternoon stopped in with my Mom. Pretty dead, except for a few ppl at the bar. Service was very nice and friendly. Ordered two apps : calamari and chicken chicharrones- neither were exciting for the price. For $16 each, they just weren't what I would expect. There were enough of them, portion wise... 
We did not drink or have anything else, but based of this experience.. I think we could find a better Mexican option on the Strip."}
{"text":"Sorry but I'm not sure why people rate this place so highly.  People rave about their octopus- oh please there are better places in vegas to get better grilled octopus.  Their empanadas do ROCK!!! Thank good for the chicken appetizer and lollipop corn- it save my dining experience.  The cocktails are good. The ambience is cool.  Service is just ok- food was delayed thank God our server saw that our food is taking a while.  The extra server seems he wanted us out of there quickly.  I had better food and service next door."}
{"text":"I came here at the recommendation of a friend. They had just opened not too long ago when I went. The service was great. The food was excellent. We went for the brunch menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant!!' The food was outstanding and so was the service as well as sangria. The wait staff Learned it was our family birthdays this month and made us a special dessert. Was just a great special touch! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"This experience was amazing. The food was great, the white sangria is very refreshing and the service was beyond good. Ask for Randy, he will take care of you. He knows the menu very well.  Guacamole was fabulous and I don't even like avocados!!  Kale salad - great!  Cauliflower - great!  Chicken chicharrones - great!  But my favorite was their corn mac and cheese. I can't remember what it's called but it's essentially mac and cheese with corn instead of pasta. So yummy!  I will definitely return to try the octopus and the Meyer lemon chicken. Plus we were too full to sample the yummy desserts. A must try!"}
{"text":"I was excited to go try it , was super disappointed.. the steak sandwich was cold, the steak for the Kale steak salad was super chewy.. and the soda is served in tiny bottles and they have no refills .. overall it was an expensive crappy meal .. the service was slow"}
{"text":"Disappointed by this place despite excellent Yelp rating. 

Service and ambience were excellent. The mushroom quesadilla appetizer. Was very good although little bit small for sharing. The arepase appetizer was also quite good but incredibly tiny. My Venezuelan friend was very surprised by the size of each bite sized arepa.  I'm vegetarian, so they customize one of the entrées for me. It was quinoa with roasted cauliflower. The quinoa was overly salty and roasted cauliflower wasn't cooked enough to really complement the  quinoa. .


Margarita was average considering it was a specialty drink. I think it was the one with Tamron and/or chili pepper in it.

My dining companions also ordered dessert of churro lollipops. They said it was good but not spectacular. 

Would not come back. Excellent service and ambience brought up my rating to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience.
Cocktails: Expat had good flavors. Not best drink ever, but a great one nonetheless. The caipirinha de fresa was a bit boring and basic.
Food: tuna ceviche was pretty good - good flavors and texture. The calamari was solid - an expected level of satisfactory.
Dessert: I really liked my chocolate ganache graham cracker piece. The textures and flavors were just how I like them. My boyfriend really liked the tres leches, even if I wasn't a fan myself. The churro pops were also really good, and I don't even usually like churros.
The feel and look of the place is great. And this might sound weird but the lighting was perfect. Music was the volume and type to not disrupt conversation. The staff was great, we received excellent service! No complaints in that department at all."}
{"text":"WOW! The whole experience was amazing from start to finish. Make sure that you ask for Randy he will take amazing care of you and added to a wonderful culinary experience. The atmosphere of the restaurant added to the whole experience. Every entree our table had was AMAZING! Can't  wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Our food was superb. I can't say more than the flavors alone were just unexplainable. The manager James really made sure we were taken care of and our server Franchesa fulfilled our experience with 5 stars. Friendly, and fun and full of deliciousness."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere.  We ordered grilled octopus which was superb.  Chicken chicharones which was very good.  Guacamole was decent with plantains which were nice.   Shrimp and crab salad was pretty good. Mushroom quesadillas were excellent   Overall very good"}
{"text":"I've been eagerly anticipating checking out Chica.  What a disappointment.  We ordered the guac and the portion was rather small.. it tasted good. Not amazing but less than 1 cup portion.  We ordered the pork tacos. There were 3 and each smaller than a Ritz cracker. For a $16 appetizer I find that to be ludacris. The flavor was good I guess but the small tortilla was soggy and the portion size was embarrassing. The blackberry marg was tasty.  Overall I find Chica to be over priced and not worth the cost.  The vibe was ok but the set up was weird my head was under some huge sports screen at a 3 top in the bar.  
Javier's will remain my favorite."}
{"text":"Wow.  We eat Peruvian food all over the US and in the islands.  From the Tamarind Colada through top shelf ceviche and empanadas to fantastic shrimp dishes, we were beyond impressed with every bite.  Nicole C was as attentive and efficient as she was friendly.  We could not ask for more in our choice of a casual dinner in the Venetian.  Thank you Nicole C and we will see you again soon, Chica!"}
{"text":"Corn, corn, and more corn. Is the name of this restaurant Chica, or Choclo? I was hesitant to try this place after a disappointing dinner at Yardbird next door and part of the same restaurant group. I'm so glad I decided to celebrate my birthday brunch at Chica, as it was one of my favorite restaurant experiences in Las Vegas. The restaurant's interior design is beautiful. Everything I tried was delicious! (Except for the Huancaína sauce... that recipe needs to be revised right away.)

The sangria manzana was a refreshing take on white sangria. Guacamole made a nice starter with fresh tortilla chips, plantain chips, and assorted flavors of fried arepitas. The Venezuelan-style corn pancakes were a hit with me and my ten month old daughter. I think the mac con queso will be the most memorable dish. It's actually a creamy gratin version of choclo con queso (giant Peruvian corn with fresh cheese, typical street food served all over Peru), with the addition of hearts of palm and spinach, so don't expect macaroni.

I enjoyed a few bites of marquesa de chocolate as a birthday treat, but I was unfortunately too full to order dessert. As a Las Vegas local, I was also set up with a VIP card, and I'm hoping to return to Chica again! I'll try to order something other than corn next time."}
{"text":"Great ambience and a great looking restaurant. That being said, service for lunch on a Saturday was terrible, server was MIA for the most part, came in, told us to have water then left...came back again to ask if it was our first time there, left again, came back and finally took our drink order.

Drinks took 20 minutes to get to us, restaurant was empty-ish. 

We went with the restaurant week menu and it was very good, portions were adequate and the food was awesome. 

I dont think we would go back based on the service and the incredible prices that they have, definitely not worth the trip to overpay at this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time here to meet up with a girlfriend. We sat at the bar. Bartenders were very friendly and welcoming.  We ordered a couple small dishes all was great no complaints!! Our only negative thought was there was only all Male bartenders not one single female bartender.  Maybe it was just the time of day??"}
{"text":"One of the best Latin restaurants I've ever experienced with a contemporary spin to some dishes such as arepas and Mexican street corn. We ordered 4 small plates, full Meyer Lemon Rotisserie chicken, Hoppin' John's rice and a side of fries for 2 adults and 2 kids. The food was more than enough with left overs to spare. Of the 4 small plates we really enjoyed the trio de picos, arepas and empanadas. While the guacamole was very good, I would go with the picos over the guacamole if you are considering a chips and dip small plate. The chicken was very flavorful and moist. The rice is highly recommended as well. My wife and I shared the tres leches cake, which was excellent as well as authentic. While our kids managed to leave satisfied, there is no kids menu, so I would not recommend this place for kids unless you have more adventurous eaters (i.e. willing to stray away from pizza, hot dog, burger, etc.). As this restaurant is along the strip be prepared to spend $35-$50 per person. Overall, I would highly recommend Chica to anyone looking for great Latin fare while in Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't really understand the hype of this place. The food was just adequate. Our server was extremely friendly, but somehow paced our donut order first and then our entrées much later. We were very hungry and wanted our food at once and were surprised that she would assume to do this. We did not think that we had to explicitly mentioned this since it was not an appetizer order. There are far better choices."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant!! While staying at the Venetian I was looking for a place for brunch and playing slots. When I walked into this place I was blown away on the atmosphere and it felt like I was walking into an entirely different place. I had the guacamole with banana chips, empanadas, and octopus.  All three dishes were so amazing...so delicious...the octopus had the right amount of spices and the empanadas tasted like what my mom use to make which were delicious! Also, I have had chips and guacamole many times but not with banana chips...WOW!!! I can't go back to normal tortilla chips after this! And, to top it off, for dessert I had abuellous with an amazing beer that I have never had before from Abel & Baker Brewery.  The service was also really great too as the server was on point for timing and making sure I had everything I needed to enjoy my meal. This is truly an amazing restaurant...delicious, unique and indescribable food that I will definitely be back for! I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is craving something different than your typical Las Vegas strip food. All I can still say is wow and yum!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, but overpriced.  Ambiance okay, but not great.  Service so so, not bad but waiter was inexperienced and overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Great time at this restaurant last night! We loved the decor. Very inviting and the vibe was super cool. We sat at the bar. Our bartender, Jessica, was the best! She was very helpful with the menu and very knowledgeable about the dishes and the drinks. The specialty cocktails were dangerously delicious! Very refreshing and paired perfectly with the food. The food runners that brought the food described all the dishes very well. We loved the octopus and chicharrones. The halibut was cooked absolutely perfectly! The manager was very professional and friendly when she came  by to make sure everything was going wonderful. All around very impressed with the service. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is by far my FAVORITE GEM in LAS VEGAS!
It's a an explosion of orgasmic flavors in you mouth! Perfection to say the least. You're greeted with a smile and if you eat at the bar the way we did you will fall in love with D \"best bartender\" ever. Great attitude and EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGABLE OF THEIR MENU. And their Manager \"JoY\" is amazing as well greeted us with a smile and checked in with all the guests."}
{"text":"Came here the other night with my Fiancé. Place is really good! Something completely different, being Peruvian. 

The decor was very nice. Pretty good ambiance. Really big on the inside.

The service started out impecable. But as our waiter started to get more tables, it quickly died fast. We started to ask the table busser for service.

The food was really good. My only thing about the dishes were the lack of sauce or cheese. Other than that it was very good!

We ordered:

Guacamole with chips, plantains, and arepas.
The arepas were dry.

Corn con queso - very good! Especially ordered with the chips

Empanadas - Very good.

Pork Tacos - Good. Tiny!!! Not much to eat

Mushroom quesadillas - good but tiny!!

Arepa with short rib - Very Good!

Crispy Pork Dish - Huge portion. Very good flavor. No sauce of any sort - so very dry

Short Rib - Huge! Great flavor! Best dish

Churro crusted Ice Cream - Meh...pass

Overall - a great place to try out. Some of the dishes were too small of portions. Also, if they added some sort of Sauce or more Cheese to dishes- I think it could have gone a long way."}
{"text":"Five stars! I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for authentic Latin American cuisine. Coming from someone raised in Latin America, I'm usually skeptical of restaurants that claim to have Latin American food because although the dishes try to imitate Latin American styles, they usually come up short and completely miss the subtle flavors that make these dishes what they're supposed to be. However, Chica completely nailed it. The whole chicken with chimichurri is a must-have (we shared it among four people) and the small dishes were delicious as well. The mini arepas that came with the guacamole were a really nice surprise and the empanadas were simply amazing and tasted just like the ones back home. Besides that, the latin music was on point and the cocktails were great too!"}
{"text":"I usually only write reviews when I'm pissed, like the mad rapper, but the mad yelper in my case.  I went to eat an early dinner at Chica, and I'm glad I did mayn!   It's a restaurant with South American influences, that didn't fall short in any category.  Everything from the octopus to the porchetta pork was cooked perfectly.  If there is anything negative I would say is that the cocktails are small, but I'm not gonna hate just cause of that.  Then I got the tres leches and labeled this place a favorite of mine.  Chica has a fan now, and I plan to have many more dinners here when I visit Vegas.  #DubNation"}
{"text":"WOW!!!! What a wonderful dining experience!!!! I'm so impressed with everything from start to finish. The decor is an incredible mix of color, texture, pattern...a modern take on island, Latin, eclectic and a little boho. Even the menus are gorgeous. The lighting really sets the mood for relaxing and intimate conversation. 

We started with a sangria each...mine was the white and his the red. We were both delighted. The white had 3 different fresh fruits, it was so light and refreshing. 

ORDER the empanadas and arepas for appetizer 

The halibut wasn't great, and they were so kind to take it off our bill. Mya, our server, so sweet and gorgeous!

The tres leches cake was divine 

Perfect birthday dinner!!!!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, I dined at Chica with my best friend and her coworker. We went based on the great reviews on Yelp. The service was good. It was unpretentious and our waitress was very nice. Maybe we ordered the wrong things? We weren't starving and trying to eat a bit more healthy before going out that night so we got guacamole to share (which was good with the different types of chips they served with it) and salads as our main. My best friend and I got the chicken Caesar salad as it's really hard to mess that up and we just wanted something quick. My best friend's coworker got the kale salad with steak. We also got octopus per the server's suggestion. The octopus and guacamole were pretty good. The octopus was a very small portion to share for 3 people. It was perfectly charred and the flavors were good, though a bit salty. The guacamole was fresh and like I mentioned above, the variety of chips was a nice touch. The salads however, were TERRIBLE. My chicken was so dry and so was my best friends' chicken. Her coworkers' steak was so tough and the salad itself was disgusting (I hate to use this word but it was really not good at all). Maybe we shouldn't have gotten salads, but honestly, it's hard to mess up a salad but they somehow found a way to. They noticed we didn't finish the salads and asked if they wanted us to \"remake it\" but why would we want you to remake something that is clearly not good, 30 minutes into us receiving the food? They didn't offer any discounts on our food and drinks (we did order cocktails as well). We weren't looking for a discount anyways, but the offer to re-do our food was nice but too late. It was pricey for what it was, and i'm one to spend on food and not look at the price too much as long as it tastes delicious. Definitely won't be back as Vegas has plenty of great options and is a culinary paradise. The food was just meh and the two words come to mind when I think of my meal at Chica: SALTY and TOUGH."}
{"text":"Service aaa+ chicken pretty amazing, the calamari a bit too fried but not bad and the oysters were top notch. The wine was very tasty and the ambience very nice and clean. Our waiter was a cool guy he made sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is lively with great Spanish music. The chicken chicharrón was delicious as was the braised short rib dinner. I added yucca onion Brussels sprout  fries which did not disappoint. I was surprised as I don't like sprouts but loved this. My friend ordered the empanada and we didn't really like them. Great place."}
{"text":"Infuriating.

After making a reservation for my mom's birthday since we were having a family reunion (we all live out of state in different locations), we were so excited to narrow it down to Chica at the Venetian. The ambiance and food were what drove us to choose this place. I went to the restaurant website, made a reservation, and got confirmation for tonight's dinner.

Upon arrival, we noticed there was a convention going on, but no actual restaurant employee in front of the house- just the conference leaders shuffling people in. When I tried to enter to find someone, the conference worker directed me outside to the left..to nowhere. Perplexed, I called and spoke with Kayla and James. They let me know that according to their records, they had called twice to try to update me of the unavailability of tonight for regular dining. I never got any missed calls. When I asked why they did not leave a voicemail or email me, they said according to their records, they could not leave a voicemail and did not have my email. There was really nothing they could do since the restaurant was closed to the public. Why have your restaurant linked to an online reservation system where you confirm via email when they can't communicate there with you directly..?

Kayla and James were empathetic and professional- I do not blame the actual staff working at the location. I do, however, feel that it's my responsibility to warn others of corporate irresponsibility in making sure they have a direct and convenient way of communicating with their customers.. especially when cancelling reservations."}
{"text":"This place is so tasty! My husband and I stopped here for lunch and we weren't disappointed. We had the guacamole appetizer and it was so fresh, you can taste the quality in the chips and the guacamole. 

For our entrees, my husband got the chicken with chimichurri and I got the braised beef. Both dishes were expectional.

For drinks, I got the watermelon mojito which had more ice than drink but it was delicious and my husband got a Malbec.

The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is fun. They play great music which makes the energy up.
I would come back next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We stopped at this place while in Vegas for a long weekend and were really happy with both the service and the food. As foodies, we just wanted a bite here and a bite there so we could try multiple restaurants in the area. We ordered the Peruvian Grilled Octopus and it was amazing! Before we left our waitress brought out a beautiful dessert of Churro Fried Ice Cream Pops on the house! I don't often like desserts, but this was wonderful. Don't skip this restaurant!"}
{"text":"It's a very pretty restaurant with good food and good service! My friend and I went for brunch and shared several items. My favorites included the corn lollipops which were great with lime and cotija cheese, as well as the octopus which was very tender and flavorful with the shishito peppers and spicy pico. We also had the steak and egg tacos, ceviche, and empanadas which were all delicious as well. The espresso filled churros were a little on the smaller side, but we ate it as dessert along with the tres leches cake and they were both sooo good. 

Sangrias were tasty, of course. The food came out quickly, and the service was very friendly. I can't wait to come back and try their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"I saw an ad for this restaurant awhile ago talking about how Lorena Garcia was one of the first Latin women to have a restaurant on the strip which I thought was pretty cool. We came here after a particularly rough day in Vegas and were absolutely blown away by the hospitality. They gave us both a free glass of champagne, so nice! I forget our servers name but she was an absolute gem. 

I started with a cocktail- a tamarind guava colada. Delicious spin on a pina colada with a tanginess from the tamarind. Really refreshing! From there we split a few appetizers:

Guacamole- pretty standard as far as guac goes but what stood out was the dippers. They had  tortilla chips obviously, but also fried plantain chips and mini arepas. I loved this, no one ever gets fancy on the chips so I appreciated not only the variety but also the creativity. The plantain chips were a bit greasy but the mini arepas were awesome with the guac! 

Empanadas- These were my least favorite, the inside was just a bit bland. It could have benefited from better seasoning, some cheese pull or perhaps a sauce on the side just to pump up the flavor. 

Pulled pork tacos- These were my boyfriends favorite. Three mini tacos on homemade corn tortillas with melt in your mouth tender pork. The slaw, salsa, and peppers all combined for a yummy little taco. 

Asado Negro Arepas- YES. These were my favorite. I just love the mini arepas they make here. They're so soft and the perfect canvas for the incredible braised short ribs sitting on top. The meat was cooked so well, so tender and juicy. There's also a great anise flavor that comes through which I really enjoyed. 10/10 don't pass on this app! 

We ended our meal with the churro fried ice cream pops. SO GOOD. What an original dessert, an unexpected riff on churros. The pop was made with a delicious caramel ice cream coated in cinnamon sugar. You held the pop up with a mini churro stick in it- I wasn't sure these would be able to be held without breaking but the churros worked perfectly! It came with a vanilla bean anglaise and a really good whipped cream, more like a cool whip it was so luscious. Definitely recommend this dessert!"}
{"text":"Spare rib was perfectly cooked, but under-seasoned. The Peruvian-style grilled octopus was to die for. Proficient cocktails - decent beer selection. Nice decor, though a little on the dark side, so visibility was tough for some of my older comrades. There was a good view of the casino, if you're in to that sort of thing."}
{"text":"Very loud and lighting was very poor.  The guacamole appetizer was excellent but the main course was just fair.  The shrimp was over cooked and tough.  The lighting was so poor it was hard to see what we were eating.  Very pricey!!!"}
{"text":"I went in not knowing much about the background of this place, but breakfast was great and they have these mini churros filled with an expression flavored sauce and they were delicious! We also were the first customers that day and the chef made us these lemon pastry balls that were AMAZING. AND little did I know that the chef who runs the place is Lorena Garcia! What??"}
{"text":"Food here is awesome and staff is incredible. I wish the corn pancakes had a gluten free version. That would really make my day. I like the small plates and on one night combined them to make a meal. On another day I had a full meal. One of my favorite restaurants in Venetian and Palazzo"}
{"text":"We went for dinner as a promo for the Venetian so we didn't know what to expect. First we were greeted warmly at the hostess desk. The decor is beautiful with a well appointed cocktail bar in the front, ceviche/salad bar in the middle, and a churrascaria in the back. Our server was extremely attentive and knowledgeable while presenting us with a prix fixe menu which allotted us much more than we were expecting. Everything was delicious, flavorful, and the portions were surprisingly large! This dinner was a nice surprise and will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Been a few times and tried a few different items for brunch.  Our favorites are the porchetta breakfast sandwich and the grits/chorizo/eggs sauce item.  Both are yummy.  The grits are a must order there.  No cheeses needed!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is lovely, staff are so personalble & professional! The Tapas, Entrees, and Desserts; presentation & flavours are Spectacular! Thank you Francesca you are fabulous!"}
{"text":"Made My Vegas Vacation Thank You Chef Lorena Garcia!

On my recent vacation to Vegas we went to various restaurants.  Chica over delivered.  From the knowledgeable and courteous wait staff to the most amazing Latin food I have eaten.  This restaurant is clearly a fusion of many Latin and Caribbean cultures. I have had the opportunity to have many different types of Latin foods in my life due to places I have lived and Chica was able to bring the best of all the cultures together.
I went for brunch and had the Latin Breakfast. Two eggs scrambled, with the house made chorizo sausage, with assorted arepas.  My mother had the chicken sausage and both were amazing.  It had been so long since I had arepas and it brought me back home. When I tell you the eggs were season to perfection and something as simple as the coffee was the best cup of coffee I have ever had.  I could have drunk it black with no sugar.  The waitress was so knowledgeable about the menu and where the food is sourced. She also got the kitchen to prepare us a small sample plate of two of the lemon doughnuts.  We really wanted to try them but were full after our meal.  I understand now why the lemon doughnuts are award winning.  Chef Lorena Garcia is clearly doing what she was created on this earth to do because eating at her restaurant is a gift.  
I recommend you place Chica Restaurant on your must eat list when you visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Adiós to the mediocre DB Brasserie... Chef Lorena Garcia has arrived ;)

Chica is beyond beautiful on the inside! You can just feel the fiery Latin energy and soulfulness moving throughout the entire restaurant. The menu is creative and sophisticated but not pretentious, and it's full of indulgent and downright delicious offerings from all different Latin American countries.

Thank you to Oscar for being a vibrant and wonderful host during our first time at Chica. I'm so thrilled to return to the best Latin restaurant on the Strip over and over again!"}
{"text":"Fun place, I had my Birthday dinner here with a bunch of work friends. Very nice to have a location that touches on the colorful variety of Latin American Cuisine. Awesome location, delicious drinks and spectacular food. Thanks for the wonderful time!"}
{"text":"I are here 2 days in a row I loved it so much!!! Jimmy was our waiter and he could not have been more stellar. He was so attentive and thoughtful to us. We really appreciated his awesome service. The food here is like Mexican with a twist! Every dish we are, from the grilled octopus to the shrimp and quinoa to the pulled pork tacos and steak and kale salad and chips and guacamole. Everything was delicious and so creative. An explosion of flavors in your mouth. Danny, I think is one of the owners and he was awesome. He brought out our dishes and shared the inspiration behind the restaurant with us and sent us a special treat for dessert. This is hands down the best restaurant in the Venetian. The reviews speak for themselves!!!!"}
{"text":"Mexican street corn at its best!!! The pulled pork tacos are delicious as well. We ordered seconds of each of these items. Everything was so fresh and very satisfying"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch...it wasn't great and it wasn't terrible. Just kinda unmemorable!
Ordered the empanada tapas and beef short rib tacos. The empanadas were quite black and this took away from the taste considerably. I was excited about the tacos but they were 2 \"street\" tacos with a single tortilla for each. They fell apart when you picked them up to eat them....there's a reason even the cheap taco truck uses 2 tortillas!!
Was it food you can eat??? Yes
Was it crave-able and yummy??? No"}
{"text":"Mmm... I am still on the fence on this place. As a Peruvian I was excited to see our cuisine on the menu, but even for being \"fusion\" the ceviche was a disappointment for me.  One of my friends was horrified by whatever they called pisco sour. Definitely not it. She was not impressed by the calamari either.  I ordered the panna cotta too.  Good tasting but I didn't like scraping my plate to get to the coulis. I am all up for experimenting but this wasn't it for me.   Maybe next time I'll try the Venezuelan side of the menu."}
{"text":"It was a pleasure bumping into this restaurant on my trip. It is located at the Venetian hotel so it is really easy to find.
This restaurant is reservation recommended, but we kind of barged in and they were super nice about seating us anyway. The service was great and it felt like the servers were genuinely attentive to our needs. Our water glasses didn't just stay full and we weren't just checked in on; we felt like we were part of a luxury dining experience. I feel like service makes a huge difference when dining out.
The menu was small, but appropriate and fully covered a variety of Latin American flavors that I would expect to see in more traditional dining. The prices were on the upper end of average, but the portions did appetizers were really small and not shareable. 
The plating was beautiful and modern and all of the food tasted amazing. I'm definitely inspired to come back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our brunch here. There were a lot of gluten-free options and the arepas are gf now! We loved the arepas- of course they are not traditional but if that doesn't bother you then you'll probably enjoy them. They come in really nice flavors- cheese, beetroot, cilantro, and black bean. The beetroot and cilantro taste like you are eating an actual beetroot and a bunch of cilantro which, for us, was fantastic. The black bean and cheese ones are very good too. They are a little greasy but still very good. We would love to see ones stuffed with meat in the future. We ate them so fast and they were so filling that we didn't eat much of our main dishes. I had the huevos rancheros and my partner had the steak tacos. Both meals tasted very good but not as great as the arepas. The huevos rancheros had too much cheese for me but other than that it was well made. The steak tacos had a lot going on within the taco so we didn't get very much steak. The flavor was good and the rice and beans were fine. 

Our servers were very nice, accommodating, and attentive. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great place, food is delicious and service was excellent. We had dinner there for anticipation of my sister birthday and enjoyed our time there. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here during their first week and amazing service! They didn't have a table for five right away so gave us seats in the lounge with a free drinks and an appetizer. The salsa trio was amazing, but the corn one was out of this world! The assistant manager Mike was the best, next time I'm in Vegas will stop here first!"}
{"text":"The service and food were so good.  I can't say enough about our server Patricia she was so nice and knew all the items on menu .  Me and my wife will definitely be back when we come back to town."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends for lunch, but they were only serving brunch. We were somewhat let down, as we had our lunch menu order set in our minds, but fortunately the brunch menu was very creative. 

We started with the guacamole and empanadas. The guacamole was not your usual, as it came with arepas (I love arepas), tortilla chips, and plantain chips. For mains I had the chicken and waffles Peruvian style which was quite nice. I also sampled the breakfast burrito and that was really good. I will be coming back for lunch or dinner. :)"}
{"text":"After returning a second time and trying the grits and chorizo I am more confident that the food here is 5star. These grits are flavorful and delicious, but the star is this red sauce on top. Overwhelming depth of flavor and just the right texture. I'm actually genuinely excited to try them for dinner if the brunch food is this interesting!"}
{"text":"Chica!!!!! BEST MEAL IN VEGAS!!!! Good lord this is the best meal I have ever had!!!! Seriously. It doesn't disappoint! I've recommended this restaurant to a ridiculous amount of people and all of them re visit and gush about how amazing the food is. Chica is amazing, I've never seen a new restaurant have their menu this dialed in so soon in their business. The cocktails alone are on point! Try the tamarind guava colada YASSSSS! Their mole is the best I've ever had (and I don't even like mole!). All the staff are amazing and knowledgeable. The management is so gracious, polite and accommodating! They personally stopped by our table to make sure we were having the best experience we could have. And we did have the best experience! We have tried almost everything on the menu and well all I can say is GO HERE! 100% worth it! I've probably sent about 50 people here and they love it and return. They also have a post card you can fill out and they send it for you! Such a great touch! Don't be afraid to order something you usually wouldn't they will surprise you. I could keep writing but just go (like now)!!!"}
{"text":"* Price: pretty expensive; salad $28, steak $50, drinks $15 starting. The portion is not big... 3 star.
* Ambiance: casual, Latin and earthy decor. No dress code (thumb up!) 4 star.
* Location: in the Venetian. So if you stay at the Palazzo, walking toward the Venetian casino to restaurant row (the map is confusing... so just ask casino peeps). 4 star.
* Meals: excellent. Every dish is well thought out and beautifully presented! Latin flavor with a lot of spice! 5 star.
* Service: our waitress, Monica is the best! 5 star.

This is averaged to 4 star!


This restaurant is recently opened at the Venetian. We saw their ad on the Palazzo Chanel and were fan of chef Lorena Garcia. We came for dinner on NYD. We were not disappointed!
 
For small plates or appetizers, we had Asada Negro Arepas, grilled octopus, and shrimp butter lettuce salad.
For main dish, we had Brazillian beef tenderloin with wild mushroom and HopinJose rice.
For desert, we had churro ice cream pops.
For drinks, we had tamarind guava colada and midnight in Puerto Rico. 

- Asada negro Arepas $13: corn biscuits with ribs. It was a perfect bite. 
- grilled octopus $18: octopus was very tender, slightly charred, spicy and perfectly seasoned. My favorite! You would not know it was octopus because the meat was so tender and well-treated.
- Shrimp butter lettuce salad $18: it looks like a painting! Everything is perfectly seasoned with pomegrade seeds, cheese cubes, and a hint of spicy with chipotle vinaigrette
-  Brazillian steak $52: the steak is served with grits... but it kinda works! The steak is so juicy and tender! I would definitely order it again.
- side dishes, mushroom $12 and Hopin Jose Rice $12 are good addition with the steak but can be missed. (We heard Mac con queso is very good but they ran out by 6 PM.)
- churro fried ice cream pops $12: it is worth every calorie and waist fat (sorry Dr. Oz... I would not give up this!) The caramel ice cream is coated in churro and cinnamon dust, so tasty, buttery and creamy ice cream!
Their drinks are pretty good but expensive! 

Overall, we enjoyed our first dinner of 2018 and were not disappointed! It is pretty expensive though but is expected in this area! Dinner for 2 is about $200 without tip."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I was totally impressed by the food and the service.  We were a party of 4 we all had something different but it was all delish.  We had the quac, the quesadilla,  a couple of different salads, a shrimp plate and even dessert.  The food and service r great but the prices r, I would say, I guess in line with Vegas expensive but oh well..it was a satisfying splurge.  Would highly recommend..enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was fabulous!  Sat at the bar and bartender was wonderful.  Her recommendations were spot on and loved everything.  Arepas were awesome and had the yuca and Russell sprout it was best \"starchy vegetable\" ever had.  Definitely a great spot to hit"}
{"text":"Wow! What a lovely and exquisite experience I had! The food wad delicious, the servers and the manager were very attentive and friendly and love the decor of the restaurant! Bravo Lorena Garcia... you nailed it with your unique touch in the food. Definitely will come again next time I come to Las Vegad"}
{"text":"Gift from the chef our restaurant Week is full of surprises. I was excited to try this place because of this on their restaurant Week menu, well false advertising there was nothing extra, I was disappointed when I pointed this out to our waiter he did nothing to fix it. The food was very tasty, the ambience was nice,service ok but don't like being lied too. Will not be going back to this place for this reason. At least I was able to donate to three square"}
{"text":"I was absolutely blown away with the dish I had, the lemon roasted half chicken. Absolutely divine and easily the best chicken I have ever had. The ambiance here is stunning, food is great, and menu looked fantastic! Definitely pricey, but if you want to impress, this is a winner. Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The service was slow, but they were nice absolutely nothing special as we experienced in the many other restaurants we visited this trip. The food was okay. The atmosphere was very good. The wine choices were decent. I know overall it receives a 4 star, reason we tried it. WE just can not give it a 4. Also they indicated my salad came with a citrus vinaigrette. I've never seen a creamy white thick citrus vinaigrette. When I questioned they confirmed it was indeed their version. That was quite disappointing since I do not use heavy calorie laden dressings on our salads."}
{"text":"overall i had a great experience at Chica! there were 6 of us and we decided to share so we could try lots of dishes from the brunch menu and most were a smashing hit. however there was a dish that disappointed me and my heart was so sad that it was the chicken and waffles. the flavor was good but the waffles got soggy quickly and the chicken isn't fried so instead of a crunchy or crispy bite the slimy chicken skin mixed with other wet textures served on the plate it was less then appetizing. this was highly recommended to us and it was rather an expensive dish for the outcome, no one wanted to finish finish it."}
{"text":"I dined at Chica on a Sunday night with a group of 5.  We didn't have a reservation, but were able to get a table with about a 90-minute wait.  And, wow, that wait was worth it.  

The venue is a bit dark and very interesting and beautiful inside.  The only issue I had the entire night was the music - it was entirely too loud.  The waiter had to yell the specials to us and conversation from one end of the table to the other was pretty tough.  

I began the dinner with a drink of their dark (raspberry?) sangria -- so very good!  For appetizers, we had the octopus and arepas - those flavors and textures were just perfection.  For dinner, I had the strip steak that included a mole/mushroom sauce --- HOLY MOLE -- it was amazing.  My husband had the short rib - which was also quite tasty (though, not as tasty as the mole sauce!).  

Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable.  With the exception of the LOUD music, dinner was perfect."}
{"text":"Service = Excellent 
Food= Excellent 
Ambiance= Excellent 
If you're ever in Vegas , you have to come to this place! The food is incredible and fresh! The service is superb!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were visiting Vegas for three days. She is gluten & dairy free. They accommodated us well, so we returned 3 more times during our stay. There was simply nowhere better to go. The slow roasted chicken was phenomenal every time."}
{"text":"The first thing you can tell about Chica is that the chef is truly Hispanic, she knows what she's doing and it's appreciated.
I went to Chica with my family to celebrate Father's Day and it didn't disappoint.
I got a steak arepa and it was great, the fries were a little too sophisticated to me, they tasted good but I would have loved to get more arepa or steak than fries.
My kids got a burger to share, they certainly don't have the most refined palate, however, one of the reasons they pushed back on the burger is because it came with cheese, although we requested it with no cheese. It's not the end of the world so we didn't even mention it to the waiter and the kids eventually ate most of it in a very inelegant way.
My wife got street corn, probably the most beautifully presented corn I've ever seen, the taste was great but it's worth ordering it just to admire the braid they do with the leaves. The other thing my wife got was Peruvian ceviche, it was really good although it was a little sweet, if you're into the sour flavor that tons of lime juice adds to Mexican ceviche, this might be a bit disappointing, however this is very authentic."}
{"text":"I flew to Vegas on last Wednesday for business meetings. I flew my wife up for the weekend because she wanted to go hiking and then visit CHICA, which she has always wanted to do. We go for our hike on Saturday and we head back to our hotel exhausted shower and get dressed in jeans and shirt. My wife gets ready fast and  is excited to go eat there. We get there she sees Lorena at the bar sitting and appearing to be FaceTiming with someone. My wife is excited. We are seated near the bar area, which is not so busy... we wait over 10 without any acknowledgement. We see someone get a second round of drinks before we are even greeted. I told my wife let's go maybe we aren't dressed up enough to be seen, I'll take my money elsewhere. Very poor service. Your better off visiting Cañonita, AWESOME SERVICE and staff is very nice. And the food was 5STAR!!"}
{"text":"Went to the soft opening a couple days ago.  The restaurant is right in \"restaurant row\" at the end/beginning of where it spills out to the casino floor.  We loved the chic open restaurant with it's grey walls and purple accents.  The bar was nice and spacious and there were other areas open to the restaurant where they were preparing various food item.  Service was great.  Our server was Kayla...she was sweet as candy.  We had the trio appetizer which was fabulous with tortilla chips, plantains, two different style yummy salas and some type of corn salsa mix. I loved that.  They also served some little tiny croquette things that we were told was what in Latin countries is popular to serve with meals, much the way bread is served before meals in America.   I could eat those little round corn fritter things all day long.  I forget the name of them,sorry but I think they come automatically with every ones meal.  The beef tenderloin with grits was awesome.  Shrimp and quinoa was also pretty tasty.   Overall, a fun, cool experience, great atmosphere and decor and excellent service."}
{"text":"Had the chimichurri steak, very good.  The house special Chicarita was above the rest and nicely garnished.  Ambiance was great for a place inside of a mega hotel.  Also saw plenty of seating in the bar area, great place to drink.

Tuna cervichi was great too."}
{"text":"Chica is located on Restaurant Row in the Venetian just off the casino floor. The menu is Chef Lorena Garcia's spin on Classic Latin Food. The atmosphere is a little dark but lively with bright pillows and interesting wall paper on some walls. My photos don't do justice here.

They sat us by the Rotisserie and the aroma was intoxicating from the Marinated Meyer Lemon Chickens spinning around so I had to order that for dinner.

We started with the Wild Mushroom Quesadilla. It differed from quesadillas you get at most places. It was more elevated. Besides mushrooms it contained Huitlacoche, Oaxacan Cheese, Jalapeño Pesto and Pickled Onion. They served it in a tower that was held together with Guacamole. It was the most interesting detailed quesadilla I ever had.

I had the 1/2 Marinated Meyer Lemon Rotisserie Chicken. The Chicken was the moistest Rotisserie Chicken I ever had. Even the breast almost fell apart. The chicken was very flavorful and was delicious! Off to the side was Purple Peruvian Potato Salad with Palm. It was very spicy with Jalapeño but also was creamy to cut the heat. It also was herbaceous with Cilantro.

My husband enjoyed the Porchetta with crisp Yucca Hash with Brussels Sprouts with Pearl Onions and Escabeche.

They did send samples of some of the other foods they offer our way. (and man they were awesome) I was told it was because I mentioned that I was a fan of Chef Lorena Garcia. I did notice other tables didn't get the samples we got.

Everyone working there was very friendly with us and treated us like we already were regulars.

We enjoyed dining at Chica Very Much!"}
{"text":"Excellent Service, Great Food, Good Price Point

Went here for Restaurant Week to try it and see if we wanted to go again.  I would emphatically assert that we are definitely going back again.  The craft cocktails were excellent as was the food.  

We tried the Mac Con Queso and Tuna Ceviche for appetizers.  The insertion of corn that looks like hominy was an interesting touch.  I would have preferred pasta instead of the corn in the Mac Con Queso, but it was interesting and tasty.  The Tuna Ceviche was great, although the corn in this dish was just weird.  

For sides, we ordered the corn and cauliflower.  These were both great and I would order them again.

For the entrees, we had the Braised Short Rib and the Porchetta with Crispy Yucca Hash.  The Short Rib was excellent.  It was moist throughout the entire protein and had a nice flavor that was similar to a mole sauce.  The Porchetta was very gamey, but not entirely unexpected.  It had a flavor of free range meat, so if you're not into this type of flavor, you might find it unappealing.  That said, the Yucca Hash was dynamite!  I would just eat that on its own if it was offered as a appetizer.  The fried brussel spouts were excellent.  The only downside is that there weren't more of them.  

Finally, the desserts were awesome.  The tres leches was one of the best I've ever tasted (although I hated the meringue that tasted more like marshmallows).  The Marquesa de Chocolate was very heavy and rich.  

Finally, the service was great.  I enjoyed speaking to Francesca.  As we are local, I was happy to tell her about my other favorite restaurants and the places I've tried, and to hear about the places she worked at and what she was going to try.  

Vegas is a great food city, and this is definitely a place you should check out!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything was delicious and tasted perfect. The flavors and the selections were just beyond my expectations. I'm Brazilian and know Venezuelan and Brazilian food; this place got it right. I will be visiting often. The service and the ambiance of the Resturant along with the food is perfection."}
{"text":"Yardbird was all filled up, so we were directed to this restaurant, and I was pleasantly surprised!

The skirt steak was perfectly cooked to medium, tender and juicy, and had great flavor. It may have been a tad oily. Fries were seasoned well and not too spicy/hot

The rest of my party ordered the chica burger and fish tacos, and were fans of both.

Although the food was great, I am taking off a star because I felt that the service was at times impatient...we would have dishes out for not even 5-10 minutes, and still have food on them, yet we were constantly asked if we were done with the plates."}
{"text":"We LOVED this place! The sangria was the best I've ever had and I'm a sangria snob. We only ordered the chicken chicharrones and the octopus because we were full but can't wait to go back to try more of the menu because it looks awesome. We sat at the bar and the bartender was awesome! I would give 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"I had the best dining experience of my life! Starting with the friendly hostess and the wonderfully passionate server who explained the dishes to us, we were already in love. The. The food came out - wow. The calamari was the best we've ever had, it's the first time we've had calamari that melted in your mouth. We ate brunch, I had the steak and egg tacos and he had the chicken omelette. Delicious! She noticed my birthday was a few days prior on my ID and surprised us with a delicious piece of chocolate cake. Thank you, we'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"We dined here on December 9th and it was one of the best dining experiences we've had in Vegas, and we come several times a year. We always eat at the bar....we just like the vibe. Our bartender was Elizabeth and she was AMAZING!!! She guided us through the entire meal, from appetizers to dessert including our drinks. We had the pico three ways to start, the Halibut and the short rib for entrees, and we had her surprise us with dessert drinks. Everything was beyond delicious! I wish I would have taken pics! Thank you Elizabeth for making our evening so fun, and thank you Chica for the wonderful food! We had the best of both worlds! See you soon!"}
{"text":"Not sure if the night we went was simply a bad night but it wasn't a great experience. Had reservations for four. Restaurant was maybe half full. Got put at the worst table in the place at the back at the restaurant. Server talked up the lemon chicken dish extensively. We ordered it. She comes back 10 minutes later and tells us it's sold out and no longer available. The grilled octopus was tasty and interesting but the rest of our meal wasn't memorable. For the price tag, it wasn't what we hoped for. Not horrible, but not worth the money."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night in May for a bachelorette party dinner (group of 8) and it was great. We ended up getting a private room in the back, which worked out really well because we could control the music (volume) and lighting, and we didn't feel like we were yelling over the noise of the restaurant. Our server, Alyssa, was so sweet and helpful, and even gave us some recommendations for clubs to hit up that night. The food was tasty, and it worked well for our gluten free member of the group too. My one tiny complaint would be that they don't offer pitchers of margaritas, which we definitely would have taken advantage of. But otherwise everything was great! Would definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Service and food was excellent. I'm from NYC so I have pretty high standards when it comes to service and food. This place far exceeds my standards and expectations. The only thing I didn't like was the carrot mango mimosa (forgot the exact name). My friend however got the passion fruit mimosa which was way better. So I'm cutting off a star for my poor choice lol. Other than that I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We came to Chica for brunch and were not disappointed! After reading an interview with Lorena Garcia, we had to get a basket of arepas for an appetizer and it was 100% worth it! They were simple and a delicious way to start our meal. My husband got the Chipotle Chicken Omelet and I got the Rotisserie Chicken Sandwich, which came with some amazing fries! I also highly recommend the Sangria Manzana -- it tasted exactly like alcoholic apple juice! Also, Lorena was present in the restaurant which was appreciated!"}
{"text":"Best Huevos Rancheros I ever had. Came during CES week for breakfast and I wasn't sure what to expect. But it it didn't disappoint. The service from Edward was great and the food was excellent. Also had the corn lollipop and the were unbelievable."}
{"text":"This place is SOO BOMB.

My boyfriend and I stayed at the Venetian, hoping to grab a quick dinner and my boyfriend suggested this place for a first try.

I was at first a little hesitant because of the little reviews it had so far, but it's also because it was new.

Service: 
They are so nice, if Beatriz is working, ask for her!! We sat at the ceviche bar, and I asked Beatriz for cerviche makers name and she told me it was nubi? I'm not sure if I'm spelling it right.

Beatriz: super nice great vibe and definitely knows what she's doing and knows what is good

Nubi: he brings the vibe of the restaurant. He's constantly smiling always happy. He takes all his dishes very seriously and makes his presentation look great. He also gave us a dessert salad on the house which was phenomenal 

Chef: he walks around making sure everyone is enjoying their meals and making sure all the food is ok with everyone. He also has no problem with explaining what he does and what goes into the food. Definitely ask him if you have questions, he explains with passion as if you was next to him while he is making the dish in the kitchen.

What we had:

Octopus: perfectly cooked, very moist, perfectly seasoned

Rice: I don't remember the name but OMG IT IS SO BOMB. They give you the crispiness sides of the rice and that is my favorite when eating rice.

Guacamole: this is a big appetizer so I suggest you ordering this if you have 3 or more people, but the guac is perfectly textered. It tastes lovely with the banana chips that they freshly make, and I love the mesa doughs that he puts in with this appetizer. I tried the cheese one and the beet one with the Giap, even without the guac the mesa doughs are perfect.

Corn: the corn was ok, but I could have lived without this.

Classic ceviche: this was ok, the texture was good, but there wasn't enough flavor in this dish. 

Beef tenderloin: this is a definite, you need to get this, there was a perfect amount of flavor and the texture was perfect ( I like my steak medium rare).

The rotisserie chicken: perfectly seasoned, I usually like dark meat so I didn't really like it all around since the breast was a tad dry but that was only my taste in preference. 

The reason why I give a 5/5 is because the food pairing with the drinks and service that we got all around just made it perfect. Thank you for making this dinner so great.

I came on Saturday, July 22,2017 at 8/815 pm for dinner time."}
{"text":"Amazing. Try the guacamole and the butter lettuce shrimp salad.  Great vibe, even better food"}
{"text":"This is probably our new favorite spot to dinner dine in Vegas- (but don't worry Bouchon you are still breakfast and brunch). It's new- only opened in May and worth your stopping in for. 

As you well know, Food in Vegas is amazing these days and with Chica you have the yummiest Latin menu of them all- Not overwhelming choices, not retread Mexican but a really inspired combination taken from all over South America.. first time here be sure to get the roast chicken and the octopus appetizer. The steak with an artsy plate smear of mole could definitely use more mole/ but nothing the waiter couldn't happily fetch more of. The waitstaff here have always been friendly and passionate.

The design of Chica  is also lovely - and you know I am a stickler for details design wise.. the plates and dishes are very special and worth a note here.

Great for a big party too!"}
{"text":"I came here with a bachelorette party and it was our favorite meal of the entire trip! They didn't rush us through dinner and the ambiance was incredible. Our server also informed us that their chef is the first Latina chef on the Las Vegas Strip. Very cool! 

We got a couple bottles of wine for the table and a friend and I split the guacamole, asada negro arepas, pulled pork tacos and mac con queso (it's tapas style). Everything was delicious but I highly recommend the asada negro arepas!"}
{"text":"Everything about Chica is trendy and very Las Vegas. Over top decor, drinks, food and crowd! Service is good but not great. Amble staff that is attentive however at times service can be slow even though they aren't that busy. Expect to wait for drinks and food service, then enjoy both as it will definitely be worth the wait! Our favorite must do restaurant in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is the best food we have had in Vegas. Absolutely Amazing! We had the Charred Peruvian octopus which was fantastic. The Calamari was the best I've ever had. The mushroom quesadilla was really good. The Marquesa De chocolate desert was out of this world. Monica was the BEST waitress we have ever had. Thank You!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with a group. It was delicious! And service was great! The arrepas(not sure on spelling) were my favorite! They even had them flavored! The decor is absolutely beautiful in this restaurant."}
{"text":"More of a 3.5 star, but closer to 4 than to 3. 
We had the steak salad and the rotisserie chicken for main courses, but started with the ceviche and grilled octopus.
The grilled octopus was by far the best thing. That octopus was super tender and flavorful. It had a good spice and the chilis underneath were a little spicy, but not too much.
The ceviche was pretty good, I'd get it again but not the best I've ever had. Still had a good acidity, just lacked something I couldn't put my finger on. Overall a good dish and I can still recommend it.
On to the chicken... Really tender and had a really good sauce. I didn't like the potato salad-like thing that was with it, but if I had a bowl or rice.. forget it. But that might be the asian guy in me talking.
The steak salad was also pretty balanced. The steak was seasoned well and the salad dressing went well with the greens.
If you're in the area give it a shot, just don't forget the octopus, that's the winner."}
{"text":"Open your wallet my friends. Most of the entrees are finger foods.  We had four corns or as they call them \"lollipops.\" Four (4) corns was $53 -that's insane!!! Only mistake I made was not looking at the price before ordering  these 
4 corns. Our bill was $250 for 4 appetizer empanadas, 4 regular corns, bread basket they use to serve free when they opened,  1 order of French fries, 1 rotisserie chicken and 2 drinks (beer & pisco). I'm afraid to see what a bill is like if you actually order real food in this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place for dinner during our trip to Vegas. We made a reservation on a Thursday night but it was not necessary. The place was pretty empty when we arrived.

We started off with some cocktails - the Tamarind Guava Colada and a Bloody Mary. I absolutely loved the colada, a spin-off of a classic piña colada with guava nectar. My boyfriend's Bloody Mary was great too, spicier than normal which he enjoyed.

Reviews on Yelp all said to get the Grilled Corn Lollipops, which is what we did. I thought they'd be actually in the shape of lollipops - like corn fritters on a stick or something - but they were just grilled corn on the cob slathered with queso freso and spices. It was really good, but I guess I expected more for a $13 appetizer. Also, I've had something similar at a much cheaper place in NYC (Cafe Habana near SoHo) so this didn't particularly impress me.

We also got the Strip Steak and Steak & Kale Lime Chopped Salad. My boyfriend wasn't too impressed with the steak - he thought he got a bad cut because it was a little too fatty and not tender enough. I enjoyed the skirt steak on my salad though.

Overall, a good place to try if you pass by, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"We went to Chica for brunch and if I were to rate this placed solely based on the ambiance, decor, and service, I would have given it 5 stars but since I have to factor in the most important part of the dining experience; food, I had to rate it honestly. 

Maybe my expectations were too high since it was a restaurant in Vegas and the restaurant had  a 4.5 star rating on Yelp but the food was very mediocre. I ordered the Espresso Filled Churros and the Pancetta Eggs Benedict. The Espresso Filled Churros was especially disappointing. I was expecting really fresh, warm, Latin style churros but instead got really stale and hard churros that was just really nice to look at. It took a couple of bites for me to realize that there was an espresso filling, which was very difficult for me to distinguish as \"espresso cream\". It was very dry. I was so disappointed that I asked our waiter if it was supposed to be stale and he took it off the bill for us, which was very professional of him. The Pancetta Eggs Benedict was again a beautiful presentation but the taste just didn't fulfill my expectation. It was good; just not amazing. 

My favorite part of the place was the decor and their french press. Their dishes and silverware were also very cute. 

Perhaps Chica would be better for dinner and cocktails?"}
{"text":"Really cool looking place with some tasty (though high-priced) food and drinks.

This is the second time I've stopped in here, though this time we ordered enough to do a proper review. As usual, Jim G and I sat at the bar (best service, IMO) and started off with their Classic Ceviche (hamachi). It was super tasty and came with a few delicious, crispy plantain chips. I also enjoyed a modified version of the Some Like it Hot cocktail (mezcal only and no simple syrup): super good but, for a lush like me, far too weak.  On our bartender/server's recommendation, we tried the Grilled Octopus and the Pulled Pork Tacos; both were delicious, especially the octopus. Small portions, as you might expect, but big flavors. We chose a bottle of Albarino wine to go with it all and enjoyed our time at Chica."}
{"text":"The place is disgracefully overpriced. $20 including tip for an Old-fashioned, check. $12 for a tiny 6oz glass of granola with yogurt, check. $7 for an average cappuccino. Pushy waiters. Avoid! PS - the food was OK. Not great but not bad either. But definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! From the apps to the desserts! Just woow!! I definitely recommend everything on the menu.. you can't go wrong with any of it. But for dessert I definitely recommend the churro pop!! Paradise!"}
{"text":"Great place! Plates are large and the service is wonderful. I would love to come back. I would recommend the burger. Next time in town I'm am totally down."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was here! Guacamole is served with chips and these Venezuelan sweet cakes!! Omg so good and the pulled pork tacos were fabulous but order two bc they are small and you'll want more. Great service"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. The smells, the flavors, the tastes, just phenomenal ! Ready to take your taste buds to South America???!!?!
Made a reservation for a party of 6 Saturday night. Was greet and sat down Immediately and our waitress was monica. This was a first time at a fancy restaurant in Vegas and not some greasy quick fried food after the club! 
I had been looking at the menu the day before so I had an idea what I wanted to eat. 
Monica knew we were celebrating a birthday so she brought out some \"celebration cava\" Which is a special shot that the bartenders make. It had tequila and pineapple and some other ingredients that we were not supposed to know. Top secret. 

I love having family style dinners. So we ordered corn, Mac n cheese, two orders of the chicken , fish of the day (sword fish), Peruvian ceviche , and the pork. 
The corn had so much flavor. Evenly grilled to perfection. The cheese wasn't too overwhelming. 
Chicken fell right off. Super soft and not too salty. The chimichurri sauce was so addicting.   
The purple yam that came with the chicken was very refreshing. 
Mac n cheese was made with Peruvian corn. I totally didn't see that when I ordered it. Even though it was good, I do wish it was pasta. 
Sword fish was my favorite of all the dishes. The onions were well seasoned. 
Peruvian ceviche was refreshing as well and has lots of flavors. The chips just crunched so nicely. 
Pork is not my first choice of meat. The fat layer out side was roasted so well that it was crispy. The meat itself was soft and well marinated. The potatoes were indescribable. 
We also got a few watermelon margaritas. Fresh watermelon juice. Delicious. This is a must try!
Everything was so good we didn't even make it to dessert!!!!

Monica was so delightful. She had us laughing all night and was very pleasant to talk to! She is very educated in the food world ! She mentioned that they had just gotten a new Venezuelan cook and the menu will be changing slightly soon to showcase her passion for food. I love that she acknowledges other well known chefs in the area and made great recommendations!!! I wish I ran into her earlier on in my trip so I could eat more good food!!! Yard bird is my next stop next time I come to Vegas!!!! Also need to come back for brunch at chica! You seriously cannot go wrong with anything here !!!!!  

They offer mescal that's up to $350 a shot!!!! Crazy. 

I hope someone sees this review and let's monica know because she is absolutely amazing !!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal. 100/100. 
From the grilled corn lollipops to the short rib arepas. Pulled pork tacos. 
Everything was wonderful. Great music, Monica c. was our waitress and explained the whole menu and what she recommended. She was super friendly and constantly checking in on us. 
Wish we had this place back home, please open a restaurant in LA Chef Lorena! 
You cannot go wrong with the food here. Impressed."}
{"text":"My meal at Chica was all but perfect...until we got the check.  We came during Restaurant Week and added on an additional appetizer to truly taste everything Chica had to offer.  For our meals we had the empanadas and tacos to start, chicken and cuban sandwich for entree, and the donuts.  We also added an order of corn lollipops.

To begin, the empanada was very good.  The shell was cooked perfectly and the ground meat was heavy, but flavorful.  The tacos were one of the better upscale tacos I've had in the area.  Corn tortilla was starchy and hot and the insides were overflowing with pork and veggies.  The corn lollipopps were different than I'm used to.  These were more of a cheesy, lime flavor, while most I've had have steered towards heavy chili flakes.  But overall very tasty and a neat presentation with the corn husk, perfect for eating the \"lollipop.\"

As far as entrees, both were huge and easily could have filled up anybody, without the additional appetizers we chose to order.  The chicken was a basic rotisserie, but had some fresh chimichurri and purple potato salad to make it a meal.  I wouldn't necessarily order this dish myself, but it's nice for a basic, chicken lover.  The cuban came full of meat and had a harsh horseradish sauce that was perfect for the meal.  Bread was buttered and toasted perfectly to make a great dish.  Fries were good with a nice spicy seasoning, but nothing too overpowering.  The final desert course, the donuts, were phenomenal and a must order.  The donuts themselves are warm and topped with powdered sugar, but every sauce on the plate was worth a dip as well.

The downside of my meal came when I went to pay.  The waitress would not accept my \"free appetizer with purchase\" coupon that I received from the Grazie desk.  The only reason I ordered the extra appetizer was because of the coupon.  The waitress seemed well overwhelmed so called over the manager to discuss.  The manager eventually came out, angrily explaining the reason was because the Restaurant Week menu was a \"special\" and would not qualify as a purchase.  Instead of simply comping us for the misunderstanding, she all but yelled at us and would not take the appetizer off our check.  After explaining the situation for about 5 minutes, she finally caved, condescendingly saying \"sir\" about 30 times during our encounter and reiterating that Chica is owned separate from the Venetian/Palazzo and reserves the right to not accept coupons if they feel like it.  

I understand the policy, but what is the cost of an appetizer?  I wasn't trying to steal - it was a misunderstanding.  Management should always be on the customer's side, and her attitude was unacceptable, even up to the point where she reluctantly comped $10 worth of food.  She brought our experience from a great 5 to a \"we might not come back here,\" regardless of the quality of the food.

The food was great and the service was pretty solid.  Meal does take awhile, however, as our lunch was well over an hour.  My only complaint was the Manager.  But can't fault the chef for front of house rudeness."}
{"text":"Great small plates and awesome atmosphere.  Latin cuisine won't disappoint and the bar / drinks were awesome. Enjoyed this Vegas / Venetian find"}
{"text":"Everything I tried was good... congrats to Cheff Lorena Garcia for the excellent fusion of flavors and plates. I recommend the Brazilian steak with some Argentinian Malbec wine... for starters you can have the Peruvian Octopus and arepas basket."}
{"text":"If you guys are looking for a tasty and good selection of Latin American food, well this is the place. Everything that we ate was delicious and the service deserves a 10 out of 10. My favorite plates were the corn Mac and cheese, the avocado avocado appetizer and the mushroom side plate. I'm vegetarian but I can tell based on the rest of the people of my table table that the chicken, ceviche and octopus were also delicious."}
{"text":"Hands down this is one of the best Mexican fine dining restaurants on the Las Vegas strip.  My fiancé and I had the luxury of dining here on New Year's Eve l, and although busy, the menu was thoroughly explained, food and drinks were prompt and the staff's mannerisms were impeccable.  I recommend this place 5 fold over other Mexican fine dining, and if you love Mexican food  like I do, 10 FOLD!!!"}
{"text":"Don't go to this restaurant if you are hungry - unless you have a lot of money to spend. Our entrees were the size of appetizers, but with a very large price tag. I had the roast chicken - it was a good flavor, but not much meat. I think that chicken had been on a diet. My husband had the short rib. Uh, it couldn't have been more than 4oz of meat and there was no side dish included. Good thing he ordered a side of grits, even though the \"grits\" were more like puréed polenta. We won't be returning unless we win the lottery."}
{"text":"I ordered the MEYER LEMON ROTISSERIE CHICKEN - marinated in meyer lemon and slow roasted to perfection, with Peruvian purple potato salad and chimichurri - Half chicken $26. My husband ordered the YUCATÁN HALIBUT - Achiote marinated halibut, roasted in a banana leaf with pineapple, charred orange and sweet plantains, habanero pico $35.  For an appetizer we ordered the GRILLED CORN LOLLIPOPS
Sweet corn with chile piquin, lime, butter and cotija cheese $13. All three dishes tasted exactly how it is described on the menu. We had a great server and he remembered to give us separate checks. Also, he gave us a little dessert that was complimentary."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant that offers Latin American food. We got empanadas, tuna ceviche, shrimp and quinoa and porchetta. Everything was delicious and tasty! To finish of, tres leches cake was moist and light. I am looking forward to future meals there!"}
{"text":"This review is for their 2017 Las Vegas Restaurant Week menu that's been extended through July 7, 2017.

This restaurant serves Latin American fare that leaves me wanting more. Chica's three-course Restaurant Week menu is a value at $20 for lunch. 

First Course: Kale Salad - There's two ways to eat kale (1) in a smoothie and (2) the Chica way. The description of the kale salad is unimpressive, to tell you the truth. It seems like a regular 'ol kale salad with pumpkin seeds, dried cranberries, croutons, sour green apples, and Napa  What makes this dynamite is the salad's lime vinaigrette mixed in with all its ingredients. The portion is generous.

Second Course: Shrimp & Quinoa: I was just thinking if shrimp goes well with cheese. In this case with the shrimp and quinoa dish, yes, yes it does go well. The four or five shrimp and the corn poblano pico \"crown\" the quinoa and the cubes of Guayanés cheese. The entire dish is flavorful with an occasional spicy kick in every other bite. 

Third Course: Lemon Buñelos: Two donuts with soft centers. These was crispy, citrusy, and delightful. If you need to satisfy a sweet tooth, I would pass on this. It's too bad that there's only one dessert option on the Restaurant Week menu; I would liked to have seen another option.

Overall: The food is solid, and the cuisine is worth the try if you're searching for something to eat in the area that isn't the traditional Italian and steakhouse offerings."}
{"text":"I have banana allergies and couldn't have the halibut on the menu. They so kindly did an alternate dish. I was so good, I wanted another. And the little roll type beet ones (cane with the guac) were so tasty and different. I'm trying to go tomorrow for breakfast. It was delish. Oh and the water melon margaritas were awesome. I don't even like watermelon!"}
{"text":"Omg my favorite place to have breakfast in Vegas so far, everything they have is very tasty."}
{"text":"Chica is a great new edition to the Venetian/Palazzo.  The décor screams new, fresh, and modern.  The food fits the vibe perfectly. From the vibrant Classic Ceviche to the super tender Grilled Octopus, both are fresh and flavorful.

We also enjoyed a couple cocktails at the bar during happy hour. Its is Vegas so the prices are a bit high for what you get, that is why I would recommend happy hour so you could still enjoy some great food while saving a bit of cash."}
{"text":"Very good food!  Had a little bit of a few things on the menu and enjoyed it all.  Drinks were good too.  Prices are what you would expect them to be for a restaurant in the Venetian"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing, our server Juliana recommended the Meyer lemon chicken and the lamb, both excellent choices.   The Marquesa de Chocolate was a perfect finish to a delicious meal. Great experience and excellent service."}
{"text":"Horrible food. I'm ok with paying at the high end for good food but I had a small Peruvian ceviche that was nothing special, 3 salty pulled pork tacos, a mediocre guacamole and a beer, all for $68. I had to give 20% for tip since servers were good and hence the 1 star. But other than than, I suggest don't waste your time and Vegas money at this joint."}
{"text":"e were a party of 4 and reached here around 1.45pm today. Yardbird had a 30-40 mins wait so we ended up here instead.

The restaurant was open about 3 months ago and I have read good things about it.

The decor is cool and had a great atmosphere.  The Latin music transported me back to my PVR vacation. 

Our friend dig the chairs, they were very comfortable.

We ordered-

Grilled Peruvian Octopus
Crispy Calamari Fuego
Empanadas
Classic Cerviche
Steak and Egg Tacos×2

The portions are small but the balance of textures and rich flavors of the cuisine was very impressive. Every component of the dish from the fresh Cerviche to Grilled Peruvian Octopus was delicious and satisfying without being too salty or oily.

I also tried the Cornncake Flan for dessert, which was a tasty and a unique treat.

I had Passion Fruit Mimosa which was delicious and I could tell it was real. My bf had the Sangria Zarzamora and this drink is thoughtful, creative, well-balanced and supremely satisfying. 

Service was on par. They always made sure the glass of water is full.

Overall a really excellent meal and experience! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful, service was exceptional!  Eric and Joy at the bar were fabulous, we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Came here this weekend for a date night with my boyfriend and it was delicious! 

We started with the classic ceviche and the pulled pork tacos- both of which were exceptional! The ceviche was light and refreshing and was the perfect shareable portion for the two of us. The pork tacos came in a set of 3 and were topped with salsa and a house made slaw which was delicious! 

As an entree, we shared the braised short rib and oh my g was it mouthwateringly amazing! Served with epazote oil and pickled onions, the beef just perfectly tender and could almost melt in your mouth. It had the most perfect savory flavor and the pickled onions were a great touch. My only complaint would be that it had a lot of fat- especially for being such a small portion.

As for cocktails, I ordered the Sangria Zarzamora and my boyfriend had the Pepino Sandia. I'd say my sangria tasted a bit watered down and didn't have the best flavor. The Pepino Sandio was their take on a gin tonic and was pretty strong but the taste of cucumber still gave it a light refreshing taste. 

Service was eh- we were seated at our table, had our appetizer, entree, and drinks selected and were sitting there for about 7 ish minutes before a server came by."}
{"text":"Okay, my last dinner in Vegas was absolutely the best!  Made early dinner reservations as we heard this was a new restaurant at The Venetian.  Arrived early and were promptly seated.  I debated back and forth between the steak and the short rib as I wanted to get \"my meat on\".  I settled on the braised short rib with black eyed peas (two ways) and a side of Peruvian mac n cheese (which is actually corn).  Wow. Amazing, amazing, amazing!!  The short rib was moist and tender enough to peel away with a fork.  The caramelization of the sugars as it was braised was flavorful and sealed in the moisture. The pairing with the peas and corn was dead on the spot!  After finishing our meal, we complimented the waiter on the food who then brought out the chef to accept our compliments!  Great atmosphere, great staff and great food.  Can't wait to be back!  Give it a try, you will not be disappointed.

Tips:  -This place just opened, but probably will be booking fast-so make reservations.
          -Bar is very nice and inviting.
          -The kale salad is great and will feed four people!
          - Go for the short rib!"}
{"text":"We celebrated a birthday here. The staff were polite and attentive. The setting was beautiful and the restaurant is stunning. 

The food however was very mediocre and lack luster. We ordered a wide variety from the menu and the only thing that stood out to me was the side order of plantains."}
{"text":"Worst place i have ever been in my life. I came here for lunch on my birthday. I had a stomach virus the night before and was throwing up, couldnt eat. So i was STARVING when i got to this place.  We got the guac appetizer and we specifically asked the waitress if it was going to be enough guac for us 3 girls, she said yes plenty of guac. When we got it, it was so tiny and definitely not enough guac. It was also $15. There was probably half of an avocado of guac in the bowl. Crazy ridiculously expensive and it wasnt even good!!! It didnt taste fresh. It was DEFINITELY pre-made! 

Then i asked the older blonde waitress lady if i should get the shrimp salad or the shrimp tacos, and told her that i was starving. She said the shrimp tacos are more hearty and filling. So i got them. (i dont eat meat or chicken so the shrimp dishes were my only option on the lunch menu)

there were 2 tacos and they were SOOOOOO FREAKING TINY!!!!! Holy shit 
i thought she was joking when she brought it out. It didnt even have any sides that came with it. The diameter of the opened taco was 3 inches. With 3 little tiny baby shrimps in it. Thats it. I asked them to put the slaw on the side that came on the tacos and the habanero sauce on the side, this came with no sides. I finished eating within 90 seconds of receiving my meal. I left starving and hungrier than when i got there!!!! The tacos were $20 btw. So expensive for NOTHING!!!! 

The restaurant was empty the entire time we were there. So overpriced and ridiculously small portions, i would never go back even if they paid me or fed me for free. Ill never forget how disappointed i was"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch during a trade show and was pleasantly surprised. 

Decor: unique and interesting. Detailed without over stimulating my senses.  Bathrooms had fun faucets. Seating was comfortable and not too loud despite a few hundred people in the place. 

Food: shared pork tacos, ceviche, and empanadas. The ceviche had lots of lime, seasoned well, and had nice chunks of fish and corn. Tasty. Only complaint was the plantains tasted like they were fried the previous week. Fresh fried chips or plantains would have made this a knockout starter. Empanadas were really well seasoned and had a great pastry. Tacos were the superstar. The pork was truly perfect. Everything sang delicious!  Small side of beans were fresh and tasty. 

Service was on point and pleasant despite the place being busy."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and fantastic food! We ordered the guacamole, Cuban sandwich and the shrimp salad. All very well prepared and delicious. It was my favorite meal in Las Vegas! We will be going back tomorrow to try their brunch!"}
{"text":"Our party of 6 came during restaurant week to test out Chef Lorena Garcia's cuisine.

Mrs. Q and I shared the following items:
Empanadas, Ceviche, Red Shrimp Cazuela,  Asado Negro Shortrib, Tres Leches, and Marquesa Chocolate.

Ceviche was good, but skimpy...Empanadas were okay(cheaper, more delicious ones can be found at Pollo Campero and Makers and Finders) The shrimp was borderline rubbery and quinoa was salty, the star of our table was the Shortrib, the desserts were pretty tiny, the crema ice cream did not show up on the Marquesa Chocolate plate as advertised, and to top it all off, we pretty much got rushed to leave because they seemed to be more concerned about turning tables.

The company was most definitely 5 stars, but the misses outweighed the hits. The price point definitely doesn't match the quality of food, but that's almost always the case when you have a celebrity chef attached to the restaurant, and  it's on the strip. ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Try anything here.  They make it to perfection, with an understated attitude.  The cuisine is an amalgamation of Latin American (partly Cuban, partly Mexican, partly even South American).  It's a bit loud at night (not sure about the daytime), but you can find a cozy corner to have a decent conversation.  Service is very attentive.  I got a kick out of the avocado green mid-century modern chairs.

If you get the empanadas basket, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Came for lunch the other day and food and service were great....today...totally opposite.  Server was slow, seemed like she was irritated.  Food took forever even though we told her we only had an hour.   Experience was awful."}
{"text":"There's nothing not to love about this place! The ambience was typical awesome-Vegas. I immediately wanted a cocktail from their yummy menu.  The service was accommodating (especially to my picky palette:) and nothing was a problem.  A great place to share appetizers with a group of girls, co-workers or whomever you're in town with.  Thank you for a wonderful start to our night, Chica."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I went in for brunch with a couple of my friends and we absolutely enjoyed the atmosphere and service. My favorite was dessert! We had the churro with vanilla ice cream! I would definitely go back to this place next time I'm there."}
{"text":"Hola, Chica! ¿Qué tal?

John Kunkel's 50 Eggs, Inc. has done it again at the Venetian Resort Las Vegas!  Last May, when we dined at Yardbird Southern Table & Bar, we fortuitously met up with one of 50 Eggs, Inc. General Managers (Randy) who showed us Chica's space as it was soon to open (late May 2017).  The restaurant space looked inviting and warm.  I was excited by Randy's description of Chica's Latin culinary focus who would be helmed by celebrated Latin Chef Lorena Garcia.  

I recently planned a weeklong birthday celebration for my husband at Las Vegas, NV and chose Chica to be the first restaurant on our culinary slate.  We wanted to try their lunch menu first before being joined by good friends to do their dinner.  Both times, we made reservations as there were several conventions in town and we knew by Chica's Yelp rating that this restaurant was certainly popular.

Our lunch server, José M, was simply awesome!  This guy exuded professionalism, warmth, humor and attentiveness.  Being that this was our first dine at Chica, we had several questions about the menu.   José's menu descriptions enlightened us about what is Latin cuisine as  many people only associate Latin cuisine with Mexican cuisine.  Latin America refers to territories and countries in the Americas where Spanish or Portuguese languages prevail such as Mexico, most of Central and South America, and in the Caribbean, Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico.  His descriptions of the menu items were so mouthwatering that I wished for our friends to hurry and join us for dinner so we could try more items.  

FOOD:

-Grilled Peruvian Octopus:  grilled octopus served with aji amarillo sauce, blistered Shishito peppers, crispy quinoa, spicy guasacaca pico.  As we walked into The Venetian Resort, we noticed a huge poster of this appetizer.  How could we resist from ordering such a \"Vision of Beauty\"?  The octopus tentacles were grilled and seasoned to perfection.  It's tender bite was nicely complemented with the spicy and pleasing blistered shishito peppers and spicy aji amarillo sauce.

-Empanadas:  3 house made pastry dough half-moons were generously filled with braised ground beef, sweet plantains and black beans.  They were finshed with queso fresco and spicy guasacaca pico.  The pastry was light and flaky, unlike other empanada pastry which often tends to be mealy or crumbly.  These empanadas were good sized at least 3.5\"-4\".  Very tasty and filling.

-Hoppin' José Rice:   Our server described this side dish as fried Jasmine rice mixed with black eyed peas or beans and topped with avocado guacamole and cilantro.  He had us at fried rice!  Of course, we ordered this side to pair with our entrée.

-Meyer Lemon Rotisserie Chicken:  slow rotisserie roasted Meyer lemon marinated chicken lightly slathered with chimichurri served with Peruvian purple potato salad.  We ordered a 1/2 chicken which was plump and cut into 4 manageable and generous sized  pieces. The chicken had nice crisped skin, juicy and flavorful meat.  The chimichurri complemented and added a fresh dimension.  Also served with this entrée was Peruvian purple potato salad...this cold potato salad was tasty without being overly sauced. It was pretty to look at and by the way, the Peruvian purple potato is not a sweet one like the Okinawan variety.

DESSERT:

-Churro Pops:  3 caramel ice cream (dulce de leche) pops coated in fried cinnamon churro crumbs were served with 3 quenelles of vanilla bean Anglaise.  OMG!  These pops and quenelles were absolutely delicious, silky and \"sinfully\" delicious.  If I didn't have lactose intolerance, I could've eaten the entire dessert myself BUT I did show restraint!  

José and the rest of Chica's staff certainly made our lunch very memorable and we DID return for dinner a few days later."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a beautiful a atmosphere of a mixture of Latin cultures. The decoration and service is excellent. Wonderful music selection. We went during brunch. I'd recommend the corn Lollipops as an appetizer. Any of the brunch sandwiches such as the Cuban and finish with the churro Lollipops."}
{"text":"I came on Thursday for a birthday party. Too bad for us it was Christmas  employee party. Servers, cook pretty much everyone else was more attending the employee party than offering a customer service.
The food was good, that's why one star was given. 
But as a suggestion, please close the restaurant if you have your employees busy with their own party.
No wine selection at all, good wine list but there's nothing in stock, no recommendations from the server.
Super disappointed because of the server's attitude and for paying half attention for full price."}
{"text":"The food was amazing...the staff and service is on point! Francesca was kind and informative, along with everyone involved. Thankyou!"}
{"text":"Probably would have given the restaurant four stars, but for our party of ten, we were charged an additional 5% admin fee.  I understand the minimum pre-tax spend of $65 or the mandatory gratuity charge, but an admin fee?  For simply reserving our reservation and being a large party?  We didn't have any other special requests, and so I don't see how this charge was warranted...

The food was good, and we had a great time. (Service was a tad bit slow.  We were on our way to see Britney and felt very rushed at the end, especially because we didn't hit the $65 limit, and needed to order desserts at the end).

Would highly recommend: pulled pork tacos, grilled corn lollipops, chicken chicharrones, braised short rib, and steak & kale salad."}
{"text":"We planned a trip to Vegas over Memorial Day weekend and decided to make a reservation at Chica for dinner one of the nights. The entire experience was nothing short from perfect.

From the moment we got there the hostess was warm and welcoming and sat us by the rotisserie area where we could see the chefs handling the delicious chicken they serve. We all ordered something different to try and my personal favorite was the \"Mac con Queso\" and the arepas. 

The restaurant is beautifully decorated, mixing traditional Latin styles with contemporary art. This is an excellent place to go for a delicious dinner- highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome Octopus and Strip Stake...the Rice side order was unbelievable...will be back on my next trip."}
{"text":"Oh this place is super cute! Love the style. It is located at the corner between Venetian and Palazzo (So location is perfect). The menu was very nice lots of delicious options that make it hard to chose just a few. They paid a lot of attention to detail here. Very much so in the decor and ambiance and the dishes that were used to serve the entrees were very rustic chic and cute. Loved that the guacamole tasted fresh to order and tasted like homemade. I can't complain here because that is a treat in itself but do wish there was 1 additional magic touch maybe a hint of heat or a slight delicious twist. We ordered the rotisseries chicken that came with purple potatoes, the fish tacos, a side of the beans and rice, the guacamole, and the fried plantains. The best thing was the fried plantains. They were perfectly sweet and delicious. The rice that was served with the side of beans and rice was jasmine you could definitely taste the flavor there, texture was good, bland but I enjoy that here and there, maybe not everyone's favorite thing when eating out however. I usually don't like battered things but the fish tacos really were good. It wasn't that they were lightly battered it was that the tacos were well seasoned and it was very delicious. Service was great and can't wait to come back to try the drinks next time as it seemed to have a lot of fresh items I'm hoping they'd have a great cocktail menu with fresh twists on them but didn't get around to checking the cocktail menu this time around."}
{"text":"Chica. (4 stars).

\"Chica: girl.\" - Google

Truth is, I had no burning desire or expectations of trying any more Peruvian food after I recently had another dismal meal at Limon Rotisserie in Hawaii.

My friend had asked us if we wanted to try Chica & after hearing \"they have lamb\", I immediately said YES!

My friend then made a reservation for dinner after she & her other half tried Chica for lunch.

Since we had a lot of different items, I'll review one I would pass on & 2 of my favorites:

Pepita Crusted Lamb - $45. (3.5 stars).

\"Colorado lamb, herb pumpkin seed crust, mole verde, crispy squash blossoms, & grilled calabaza.\"

Having no idea what half of this stuff was, I just blindly agreed to try this dish.

After all, this is the dish that brought my friend & her hubby back for another meal!!

I absolutely adore lamb, but the BF is indifferent to it, so when I find people who are willing to try new dishes with me, I'm ALL IN!!

The lamb itself was prepared beautifully.

Medium-Rare please!

Perhaps I'm just not used to Pepita (pumpkin seeds) being used as a crust or the mole verde which is made primarily from pumpkin seeds & green chiles.

The mole verde wasn't bad, it was creamy, but didn't have much a flavor profile I could discern. Aside from adding moisture to the lamb, I felt the mole got lost.

I think I watch too much Food Network. When I saw fried squash blossoms I was thinking of the bright orange-red flower that gets fried in tempura batter. I didn't see that anywhere on our plate??

I didn't even try the grilled calabaza (West Indian pumpkin) because I didn't know where it was on the plate??

This dish really celebrated the PUMPKIN in my humble opinion. NOT THE LAMB. If I had known what all these fancy items were before I tried the lamb, I quite possibly could have been prepared myself for a less dramatic crescendo.

I was secretly hoping for chimichurri sauce... *Sad Face*

Definitely a lesson learned for me, if I don't know the ingredients, GOOGLE before trying.

Nothing against my friends or Chica, I just enjoy big bold flavors & chimichurri sauce!!

Porchetta with Crispy Yuca Hash - $36. (4.5 stars).

\"Suckling roast pig, crispy brussel sprouts, fried yuca, pearl onions escabeche, & pork jus.\"

I honestly thought this was going to be my favorite dish of the evening... but there's actually a tie?!

I love pork so much I swear I OINK every time I speak!!

I watched the spit rotate for a while with these giant porchetta roasting over an open flame. What a glorious moment it was!!

The porchetta was roasted perfectly & was served piping hot & crispy!!

Cutting into the porchetta was so satisfying. The meat was so tender on the inside & crispy on the outside.

That crispy pork skin was excellent!!

The brussel sprouts absorbed all of the rich pork jus & which added a nice flavor to my favorite vegetable! It was almost as good as having brussel sprouts with bacon!!

I can still imagine licking the fatty porky juices off of my lips... Mmmm. Good!

Meyer Lemon Rotisserie Chicken - $26 (Half Order: 4 pcs). (4 stars).

\"Famous Rotisserie Chicken, marinated in Meyer Lemon & slow roasted to perfection, with Peruvian purple potato salad, & chimichurri.\"

Now on to the biggest surprise of the evening.

For those who know me, I really enjoy CRISPY fried chicken.

Having just tried Yardbird (next door, same owners) & being quite disappointed in my non-crispy chicken, I wasn't really expecting to enjoy a roasted bird.

Boy was I mistaken!!

This chicken was roasted on an open flame!

The skin wasn't terribly CRISPY so I had a little bit of a challenge eating the chicken on its own. I guess it's the same texture that makes me remove the skin from my cold ginger chicken... I'm not a huge fan of flaccid skin.

The Meyer Lemon flavor is evident & gives a brightness to this dish.

The CHIMICHURRI SAUCE at Chica was phenomenal!! This sauce could be put on a fast food burger & I would eat it!! 

Note: I LOATHE FAST FOOD SO THAT IS SAYING A LOT!!

What makes the chimichurri sauce my star of the evening is the robust & intense garlic, olive oil, & parsley flavors. I thought I noted some cilantro in this sauce but I could be wrong.

OMG, some of my favorite items in the world... all in one bright green sauce.

After slathering a dollop of chimichurri onto my plate, I silently cursed myself for telling my friend to order \"just a half\".

---

While our server was extremely personable & friendly, I have to say the wait staff was a different story.

We had a few plates that were sitting for a while with a brussel sprouts here, a yuca hash there. Without even asking us, the busboy just swept up our dishes & took it to the kitchen.

I thought it was a bit weird since I was going to eat that brussel sprout!!!!

None of the busboys asked us anything before clearing the rest of our table.

That's fine, I'll just have to remember to shoo them away the next time!!

I'll be back Chica!!"}
{"text":"This is the best food I had in Vegas. So tasty, amazing service, portions, everything! Great to go for food and drinks with a group of friends before hitting the dance floor. 10/10 recommended and will go back when Im in town!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick dinner, sat at a bar table

What I ate:
- Chicken chicharrones: These were super tasty, very flavorful with an amazing sauce, but these were way larger than I thought they would be. My date and I could hardly finish this. Also this is not really date friendly as it's meat on the bone. I just went for it and used my hands while eating this
- Pulled pork tacos: These tacos were amazing - flavorful, well balanced, perfectly cooked pork. There were three tacos. Good to share or just have as your main
- Chicken watercress caesar salad: After having so many rich meals on strip, I think my body was craving salad. This salad was okay. The chicken that came out with it was really dry and overly charred, so we ended up leaving the chicken on the side and not eating it at all
- Mushroom quesadillas: This dish was not great. I actually had to complain. The quesadillas were really charred, almost burnt. It made the blue cheese super strong in flavor. All you could taste was burnt flavors and blue cheese. There was nothing to cut those flavors, so it was not palatable. 
- Happy pill cocktail was refreshing and easy to drink

Pros:
- Really beautiful restaurant. The inside was wonderfully done. 
- Plenty of large and small tables
- Bar had a HUGE screen TV that was playing the basketball playoffs - mainly what drew us to eat there in the first place
- Service was friendly. When I complained about the mushroom quesadillas the server didn't make it a big deal, told me it was easy to take off our bill, and then the house manager came by to apologize
- A few private closed off rooms you could reserve. It was nice to see some rooms of different sizes that could accommodate different sized parties from small parties to really big
- I liked that they had a bathroom inside the restaurant. I hate when I'm at a hotel restaurant and have to exit the restaurant just to use the bathroom. 

Cons:
- Since we didn't have a reservation, we couldn't grab a table. This seemed super confusing to me since there were so many open tables when I went to the bathroom. Maybe they were understaffed that night in terms of servers and left part of the dining room closed? Not sure since I saw plenty of server just milling around chatting amongst themselves. Or is this part of the restaurant's allure, to try to make it SEEM exclusive? No biggie since ultimately my date wanted to be able to see the TV and watch the game
- Food was really hit or miss. I liked the pork tacos, but I really wouldn't write home about anything else I ate that night

Would I come again? Probably not"}
{"text":"Friendly service, great hand shaken guava pina colada. So many good options to choose from but myself and friends ended up with a huevos rancheros, steak & tacos, yogurt parfait, and Cuban sandwich-everyone was satisfied with their food. Also got espresso churros to share...totally worth it!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. We had guacamole which comes with chips and plantains. I had the steak and kale but I don't eat red meat so substituted steak for chicken. They will accommodate just about any ask, they even asked about food allergies when entering. My friend had steak and eggs. It was expensive but not ridiculous. This was my favorite meal while in Vegas. Staff was helpful, kept water filled, helped with menu selections, etc. I think bill was around $60 before tip."}
{"text":"This restaurant is found in the Venetian.  We saw a delicious picture of their octopus dish in the hallway and wanted to try it.  The Octopus was wonderful. It was not overcooked. The seasoning perfect.  The ceviche was slightly bland. It was missing a little something.  Maybe needed a little more acid.  Their special fish was supposed to be Halibut but they were all out. Instead they were serving swordfish.  I thought I would take a stab and ordered it though I usually don't because this is a difficult fish to cook and easily overcooked.  They had done an excellent job with the octopus and the sword fish was superb. It was delicate, moist and delicious.  The seasoning was well balanced and the portion was adequate.  This restaurant was definitely a great find. 
The cocktails were also delicious. We ordered the flor pina and the chica Rita.
The server was excellent, incredible.  She took real pride in serving us and had a wonder touch. 
We were seated near the bar on the restaurant side. It was a bit loud."}
{"text":"My drink & small dishes were ok but the steak was pretty bad. Ordered medium and it was tough and overcooked. Two small dishes (BTW the guacamole is not small), 1 drink and the steak was $87 without tip. When in Vegas I guess. This reviewer would have preferred Delmonico's."}
{"text":"Very flavorful. Wife and I ordered a variety of small stuff to share.  Shrimp with quinoa. Lentils. and some gueryera cheese was my favorite, gourmet and something that a chef whipped up. Guacamole excellent don't mind paying $16 with chips and plantains because it was worth it. Arepas were great, I would skip next time. Go to viva arepas on the strip, and u will know why I'm picky.  Octopus was incredible, the shishuto peppers went with with the other food. The Mac and queso was so unique my taste buds were screaming flavor. The Sangria was perfect. Some prices seemed a little steep, but you are in Vegas and the top notch service from our waiter made it worth it. I will return."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this dining experience. Very unique from the usual hotel restaurants. The server was super sweet and it was a nice ambience even for Christmas day. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Food looked amazing, server was excellent, great decor/ ambiance, and everything came out in a timely manner... You're probably wondering then why the 2 star review? Well the food \"looked amazing\" but taste or lack there of just didn't live up to the hype. They had a restaurant week 20 dollar tasting menu of an app, entree, and dessert. Pretty good deal so we both got that and got different items so we could share/try more items as it was our first time here. We got the chica fries 3.75 stars, classic ceviche 1.5 stars, shrimp w/quinoa 1.5 stars, rotisserie chicken 2.5, and lemon bunuelos 4.25 stars. Fries were pretty good , Ceviche was completely bland, it was like eating a soupy milk without any flavor at all. The shrimp was completely over seasoned, so much so that when my gf asked what I thought of the shrimp I said its ok and her immediate response was, \"you don't think its way too salty?.\" It was over powering and my gf likes salty stuff so for her to say that its too salty means its way over seasoned. The chicken was over cooked and dry. The skin was really good along with the wing and thigh piece but the breast was really dry and we didn't even finish it. I feel like if it was pulled a few minutes earlier it was close to being really really good. Im not a big dessert person but the highlight of the meal was the bunuelos. They weren't anything fancy just little lemony donut balls with black berry sauce but they were made perfectly and delicious.

Overall I would give 2.25 stars on Chica. 

Ive been to Canonita (just upstairs also in the Venetian) a few times and would have to say its much better when you're craving latin/spanish food inside Venetian/palazzo.Its unfortunate because my gf who's Venezuelan has been excited to go to chica because of the chef Lorena Garcia and the really good yelp reviews so far but it just didn't live up to the hype at all."}
{"text":"Went to Chica on a whim one night.  As far as whims go, I couldn't have asked for anything better.

Started with the Arepas:  a basket of 10 bite-sized arepas, served with nata butter.  They're broken down into 5 flavors, each flavor being represented twice:  plain, pistachio, beet, cheese, and black bean.  While all of them were good, the best were the pistachio and the cheese.

The Red Flint Grits followed.  I honestly wasn't too excited to try it, thinking it would taste like any old bowl of grits I'd had before.  One taste of this dish changed my mind.  Ultra creamy, sweet, and flooded with Parmesan cheese.  These were truly incredible.  If I had to recommend one dish from my entire meal, it would be these grits.  They're only $8, just get the grits and rationalize it by pretending you lost a single hand of blackjack.

My main course was the Porchetta with Crispy Yuca Hash.  Tender, salty, savory meat under a pile of yuca and brussels sprouts.  The brussels sprouts were dark and crispy as they should be.  The yuca provided a heavier, salty starch... crunchy and delicious.  Similar to potatoes but lighter.

Chica pays attention to the small details of their dishes. For example, they could have kept it simple, and served my arepas with a regular, salted butter.  But they pay attention to the details, and upgrade you to a nata butter.  All of these sorts of small details add up to a huge impact that bumps a restaurant up from 4-stars to 5-stars."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! The Brazilian steak was awesome. Brandon did an excellent job as our server."}
{"text":"I'm loving this new-ish addition to our dining options on the Strip. As annoying as all of the rigmarole that comes with casino dining can be (parking, walking for miles, finding the place, etc.), Chica made me forget that whole part almost instantly.

Stopped by close to closing time for dinner, and service didn't skip a beat. Beatriz was our lovely server who gave great suggestions and answered all of our menu questions in great detail with a genuine smile.

I got the Tamarind Guava Colada for starters. The most beautifully refreshing cocktail I've had in a while. Corn Lollipops came next; pretty basic elote style corn on the cob with braided husks for decoration, but no complaints. While my date's lamb looked stunning, my NY Strip was a righteously perfect medium well. BUT, the surprise show stealer was the mini quesadilla accoutrement next to Mr. Steak. Mushroom & some sort of melty bleu cheese flavor made it the best part. Also, who doesn't like legit molé instead of A-1?

An unexpected dessert platter appeared to cap off our first visit, reading 'Welcome'. Decadently rich chocolate & churro ice cream madness. Not only is this restaurant beautifully decorated (not to mention a danceably saucy latin soundtrack), but it's obvious that the staff takes pride in what they offer."}
{"text":"It was a nice atmosphere, our service was fine, but as far as Latin cuisine was concerned, it was lacking. Nothing outstanding, nothing terrible, just meh. We ordered a lot, but out of all of our selections, there wasn't one dish that made us want to come back again."}
{"text":"GET THE BRAISED SHORT RIBS. This is a magically delicious dish that's basically melt in your mouth heaven.

If you really want to WOW a group like a client dinner or intimate team gathering, the private dining experience is simply phenomenal! You are able to select from their top dishes to create a custom menu for your guests. Everyone in my group loves the chips and guacamole, ceviche, Mac con queso, short ribs, and the chef's choice of desserts... these perfect beignet/donut balls and a decadent chocolate tiramisu with some berry sauce. You couldn't have asked for a better ending to this meal.

What's really top-notch about Chica is their service from beginning to end. I am referring to their management in working with me on the dinner reservation - prompt and attentive in booking - to accommodating when I needed to adjust the pricing and guest count last minute. The dinner service delivery was also on point - engaging and hilarious with every interaction with my team.

I really couldn't have asked for a better dining experience here.

Also, apologies for the lack of photos but when you're eating a large hungry sales team... camera didn't have time to eat or else there would be no food left!! Survival of the fittest..."}
{"text":"Underwhelming, mediocre food, we ordered 3 appetizers & two alcoholic beverages our check was $95.26. Wayyyy over priced, tacky ambience. They should stick to a simple, traditional concept I felt they were doing too much with the dj and strobe lights. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"Though the ambiance and decor of this restaurant were pretty inviting, I wasn't overly impressed with the whole experience. The food was pretty good and certainly plated in an appealing fashion. But it didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped. Also, there wasn't a whole lot of intriguing vegetarian options, which usually Latin American restaurants can pull off without a lot of effort. But certainly the biggest reason for my 2 star review, was the over attentive wait-staff. I felt as though I spent more time being checked in on by our waiter than actually conversing with my dinner partner. This was very off-putting and distracting. Also, it made me feel rushed through the visit. Of course when we were finished and ready to pay, the waiter was nowhere to be found. There are just plenty better options to be had in the area, I think."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal, actually ate here twice during my stay in Vegas. Must have the guac, pork tacos, and empanadas. Otherwise the slow-braised short rib is divine."}
{"text":"Received a little packet of coupons on the plane, to be activated at the Grazie desk in the Venetian Hotel. Took a little time, but got the vouchers for free appetizers at Chica.
It was a little worrisome when the hostess at the door acted like she didn't know what it was. She took off to \"go find out.\"  Well, some appetizers were not included. And I was required to  spend $10 to be able to use the voucher. Ok, so I ordered a glass of wine and the empanadas. Perfect lunch - about $15 total with my voucher plus $5 tip for my waiter."}
{"text":"So far, one our better meals in vegas.  Had brunch and enjoyed every part of it.  Definitely will make this a regular stop when coming to vegas.  Authentic flavors, neat decor and great service and excellent food."}
{"text":"Hands down a must visit in Vegas inside the Venetian...want something different try Chica! Delicious Peruvian octopus, short rib arepas, and roasted pork with Yucca hash and crispy Brussel sprouts...everything is to die for whether you love South American food or not. My Colombian mama would love this place IT'S SOOOOO GOOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced.  Food was terrible.  Very small portions.  Good service was the only positive.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Review is for Restaurant Week 2017 menu

Chica takes the spot of the former DB Brasserie in the Venetian.  I went for Restaurant Week dinner and I chose (with menu descriptions):

Empanadas Pabellon - Crispy arepa masa stuffed with braised ground beef, sweet plantains, black beans, queso fresco and spicy guasacaca pico
Porchetta with crispy yucca hash - Slow roasted suckling pig, crispy brussels sprouts, fried yucca, pearl onion escabeche, pork jus
Tres leches dulce de leche - Traditional \"Three milks\" cake topped with toasted meringue, with exotic fruit pico

The empanadas were the let down of the meal.  You can see from the photo that the one was especially crisp and the bottom of that one was blacker in one spot.  Someone needs to watch the grill more carefully.  The empanadas were OK but they need more moisture.  The porchetta was flavored well and was juicy.  It had a crisp exterior.  The pork jus made the porchetta even more juicy.

The tres leches cake was the real winner of the night.  Excellent cake-moist throughout from the three milks.

Service was good but sometimes it was too good.  There was a busser who kept walking back and forth and took dirty plates almost as soon as you put down your silverware.  The table next to me had to ask for another share plate because he took the one she was using for shrimp tails she cleaned off her shrimp.

This is an OK place."}
{"text":"Chica is an amazing Restaurant!  We had the corn lollipops, grilled street corn and instead of mayonnaise she uses a chili lime crema. Absolutely delicious.  We also had the Red Argentina Shrimp with Quinoa and they were cooked to perfection. Great experience not to mention the trio of sauces served with plantains and tortilla chips.  I highly recommend this restaurant so if you go to Las Vegas this is must on your lists of things to do."}
{"text":"We didn't want a very heavy dinner so we opted for 3 small plates. All delicious! Chicken chicarrones, empanadas de pabellon and guacamole with arenas. We got really excited to go here because it was Latin food especially Venezuelan. The empanadas were perfect with pabellon, the classic Venezuelan dish. And my hubby loooooved the chicken. I got and Old Thomas en Venezuela or something like that, a cocktail made with Diplomatico, my favorite Venezuelan rum. Ehhh not the greatest it was super strong and bitter...but I made sure to drink all $17 worth of it! Great ambience and music too...only downside was i was little annoyed by the waiter. When I told him what we wanted to order he told me this wasn't a tapas place and they recommend an app, main entree and dessert not to share various apps. So my husband told him he didn't like the entrees he didn't want that, he insisted again about the \" way they did things\" until we told him again what we wanted. So he let us order and left us to it. So besides being told what to eat...lol we really enjoyed our meal ( that we picked!)"}
{"text":"The food here is truly special.  Authentic Latin but with a modern twist. The Meyer Lemon rotisserie chicken is amazing. Service was attentive but we never felt rushed. We wish the noise level from fellow patrons was a little better managed so we could have heard the lovely Latin music playing in the background."}
{"text":"If you are in Las Vegas and want to try some great Latin food, head over to Chica and you will not be disappointed!! 

We went for Dinner(party of 4) and started off with Empanadas, Chicken Chicharrones and Chica fries. Empanadas were great, Chicharrones were so amazing that we ordered them again which speaks to how good they really were! Chica fries were pretty great as well. If you are ordering Fries I would recommend you to opt for Chica Fries since they are pretty unique. 

For the main course, I ordered Pepita Crusted Lamb. Lamb was perfectly cooked and tasted good but the highlight of the dish was the sauce(mole verde) that comes with it. Rest of the group ordered Halibut and Chicken Rotisserie and from what I heard they were great.

Service was great and even though the restaurant was filled with people we were never rushed. I definitely recommend this place if you are in Las Vegas and I for sure am planning to go again whenever I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Refinement and sophistication are terms that one would use to describe this master piece of a Restaurant. Latin cooking has a distinctive flavor and that delicate balance has been refined to preserve all the phenomenal flavors and incorporated into the menu here. The drinks have been infused with fruit and other fruit juice to put a new spin on old classics. 

Once in a while a few ladies and I, will get together for dinner and catch up on everything. Accepting the invitation of Refinement to come out and be guests with Peroni we jumped at the chance. This was a private event that Chica sponsored the space.

The Peroni event sampled this liquor in an array of drinks that were made up for all of the guests to sample. The beautiful restaurant was perfect for hosting this venue. Our area included the bar and a few tables by the bar, just to the right of the hostess stand.

The catering was done with sampling of the menu at Chicas for all the guests to try. The amazing wait staff brought around trays of beef filled enchiladas for the first round. The last sampling from Chicas menu was a cinnamon roll with Latin twist and it was amazing. 

The bartender made the drinks for the guests to take from the bar. A serve yourself or wait for the staff to bring the drinks by on a tray. The bartender had an awesome skill level of what goes in the drinks serving. The bar was also open if a guest wanted something other than what was being served. 

The decor of Chica is really over the top! The tables are paired with such comfy chairs. The colors they use to decorate are warm and welcoming. The lighting in the dining area is so delicate that it captures a perfect place to share a meal with a that special someone. The bar lighting is brighter than I have seen, and is ambient feeling. The sleek black granite coloring of the bar gives it a nice focus. 

The cocktails that were made focused on infusing strawberries and raspberry with Peroni in some fashion. Who knew that Peroni could taste so amazing in cocktails. 

The first drink they offered was a strawberry lemonade mix with Peroni. It was so sweet and delicate. It had real strawberries served in it too.

The second drink came in a brandy style glass with raspberry sorbet and Peroni. The fizzy violet bubbles were what made this drink. At the bottom of the glass were real raspberries and were full of all the Peroni flavor.

The third sampling was Peroni beer from their
glass bottles. You had a choice to drink the Peroni straight from the green bottle, or pour it in a pilsner cup. It was good either way.

There were games that Peroni had us play, if you wanted too. The photo booth was fun. The DJ was spinning records live for this catered event too. They encouraged us to take snaps with one another; then post to Instagram or what ever social media platform one use

The girls and I just enjoyed one another's company. Jammed to some tunes. Met some new people . And were educated on fabulous cocktails at an amazing restaurant. We are already planning our next visit!"}
{"text":"Chica is a beautiful restaurant, with great service and great food, I had the Guacamole who were excellent and a Negroni. When You serve a guacamole that good you know the rest of the food must be good. I gave only 4 stars because there is a lack of Vegan food or Gluten Free food on the menu. Of course they can modified the menu but why not created Couple plates Vegan or Gluten Free. Chica is definitely a  restaurant to Visit in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"2018 Restaurant week is here, and the work squad and I were stoked to see Chica in the listings....party of 8 for a Monday lunch please.

It's been 6+ months since I've dined at Chica but the service and staff are still crushing it.  The kitchen was fantastic with getting our entrees to the table quickly.  

Today at Chica, I discovered that they serve up flavorful Cubano sandwiches that are extremely filling. (see pics) I finally found a Vegas joint where I would order the Cubano again.  Well done.

This short update was to let my Yelp friends know about the Cubano.  Also, the 2018 restaurant week special offers amazing value at $20.  Check it out while it's still out there.  Enjoy! =)"}
{"text":"Lamb was served to us raw. Sent it back and fixed, but would have expected a discount. Food and service otherwise good, but not outstanding."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for amazing Spanish/Latin American food. I could quite literally live off this food for the rest of my life and be perfectly satisfied!

I happened to be in town recently for a girls trip. Vegas it totally known for having some of the best of the best...but I've been pretty disappointed by a lot of restaurants here. That was totally not the case with this place. 

We got seated about 10 min after arriving. It was pretty dead/quiet for a brunch on Saturday, but hey - I was starving and needed food. I won't complain! 

I ordered the Bloody Maria spicy and the Chipotle Chicken omelette. It was probably the best freaking omelette I've ever had! The chicken was full of amazing flavor and not dried out at all!! They also made a house made hot sauce if you like a spicy kick to your food. I highly recommend you ask for it. They'll charge you $0.50 - because nothing in Vegas comes free! :) But you'll be happy and quite satisfied with your meal. 

I'm planning to come back again for dinner, because...tapas, guys! Who doesn't freaking love tapas around here?! Though if I could make a menu suggestion, please add some croquettes to the menu....you'll thank me later! :)"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Chicken was great but after a few bites it gets really salty. Liked the design and layout of the place. Guacamole was good. They took forever bringing my wife's steak out but comp'd it right away which was cool"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Chica in the Venetian, you need to make a reservation. It is excellent Latin American fare. I loved the Peruvian style ceviche, Venezuelan style short ribs with black eyed peas two ways, and churro ice cream pops. I will be back."}
{"text":"Wow...amazing experience.  The food was great and service was awesome.   Had the guacamole dip and tuna appetizer and would recommend both highly.  Also would recommend the halibut and Brazilian steak.  Had sides of macaroni and cheese, jasmine rice and plantain. All were great.  Topped with the churro and Marquesa for dessert.   A must visit when in Vegas.  Fun and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome service great staff the burger was the best I've ever had great place if I wasn't on vacation here I would be a regular customer. If you are in Vegas this place is a must see. Some things you don't talk about when you leave Vegas but I will.be talking about Chica when I go back to New York."}
{"text":"Loved this place. I specifically went because the chef is Venezuelan and I'm Venezuelan. However, they have different latin styles and flavors to offer. We tried several things and I wish I could have kept eating and eating. Everything was really delicious. The ambiance is great too and with great latin music!"}
{"text":"Breakfast service is terrible. Waited almost an hour for breakfast to be delivered the restaurant was not crowded. People that sat down after us and ordered after us got their breakfast before us and the waitress did not seem concerned at all. My husband ordered steak and eggs and she gave the gentleman next to us a steak knife for his eggs by the time our breakfast was delivered my husband steak was cold his egg was cooked wrong. Trying to get a refill on coffee was next to impossible they took my cup away to refill it. Too many great places for breakfast to ever go back there"}
{"text":"Amazing latin food! You can tell this is top-notch once you get the food! It was our first time their so we tried all their signature dishes -- corn cheese, quinoa with shrimp, and beef tenderloin. Seriously.. AMAZING.
I would definitely go back when i stay at the Venetian. Seemed like a good place to go on a date too! 
Make sure to make reservations. They get very busy."}
{"text":"On to my next stop so gotta make this quick. Had the prime rib (chica burger) and a half kale salad. I couldn't stop eating either one. Good, solid, flavorful food and the DJ had me grooving the entire meal. For the food alone, this is already on repeat status before we leave Vegas.

I also ordered the berry mojito and this was the weakest point of the meal. It wasn't bad just didn't stand up to the meal. The flavors were a bit muddled so the only discernible flavor was the soda water. For $15? In the words of Rosa Parks, \"nah\". Throw the whole bartender away."}
{"text":"Despite the good service, the overpriced food was just was so notably bad, that as much as I'd like to give this place three stars, I really can't. You'll definitely pay, but you WON'T get! My generosity of two stars stems from the overt effort the waiter made to please a customer.

Empanadas were really just ok. Nothing special at all, but fine ($15.00 for 3 pieces).

I was really looking forward to the Grilled Peruvian Octopus, as the waiter really built it up as one of their best dishes. I love octopus, and grilled Peruvian sounded great, but I was a little leery because I saw that a few fellow Yelpers commented on the saltiness. Because of this, I specifically told the waiter that I wanted very very little salt on this due to what I had read. He understood, and said it wouldn't be a problem. Lo and behold, fellow Yelpers we're right - it was so salty that it tasted like they accidentally spilled a bunch of Morton's on the dish. This was a$26.00 dish (and small too), and I didn't even eat half of it! Now, that's nothing like me!!  The waiter asked about my barely eaten dish, and I told him that it was basically inedible!! He was so nice and insisted on having the dish brought out again sans salt, even though I said I'd rather just pass. Well, unbelievably, their second try came out as bad as the first dish?!?! Based on my analysis, I think a huge part of the saltiness came from the toppings/batter. How could they screw it up again a second time? Anyway, never again!!

To top it all off, the food was so terribly overpriced for what I got that I wish I had just gotten a burger. The food was extremely expensive and waaay to SALTY!!"}
{"text":"Food was so good it felt like it was authentic. Idk if it's because I'm really high and drunk but the service was awesome the food was on point and he ambiance was great! I recommend and would come back -- the corn was the best"}
{"text":"Chica was recommended to us by a friend and my husband and I were NOT disappointed! There were so many delicious things to choose from but Jeneveive (our amazing server) made incredible suggestions and took such wonderful care of us from start to finish! 
She recommended the Grilled Peruvian Octopus and the Classic Ceviche (we got both because thats how we roll) and for our entrees I ordered the Yuca Hash and my husband got the Halibut...The food was so flavorful and delicious I cant say enough about it! To sum it up...Delectable food and phenomenal service!! Thanks Chica, cant wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Great service! Lily, our server, was awesome, good recommendations, Amerie the busser was great too, she made sure our water glasses were full all the times, overall our breakfast was delicious! We will be back."}
{"text":"A number of us ate here during a conference - inspired selections, a fresh decor, and a delightful experience was had by all."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorites restaurants in Vegas!!! The food is excellent, authentic flavors. Beatriz gave us superb service. It makes me proud to be a Latino and show people from all around the world that we can have world class cuisine!!! Good job Lorena Garcia!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and the dishes were all so flavorful. 

We ordered the skirt steak and shrimp bowl for entrees, but started off with guacamole (which came with banana chips, tortilla chips & the most delicious rice cakes), sweet corn, octopus, and chicken chicharrones (this was just OK).

Our server was attentive and very knowledgeable of all the food, and was very accommodating since I'm lactose intolerant as well.

Would def recommend it and will be returning!"}
{"text":"What a terrific dinner spot! We came here because other restaurants in the Venetian for totally fall and booked up but I think the other people are missing out on a fantastic dinner location here. Each of our dishes was succulent and Incredibly tasty. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Was invited by colleagues to meet-up at the bar. Really wish I had stayed for dinner; nevertheless, had an outstanding time at the bar.

Arrived and my 2 colleagues were already there. Staff immediately poured me a glass of chardonnay. There were only enough seats for 2 of us, but as soon as a couple others left, staff grabbed more seats for us.

The decor is contemporary, yet still captures Latin highlights with bright and colorful fabrics/tiles and art.

The highlight for our group were the spicy mules. We stayed much longer than expected because staff was fantastic and kept the drinks flowing. I wish we could have stayed for dinner.

Next time."}
{"text":"Had a dinner meeting here.  Food was family style with no serving utensils.  This was quite interesting.  Had to use other peoples unused forks for serving.  We even ask for serving utensils but I guess it was ignored.  The food was not my favorite, as it was overly spicy.  Some staff were nice and some staff were indifferent to asking for help with our meals.  Wont be back.  Other reviews seem to like the food.  We were in a special room for group meetings and the arrangement of tables are just not a good fit for business meetings."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! We visited this restaurant about 8-9 months ago and we happened to come across our server at a nightclub the night before, he remembered our faces and introduced himself so that's the reason we came back he's so friendly and knows everything about every dish, his name is Oscar Martinez. Also, by the way, the drinks were amazing the bartender really knows what he's doing. Great experience all around we need to go back so we can taste everything in the menu"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant. Went for brunch on a Sunday. Beautiful restaurant.  Started of with what we all agreed was the best ceviche we have ever eaten, and I've had a lot of ceviche.  I had steak and eggs, both fantastic and flavorful and served with arepas (sp?) My girlfriend had juevos  rancheros.  Man her dish was really good also. I was going to order a margarita bit they had some really good sounding lemonades (and I was still in recovering mode from Fri and Sat night). Both our drinks were awesome. My girl ordered some kind of lemon donut type dish with berries and white chocolate. That was very good too. Warm, slightly tart and not overly sweet. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, although this review is for the restaurant week menu. Service was very attentive, just the right level of checking back without being irritating. Decor is awesome, very cool Latin vibe. 

I had the tiger de leche ceviche, which was a nice, bright acidic punch coupled with fresh fish. Excellent.

 My entree was the meyer lemon chicken, and it was bomb. Crispy skin, juicy chicken. The only place it fell flat was the side of potato salad. Bland. Nothing special. No heat or richness or acidity or anything. I'd try and sub for something else, but the star of the dish was the delish chicken anyway!

Finally, I told the waiter I don't do sugar, so they made a special stevia whipped cream and fresh fruit concoction that was awesome! Kudos for helping a brother out."}
{"text":"I recently attended the CES conference and was excited to find myself in the same hotel as Chica. I am admittedly a fan of Chef Lorena Garcia, so this restaurant was already on my bucket list to try since the opening last year.

So of course my first order of business before any conference-related activities was a solo brunch. They seated me quickly even though it was pretty busy already. I was quickly offered the chance to order a drink by the awesome Adrienne, and went with a nice classic mimosa. The menu is very simple, just two pages, but I asked for some suggestions from the staff before ordering. Adrienne brought me the guacamole appetizer, with an assortment of accoutrements - tortilla chips, plantain chips, and mini arepas in different flavors. The guacamole was delicious, and I really loved the pairing with the plantain chips. The arepas were excellent, and I enjoyed their flavors so much I didn't bother dipping them in the guacamole.

I also ordered the Grilled Peruvian Octopus, which did not disappoint at all. It was perfectly cooked, amazing flavor from both the octopus and the shishito peppers, and the crispy quinoa offered a nice light crunch. Absolutely recommend this appetizer!

For the main course, I settled on the Chica Burger, which Adrienne and manager Michael recommended to me when I couldn't decide. I had my heart set on tacos, but I'm glad I went with their suggestion. This burger is outstanding. Perfectly cooked to my preferred \"pink in the middle,\" with a super flavorful meat blend, and the kick of the Chica sauce was nice as well. It's topped with bacon, jalapeno jack cheese, avocado, crispy fried onions, lettuce, and tomato. Definitely a two-hander, and definitely recommend.

I didn't stop there. I wanted one more drink, and the bartender, Freddy, served up a margarita called \"Some Like it Hot.\" It's made with their house-made papaya habanero jam, lime juice, and Espolon Reposado tequila. It has quite the quick, and I'm told that the spice level can vary based on the batch of jam, but if you like spicy you'll love this.

Lastly, I dabbled in some dessert! The pastry chef at Chica recently won Pastry Chef of the Year in Las Vegas (http://www.eatinglv.com/2017/12/pastry-chef-year-sara-steele-chica/) so of course I had to try some dessert. Her Tres Leches Dulce de Leche cake is absolutely incredible. I would come back over and over just for that. 

I can not sing the praises of this place any more than this! If you're visiting Vegas and you want to eat somewhere where the food is delicious, the staff is wonderful, and the atmosphere is great, head over to Chica."}
{"text":"I will go back again and again and will always order the chicken chicharones... These are so yummy!!! Their calamari is really good, too.. I have tried the shrimp tacos before but wasn't impressed. I'd like to go back and try the other plates but I keep gravitating back to the chicken chicharones!! Can you tell I like those??"}
{"text":"4.5 stars

We came here during our last visit to Vegas. I had no expectations going in and was very pleasantly surprised! 

The decor here is very nice and their service is EXCELLENT. It was some of the best service I've ever had in a restaurant. Our waitress was very knowledgable and when we mentioned we were in town celebrating a graduation, she had a congratulations cake sent out for us. The manager also stopped by. There were probably 4-5 people who came to check on us, which was a little overwhelming, but overall, everyone was great.

We tried:

Drinks:
-FW Margarita: refreshing, fun, well balanced
-Sangria Zarzamora: nice and fruity but could have used a little more liquor
-Coffee: The dark roast was excellent!

Small plates:
-Guacamole: great guac and I really loved the beet, black bean and cilantrol arepas it came with!
-Classic Cerivice: your standard cervice
-Crab and Shrimp Salpicon: a nice, tangy refreshing seafood salad that balanced well with the rest of our meal
-Grilled Peruvian Octopus: perfectly cooked octopus...yum!
-Mac Con Queso: this corn \"mac and cheese\" was probably my favorite dish. It had giant corn kernels that were a great and guilt free alternative to pasta. Where can I get this kind of corn?!

Dessert:
-Churro Fried Ice Cream Pops: these were nothing like what I expected but were yummy! Very vanilla-y.

All in all, we had a great time and I'm glad we came!
Food: 4 stars
Service: 5 stars"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great dinner to add to the fun of a night out with my husband. Loved this spot for a good meal and good drinks.

My husband and I made reservations for 7:00 on a Saturday night, but I'm not sure we needed reservations. The restaurant was fairly busy, but not full. We were seated right away in a comfortable table. I sat on the booth side and it was really comfortable with a plush booth and pillow for extra comfort. 

We wanted to start with Empanadas, but they were out for the night so we went with Asado Negro Arepas instead. This was a light and tasty appetizer. The short rib and toppings on the arepas was delicious with lots of flavor. I had the Sangria Zarzamora (red sangria) and loved it. There was a hint of sweetness with plenty of fruit, but it wasn't overly sweet. My husband had the Tamarind Guava Colada which was also delicious and fairly strong.

Dinner for me was the Brazilian Beef Tenderloin. I loved every last bite of this dish. I requested my meat rare and found it to be a deliciously tender steak with great seasoning. The grits underneath were also bursting with flavor. Awesome dish all around. My husband had the Yucatan Halibut which was equally amazing. All of the flavors of this dish were great and everything was well prepared. I was sold on this restaurant with my beef tenderloin alone.

Dessert was Tres Leches Dulce De Leche and Churro Fried Ice Cream Pops. My husband really liked his churro fried ice cream pops which included three pops. My tres leche was okay. It was good, but it wasn't the best that I've had. I'd go with a different dessert next time.

The only thing that kept this restaurant from a five star was the slow service. I'm not sure if it was our otherwise great waitress or the kitchen. This was a two hour meal and we were glad we allowed way too much time before our show."}
{"text":"Located inside Venetian. next to cashier cage.  

Ask for Oscar. Wonderful service and delicious brunch.   We had delicious corn pancake, parfait, cuban sandwich, & Benedict. Portions were right size. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed Chica... with so many choices in Las Vegas, I am so glad we went here. Beautiful space, delicious food and great service."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for a snack and beverage. The food was good although I really didn't like how eating one of the dishes was like playing roulette. You chances it with peppers that will either be mild or melt-your-face-hot. It sounded like this was \"a thing\" people had complained about so I don't know why they don't fix it. Either cut off the tip and have an employee taste test every pepper before skewering it to cook, or find a different ingredient that won't ruin someone's night. 
The bartender was nice and made friendly conversation with us."}
{"text":"This review only applies to the bar area since we only came in for a few cocktails. If you're looking for a food review, sorry buddy I wasn't hungry. Plus guys like us are usually thirstier in Vegas. Get it?

Our bartender was a pretty Chica. Oh wait, the hostesses are pretty chicas as well. At this point I think Chica only hire chicas. Hey, I'm not complaining. It's almost like walking into a formal Hooters. Anyhow, I ordered a Gin & Tonic which is quite different at this bar. Instead of using tonic water she cracked open a cranberry tasting sparkly water. She then topped it off with a slice of lime. I've never had a G&T like this before but it was quite refreshing. I do wish it was stronger since the gin was pretty much covered up with the cranberry sparkling water. The total for my drink was $14.00. The fact that the bar is located in the Venetian I did not expect any thing less. 

Overall, the bartenders are attentive and accommodating. She made a few rounds to make sure we were doing fine. My drink could've been stronger but I'll take friendliness and good customer service over stiff drinks any day of the week."}
{"text":"A group of us got into Vegas on Friday and decided to start our gluttony of the weekend at Chica (I decided this was a must-try after I had stumbled upon it the previous weekend during a separate trip to LV). I think we were all happy with our experience. The food, drinks, dessert, ambiance, and service were all great. Out of our group, my boyfriend and I decided to order a couple of dishes to share, so we settled on the rotisserie chicken and the chicken chicharron. I expected to enjoy the rotisserie, but not the chicharron as much as I did; it was sooo good, particularly with that sauce they use to top it. I cannot remember what drinks we ordered, but they were all actually good. The salsas were also very good, fresh, and flavorful. As I read in other reviews, it is obvious that Chica uses high-quality ingredients."}
{"text":"While visiting friends staying at the Venetian we stopped by this restaurant for a quick dinner. In my opinion the menu doesn't offer very much variety there were a total of maybe 6 entrees, small plates or tapa like dishes separated in categories of hot and cold, and a few side dishes that could be added. We ordered the guacamole because we figured you can't go wrong with that, pulled pork tacos(bite sized), empanadas, hoppin Jose rice, and calamari. The presentation was very nice for all the dishes but several of the things we ordered were heavily salted which didn't allow me to appreciate the flavors of the actual food. Our hostess was amazing very informative and willing to offer explanations for items on the menu and just overall a pleasant individual. They had a great playlist going but I wasn't so impressed by the food. Maybe we just went on an off day also another thing to note is most of the post and pictures on yelp for this location were actually for the lunch menu which appears to have slightly more options they aren't available for dinner."}
{"text":"Seriously... one of the best meals I've ever had!  I'm a Las Vegas local and have hundreds of exceptional restaurants just minutes away.  I've traveled around the world and experienced cuisines in over 40 countries. Chica is easily in the top 1% for me!  We ordered a variety of small plates and sides and every one was extraordinary!  Randy was our server and absolutely brought the menu to life with his descriptions, recommendations and enthusiasm!  It's only been open for two weeks and as much as I'd like it to be my best kept secret so I can always get a table I want it to thrive so that it's always here for me!!  Bravo!!  Fresh, elevated, explosive flavors!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing. The arepas are a MUST. If you're in the mood for a salad the shrimp and butter lettuce is incredible-- I've never tasted that combination of flavors (the dressing adds a different spin) and it was a perfect marriage. I loved everything! They also have what my husband likes to call \"real coke\" in the glass bottles made with cane sugar. Just like our trip to Mexico!"}
{"text":"For only being open two weeks, we were amazed at the attention we received from the expert staff at Chica and the wonderful tastes of our shared small dishes. From the front desk folks who explained a few choice menu items, to our waiter who truly understood the new menu and all the other staff members who stopped by to inquire how we liked everything. We totally enjoyed the mixologist special caipirinha of the day with pineapple and hot pepper for a little spice! We shared a bunch of small plates including guacamole with arepas, plantain and tortilla chips, tuna ceviche, salpicon (crab and shrimp salad), mixed mushroom medley, pulled pork tacos and spicy grilled Peruvian octopus! All delicious and beautifully presented! The desserts, oh the desserts! Coconut panna cotta, churro crumb coated fried ice cream pops and a complimentary Lemon Bunuelos which is the Venezuelan version of donuts! All fantastic flavors
We were  suckers for the charming octopus story told by our waiter!"}
{"text":"Food was OK but WAAAY overpriced. I get it, it's at a strip casino and we went for dinner but where do they get off with charging $52 dollars for a small steak?? Chips and salsa are NOT complimentary so that really tells you they are trying to squeeze every penny out of their customers. Anyways, it did not feel like high end dining BUT the charge more than high end prices for their food."}
{"text":"I am blown away by the good reviews. I had possibly the worst dining experience of my life here. Came in to a pretty empty restaurant and sat at the bar. It took me almost 15 minutes to get the bartenders attention. Finally a red head came over (I think she was a manager?) and wow was she rude. I wanted to know more about their bar program because they had so many different bottles I have never seen before and she didn't even seem 25% interested in asking any of my questions. I left without even ordering a single thing. I will never return."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! My two girlfriends and I came here for brunch today and it was exceptional. 

We went in on a Monday, not knowing brunch is only served on the weekends, but management was so nice that they made an exception and let us have brunch anyway. The service was great, and the food was even better! Every dish we ordered was delicious. They also gave us complimentary champagne and cake for my birthday. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday brunch. 

Thank you so much Chica!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible, from the decor, to the service and most importantly the food. Outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Was lead to believe this was a new and bright star for restaurant row, but good marketing does not equal quality food and or service. They need to send their wait staff back to basic training 101 or take hints from the Olive Garden corporate staff for training guidelines. The wait staffers were hardly pushed to the limit, six tables in a sitting area for 16 tables. The bright spot was the pork belly, delicious on its own! The French press coffee was pure light colored mud, and had to be taken back once and not consumed the second time, tres leeches cake was also a hit, but again it was tough to makeup for the \"CHICKA\" like wait staff, and that's not a put-down on kids, in fact my kids have and do a far better job in dining etiquette than these wannabes staff members did. Time for the management crew to do a review and correct the glaring and apparent short-comings. Unfortunately we were not the only patrons (Saturday night) that came away disappointed. Juanito Amore' no more por CHICKA"}
{"text":"I Really Really wanted to love this place! I was so excited for the experience! 
I have a mild obsession with Caribbean, Central and South American food. 
So to have a new place on the Strip, this could be the pinnacle of the cuisine! 
Not quite.... it was good, but not great, and with \"Las Vegas Strip\" prices... ugh
I must say the Classic Ceviche was great!!! Worth every penny and an absolute must!! 
I was looking forward to the grilled corn lollipops, but for $13 it's two corn cobs broke in half to make four small pieces, and it's just okay....
The guacamole was good, however the plantains served that accompany it are way better than the guacamole itself. 
There famous \"Short Ribs\" were some of the worst I have ever had. I do not recommend this dish.
The Pepita Crusted Lamb was good, cooked very well. 
Overall though, for these prices... the food, the service, and the whole experience.... it is just A-Okay....."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for lunch about a month after it opened (my review is a little late).

The food was great and the service was also perfect!

We ordered the empanadas and guac as appetizers. I had never tried guac and arenas together so I was hesitant but who am I kidding guac tastes magical on anything. Then we ordered the Grilled Steak Sandwich and the Herb Marinated Steak. Everything was delicious and filling!

Will definitely stop by again if I'm craving Latin-inspired food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"** churro fried ice cream pops**

I'm not a dessert person and I don't understand the purpose of churros but this show stopper dessert was so freaking good and the right Portion size!
- it's like a ice cream lollipop except a skinny churro is he stick 
- the ice cream is reminiscent of dulce de Lethe cheese cake 
- I could bathe in this !!!


Other goods:
- the ceviche 


The meh :
- maybe I'm not into hard core drinks but I wasn't a fan of the watermelon margarita or the Tamarind colada"}
{"text":"If you make 1 positive decision in Vegas it should be going to dine, drink and socialize at Chica. Not only was the food incredibly delicious (best guacamole I've EVER had!!) but the service and overall ambience was truly magnificent. Greg, the operations manager, was kind & considerate. Dee, the bartender, was friendly and provided nothing short of the greatest service. The hostesses, waiters and other bartenders were also a pleasure to interact with. This restaurant stands high above all other Vegas establishments. We'll be back -- can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Happy Thanksgiving!!!

I love the ambience of this place. It is so relaxing and light. The lights aren't dimmed too much and I loved the service we received today. 

There was a prix fix menu today for thanksgiving, but were also giving their lunch menu as well! We ordered the original ceviche, the empanadas and the pico platter to start! 

I ordered the Tamarind Guava Colada, and Jacob a cucumber gin and tonic. He enjoyed him but I was disappointment in the lack of tamarind or guava in the colada. 

I did like the ceviche but the hominy was starchy and hard to chew. Our favorite of the picos was probably the corn pico, as it was both sweet and had a slight pick! We did wish the platanos were season better. 

Jacob really liked the empanadas, but I believe they were baked and I do prefer my empanadas more crunchy.

We were both in agreement that the turkey enchiladas weren't as good as we were hoping. They did state that it came with a pumpkin mole which we didn't think tasted like a mole and more of a verde sauce. Although the turkey was very moist, we weren't fond of the pomegranate pico and we felt like it was flavorless.

We finished the afternoon with the Tres Leches, which I thought was super sweet. It was topped with a merengue and had condensed milk on the bottom of the plate as well as what was in the cake as well. I wished the fruit pico was more prominent. 


We do wish there was more of a wow factor from this place. I would have given this place 3.5 stars if I was able."}
{"text":"I loved Chica. Food was amazing, drink were great as well. I'm Hispanic and I can honestly say they got the food down. So authentic. By far one of the best restaurants in Vegas. I want to thank cesilia for such an amazing experience. She was outstanding!!! She made sure my family and I were comfortable and satisfied with our food and drinks. She went far and beyond to provide us with the best experience possible. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went here because we had a gift certificate. Nice place . Food was great however service was very slow. First ones in and order yet many tables received food before we did. Probably won't go back based on service."}
{"text":"Love the food, loved the decor and the live music they had going on. Chef Lorena Garcia came to our table to say hello. So delightful. She told us it was her 1 year anniversary and was so grateful to everyone for coming to enjoy her food. She recommended for me to try the octopus and let me know it was a favorite of hers. Loved it"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, I was with a big group and we tried the chef special - a little bit of everything on the menu. We where not disappointed! I recommend the octopus!"}
{"text":"My friend & I really enjoyed our dinner at Chica!

The restaurant is so beautifully designed & decorated.  Very nice classy feel.  My friend who is a famous interior designer in Aspen & Vail really appreciated the design & ambiance of Chica.

The food is also very delicious and nicely presented.  So awesome to go to a restaurant where you can sample the best of Latin American cuisine.  I was truthfully nervous at first given that it was my first time & I had a friend w/very high standards w/me.  But, I was so glad we went to Chica!

These are what we ate:
Grilled Peruvian Octopus ~ amazing!
Crispy Calamari Fuego ~ delicious!
Porchetta with Crispy Yuca Hash ~ wonderful!
Braised Short Rib ~ great pick!
Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our amazing dinner!
I will be back with my family next time."}
{"text":"We went here for our Anniversary dinner and it turned out to be a great experience. We made reservations and was seated right away. The service was great. We had the Trio de pico for an appetizer with our drinks Apple sangria and a beer. We had a complimentary champagne which was very tasty. As our entree my husband had the short rib. I had the pork tacos which are small but since I wanted desert I wanted to make sure I had space. Dinner was great. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Every detail was tended to. Once again, we are pleased with the intricate details Mike Minor has put into a meal. The grilled octopus was the most tender that ever ever had! The street corn was super cheesy, which strikes my happy button. The salsas were tasty. The short ribs melt in your mouth with the most delicious flavor. The halibut was moist and flavor filled. The drinks added a layer of pizzazz to the experience."}
{"text":"I was in need of a dinner reservation for a party of 8.  They initially had us down for 6pm on Saturday night, but I called to move it to 8:15pm due to a show we had at 10pm.  I had confirmed with them that we would be able to eat and get out of there in time for the show and they reassured me that we would.
Ambiance:  It has a very nice vibe and decor.  There is a lounge/bar area out front.  There was music going on in the back ground making you wonder if you were going to be eating in a lounge...however, as you walk towards the back, it truly turns into a lovely restaurant.  We were given a private room in the back that was completely isolated from the restaurant.  IT was good and bad.  We definitely had privacy, but you do not get to feel the vibe of the restaurant.  Halfway through, the server did turn on some music that made things a tad lively.  It was also difficult to flag down the server while in our room.  Restrooms could have used a little more attention.  There was no attendant and there were lots of paper towels along the floor.
Service:  We came at 8:10pm and was told that our table was being prepped.  We were not seated until 8:20pm.  It took a tad for our server to come and see us.  We were given our menus and I made it clear that we were on a time crunch.  He was very understanding and reassured us that we would be fine.  He felt a little hesitant to take all of our orders at in the beginning (wanted to get the drink orders first), obliged and was very nice about it.  From there, service started going downhill a tad...we requested lemon for our water and that had to be reminded a few times before it came out.  We had put in orders for non alcoholic drinks and that was forgotten as well.  Most of the food came in a timely fashion except for one of the entrees...that had to be reminded and came out quite a bit later. He was very apologetic about it but did nothing to rectify it.  Finally, i literally had to flag him down to get our bill and settle it.  We were out of the restaurant at 9:45pm.  It seems that he also had a few tables outside to take care of.
Food:  For the most part, really great flavors.  I loved the variety that the restaurant offered.  Lots of interesting appetizers.  Standouts included: Iberico ham (special of the evenign) that came out with warm rolls.  I also enjoyed the guac and variety of chips/plantain.  Everyone really loved the flavor and chunkiness of the guac.  The fried calamari was ok, nothing terribly special.  I was a tad disappointed in the corn.  It had too much mayo/cream and really didn't do anything for me.  For the entrees, I tried the Porcheta which I thought was really flavor.  A tad on the fatty side but I am not complaining.  I also tried the chicken and I was really impressed.  It was moist and had the perfect amount of seasoning.  The other thing I was a tad disappointed in was the mac con queso.  As long as you are not expecting pasta, you may enjoy it.  It is made of corn.  Was a tad different and didn't do it for me.  

I think overall it is a good resaturant and has potential.  I just couldn't give it a 5 star due to its service."}
{"text":"I just tried this place and absolutely loved it! My favorites were the grilled octopus and the salad w ginger and green beans. Nice friendly staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Large screen in the lounge showing World Cup matches was the perfect spot to have a bite and a drink. The guacamole was some of the best I've had and the burger did not disappoint. Cocktail menu is creative and delicious, the Daquiri Ahumado is like nothing I've had before smoked strawberries and Venezuelan rum! The Manager Cecilia stopped by and she actually created that cocktail, way to go! She chatted with us about the restaurant and the tequila and rum selections, extremely knowledgeable and just really warm and inviting. Can't wait to come back and try more delicious food and talk rum with Cecilia."}
{"text":"What a fun little treasure at the Venetian! We liked it so much we stopped in twice in one weekend. The food is so well done and the service was approachable and welcoming. Jose was the bomb!"}
{"text":"The bartenders Shanda and Ricco are so sweet and helpful! They make amazing cocktails and the food is delicious. The manager of yardbird suggested we finish our dinner here. Thanks Steve!! If you're looking for a delicious dinner or amazing cocktail, this this the place!"}
{"text":"The octopus was one of the best I've had since it was cooked perfectly and had amazing spices. The tenderloin was delicious but on the spendier side.  The beef empanadas were tasty and the pork tacos were decent. I also really liked the margarita and the passion fruit caparina cocktail.

It was overall an enjoyable meal and conveniently located by The Palazzo.  We also got seated right away in the early evening on a Saturday with no reservations."}
{"text":"lindo restaurant, buena atención, recomiendo  tapas de asado negro y pulpo.
Me quedé con ganas de comer los reales buñuelos venezolanos hechos de yuca x que los que tienen son de aire o Donald."}
{"text":"One of the best South American restaurants! 
We tried the appetizers and they are just so delicious! The flan was the bomb! Our server Francesca gave us awesome recommendations.
We will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"A truly wonderful meal at an awesome new restaurant. We are locals and it was our anniversary. We usually stay close to home but I was very curious about this new spot. Our service was absolutely fantasitic and the food was incredible. I had the pork entree- blew my mind and was so flavorful and delicious. My husband loved the beef tenderloin and we left happy and full. Highly recommend the sommelier- he was very knowledgeable about the South American and Spanish wines. Ask him for guidance if you are not familiar. I wish I could remember the name of our server- he was great and from Jersey. Such a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"The octopus appetizer is just amazing. I will return for the octopus and the \"some like it got\" sweet and spicy cocktail. The lemon rotisserie chicken full portion is enough for two. Our server split the dish for us. 

Chica is a sister of its neighbor Yard Bird which is my \"go to\" when I come to Vegas. They both make the juiciest, tasty chicken. 

The service was prompt, friendly, and helpful. Our server recommended the octopus and tenderloin. We got the octopus and we will try the tenderloin and guacamole next time.  

The decor and ambiance is cool.

One caveat:  if you're going to split the chicken, just order a full order. Don't say \"split\" because they gave us 2 half orders and charged us for it. One full order is enough for 2 people if you order drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Once again we find ourselves at Chica. This South American restaurant which concentrates on Venezuelan cuisine is something that is appealing to all. We had appetizer of guacamole and chips, which included corn chips and plantain chips and these nice soft round corn flavored and some beet flavored and flour flavored arrepas. I had shrimp accompanied with quinoa. This dish was absolutely excellent.  My husband had porchetta with crispy yucca hash. I've got to say that the pork was fantastic. It was super tender and the skin was just the right kind of crispy. Being from Hawaii, this is what you look for in pork. You can't stop me from coming back to this wonderful and super friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"So much flavor!  Everything we had here was so full of interesting flavor. We shared multiple small plates to taste more and were completely stuffed. Empenadas were a tad over cooked but everything else was so great. The small fried chicken pieces which I thought would be my least favorite were actually a huge hit. And the corn!  Not overrated. We went kind of late but the place wasn't busy at all. I feel like people are missing out. Beautiful decor & distinct flavors. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food really good spin on some of the drinks. The grilled octopus is a must. The new rum new fashion n their version of a Manhattan are great. Enjoyed the decor of the place as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently had dinner here. We are local and are always looking for new restaurants. We had a fantastic experience. The lemon chicken was amazing! We were particularly impressed with our service. Our waitress, Myya was delightful. Friendly, knowledgeable, and very attentive. We enjoyed the ambiance and the decor as well. We will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"I've bookmarked this place since they've opened. Since I was staying in Plazzo for the NYE, I decided to come trying out. We were able to reserve a table easily since most people booked the steakhouses on nye. We were glad that we finally tried it, it is now my favorite South American restaurant in town. 

Services was attentive. Atmosphere was nice and cozy. Food was delicious!

Here are the things we've tried:

1. Grilled Corn Lollipop (3/5): it is basically like elote but I found it under seasoned. It was plain. Not recommended, 

2. Scallop Ceviche (5/5): daily special. it is a dish that you would find in a Japanese restaurant with raw scallop, uni and caviar but with the South American twist and pancetta on the raw ingredients. We enjoyed it. 

3. Chica Fries (5/5): it was cover with cheese, pancetta and green onions. It was crispy nonetheless all the sauce on the fries. Loved it. 

4. Mac con Queso (5/5): Peruvian corn and cheese. It was my first time having Peruvian corn and it was so good!

5. Steak and Kale Lime Salad (5/5): love the dressing and the steak was cooked perfectly for its price. 

6. Shrimp and Quinoa(4/5): love the quinoa, it was so flavorful. Shrimp was okay though. I think it was over cooked and under seasoned. 

7. Grilled octopus (4/5): it was good but nothing outstanding. 

8. Empanadas (3/5): It was too dry like other yelper stated. The flavor was mediocre. 

In all, I would come back again to try brunch and more dinner items. I would recommend you to come and try it out if you're reading this!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant during an event and had the opportunity to try many of their appetizers. Every appetizer I had was great, including the mini cuban sandwiches, churros, arepas and ceviche. They were all very flavorful. My favorite one was the arepas and the churros. I highly suggest getting the churros for dessert. They were warm, doughy and had the perfect amount of sugar. 

The only appetizer I was not a fan of was the ceviche. I prefer my ceviche to be lemon based and not with a strong tomato taste. The ceviche reminded me more of Mexican ceviche whereas I prefer the Peruvian version. 

The drinks here are fantastic as well. Their signature drinks start at $15 but they are worth the money. I ordered the Midnight in PR and it really did remind me to drinks I have had in PR. My hubby tried multiple of their drinks as well and he thoroughly enjoyed them.

Overall great time, atmosphere and food. This is a place I am looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"If I could try everything on the menu, I would. Every dish seemed delicious. I ended up getting the Grilled Peruvian Octopus as a starter and Fish Tacos as my entree. The octopus came with whole shishito peppers which were similar to jalapenos but with a mild kick. The fish tacos came with these savory pickled fruits and veggies. I must come back later for dinner or breakfast!"}
{"text":"\"O\" for Oscar!

My favorite @unfiltereddames and I met at this casual Latin American inspired restaurant yesterday afternoon for a birthday celebration! The ambiance is colorful and the upbeat music will have you shaking your shoulders spontaneously with content (trust me I got my shimmy on a few times)!

{"text":"If flavor and customer service is what you're after COME to Chica's.  The food and drinks are not flavored down.  Expect spices, garlic, and flavor. Many restaurants like this water down the flavor and take away the essence of South American heritage. Chicas welcomes you. Come and enjoy Chica's!!!"}
{"text":"Drinks: 5/5
     When friends get together for dinner,  you can definitely bet that we will be drinking. Tried their house specialty drinks and they were great! Pepino Sandia was light and refreshing. The watermelon \"ice cube\" was interesting but I can just imagine all that alcohol soaked up and it would definitely deliver a punch haha. My friend ordered me a Rhum New Fashioned. Tasty and strong. Not my usual fruity and sweet drink order but it sufficed.

Server: 5/5
     Sante was the highlight of the evening. Kudos to her putting up with my friends' kids running around the table after they were fed. Even funnier when my friend's son practically burried his face on her behind because he was trying to get back to his seat and she was serving the table. Her patience and understanding made our night, especially with our dreaded split check fiasco. Sorry friends for that 30+ minute wait at the end of the meal but thank you for dealing with us,  Sante!

Food: 3.5/5
Guacamole w/ Assorted Chips & Mini Arrepas 
     What can I say? It was guacamole. Nicely seasoned. The great part about this was the assortment of plantain chips, mini arrepas, and tortilla chips that came with it. 

Grilled Corn Lollipops 
     Not to nit-pick their menu wording, but I didn't know cobbettes can also be called lollipops... corn was very crunchy, almost raw. Wish it was grilled longer. Not the best version of an elote I've ever had but a friend ordered it. Eating the dish made me wish they either had more butter or actual mayonnaise on it. Horrible I know. Presentation was cute with the husks tied into a knot, but that was all it had going for it.

Chicken Chicharones
     Very deceiving name by the looks alone until you read the description. You would think it would be chicken skin, but to call the dish chicharon is far reaching. It's basically an unbreaded fried chicken. Not crunchy as you would expect from the name. Seasoning was fine. Nothing memorable about it.

Grilled Peruvian Octopus
     I was very hesitant to order this dish because of the bad reviews it had, but my friends are suckers for grilled octopus that's available in any restaurant. Pleasantly surprised that it came actually cooked perfectly. Not chewy or gummy. Great seasonings. A little bit heavy on the salt, but overall a great dish.

 Shrimp and Butterlettuce Salad
     My friend ordered to try it and it was another great dish. A very light salad and the shrimp was cooked perfectly.

Arepa Basket
     These were amazing! Light, fluffy and definitely not dense. Reminded me of cornbread with the size that they came out in. The nata butter was velvety smooth and paired well with the mini arepas. They came in regular masa, red (I thought it was red, since the lighting in the restaurant is very dim), and blue corn. Would definitely order this by itself!

Porchetta w/ Crispy Yucca Hash
    Amazing! Who doesn't like pork?! The skin was crisp, meat flavorful and fork tender. No adjustments needed. Best entree of the night. Too bad I didn't order this.

Pepita Crusted Lamb
     Lamb was cooked to the desired temperature of medium rare. Didn't really get much of the pepita crust on it, but nothing else was memorable about it.

Strip Steak
     This was a dish that I shared with my friend. I already ruined it by ordering it medium, but she just couldn't do anything rarer haha. Out of all the items, this was the most that I anticipated but in the end was such a let down. This dish would've been my first time trying mole. Instead what I got on the plate of the sauce was a crusted on painting on the plate. To me that signaled that it was sitting on the heat lamp while other foods got expedited before it. The second thing I was excited for but was let down yet again was the \"huitlacoche quesadilla.\" I love Point Reyes without a doubt, but if huitlacoche was in there I would not have been able to taste it at all. 

Rice & Beans
     Very simple dish. What could go wrong with It? It was a scoop of rice and a small dish of the beans. Not enough seasoning. Consider my rice loving side offended.

Hoppin' José Rice
     This side dish was flavorful. This was how the rice and beans should have come out, already mixed together and seasoned.

Panna Cotta
     Passionfruit I believe was the flavor but the kitchen didn't have any available. That was a let down.

Lemon Donuts
     Light, aery and with a great scent of lemon. Downside, there should have been more on the plate. These were finished by the table.

Tres Leches Dulce de Leche
     Passable. Not too sweet. Wish the cake was soaked in more leche. Would it be wrong of me to want a Marianna's or any other supermarket version of this dessert instead of this restaurant? 

Churro Fried Ice Cream Pops
     Churro was the size of a baby bamboo twig compared to the ice cream pops."}
{"text":"My friend invited me for one of the soft opening nights for friends and family. I am glad I went!

The place itself feels pretty upscale. I liked the décor. We were seated at the bar. One thing I did not like was that one of the drink stations was literally in front of my friend and I, on the counter. There were two plates of salt just sitting out right where our drinks should have been. 

Speaking of drinks, I ordered the sangria made out of the red wine, and my friend ordered the pablano drink. Mine was yummy! My friend however doesn't think she actually got what she ordered. The server asked her twice what she wanted before she made the drink, so I think she was just too busy to remember. My friend also wanted to order another drink, and was told it was a one drink limit, but would ask someone if she could have another. My friend ended up getting another glass of red wine.

We got an appetizer to share. We ordered the guacamole. It came with tortilla chips, plantains, and arepas. The plate was huge! Some of the people near us ordered other apps, and they were tiny, so we were glad we got what we did. The guac was very tasty, however it was a little watery. It was almost like a mix of guac and salsa. I loved it on the plantains.

We each got an entrée. My friend ordered the halibut, and I ordered the chicken. Mine came with a side of purple potato salad. The chicken and potato salad was very good! The chicken was tender, and the skin was crisp. My friend said her halibut was good too. Hers came with more plantains. 

The funny thing is that we also got a side to share, and we ordered the plantains! Haha lots of plantains in this meal. The side had some kind of cinnamon on it. They were soft and warm. They were really good.

Lastly we got a desert to share. The bartender/server recommended the churro pops to everyone at the bar. It sounded good, so we ordered it. Sadly, it took about 30 minutes to get the desert. The service was very very slow. The churro pops were good, however we believe the ice cream in the middle was just vanilla. We were told before ordering that it was caramel ice cream. Oh well. 

All in all, this is a nice new upscale place in the Venetian. All of the food was approved by us! Service speed could improve, but hard to critique this, as this was just a soft opening."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Food was excellent. Great staff. Ordered a Nazcal Winter cocktail... wow, it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Ate here for my friends birthday. Drinks were ok. If you're going to get drinks I suggest the mojito. The mango margaritas tasted like it was straight juice so definitely don't get that. The food however was so good!!! Pork tacos are the way to go. Sweet corn was also an amazing option. Service was good."}
{"text":"Reservations were not needed but recommended. Lunch was shared guacamole with plantation chips and arepes as an appetizer. Then short rib tacos and black beans. Management comped us dessert of tres leches cake and chocolate layered cake"}
{"text":"Excellent decor, food, and service. No complaints whatsoever! Would highly recommend. The swordfish was succulent and the arrepas original and flavorful"}
{"text":"These kind of reviews truly break my heart. 
The place is beautiful, the vibe is cool, decor beautiful kinda Latin South American vibe to it, place was busy,  energy was great and the food for the most part was tasty (mostly appetizers). 

But unfortunately they made too many mistakes. Some of them were really bad. 

1. Serving 2 steak dishes (45$) when the steak was completely cold. 

2. After talking to them they took back the steaks and brought it back to our table after putting it on the pan or possibly even in the microwave. The stakes were definitely not good. Dry and completely lost their taste. 

3. They sell a rice dish that doesn't show on the menu that it has pork in it. Some of our table were vegetarian and some were Jewish so pork is definitely a no go for like half the table. When we said something about it the replace with a new one but by the time we got our new one it was already too late to our meal. People lost their appetite. 

4. The server was definitely apologetic and felt bad and tried to make it easier for us, but i didn't see any try from her side to compensate us for those mistakes. 


Unfortunately that's a 2 stars experience. 
Trust me. I know food."}
{"text":"Great dinner last night. Sampled many items on the menu including the short ribs, roasted chicken, and the popular porchetta dish. The distinct flavors of each one had me coming back for more.  The best was the Mac Con Queso side dish was to die for.  I could eat 2 of them.  The churro pops finished meal perfectly.  José was excellent and detail orientated.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Had dinner yesterday with my hubby & my toddler. It was fantastic experience from beginning to end! We started off with the trio de picos which was perfect since my daughter loved the silver dollar corn mass bites & plantain chips. My husband ordered a few specialty cocktails by recommendation of the waitress ( she was so attentive!) we had the 3 course chef meal & finished off with the yummy chocolate cake dessert."}
{"text":"Great food. Breakfast burrito was out of this world. Shawna B gave us excellent service!!"}
{"text":"First time trying Chica and I loved it. It's pricey but that's expected on the strip and it's well worth the cost. We shared the octopus, empanadas, porchetta, Mac con Queso and the churro ice cream/tres leches for dessert. Everything was amazing. The porchetta was crispy, fatty, tender and perfect. That and the churro ice cream were my favorites. I was hoping to find one dining experience in Vegas that blew me away and Chica is that place. This will definitely be a place I return to every time I visit."}
{"text":"Diverse, excellent menu. The octopus was perfectly cooked & highly recommend the guacamole."}
{"text":"Love love love! We had the most moist pork, the hoppin Jose rice incredibly flavorful, asada negro arepas were well balanced with all sorts of interesting flavors. Our waitress was awesome, I'm sorry that I can't remember her name...she was warm and authentic and honest with her recommendations. Highly recommend Chica!!!"}
{"text":"Chica has a very nice ambience it's located in the Venetian down restaurant row. The guacamole and salsa and chips and plantains were amazing. The service was excellent. My friends raved about their Mojitos and said they were the best they ever had. I had a strawberry and regular daiquiri which were super good also. Senta was our hostess and she was very nice and gave great recommendations on what to try. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Chica by chance.  

Where to start?   

Flawless execution on opening day.  How?  Outstanding staff from the hostess who loaned me her phone for a half hour to Bo, Jessica and the entire group behind the bar.  I've walked the earth 51 years and never had shots this good.  

The food was simply incredible.  Chicken appetizer, jasmine rice, ceviche all out of this world.  My friend called the octopus the best he's ever had.  

I've never posted a restaurant review.  But I could not wait to tell this story.   

The upbeat / family vibe is unreal.  Decor is stunning from the artwork to the ceilings to the floors to the flowers.   There are beautiful restaurants in Las Vegas but this one stands out.  Very relaxing.  

Chica is a 10."}
{"text":"My fiancée took me here for my birthday. 
We tried the guacamole which come with plantains and arepas: beets cheese and I want to say the third one is black beans. Their guacamole is not your normal hass avocado that you get in Mexican restaurants. It's very unique. What I liked the most of the place is that they tell what country the dish is from. 
Our experience with the restaurant didn't start off right. My girl got the chicken and I got the halibut dish. 
Her dish came first and then ten minutes later they brought my out. But once my girl took a bite the chicken was super cold. The kitchen or the waiter mess up. Don't know who. But the manager stopped by and apologized for the mistake and offer dessert on the house. Which was nice for them to recognize the mistake and make up for it. Awesome job manager for taking the time to apologized and make up and keep us to keep coming for more."}
{"text":"From chef Lorena Garcia comes Chica, a Latin American eatery.  Oh, it's good.

First female, first Latino, first... blah blah blah casino PR aside, The food, while toned down to be kinder to the American palete and prettied up, is solid.  (Sorry for lack of pics, we have a no phones at the table rule).

To start, the simple grilled corn lollipops. Essentially Mexican street corn. It showcases sweet, buttery, not starchy corn brightened with a squeeze of lime and lime oil and a citrusy heat from piquin peppers all dusted with generous shavings of cotija cheese.  Sweet, earthy, citrusy in all the right ways.

The grilled Peruvian octopus, excellent. Extremely tender, it's oceanic flavors meld beautifully with a warming aji amarillo (Peruvian pepper paste with up front chili flavor) and accompanying guasacaca pico. Blistered shishito peppers add a brilliant bitter, vegetal foil.

Finally, be sure to order the guacamole. Not that it's different from the best in your local city, it's eating it with crisp fried plantains.  Crispy and starchy meets creamy, gently spicy, and citrusy. It's so goodly.  Sorry, couldn't resist.

Mains sampled, are very good packing a flavor punch. Top marks to the Venezuelan braised short rib. Deep and earthy flavor's penetrate the bone in, fall apart tender beef. A purée of black-eyed peas enhance the earthy the spice blend.  Pickled onions, the sour vibrancy to balance the beef.  A touch of epazote essence adds a pronounced herbal, almost astringent finish that greatly enhances the complexity of the dish.

The other stand out, the porchetta. It's simple, who doesn't love tender, juicy, crispy skin pork sauced with his own juices. Sautéed Brussels sprouts, and yucca work to bring out the pork's sweetness.  Excellent.

Although sidea are totally unnecessary as each dish is accompanied with some, the \"mac con queso\" (Peruvian corn with hearts of palm, wilted spinach and an intense Parmesan cream gratin) is a must.  Just try this.  Trust.

Service is friendly and efficient but not polished. This should improve with time.

Solid beverage program. Cocktails truly match the food.  G&T fans, try either the pepino sansia with its watermelon ice cubes, cucumber and mint) or regaliz de fresa with strawberry, star anise and lemon oil.  Either works to cut spice and refresh the palate.

Location:  Venetian, restaurant row, across Sugarcane (old DB Brasserie).

All told, an impressive and fun."}
{"text":"I think sometimes you have to think outside the box and this restaurant is a perfect example. This was one of the best restaurants I have eaten at in a long time. Everything we ordered was incredible including for appetizers were the chicken and the empanadas and for entrees the rotisserie chicken, the pork and the lamb chops. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Went here for a nice dinner for my bachelorette and everything was excellent! Friendly staff who saw that we were celebrating and sent overs complimentary round of champagne. Prices were extremely reasonable as well. Wish they had one in NYC I want to go back so bad. Corn was to die for!!!"}
{"text":"my wife and I ate there on the evening on Nov 11th 2017. I enjoyed the halibut entree. my wife did not enjoy the braised short ribs. I think I have the description correct. they were a bit chewed and not as tender. the french fries have no signature at all.. no flavour, not fresh cut and unimpressive."}
{"text":"Best food ever, my Cuban sandwich was the best I have eaten in a long while, the tamarindo piña horchata excellent combination... our waiter Eddie \"The Bear\" provided us with an excellent service. A great server, ask for him and you will see.
Thank you Chica for such a great  meal"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for brunch after finding that everywhere else had insane lines. We were unsure at first, especially since it wasn't so crowded. Turns out, this place is just super new. It feels very nice and upscale inside. 

We ordered the OJ and some coffee as drinks. The Oj was delicious and fresh. The kitchen gave us a set of four arepas as an appetizer to our brunch, which was super friendly. I ordered the breakfast burrito, and others in my group ventured to other items. I absolutely loved the flavor of my burrito. Most restaraunt make insanely large breakfast burritos, but I feel that the portion size at Chica was reasonable. I ate every bite and cleared my plate. The textures were perfect, and had a great ratio of dry to wet ingredients.  My friends ordered Huevo Ranchero, and noted that their food wasn't as hot, so I think the kitchen had finished their items before mine. My item was the perfect temperature. For this, the review is closer to 4.5, but as a new restaraunt, I know there are some kinks to be worked out!

At the end of our meal, we were given postcards that we could fill out and mail anywhere. This was such a cute idea, and we loved doing this!

The service was wonderful and friendly. I have high hopes for Chica, and will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas to try another meal here."}
{"text":"I loved this place so much that I came back two day after my first visit!  Their food is so tasty! And they have many different options.  The first time we ordered the arepas to share and they were so awesome! I am used to doing arepas at home but this was different, they had different flavors... I mean how awesome is that!? Being from Venezuela, I missed the nata! So it as a very nice addition to the arepas. Then I ordered the asado negro arepa and the empanadas... again so so tasty!!! The asado negro arepas were different from the arepa appetiZers... they had a sweet taste, and with the empanadas, you can never go wrong.  My friend had the shrimp and quinoa and loved it! 

2 days later I came back because i loved it,  and the hostess came to check how was my food and I let her know how much I liked it, and as a thanks I got a free marquesa dessert.  People at this restaurant were so nice!!! Literally I have no complains ..."}
{"text":"The office tried CHICA for a coworkers birthday and they didnt disappoint! We picked CHICA because they were participating in Restaurant Week on a slow Monday at noon. So we had a 3 course prefixed menu for $20! I had the asado negro arepas to start. Then for lunch I chose the meyer lemon rotisserie chicken with peruvian purple potato salad with a chimichurri sauce. You would think maybe the restaurant week meals would be small but I LITERALLY got a half of chicken! Last but not least, donuts were the only choice for dessert.

Reservations were easy to be placed. They asked if anyone in our group had any dietary restrictions. And even had a special birthday tiramisu made for my coworker!

Service: 5/5 We were seated as soon as we walked in. Had drinks within 5 minutes, older was taken and 10 minutes later we had our first course. We had a party of 8 and we were out within an hour. 

Food: 5/5 Everything we had was delicious! My chicken was perfectly cooked! It was so juicy! I wasn't a fan of the Peruvian potato salad but that's just my taste. And the donuts were crispy and fluffy.

Would I come back? Probably not. The menu is very overpriced. But I'm glad we were able to taste the menu for $20. Thank you restaurant week!"}
{"text":"We love going to Vegas and try tapas food. This place was the bomb! We got to taste several plates and it was more than enough food for two. Our waiter was very pleasant and He was on it. Too bad we don't remember his name! But thank you for your lovely service."}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Chica. I am working backwards in my reviews of our restaurant week visits and this was stop number 3 in #helpoutdineout week in Vegas. I had worked a half day and Josie decided she wanted to try a lunch spot for a change so we traveled to The Venetian for a nice lunch. I am a fan of Lorena Garcia and have been wanting to try this for a while and so has Josie. We had reservations and arrived early (of course) and were seated immediately. Drink orders were taken right away and delivered in a timely manner. The Coke and Diet Cokes come in a bottle and there is not an unlimited refill. The bottles are the Classic Coke style with the Diet Coke being smaller than the Original Coke bottle. I will post pictures in a few. Blanca was our waitress and was very informative. Very soft-spoken but very helpful with every question we had regarding our meals' components. 
The decor and layout is very quaint. You can sit at the front bar or at one of two other areas that have raised seating. one is where the prepare the salads and cold apps, the other where the rotisserie chicken is prepared as well as some hot apps. 
The lunch menu was simple with rather easy things to choose from.  
First course was a salad round with a Kale salad and a classic ceviche and chica fries. We opted for the Kale salad and civiche. Kale salad was had by Josie and had green apples dried cranberries, Napa cabbage, croutons and a citrus vinaigrette. This salad was piled high and presented very nicely. had a crisp clean citrus tang almost like a key lime pie flavor. apples were subtle and cabbage had a nice crisp bite to it. This alone could be a meal. My civiche had halibut, corn, red onions and cilantro. also accompanied with peruvian chips. (plantain chips) all sat in leche le tigre. Second course Cuban sandwich for me and Shrimp & quinoa cazuela. I will start with my Cuban Sandwich. I was expecting a small portion due to it being a lunch menu, it was not. Wonderfully cooked with the pressed grill marks on what they said was a sweet roll. Mojo pork, Smoked ham,Guayanes cheese, Dijon mustard and sweet pickles. As you bite into the sandwich you get the sweet taste of the roll with the bite of Dijon with the Mojo (vinegary) taste of the pork and the smokiness of the ham. Cheese just melty, salty and soft to the palet. Yes, i loved this sandwich. She also brought this Pablano spread for my fries that was much better than any ranch could ever be. Josie had the Shrimp Quinoa. Red shrimp perfectly cooked over a red quinoa and the same cheese as my Cuban. Shrimp was seasoned with a slight tangy bite. Quinoa was properly cooked with a hint of cilantro and pablano pico. Final course was Lemon Bunuelos with served with a wild berry compote. So donut holes filled with lemon and a berry jelly. Not filling which was fine since we will be going to Carlos Bakery while in the Venetian. Nice zesty sweet bite to end a great lunch.
Thank you for dining at Chica. we will most definitely dine here again for a dinner menu. Everything from the very start was exceptional. I am slow to give out five starts but this gets them. Blanca was an excellent host on our lunch adventure and made this experience worth it. . Only negative is the non unlimited drink refills. If you get the chance head on over and experience this excellent dining spot."}
{"text":"Really yummy, great selection of cocktails (some like it hot was so good!!), wonderful service from Oscar, and plenty of food options for everyone in your group. The steak and kale salad was delicious and filling, bit I recommend getting a side of the house pickles to go with the salad because it really took it up a notch flavor-wise. 

The decor is so beautiful and not at all gaudy like most Vegas restaurants. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but its just on the edge for me. The service was ok, but it felt as though our server was a bit stretched out across too many tables, not his fault. Food did take a little longer to come out than we hoped considering its tapas style. Restaurant has a great ambience and modern feel, its closer to venetian in restaurant row.

By far the best dishes we had on the menu were the empanadas and the octopus. We ended up re ordering both. Empanadas could have used just a touch more of the pico de gallo, excellent combo. The short rib arepas had good flavor, but the arepas themselves were a bit on the doughy side. 
For a main dish we got the porchetta - on the fattier side and had a great outer crust. The rest of the dish was meh, it was all fried! Fried brussel sprouts and a fried yuca hash. The dish really needed a hit of acid or sweetness to balance it out and less things fried. Wouldn't order that again.
For dessert the churro lollipops were like a deconstructed version of churros with ice cream in the middle and a nice velvety whipped cream. 
Overall there were a few really memorable dishes. If you come here the octopus and empanadas are a must get. Will definitely be returning. 
Solid 4.5/5"}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good!! Everything is fresh and delicious. I'm from Brazil so I can tell for sure that they make the best caipirinhas I ever had in USA!"}
{"text":"Chica is oddly placed in the Venetian (not located along restaurant row), but on the second floor of the casino next door to Yardbirds. 

We were excited to try this upscale Latin cuisine / place after hearing that Chef Lorena Garcia (seen on Bravo, Top Chef). We made reservations in advance, and got wonderful seats upon arrival. The natural sunlight from the center room with wrought iron surrounding the restaurant will surely catch your eye, as well as the other rooms that transition to dimly lit. 

We ordered a few items: 
 
1. The Tamarind Colada and Bloody Mary to start. This cocktail was soooo expensive for its size. $16 if I'm not mistaken. Delicious, but a little expensive for my taste and it was loaded with loads of crushed ice.  Bloody Mary: Very, very short glass / contents with a plantain and and odd cube of cheese? 

2. Next up: The empanadas. This was quite disappointing (sad face). The pastry dough was too thin, hard and the ingredients very bland. We mentioned this to the waitress, but she just apologized. 

3. Brunch items:  Grits, egg and chorizo. This was definitely the star. The grits were made in-house and had a porridge like consistency. Eggs bene with pancetta on arepas: This was quite dry and lacked flavor. Tostado with egg: This was just okay. It had so many black beans, that I was missing the other listed ingredients. 

4. Dessert: Venezuelan chocolate mousse cake: Very nice. We enjoyed the small dark drizzles of chocolate, and raspberry. Churro Pops:  Not sure why they emphasize \"churros\" when the real star of the dish are the pops (similar to cheese cake rolled in churro dust). The churro sticks were a little disappointing as well. Thin, small and just okay. 

5. 12 oz coffee in a carafe: The chartreuse carafe was adorable, but the coffee was nothing special. And they only offered half and half in the kitchen. What?! No soy for a $12 priced carafe?

Overall, I love the beautiful ambience, and the service, but the price was a bit over the top for the amount of food and beverages received. Our total was $135 (not including tip) for 3 people eating brunch. Hoping to give this place another try, but for now, I'll give this place 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Pretty great. It's nice to see some character in the food being offered in the Casinos. The originality of their offerings is refreshing. Everything on the menu that I tried was great. Service was really good too. I would give it five stars if the prices were a bit more reasonable on the appetizers and desserts. It really was quite amazing and I am looking forward to going there the next time I am in the Venetian or Palazzo. I hope this place sticks around."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in our experience here. I recently heard of this place and with the great reviews and unique menu, we decided to try this out for our group New Years dinner. Honestly, one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. I will say the location is great, decor is beautiful!

But the dining experience itself was absolutely terrible. We had a group of 7 people. We ordered several appetizers, we received one appetizer for the entire table and waited at least 15 mins for the remaining appetizers to arrive (although several of them were easy things like chips and guacamole or chips and salsa). Then we received our entrees. Two of my friends had ordered steak and both were completely cold when they arrived. They notified the server who said she would bring new steaks for them. Another person ordered corn which did not seem fully cooked when received. My boyfriend and I ordered a side dish of rice which the menu said had \"fried rice, beans, and topped with fresh avocados\". Halfway through eating the rice I realized there were small pieces of pork in there.... I'm a vegetarian and my boyfriend is a kosher jewish and so obviously doesn't eat pork. The pork absolutely was not called out on the menu. Also there was edamame in the rice which was not called out. And instead of fresh avocados, there was a scoop of guacamole. I notified the server and she said \"really? That's not on the menu?\" I checked again to be sure, not called out at all. She asked if I wanted it remade, and I said absolutely since neither of us eat pork. That should not even be a question. The two steaks then arrived but it was clear they had just been cooked a little longer and replated, it was so awful one of the guys just asked to send his plate back. By that point every one else had pretty much finished their meals: my new rice dish came when we were done eating. Absolutely nothing was done to remedy the dishes that were wrong, except they comped the one steak that had been sent back. I am shocked at this service and extremely disappointed"}
{"text":"Restaurant week is an amazing time of year where many eateries in Vegas offer set menus at discounted prices and donate part of the price to 3Square Food Bank. After surveying some of the options online, we were drawn in to Chica's for a nice Sunday lunch. We made reservations before hand, so, though crowded (brunch + FIFA), we were easily able to get a table. Initially I was worried because the music inside is really loud. We were sat in the back, which made it better but still a bit much. Our servers Jack and Amarie were excellent. Very social and friendly. The food was all amazing. My first course was the empenadas. Cooked to perfection. I wish it came with more than 2. Next, the Cuban sandwich. Amazing! I'm not a huge meat eater, but there was literally no flaw with this sandwich. Lots of meat, cheese, and Dijon mustard with a side of fries. My friend got the rotisserie chicken with purple potatoes. Sadly, she did not experience the same food ecstasy as I did, as both potato and chicken were underseasoned. It ended with a dessert of lemon donuts (more like donut holes). They were served on top of a berry sauce that made me want to lick the plate. Not too sweet and not too tart. Chica you have my attention, now take my money."}
{"text":"I sat down at the bar around 545p on a Wednesday. It was fairly slow. Bartender did not pay any attention at all. I asked a barback for menus & he gave me water. 

I continued to look at the menu for 15 minutes before the bartender came around to check on me. 
I ordered a glass of wine. By that time my friend had joined me at the bar. 

Things were way better when Jessica the bartender started her shift. She was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. She made some excellent recommendations. 

My friend n I enjoy a few appetizers and couple glasses of wine. The apps were full of flavor. My favorite was the octopus. I didn't really care for the chicharones, it had good flavor but it was like eating dry fried chicken. 

The menu is quit pricey though. Too bad they do not have a happy hour."}

Unimpressed by Db Brasserie from the start, the eventual shutter little more than a protracted death march after the kitchen switched Chefs in an attempt to recover from the mistake of treating Las Vegas as if it was a one-off town willing to settle for a mish-mash greatest hits compellation rather than an original idea, it was with high hopes that the space could shine under the management of 50Eggs that friends and family was attended at Chica, the service an unmitigated disaster even for a trial run while the food was mostly good, though much showed room for improvement.

Fresh off of almost unprecedented success with Yardbird Southern Table & Bar, not even a couple of changes in the kitchen slowing business for a restaurant that remains full at nearly two-and-a-half-years in, Chica is touted to \"give guests the opportunity to explore the flavors of Latin American cuisine as one culture\" with a menu from Lorena Garcia featuring \"influences from Venezuela, Peru, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, among many more,\" the decision to hire former Border Grill Chef Mike Minor to head a restaurant \"boasting the first Latina chef on the Las Vegas Strip\" seemingly an odd choice regardless his skills.

Now open just over six weeks, presumably enough time to iron out most kinks when considering the fact that Yardbird was on-point from week one, Saturday Brunch saw Chica at perhaps 25% capacity while its sister property was predictably out the door, the hostess at the podium retrieving a reservation as if she was surprised before handing three guests off to another young woman who led them through a maze of obstacles to a table against the back-right wall.

Featuring a Full-bar, Ceviche station and Rotisserie/Grilling area amidst stylish décor dotted in pots, books, plants and metal sculptures, the music overhead ranging from Shakira and Santana to older Mexican ballads, it was shortly after sitting that a young woman approached the table with a cocktail list, menus and three types of Coffee, a lengthy description of their origins and flavor notes apparently commanding $12 for a two-person French Press featuring an admittedly smooth brew out of Peru with subdued spice and lingering fruity notes.

Opting to defer menu choices to Chef Minor, only the Octopus, Tres Leches and a Watermelon-infused Lemonade for the youngster specifically requested, it was after greetings from Mike as well as the daytime Manager that the meal got underway, the \"Grilled Peruvian Octopus\" quite undercooked and thus rubbery despite being well flavored, the Shishito Peppers actually stealing the spotlight as they were served charred but not too spicy amidst toasted Grains and Yellow Pepper Sauce.

Perhaps making a mistake in returning for Brunch, the limitations of a this meal frequently stressed by in-the-know diners, it was by plate two that trouble was first sensed, the \"California Red Flint Grits\" with Eggs, Chorizo and Tomato Ragu about as 'Latin' as the Shrimp n' Grits next-door while the Chicken & Waffle seemed unapologetically ridiculous considering not only Yardbird but Chica's theme...even a nine year-old wondering aloud if people eat Waffles in Mexico, before also pointing out that although the Chicken was \"really juicy,\" the Waffle was \"too dry.\"

Finding the sweet half of the menu a bit more interesting than savories, though a thin stack of Johnny Cakes with Berries and Cream has a long way to go before matching those at HeXX, Lorena's \"Award Winning\" Lemon Donuts were offered gratis by Chef Minor before moving on to the meal's three best plates, the crispy Churros piped with Espresso Cream alongside Cherries soaked in Syrup a suitable replacement for those previously offered at Art of Flavors as Las Vegas' best while the lighter-than-it-sounds French Toast with Dulce de Leche Drizzle is a great share-plate for just $14, especially since most will have no interest in sharing the sopping wet Tres Leches Cake served in a bowl with plenty of sweetened Milk and a topping of Toasted Meringue that is mellowed out my diced Fruit and Tajin."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience in this place. Food was delicious, they have multiple options for latin food. They have a bit of everything. Drinks were also amazing and servers were helpful, kind and fun. 
Would definitely coming back to this place any time I go back to Vegas. Hopefully very soon! 100% recommended."}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas this is a must do place! The food was amazing, beyond my expectations, service was  extra ordinary! Music, lounge, dance!Talking about perfection when you get a combination of great food and service, now days is either one or the other! 

Michael GM, servers, and waitresses, gave us plenty of food suggestions, and drinks. I guarantee you wouldn't leave hungry.

Best quality! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was super flavorful! We were super impressed with their menu and drinks. We will be returning back for 4th if July and looking forward to trying different dishes"}
{"text":"Service is good and waiters are knowledgeable about the restaurant's products. Came in with a group of five and we were able to share three appetizers, three entrees and two deserts between all of us and were relatively satisfied. 

We had:
Chicken chicharones
Empanadas
Caesar Salad with chicken
Rotisserie chicken
Slow-braised short rib
Pork porchetta
Then the tres leches and the chocalate desserts

All-in-all, food was good except for anything chicken related. It was white meat, sure, but still too dry even for chicken breast (overcooked), especially for a description that said \"famed\" rotisserie chicken. Good food other than those with strip prices."}
{"text":"I loved the environment there as well as the different flavors or all Latin areas from Oaxaca, Mexico to Peru! Got to meet Lorena Garcia there and she made our experience super enjoyable after hearing I wanted to meet her! The food was amazing!"}
{"text":"The salsa trio, juevos rancheros, empanadas and Dulce de leche French toast were all amazing. The restaurant was pretty empty for Saturday brunch- we were seated right away. The service was great, food came out quickly, the Manzana sangria was delicious... the only complaint on the table was that the portion size was small for the juevos rancheros (only one egg). They even gave me a small piece of cake for my birthday and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place was cute, I'm not one to really go to many restaurants on the strip because they're overpriced but I've been wanting to check out Chica for a bit now. my friend and I went to see a show and decided to come here after. To start the service was amazing. I wish I remembered our servers name but she was really sweet and attentive to our experience. She had great suggestions and I even let her pick my margarita flavor and she came with a passion fruit and pineapple margarita (I think). Lol. We started off with the guacamole, I loved the plantain chips & baby arepas that came with it ! nice change from the typical chips and guac. It was strong with lime with is something that I actually love. we also had the empanadas which were ok. I could've gone without. They're good but not the best. for our entrees my friend had the chicken dish and I had the braised short rib. Both had a super cute presentation and tasted amazing. We had the tres leches dessert at the end and my girl inhaled it. Needless to say she loved it. Haha In total it was a great experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant has very good Ceviche and Octopus for starter. I was here for breakfast so most of the main dish were breakfast. I wish that I was here for lunch I think that would be better. Overall, the food are very tasty. The customer service  is very professional. My glass of water was always filled. I never have to ask them for a refill. The most amazing thing is that the worker there are very courteous. For instance, different waiter/waitress  would come to refill my water and they are not even the person that help me with my orders . It's a very welcoming environment and I definitely will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Vegas, Vegas, vegas.... 

I love this place! It was amazing! We went for brunch! The ambiance is super chill and so beautifully decorated! The wait staff is super attentive and helpful! 

The food is amazing !!!!! We ordered the street corn and a basket of mini arepas to start! Both were to die for. The arepas were all different flavors like blue corn, beet and original, and the corn was spicy and salty! Sooo good! Then I ordered the chicken and waffles, which were amazing. The chicken was rotisserie style, the waffle was a 5-spice waffle and there were Peruvian peppers and agave syrup on it! It is a MUST try!  Also ordered were the hash and eggs and the chipotle chicken omelet. All were tasty and delicious ! 

This place is awesome, I recommend it to anyone and everyone visiting ! Brunch was amazing, I'd love to go back to try lunch or dinner! 

Happy Eating !

{"text":"Went to Chica for lunch during Restaurant Week and was really impressed. My husband and I bot. Tried the Ceviche which was the favorite thing we tried on the menu. He got the shrimp and quinoa and I got the Cuban sandwich and we both really enjoyed them. Cocktails were great too."}
{"text":"Went here with a bachelorette party. The food was delicious, interesting, and the service was good. The espresso filled churros were a fun brunch appetizer! 
I tried a few of my friends dishes and everything was good. 
I appreciated the atmosphere, its modern, fun, and classy. The restaurant is broken up into smaller spaces with semi-transparent walls so you don't feel as if you're sitting in a massive, open banquet room."}
{"text":"Came for lunch solo. Enjoyed the guacamole and a watercress Salad.  Guacamole was good . The star was the plantain chips.  Croutons on the salad were on the bottom so I didn't find them until well thru the salad. I found that odd. Salad was so lightly dressed almost too lightly dressed as I couldn't taste the salad dressing. Service excellent. Atmosphere excellent."}
{"text":"The good is amazing. For starters the octopus was fabulous. The Brazilian steak with grits and cauliflower   amazing. And for desert buñuelos with white chocolate."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised by this place, located in the Venetian. Came in a Saturday afternoon to enjoy some Olympic with a couple of girlfriends, and we were being indecisive over a bottle of wine. Instead of being annoyed with us, bartender was happy to let us a try a couple different ones until we settled on one we liked. Fab service and such a fun vibe.

Huuugeeee screen for enjoying sports, but fun wines to choose from. Perfect for what we were, girls who love hockey and wine!"}
{"text":"Great food, great experience.  Service was on point.  Ordered  the Peruvian Ceviche , Octopus and the Braised short ribs.  My wife and I really enjoyed the food.  We'll definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Best dining experience on our most recent trip!  We came here just before 11am on a weekday when they were making the transition between breakfast and lunch.  We were told we could order from either the breakfast or lunch menu for that reason, but we were only given lunch menus.  That was fine by me as I was planning on trying one of their lunch sandwiches.  First of all, let me say that I love the decor at Chica!  It's just really, really pretty, even the restrooms, too!  It was so nice to have this beautiful restaurant almost all to ourselves for the beginning part of our meal.  What also makes this place top-notch is their service.  Our water glasses never went empty.  More importantly, Shawna took good care of us during our meal, and this was the only restaurant on our whole trip that actually acknowledged that we were celebrating a birthday.  Thank you, Shawna and Chica, for showing that your customers are appreciated!  

The food didn't disappoint either.  I had their Cuban sandwich which was good - my favorite parts were the bread and cheese.  (I usually don't eat the type of meat that comes in a Cuban sandwich but wanted to try it anyway.)  I also liked my fries which I had with a creamy topping and bacon bits.  My dining companion had the shrimp tacos which she said were delicious and that she liked more than my sandwich which I let her taste.  For her birthday she got a complimentary single serving of their churro pops topped off with a birthday candle and a happy birthday greeting spelled out on the plate.  I wanted to taste it too, so we placed an order for a full serving and it was absolutely tasty!  

Overall, it was a great dining experience, and we look forward to coming back and having another meal at Chica :)"}
{"text":"It was a pleasant surprise. Food was good service was excellent and the music was great. They need to work a little bit more on flavor and portions were too small."}
{"text":"I ordered your classic new York strip steak. Asked for medium rare and in return got medium well. After my food got dropped off my waiter did not check up on me until I was almost done eating. It was not busy. From what I saw, they had a good handful of tables. Beside the negativity, the front of the house staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Came in here for some light dranks. Wish we time to eat but we loved the ambiance!

FW Marg.... fuego! We did not like the Some Like It Hot but our girl/bartender Elizabet was the absolute bestest. Gave us little samples."}
{"text":"Amazing Latin cuisine. My music played through all day!! Order the Peruvian shrimp tamale ...a must! Service was a little hectic because of CES being in town. Don't leave without trying the lemon doughnuts"}
{"text":"OMG... it was freaking amazing. We had the Asado Negro Arepas to start. Then we shared the Meyer Lemon Rotisserie Chicken and the Braised Short Ribs we also requested the Mac Con Queso. We finished with the Arriz Con Leche, the lemon donuts and the Tres Leche Cake. We washed it down with a bottle of Malbec and the night was complete. I strongly recommend a trip to The Venetian for this delicious dining room experience!  Mia, our server, was very knowledgeable and absolutely fantastic! My complements to the chef, Lorena Garcia you are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy!! The environment, the customer service, the drinks, and the food is amazing. P.s the waiters are cute too haha it's an added bonus"}
{"text":"This is an amazing and gorgeous Latin fusion restaurant. The place is stunning for one. And two the level of service and food quality were hands down winners. Our server Monica was fantastic. She made our night so fun! The nice gestures of complimentary Cava and dessert didn't go unnoticed! Our cocktails were so good. I highly recommend the FW Margarita if you're a watermelon fan as it's a really refreshing twist on a margarita and not tart or acidic, just well balanced. The tuna ceviche and beef arepas were perfect since they were distinctly different, one light and one a bit heavier. And my Pumpkin seed and herb crusted lamb was freaking off the charts. The meat was great quality and cooked exactly to order. We couldn't have asked for a better final dinner to end our Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"This is one of the newest restaurants at the Venetian.  It boosts fusions from South American food to include Mexican.  We had their version of fries, rice and beans, the short ribs, the octopus, and the ceviche.  We were very happy with the food, but our favorite was the octopus.  It was so tender and perfectly cooked.  The short ribs were good, but I thought it was slightly bland.  Maybe I'm more used to short ribs that are marinaded more strongly.  The service was also impeccable.  I'd highly recommend this restaurant.  I also think it's a great date restaurant because it's fun, lively, and there are many shareable plates."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! If you've had great calamari, have the octopus. It makes your great calamari seem like water; it's beyond delicious! The tuna ceviche is crazy good as well! And their specialty cocktails are amazingly tasty! Have Beau mix you up a spectacular drink. Atmosphere is chill and the service is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Our meal was delicious. With only a couple of nights in las vegas we wanted to choose right and some place we dont normally go. Im so glad we chose right.
The service was excellent. The meal (grilled octopus app and short rib and popin hose rice entree) was excellent. I walked in not looking to be amazed by the food because lately I have not been impressed with restaurants but I was. My margherita was too strong and our server had them fix it up to perfection. Would dine again if on that part of the strip."}
{"text":"Went with my hubby here ordered to drink the chica-rita and I had a blueberry sangria each was about 15$, they were both tiny drinks. The sangria did give me a buzz though. I ordered the shrimp tacos, 2 in the order, came with black beans n pickled veggies. Weren't that great. For appetizer the corn lolipops ...good but they were missing a hot sauce drizzled on top. ? Paid about 80$ for everything, would probably not return. Maybe for a sangria lol. P"}
{"text":"We come to Chica every time we are in Vegas. The food here never ceases to exceed my expectations. The octopus appetizer is to die for and you can't go wrong with any of the entrees. I recommend the porchetta and the short rib entree. And definitely order the Arepas! Overall great experience with great food.  

The food is always amazing and it is always just an overall good experience thanks to the staff. Patricia really made our latest experience something special and we will definitely be coming back next time we are here! Thank you Patricia for being thoughtful with the birthday celebrations and for making it memorable. This made our trip to Vegas. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We wanted something light and quick without a reservation, they got us in at a bar seat. Drinks were quick and refreshing. We ate from small appetite menu, pork tacos was delicious, beef empanadas hit the spot perfect for two of us."}
{"text":"Advertising got us into this place; we saw an ad outside the canal shops. Boy, were we glad we went! Everything we tried was delicious. Fresh, flavorful takes on tapas perfect for sharing. Service was amazing as was the atmosphere. Will definitely return here and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Overall service was very good. We came for NYE. Ambiance was relaxed - not super uppity, you can go there to hang out and enjoy dinner. They don't rush at all. Music is outstanding. 

Food is a combination of flavors from South America. Peruvian corn and cheese was my personal favorite, but everything on the menu is delicious. Plantains were good, standard. The cheese fries were good but a little on the spicier side - freshly made cheese for sure. The salsas and arepas were delicious. Chiccarones were very good as well. The salads were awesome. The elotes were normal, it's on the cob so not as easy to eat or flavorful. 

Desserts were the highlight. Do not miss the churros. Mind-blowing dessert all around - the merengue, ice cream, cinnamon and flavors mingled perfectly. We also did the lemon donuts (a little dry but very good - not as lemony as expected). The tres leches was good as well. 

Would come back!"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of Lorena Garcia so I had not planned to eat at this restaurant.  We happened to walk by and since we have had such horrible experiences already and quite frankly did not wanted to walk any more, we decided to go in.  To my surprise, this restaurant turned out to be the best dinner we had in Las Vegas in the whole week.  The service was good, not outstanding but good.  The main reason why it was not outstanding is because it was a little slow.  The restaurant was almost empty and the waiter was a little slow.  The food took a while to get out, but when it got out it was worth the wait.  Everything was pipping hot and it looked like it came out of a magazine.  Their pictured dish is a pepita crusted lamb and when my son got his meal it looked exactly as it looks on the picture. My other son ordered the Braised Short Rib and it was melting in your mouth soft.  It came with black eye peas prepared two ways, and those peas were OUTSTANDING!.  I ordered the Chicken Chicharrones and the Arepa Basket.  These were extremele flavorfull, very fresh and cooked to perfection.  My husband ordered the Crab and Shrimp salpicon.  It was very flavorful, but compared to the rest it was completely insignificant.  We did not have dessert because the portions were too generous and unfortunately there was no space left to eat dessert.  

I always find flaws in the food, but I could not find a single flaw in any of those dishes."}
{"text":"while the food is excellent, the management style leaves a lot to be desired. Every morsel arrived perfect delicious & tasty  however the Meyer lemon chicken arrived so salty it was in edible. Reluctantly we told the waiter about the situation. He apologized and offered another entrée. At that point, we had already had appetizers, and drinks and I just simply asked for another one of the short rib appetizers. The waiter offered to comp the chicken and replace it with that appetizer - all  free of charge. When the manager came by, he apologized and remarked that others too  said the chicken was too salty. when the bill came we were charged for the chicken and the appetizer! Then they only offered to comp one of the appetizers. After we asked about the confusing bill they then only offered to comp our least expensive appetizer and charge us for the chicken! so while they saved $10 for three empanadas, they served three people who would tell 15 others each that it was not a good experience. I ask you, was that a good management move? as good as the food is would not recommend."}
{"text":"With all the choices available on the strip, it's tough for me to find a restaurant to get excited about.  When a friend wanted to try Chica, I investigated and achieved excitement:

1st - I can't immediately recall an upscale Latin cuisine on the strip, so this is a first.
2nd - head chef Lorena Garcia is a culinary superstar (TV spots from Top Chef Masters and America's Next Great Restaurant)
3rd - I love tacos.

Stepping inside you'll find the decor is stunningly beautiful.  The tiles, the artwork, and even the pottery, everything was considered to bring out the Venezuelan, Argentinian, Peruvian, Brazilian, and Mexican flavor.  The lighting is a very dim atmosphere, which sets up the nightlife - Next to the huge bar at the entrance is space for a DJ and a little dance floor which packs up on the weekends, says our server... we were here at 5pm on a Saturday and it was mostly empty.  GOOD, they can focus more on our food :)

Appetizers:
Pulled Pork Tacos ($12) - three street style tacos - take notice of the yummy, soft, doughy, housemade tortilla
Empanadas ($15) - three compact breaded delights with a light crunchy surface
*Asado Negro Arepas ($13) - three housemade arepas with braised short rib *my fave of the three apps

Entree:
Brazilian Beef Tenderloin ($52) - ordered it a Medium cook which came out a little rare, but it was perfect.  That incredible meat was harmoniously matched with the underlying grits.

They have great specialty cocktails too, I went with their twist on an old fashioned, Rhum New Fashioned ($15), always good. 

There's a lot more food I wanted to try: the ceviche, the octopus, rotisserie chicken, halibut, lamb... I'll have to come back again soon.

(TLDR) Beef Tenderloin and the Arepas stood out as the highlights of the meal."}
{"text":"A friend and I had brunch here Sunday and the place was about 20% full. Food was decent and so was the service. Reasons for -2 stars are..

Cornbread Pancakes were burnt and our server the gal with the short hair didn't check on us after the food was dropped off. Also sunny side up eggs were overcooked.

Tip: get the french toast"}
{"text":"For a group of 20ish people, we had a $40/per person quota/minimum to hit to make a reservation for Sunday brunch and we struggled (half of the group didn't drink but went along with it for convenience and to be troopers). Not sure if the reservation was entirely necessary as the place didn't seem that crowded, but when you're rolling that deep, sometimes it's better to have concrete plans rather than wing it.

We started with a couple of sweet brunch dishes for the table to share (pancakes, French toast, churros). Those seemed to be the favorites of the dining experience and maybe if we had stopped there, the meal would have been a hit. Drinks were brought out intermittently throughout our time there, but not necessarily in the order they were ordered. The staff helping the main server seemed to be more efficient in getting drinks expeditiously than when ordered directly from the server, which is odd, but you bob and weave accordingly, especially when you're trying to help tip the tab in the right direction.

When the entrees came out, I can say with all certainty that no one had a real \"this is amazing\" look on their face, in fact, two of the girls that ordered chicken and waffles were practically crying, as Chica's version is rotisserie chicken on top of waffles that are drenched in some kind of grilled peppers/onion concoction. Granted, that might be spelled out on the menu, so prob user error on their part, but still! I had fish tacos and they were hearty, but lacking any outstanding flavor. Another girl got ceviche and it was more like soup de ceviche. I liked it, but she was disappointed since she was expecting something more traditional.

Our server had different attitudes with us throughout the meal...sometimes he was hot, sometimes he was cold. I understand it's a big group, but I don't think we were too demanding or rowdy, so not sure why we got Jekyll & Hyde.

All in all, a decent enough experience to warrant three stars, but I don't think worth the $40/person price tag for brunch."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great find.  Not being able to get a table at Bouchon was the best thing that could happen to us.  This restaurant is top notch, We're so glad we were able to eat here.   The food is beyond amazing,  every single dish was amazing!  The service here was incredible, every single employee seemed like they really enjoy their jobs, that how you know it is a great pace to eat.  Congrats to the amazing chef and crew of this restaurant, couldn't have had a better place to have an memorable dinner I won't ever forget.  I'm already looking forward to my next meal there."}
{"text":"A wonderful addition to restaurant row at the Palazzo / Venetian! So welcoming. The best guacamole in the world! It has small warm masa cakes, plantains and chips. Desserts are amazing too. An outstanding foodie experience !"}
{"text":"Decent food but overpriced even by Las Vegas standards.  Servings were small and not very interesting.  The fries I ate off my husbands plate were very good.   Much petter than my bland and slightly wilted salad

."}
{"text":"I highly recommend to my friends and family.  Very nice upscale atmosphere.  Different latin dishes.  Love  the wonderful customer service. Love aguacate, arepa. De beets, spinish. Pollo criollo. Las mariquitas, y todo delicioso y excellent.  Mi Amigo Chef Ramiro y Jaime me lo recomendaron vine ala semana de apertura. Este sera mi favorito en vegas no mas oceans,"}
{"text":"Ask for Oscar! I've never received such good service in my life (not even in other countries). Amazing food with very high quality ingredients and a lot of vegetarian options that Oscar shared with us. He also gave us extra plantain chips since our little one loves it so much. We had a really spicy drink that I wish I could replicate at home. The music is so nice and upbeat and loud enough to enjoy but not too loud where you can hear each other. Could not ask for a better restaurant for a night out in Vegas. 

Coming back again for brunch. Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent good and atmosphere!  I had the kale salad, ceviche, Chica fries, the Cuban sandwich and lemon donuts for desert.  The Cuban was the best I ever ate!  We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Everything we ate was incredible and perfectly cooked; and the drinks were delicious and strong. The space is very pretty; both romantic and cool with good Latin music playing. It seemed to pick up in the bar area later in the evening."}
{"text":"We loved Chica! The watermelon margarita was fantastic. I would skip dessert and have more of these. The corn lollipop appetizer was dreamy. We also loved the guacamole, all three salsas, and tuna ceviche. My friends loved the chicken entree. It did look better than any I've seen. I really liked my shrimp and quinoa but, next time would likely try the halibut. I would skip dessert and spend more calories on cocktails or appetizers. The Service Staff was charming. They were very professional, confident, attentive, and enjoyable. I wish them great success."}
{"text":"Very confused as to how this restaurant has 4.5 stars. Ordered the chopped salad and added chicken. Salad was basic lettuce and one strawberry, two slices of a pepper, and one tablespoon of chopped jicama. A $20 salad that wasn't as good as a salad from a fast food restaurant. Husband ordered burger and had the same sentiment. Thin tasteless patty. Service was average."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite at lunch and enjoyed classic Peruvian ceviche with a Pisco Sour to wash it down!  Reminded me of my trip to Peru last year...food and fond memories!"}
{"text":"Very refreshing!

IN Vegas, GOOD PRICES for EXCELLENT FOOD and a UNIQUE concept!

Our first time here, and we were very impressed."}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious. We had the ceviche, grilled octopus, fish tacos and Chica Burger. Totally recommend all of it. The fries that came with the burger had some spice that was incredible. Can't wait for a return. Service was great. Beer was good. Leaving this place feeling awesome. Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Went to Vegas for the first time and with all the Restaurant choices, it's hard to pick one! But I highly recommend Chica!!
Located in the Venetian, it's a good area - just off Restaurant row and outside of St. Marks square. 
I went with a large group so we ordered lots of appetizers - the grilled octopus was unbelievable, with a spicy sauce and peppers, the octopus was grilled perfectly. The guacamole was amazing and there are great other sauces and corn dips - the plantain chips are awesome. The ceviche is great too - few different types you can get, all amazing. 
The steak is to die for, the lamb is fabulous and the halibut are all great entree choices. 
The churro ice cream dessert is so good - all of the desserts I tried were great, can't go wrong. 
Overall, i would come back!! Above any other place I dined - great ambiance, lovely service and the best food!!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday since I was strolling around the Venetian and came across this place! The wait wasn't too bad around 1pm (probably 25 minutes max). This place serves a variety of Latin American cuisines including tapas, tacos and burgers! It's standard pricing for Vegas. I ordered the brisket tacos and I didn't feel that they tasted anything out of the ordinary. Service was okay, but I thought it was really awesome for the server to ask my party right away if we have any allergies or items that we don't enjoy eating. However, the portions are on the smaller side so it's perfect to have lunch there if you don't want lug any leftovers around!"}
{"text":"Incredible guac and plantain chips. The mini tacos were delish but the chicken chicharrones were more trouble than they were worth."}
{"text":"Overall, very happy with our experience. IMO, one of the better restaurants in the Venetian/Palazzo area. Don't you get tired of the same ol' steak/bar/Italian restaurant scheme? I had dinner reservations at 530pm with my 80 year old grandmother - we had a phenomenal experience with waitress Monica* and busser Carlos*. Monica took time to teach grandma about tequila, gave us great food recommendations and fantastic /friendly service. 

The food was interesting, and delicious. We had the Mac Con Queso and Halibut but the Grilled Peruvian Octopus*****, Porchetta with Yuca Hash**** are highly recommended."}
{"text":"We had 3 apps for lunch Pulpo was good, chicken was really really too salty and we have no issues with salt. Fried squid poorly breaded, soggy and greasy, Desert was good. Prices were OK but will not be back as the Grand Lux is much better."}
{"text":"You have to try this place!  We stopped for breakfast and had the steak breakfast tacos and the burrito.  They were both fantastic and had their own separate flavors.  We also had dinner.  The service at the bar was not as good as I had hoped, but don't let it stop you from dining here.  The tres leches was also amazing!  Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here and had terrible experience with the service both times. I don't care how good the food is, the manager there was a joke. First she told us we couldn't use the free appetizer voucher that was issued by the hotel and the hotel \"doesn't know anything\" her words, because they are 2 separate companies, and then told us we need to have minimum of $10 purchase, which we did: me and my boyfriend each had $20 restaurant week tasting menu. We truly didn't care about the $13 appetizer, but she was so feisty about the whole situation that we felt like our dining experience was completely ruined. Her last word was: I will take care of this, but I just want you to know that you weren't supposed to use this, and then she stormed away. What a great job to take care of your customers! I would never come back here again because of the treatment we received, and I recommend anyone to stay away."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch places in Las Vegas. I love my Cuban coffee there, eggs benny, and corn pancakes. I think the staff sometimes wonders how this tiny girl eats all this food... lol"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends and the service was pretty bad. We were seated over a loud speaker which made it difficult for us the have a conversation.  Two people ordered cocktails. It took about 10 minutes to get the drinks and unfortunately both were overly sweetened. Luckily I stuck with water. 

The meals were hit or miss. The octopus appetizer was delicious but the chicken chicharron wasn't chicharron at all but just small chicken wings. They tasted fine but wasn't what we were expecting. The Mac con queso was confusing. We thought in addition to corn there would be \"Mac\" but there was no Mac. The Meyer lemon chicken was good but a bit over salted. The Chica fries were delicious. If I were to go back I'd only get the fries and octopus. Overall it was a pretty over priced place for the quality."}
