{"text":"This place is a frikking DUMP.  The place is dirty and smells bad, the customers are low-lifes, and the bartenders are too!  

Is the food good?  If you have never been outside of Ambridge then it must taste pretty good.  But it's the same crud ALL local bars sell.

WINGS, people!!!  They taste the same everywhere."}
{"text":"25 cent wings on Tues and Thurs. 
Shitty karaoke and beer any other day. Their ranch bacon fries are awesome btw."}
{"text":"Great food, not just for a bar but for anywhere. Great wings available every day but their wing nights are both Tuesday and Thursday! Awesome Pittsburgh style sandwiches and the best fries outside of Kennywoods potatoe patch. The only disappointment here was the steak salad which was only diced iceberg. I don't think the cook that night had ever eaten a salad, but it is a bar in an old mill town after all.  Service is much better when the owners are present."}
{"text":"When we moved to the area recently, we asked our new neighbors where to get good wings, and Talerico's was the only place that got mentioned more than once. They weren't wrong.

The place seems sketchy as hell from the outside, and parking is either in the street or in a lot across the street. The first time we went, I nearly backed out because we had our ten year old daughter with us and it seemed like a bad place for kids. I'm glad I didn't leave, though, and we've since been back many times.

The servers were very nice and friendly, and the wings were fantastic-- crispy, even in the sauce, hot, and juicy, not all dried out like some wing places get. The wings are good enough that we haven't bothered to really try the rest of the menu, but the appetizers are solid, and, really, if you're going here, you're probably going for wings anyway.

Tip: the servers will report, if asked, that the bacon-cheese-ranch fries are among the most popular menu items. My advice is skip them-- they're definitely not the nirvana that was promised.

Tuesday and Thursday are cheap wing nights, which means that it's often packed and the service is slower, so be aware of that if you go. That said, I've found the dining area to be very family friendly, even on Tuesdays and Thursdays-- there are often several families with kids under ten.

All in all, great wings, cheap food, and decent service-- I'll be back."}
{"text":"\"I wish I could convince myself that pa is incapable of making a chicken wing that is worth buying\" - me, tonight. Overcooked, impressively LOW quality raw product, good sauce. A shame, really, but definitely a pass for this place."}
{"text":"The best wings around. Great prices and specials. Service isn't always great though. Scott is the best but if he isn't there the service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Total dive bar, not really the type if place you want to hang out past happy hour.  Excellent food, as long as you ignore the sanitation situation.  Order take out.  Wings, well done."}
{"text":"We went on their Tuesday Wing Night to sample the goods. The bar half of the place is smoking, while the restaurant half is non, and the 40-cent wing special is valid on both ends. I was surprised at how quick the service was, with each order of wings quickly following the previous round -- no mean feat considering how crowded it was.

Talerico's has 55 flavors of wings, and while some are sort of cheating (honey garlic and roasted honey garlic, see me after class), there are plenty of tasty dry rubs, savory sauces, and a few oddballs (like sour cream and onion wings, which are dry-rubbed and taste just like the potato chips from your elementary school brown-bag lunch).

All in all, it's a great value, and a place you can bring your family if you're so inclined. (Having just a wife and myself, we merely brought our livers -- drinks be cheap there!)"}
{"text":"Awesome wings and fries. Ranch wings. Ranch and bacon fries. Great prices. Thursday wing night. Good service, low prices all around. 

Three pitchers of Yuengling, 104 wings. Four boats of fries. $86.12

Awesome."}
{"text":"Sometimes, I'm like... no, I don't want a bar with 12 different kinds of wings... I don't really want a bar with only 30 types of wings... What I really want is like... oh... I don't know... maybe 55 FREAKING TYPES OF WINGS.

Remember that scene in Forrest Gump, about the shrimp? Replace 'shrimp' with 'wings,' and there you have Talerico's.

Tuesday & Thursday are their 'wing nights,' where wings are only 40 cents apiece. The best thing about that? If you're like me, and want to go for all 55 types of wings, you can order in 3-packs! Feel free to mix and match whatever flavors are on your brain and in your heart, because you only have to commit to three of them at a time.

There is a solid mix of gooey and dry rubs, so everyone's tastes are accommodated. And on the side? They have a full page of French fries.

Let that sink in for a second: A FULL PAGE OF FRENCH FRIES.

Yeahhhhhh we got an order that had bacon and shredded cheese and ranch and the tears of angels on it. It came with forks!

Another nice thing about this place: there is a bar up front which is smoking, but the restaurant area in the back is non-smoking, so you can enjoy your wings without coming home smelly. (I mean, smellier than all that honey bourbon garlic mustard stuff that you got all over your pants.)

I know I tend to have an overly-romantic feeling about Ambridge businesses, but this is worth the drive out, even if you don't hail from the area."}
{"text":"Dive bar with decent prices and a relatively friendly staff. Great wings!"}
{"text":"Talerico's has some really great food. It's like a Hidden Treasure of Ambridge.

The wings are great, Taco's are awesome and the subs are what keep us going back. Darlas Special and the Italian subs are great, quality meats and Mancini's Bread!

We usually opt to pick up our food as the place can be creepy at times. Family's are welcome but I would suggest leaving the kid's at home...lol

Never had a problem with service, the bartenders are always nice. Just watch out for some of the other patrons they can be real creepers.

This place is a dive bar but if you are looking for some good food don't judge this place based on looks.

Prices are good too."}
