{"text":"This place is not called Kayla's anymore, it's called Milvale Diner for some reason. When we got there it was only one guy at work (the owner I assume), he took the order and made the food, he seemed pretty stressed out. But he was nice and considering we were a party of 7, he worked hard, kudos for the effort. The food was tasty, some of it looked a little microwaved and it was prepared suspiciously quickly, but it was pretty good. The homemade chips were awesome."}
{"text":"Everything about Kayla's rules, from the friendly service to the food. I loved my tender, sweet, juicy Citrus Glazed Chicken, the Artichoke Dip app, and the chocolate cake. Our server recommened to me the chicken since I didn't know what I wanted and I am grateful to her for that since it was delish. 

I think we'll be eating at Kayla's instead of at Mr. Smalls when we see concerts there.

Darren was beside himself and was sooo shy due to the band Behemoth eating next to us."}
{"text":"Really and truly, I want to like this place. If for no other reason than the fact that it's 100 feet away from my front door, I'd really prefer to enjoy the food at Kayla's. And yet, the strict journalistic integrity demanded by Yelp requires that I must be honest with myself and with you, dear reader. Kayla's is not worth the 100 foot journey. 

I've given them several chances, and not once have I been anywhere approaching impressed. Thrice I've gone for breakfast and their home fries are consistently dry and tasteless. Even worse, the potato pancakes are, I suspect, mashed potatoes mixed with actual pancake batter. There is not enough ketchup in the world. 

I went once for lunch as I could not in good conscience condemn them having only been there for breakfast. I ordered a tuna sandwich. They were out of tuna. I ordered something else. They were out of that. The next attempt? Out of that too. Now in Kayla's defense, the server explained to me that they had just donated a bunch of food to workers at a local non-profit. Alright, I can get behind that, no hard feelings. But the lunch I did end up with was lackluster.

If you go for lunch, don't expect anything better than you'd get at any standard diner. But a diner that's bad at breakfast? That cannot possibly merit more than 2 stars."}
{"text":"The place is called The Millvale Diner now. The ownership is not the same, however. Curiously enough, a webpage for the restaurant has a quote from my Yelp review.
