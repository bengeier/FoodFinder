{"text":"As good as it gets is an understatement! This place has unique and amazing sandwich combinations, specialty flourishes like apricot spreads, fresh made soups, flavorful and robust coffee, the salads are so well balanced, the food is filling and made right in front of you.  When you walk into Byte you'll feel the warmth and comfort that this restaurant radiates. There is plenty of seating, even a conference room for lunch meetings. The owner has obviously put a lot of time and attention into the environment and the details.   The Green Goddess and Desperado are instant favorites, you'll find yourself coming back time and time again.  Best sandwich place in Cleveland, don't waste your time or money with the food from Subway / Jimmy Johns / Panera that has been shipped frozen halfway across the country ever again. Instead, go taste what REAL sandwiches made with love are supposed to taste like!"}
{"text":"I simply love this place. The sandwiches are massive and incredibly filling. The turkey club and the desperado are two of my favorites, the ingredients are super fresh. They also make really great soup, so be sure to chek the board for the flavor of the day. I dig the coffee here. The cherry on top is the fact that the staff is so incredibly kind.  I do have to play devil's advocate, the salad portions are a bit small. If they were a little bigger I would order these routinely as they are definitely fresh and delicious. Size does matter here though.  As someone said, the seating is weird and limited, but on a nice day, see if the picnic table on the other end of the building is open. It's in a nice spot under a tree. Sometimes I even eat on the front stoop. #stoopkid  Do yourself a favor and get the punch card! Buy eight sandwiches and get one free."}
{"text":"Lovely and fresh, if a bit pricey for stand alone sandwiches. Service is always very friendly and quick as food is made to order. A great addition to this part of Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is sweet!  The Green Goddess and the Rustic Turkey are some of the best sandwiches I have ever had.  For the same price as Subway you get a whole lot better quality of sandwich.  Highly recommend this place to anyone in the area.  Only open for lunch though"}
{"text":"Great little cafe in the Tyler Village complex. I visit multiple times a week as the food is great, healthy, and crafted by some of the friendliest staff I have met.  Can't go wrong with the Desperado. Stop in for a byte."}
{"text":"I ordered three salads total. One for me and for two of my coworkers.  The food was ready when I was told it was ready and the service at the cafe itself was quick and friendly.  When we got the food back to the office and unpacked it, we noticed that the salads were very small. For the price we paid ($8-$10.50) we were all expecting a heartier salad worthy of a meal. We were all fairly disappointed in the size. Upon opening the salads, we noticed that each dressing cup was not even a third of the way full. And the amount of goat cheese on my salad was barely noticeable.  The food tasted good, but I highly doubt we will be returning. We were using this as a trial run to see if we would use this for catering for meetings here, but I don't think that we will be doing that."}
{"text":"I used to work here for a shadowing program and I loved it because everybody there was so nice to me and the food is great and is prepared fresh everyday you can't go wrong with eating at Byte"}
{"text":"Great fresh food!  They have entrees for vegetarians and vegans too. Their menu has some interesting choices.  The food was very good and made fresh to order. Their dining room is to the left of the ordering counter, very cool eating space. The only critique I would have is for the prices of the sandwiches, include a small bag of chips, etc..."}
{"text":"There are no proper words to describe this place. All I can say is wow!! I discovered this wonderful cafe last week while on UberEATS. I seen \"Byte Cafe\" and I thought it myself hmmm I've never heard of this place before so let me see what it's about. I looked at the menu and was instantly intrigued. I went there and ordered the desperado...the first item that really caught my eye. When I took that first byte I thought I transcended into heaven. From that moment on I realized why they mainly have all 5 stars. I was soo impressed by my food that I went back today with my mother and niece and they were just as in love with it as I was. The next sandwich I'll try is the avocado blt. I already know it's going to be amazing. BYTE KEEP IT UP!!!!"}
{"text":"Just visited for the first time; the food is delicious! The workers are very pleasant and gave great recommendations. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Chose to get the Desperado sandwich and exceeded my expectations. Very soft bread, with shaved turkey, cheese crunchy bacon and a delicious apricot honey mustard sauce Sandwich was very good and staff was very friendly. I recommend this to anyone in the Cleveland area"}
{"text":"Very good and yes a little on the pricey side.  Half Desperado sandwich and Half Mediterranean salad were both on point.  $9.00.  Definitely more of a grab n go place..limited and weird seating in an old yet beautiful conference room.  I would say that the Desperado sandwich was the best sandwich I have eaten i downtown CLE for sure.  I am still thinking about the multi grain bread and apricot spread...just a great mix of flavors in that sandwich...and the balsamic vinaigrette from my salad was great.  Hubs liked his roast beef on sourdough and small Caesar salad.  We will definitely go back!  Great little find."}
{"text":"The food is incredible. The owner treats everyone with respect and makes sure the cafe is extremely clean at all times. I HIGHLY recommend the turkey sandwich. My mouth is watering just thinking about that turkey and soft bread..."}
{"text":"I've had the salmon sandwich, turkey, and the pear salad (I think it's seasonal) and everything was delicious.  The people there put in extra care making the food. I've recommended this place to all my co-workers and friends and have heard anything but great reviews from them"}
{"text":"Hands down, one of my top 3 favorite lunch spots when I am in Cleveland for work. Before Byte, I used to go to another salad/soup/sandwich place down the street on 30th, but after feeling like cattle being herded through a line for pre-made salads, my colleague introduced me to this place and I am never turning back again. My favorite is the Green Goddess Salad with Blackened Chicken - actually - I'm eating one right now as I type this review and my tastebuds are literally singing! The great thing is that I've ordered a variety of other sandwiches and salads from here and you can never go wrong. The ingredients are fresh and you get more than what you are paying for - quality ingredients, quality service, and quality food. They have a seating area now, which I have never tried as I usually just do pick-up, but it looks super cute (and a bit small so get there early if you have a group). Also, parking is out front and I have never had an issue finding a spot. Believe me when I say go once and you will find yourself going again and again to explore all the items on their menu. Thank you Byte for being so close to my Cleveland office! =) Never change. Haha."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I had a half salad, a sandwich and coffee.  The food was very very good and the coffee was perfect.  Highly recommended. It's a good takeout healthy lunch option."}
{"text":"Leaving a 3-star because I have no choice but to give it a rating, even though we didn't stay to eat. We were a little surprised to discover this is just a sandwich takeout counter -- there are some tables in a little room adjacent, but most people were standing around waiting for takeout. We were looking for a place we could sit down and have a relaxed lunch, so this wasn't what we were looking for, but that was hard to tell from other reviews. When I see a place calling itself a cafe, I expect a CAFE, not a takeout counter. It really felt like a bait-and-switch."}
{"text":"I would post a picture, but my sandwich is already gone...   Pros: Healthy, fresh, delicious, good variety, SOURDOUGH BREAD   Cons: Gets busy for lunch (which can also be seen as a good thing!) with a bit of a wait (prevent this by calling your order in) and it's small.  But for the food they put out, you'd never guess it. I ordered the Alaskan (smoked salmon, cream cheese, cucumber, red onion, fresh dill, lemon juice, arugula, vinaigrette and salt and pepper on sourdough) and it was a delight. The arugula and fresh dill added a light herbaceous note that I didn't expect from a sandwich, let alone one with cream cheese. So good.   Also, their sourdough is phenomenal. I just want to buy a loaf and eat it all day. Great addition to the lunch scene for St. Clair/Superior and Asia Town."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food. It's actually inside the Taylor building and at the end of the hallway to the left. It does take a little time for them to make things but it's worth it and I like how they've spruced up a couple old conference rooms with tables."}
{"text":"This was defiantly the best place for a quick lunch in CLE! I've been here many times and my favorite sandwich is the Desperado. You can really tell how fresh the ingredients are after your first byte! Can't wait to go back for lunch again."}
{"text":"Stopped by here after reading great reviews from other customers, and I wasn't disappointed! The building and atmosphere are totally unique, the staff is very friendly, and the food is delicious and fresh. The local homemade bread is wonderful and the unique menu options made for a great lunch. I had the smoked salmon and cream cheese, my mom had the avocado BLT, and my dad had The Desperado - all on the multigrain bread. My dad also had some of the soup of the day, which was chicken paprikash. We were all very pleased with our meal!"}
{"text":"Great addition to Tyler Village healthy handmade Artisan foods with love, care and quality!!!"}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent and the food was very fresh. However, it wasn't extraordinary or anything that would particularly make me go back. All in all a good stop for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places close to work to grab coffee or lunch. My coworkers love it here as well, at least one of us goes here once a week. The atmosphere is really cute and branded with orange decor.  Staff is normally very nice, although saddly a few people just left who were always extra helpful and extremely friendly. If you're in a rush don't come right at lunch as they get very busy.  The food is always fresh and delicious. I love getting the pick two with a goddess or mediteranian salad and a cup of soup. The soup changes weekly and is very good.  The coffee is pretty tasty and they make a really good latte."}
{"text":"What an unexpected but fantastic experience! Also, one of the best sandwiches my husband and I have had. Byte is in a beautiful historical building that used to make ornate elevators for buildings and landmarks we all recognize. Aside from that, we were surprised that this little unassuming looking cafe could serve such a perfect lunch. I had the vegetarian special with avocados, arugula, walnuts and vinaigrette. My husband had the Desperado and both sandwiches came with a choice of bread. You can order for take away or eat in the former CEO's office and conference room. The staff were very helpful and went above and beyond in service and smiles. Byte Cafe should seriously consider expanding because it's a gem in Tyler Village."}
{"text":"I like the ladies at byte they take care of me on my rare trips downstairs for lunch. Very good for a quick lunch snack but pro tip call ahead and order or you could get stuck waiting."}
{"text":"I'm glad to add this to my near-downtown east side dining spots. Love the sandwiches. Avocado BLT and the \"Desperado\" are my faves so far. The former for obvious reasons (avocado + BLT?!? Um, yes!) and the Desperado is a fine fusion of flavors. I'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"Great stop for lunch, always a pleasant  experience here.  Employees are very sweet and want to make sure you leave happy.  The food is always delicious, I've never had anything bad here.  Everything is made fresh right before your eyes, and they are very flexible and accommodating with special orders.  It's mostly for to go orders, but if need be they have a seating area that's not well known about unless you ask.  I highly recommend this place for a satisfying and happy lunch experience."}
{"text":"Since they started delivery, in-person service has become very hit and miss. I've had 15-20 minute waits for my order, including one situation where they forgot to put the order in, and one where they forgot to give me my completed sandwich for 15 minutes.   My most recent visit resulted in a sandwich with what I'd consider to be ingredients-gone-bad. I brought the sandwich down and returned it and felt like the manager in charge at the time was defensive and unhelpful. Since I can no longer trust the food, I have since not been back (nearly two months now).   When Byte is good, it's great. But recently there has been more bad days than good, and I hear constant complaints  from co-workers about how good it used to be and how shoddy everything has become.   I suspect Byte has been a victim of its own success, and doesn't really have the infrastructure to handle both delivery and in-person pick up.   I'm really disappointed. The sandwiches can be really decent, if over-priced. But it's so unpredictable."}
{"text":"I ordered the $9 combo that comes with 1/2 sandwich/soup/salad (two of the three). I got the desperado sandwich and the house salad. The desperado has turkey, bacon, avocado, arugula, apricot honey mustard...a list of delicious ingredients in what sounds to be the makings of a great sandwich. However, I was underwhelmed. While tasty, it lacked something cohesive to bring all the ingredients together. I was hoping for a sandwich on the tastiness level of Herb and Twine, but this was a notch below. The salad fell into a similar bucket.  I liked the food, but it wasn't as exceptional as I expected given the reviews from past yelpers. Not something I would normally go out of my way to try, but I may have to try other things off the menu and give it a second look!"}
{"text":"OMG. I saw this place on grub hub, realized it was right by my job so a co worker and I went.  It's like literally a hole in the wall full of awesome!! I had the California veggie with cream cheese and she the green goddess. The intention was too split sandwiches but neither of us wanted too give up or yumminess!!  New go too place for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. We had the veggie sandwich, salmon sandwich and the caprese. All ingredients were fresh. Delicious."}
{"text":"What an absolute pleasant surprise this little place is.  I had a tuna salad sandwich which may be one of the best I've ever had.  The bread, alone, puts it into a different league altogether.  The staff is super friendly and it's infinitely clear that a LOT of love goes into the making of their food.  Outstanding and highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious but I can't leave a positive review here Overpriced and under filling"}
{"text":"Got the caprese salad, so good! It needed a touch of salt be besides that is was exactly what I wanted. Extremely satisfying."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches here! They are usually giant. The Desperado is absolutely amazing. INSIDER TIP! If you get this, ask for the special garlic mayo on it instead of the regular. They also make fresh soups and different flavored coffees. The girls that work here are super easy to talk with and very nice too! Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a fun and exciting new lunch spot."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a long time now... and everything is amazing! Problem is... you need a push to really put that review in. Green Goddess is one of the best things to find its way into my mouth, and it definitely was push enough... Plus Mike is pretty alright!"}
{"text":"Cool coffee shop. I like the seating areas of dark paneled old-school wood contrasted against modern white tables and orange chairs. There was plenty of seating and it was quiet. The only con is that at least on the day I stopped in there was no air conditioning in the seating area. It was unbearably hot.   I got a large American ($4.50) which was really good. There was also a good sized sandwich menu with healthy options and salads which I will make a point to try next time. This place is definitely more sandwich cafe than coffee shop."}
