{"text":"This is basically Jack Astor's with way more beer and giant ceiling pipes.

It's a very big and loud space. 

With the opening of CBM craft beer has officially gone mainstream in Ontario yay.  

I guess that's' good.  But this place has 100 beers on tap. Which is a lot of beers to have on tap and so you'd think there would have to be a couple of new things to try or surprises or real gems.  Don't get me wrong, they had a lot of beers to choose from, many of them ranging from good to great, and they had an awful lot of IPAs, so safe to say you'll find something to enjoy, if not something you've never tried before.  It's just that the lineup is completely safe and predictable.

We ended up going here when the Distillery District Christmas Market was lined up around the block and we needed a plan B.  This is an actual text exchange that resulted from this experience:

Me: Do you want to meet at craft beer market instead?

Him: Sure. Do u know the name of the place?

Me: What place?

Him: where u want to go instead

Me: Craft beer market.

Him: ya what's the name of the place tho?

Me: That is the name: Craft Beer Market

Him: ok lol

So zero points for creatively naming itself.  Also, it's not a market.  Just saying.

Anyway moving on to food: Nobody got the fast food sushi which made me sad because it sounds ridiculous.  I had the harvest garden sandwich with fries and it tasted pretty good, but wasn't quite as fresh and vegetably as something named after a garden ought to be.

The general consensus among five people who ordered food seemed to be that it was okay.  

Our server was great.

I would go back for beers if I was in the neighbourhood, but would probably skip the food."}
{"text":"I will never return to this place again. We had a birthday party with 15 people in their mid to late 20's. Let me just start out by saying the beer menu is fantastic! Lots of selection and different choice for various people. 

Here we go with the horrible service. When we first got their we were seated right away then were told to get up and go back and wait because the table wasnt ready yet... bad start already. The heat... the thermostat was right infront of us and was set for 27.5 degrees and were all immediately sweating. Then came the worst waiter I have ever had in my life. We all sat down and were really excited to start tasting all the beers. He came over and took drink orders from about 5 of the people there and left the other people stranded even though they were ready to order. One of the people in our party asked if they had a certain beer and our waiter said \"ill go check\" he comes back with a menu and tells him to look at the menu and figure it out. But we let it go and continued our night when most folks would have gotten up and left right after that. Some of the people in our party got their beers and food before others even ordered a beer! Like what??  Two people in our party were very upset and were talking amongst themselves and saying \"are we allowed to order drinks\" \"this service is bad\" but did not say anything to the waiter himself as we understand its busy. We were all having beers and talking when the Raptors lost their playoff game. So we decided to get some shots. I asked the waiter what the \"shot of the day\" was and he told me whiskey. About 20 minutes later a different person comes and brings us shots of Vodka telling us that was the real shot of the day. But again we shut our mouths and did not complain or send anything back. One person from our party spilled some beer on his pants and needed a napkin. The waiter was no where to be found for about 15 minutes so he decided to get up and go to the bar and get some napkins. A different employee yelled at him for doing that took the napkins and brought them back to the bar...... like excuse me? But again we just let it go and just complained about it amongst ourselves and not to the employees. This is where we could no longer shut our mouths. The waiter comes over after we all had 1 beer and 1 shot and tells us we are \"cut off\" we were all so confused and did not understand what was happening. So we argued when the manager came to our table and told us we were not cut off and that there was a \"miscommunication\". I appreciate the manager for coming over and fixing the problem but that waiter did not know how to do his job at all. To us it felt like after they started dying down at about 12am they were trying to get us out of their immediately, and forcing bills onto certain people of our party. So we all got fed up and decide to get our bills and leave. We get the bills and of course to top off the night the waiter added a nice 18% tip onto every single bill. 18%!!!! I personally would not have tipped more than 15% even if he was half decent. So my girlfriend complained and was asking why it was already included and that we should be deciding the tip based on the quality of service. The waiter said we were \"hard to deal with\". I am a very passive person and do not enjoy confrontation but I needed to ask why. The waiter told me it was because everyone here was so aggressive and rude. We were not rude at all. We did not say ANYTHING to him the entire time except for \"can i order a beer?\" If you work downtown Toronto on a Saturday night you can not expect people to be fine with you taking 30 minutes to place their initial drink order, being rude and acting like we are children, and to get drinks mixed up and ignoring certain people at our table. Any other party would have been much more aggressive and got up and left. 

After all of this I will never ever in a million years return to this place and will be writing reviews everywhere I possibly can because this was the absolute worst service ever. Im very dissatisfied and upset as we were all looking forward to going here and one waiter decided to ruin all of our nights including the birthday girls. If i could i would rate this place half of a star because of the service alone."}
{"text":"A few girls and I from work were looking to make a reservation for a lunch. We decided on craft as it was central and didn't require pre-payment for a large party. Thumbs up.

I didn't order a drink and I had the ahi tuna poke bowl- so this review will be based on that. The bowl came on a plate which is better for mixing anyway, but it had zero flavour. It's very deceiving because it comes covered in sesame seeds and dried seaweed. It needs another layer flavour like salt or spicy or SOMETHING. I asked for soy sauce which also took a while to arrive even though the restaurant was far from at full capacity. 

The other girls seemed to be happy with their salads and burgers so I'm sure the other food is better. But I wouldn't come back here. There are a lot of better poke options in the area (like at Pusateri's under the HBC) at a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"Better than expected, if not a bit pricey for pub food.

Crispy Grilled Cheese & Bacon Sandwich was stuffed with brie and cheddar, even topped with more melted/grilled cheese on top.  Truly crispy, as advertised, and ooey-gooey good on the inside.  

Fries were decently crispy, and although the yummy housemade tomato jam was probably meant for sandwich, it served as a great dip for the fries.

Beer menu was extensive, with 150 options on the board.  Server was knowledgeable and my friends liked their beers based on her recommendations of their preferred flavours.  All in all, not bad."}
{"text":"Very good place to choose when going out with a big group of friends...takes reservations and gives ETA if you are a walk-in.  Food is conventional American menu, but the beer and cider on tap choices is plenty!  Definitely a good find."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out, but the food is very unimpressive.

Great ambience. I loved the giant beer keg fridge which is enclosed by glass. Rustic/industrial decor with super high ceilings covered in twisting and turning beerline pipes coming from the beer fridge. 

Servers were very friendly despite the chaos and disorganization, which is totally understandable since they weren't even officially open. 

We had the fish tacos which are on special for $3 each on Tuesday. They were rather underwhelming. The fish was tiny on huge bed of cabbage coleslaw, atop a flour tortilla. I just hate flour tortillas for tacos period. But overall the dish just wasn't flavourful.

My friend had the butternut squash ravioli with shrimp. The servers recommended it but we really did not like it at all. Strangely seasoned a bit florally tasting. If you want a dish like this you definitely need to go to Cactus Club Cafe, where they do it right.

I also ordered the TNT (seared tuna sandwich with fries) and although this by far was the best dish, it's nothing impressive enough to order again. Lacked any exciting flavour.

All in all, I'd still come here to hang out for drinks and bar snacks but I wouldn't recommend it for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This place is always busy so I finally decided to check it out. The service is INCREDIBLE. The vibe is casual and fun. And the beer menu is impressive. Our waiter was so kind and offered to walk us through every line of the beer list. He even brought us 6-8 samplers for us to try, on the house! And to top it off, he wrote our top beers down for us to remember for next time.  

The food itself is OK, but you're not really coming for a 5-star meal. It's more for the drinks and company. The biggest downside is the price point. We found the beers to be decently priced but the food was very expensive for mediocre quality. That's why I can't give it 4 or 5 star. 

Here's my overall ratings 

Food- 2/5
Service - 5/5
Ambience - 4/5
Price - 2.5/5"}
{"text":"We have been to the one in Ottawa so we knew what to expect going here in Toronto. As expected, the food and service was great, and so were the beers!"}
{"text":"Came here on Victoria Day because not much else was open during the National Holiday.  Glad we came in.  Good vibe, relaxing ambience.  Had the World Beer Flight pictured here (reasonably priced compared to CA breweries).  Being an IPA fan, try the BrewDog Punk IPA."}
{"text":"Came here on opening week. As expected - service was learning so not rating on that (would have been lower) but more on quality, taste & value. 

Beer - lots of choices - 5 stars there. Focus on local & craft. Good prices (in fact - they ding you it seems for ordering mass beers). 

Food - quite nice - good portions, but not huge. Fish tacos were tasty and filling (3 of them). 

Second time in - they forgot my soup. So I had more barley soup (beer)"}
{"text":"I took guests there from out of town last night and it was a horrible experience.  We had to wait 50 minutes for a table standing around the bar which was fine but it took 20 minutes to find someone to order a beer from.  The waiter who found us offered samples and was delightful and was the only positive experience along with the beer.  We were seated for dinner and left there for another 20 minutes without anyone coming to our table.  The fish tacos were average and the salad or not good.  Then it took another 20 minutes to get our bill.  This was a terrible impression of Toronto that I gave my guests and will not return."}
{"text":"We visited this place Friday afternoon for work lunch. Two of us ordered Harvest Garden sandwich with Quinoa patty. While the side salad - Kale Caesar was amazing, the patty was undercooked. Since I did not have Quinoa patty before, it took me a while to realize it was undercooked until I exchanged my thoughts with my colleague. Lol. I hate to see such a good decor and amazing beer selection go for a waste when they cannot follow food basics!"}
{"text":"I tried the place based on a recommendation of a close friend who enjoyed it on a Monday afternoon before the 5 pm after work crowd.  Three of us went on a Thursday evening, after work.  There was a very long wait - over 30 minutes.  The server we had was difficult to hear/understand in the din of the filled to (almost) capacity place.  The beer prices were outrageous.  $8 for a glass that's less than an actual pint for something I regularly buy at the LCBO for $3 (Stiegl Radler).  The selection of beer is fine, but not \"crafty\" in any sense since all of those beers are widely available at LCBOs across Ontario. The food was mediocre and pricey.  I had the mac'n'cheese, which was mostly breadcrumbs and not cheesy.  The hamburgers were good but mostly because of the bun and not the meat itself.  The three of us had a glass of beer and a plate of food, and the bill came to $80.  Seriously not worth it.  So, if you like overpriced food and beer and don't mind the deafening crowds and long waits for tables, then go for it.  Otherwise, you will be better off at a real craft brew pub or just any old pub."}
{"text":"Nice place. Lots of light and good music vibe. But $8.00 for a 14oz domestic beer is ridiculous! I'm going old school to McVeigh's Irish Pub. Full pints for $7."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience here last night!! Love the fact that they have a hundred beers on tap and  great local choices. Shout out to my friends beer that they have on tap Bobcaygeon Dockside Amber. They also had cocktail choices and wine on tap!

The food was great too. Way better than you would expect from your average brewpub. Had the chipotle cheddar burger with bacon added (highly recommend). The patty was full of flavour and obviously handmade and the bun was great. Fries were incredible!

Solid service too. Made a reservation and got a nice booth.

Great dj playing and lots of TVs too. All in all a great time. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The staff was very friendly and attentive despite the fact that the restaurant was packed (St. Patrick's day). I really like the layout of the restaurant too, lots of sunlight and a sort of communal feel with everything being open. The music selection was nice and I'm impressed by the fact that despite being so open and busy, I could still hear the music and the person I was with just fine. The menu is decent, but I think it would be better if it were more coherent and centered around one type of cuisine. The prices are kinda high for what you get, the quality isn't really fine dining and the portions aren't great, but I still enjoyed what I ate nonetheless. Where they really shine is their beer selection. Their tag line \"Where everything is on tap\" rings true. I got their domestic sampler and loved it both for the well curated selection and the very, very good price. They also get bonus points for personally sending out thank you cards with a coupon when you sign up to their e-news letter, such a nice little extra touch!"}
{"text":"I came here on either the first or second opening night. Great place to hang for drinks with colleagues. Was not impressed at all for any of the food items that my party ordered. The butternut squash ravioli I ordered was so overdone that you can't even tell whether it's ravioli or just a mash up of pasta and sauce. I have had much much better (Cactus Club). I would imagine that many people would compare the food to Cactus as it does appear to be a huge establishment like Cactus and well designed. 

We ordered maybe half a dozen tacos that were on sale, but some how they were bringing out about 20 tacos. We had to informed the staff that there must have been a mistake. 
I ordered a beer and out came half a pint glass. Again, I did come during the first couple opening nights so these types of issues are understandable but on the same token I've never had that happened to me before...normally wouldn't they always rather sell the larger pint? Otherwise service was fine. Staff were friendly.

I would definitely come back for a drink due to pure convenience as I work in the same building."}
{"text":"Hostesses and the 'reservation manager' are terrible to work with and have no idea what they are doing. Was a headache to call and try to make a reservation. Told the hostess we wanted to make a reservation for Thursday night. Told us to email the 'reservation manager'. Waited 3 days for a response to find out they don't take reservations on weeknights. So why couldn't the hostess tell us this to begin with?

Was also a headache when we arrived to get seated at a table. Told the hostess we didn't have a reservation but wanted to be put on the wait list, sent us to the 'reservation manager' who looked us up on the system, only to find out we didn't have a reservation and sent us back to the hostess. Lol. 

Food is average. The kitchen staff messed up 3 of our dishes - forgot the salad dressing on the kale salad, under cooked the steak, and forgot the avocados in the fish tacos. We mentioned all this to our waitress, who then said she would send over her manager to speak with us. We waited 15-20 minutes for a manager, which in my opinion is a terribly long time to wait when a restaurant has messed up on your order. 

Giving 2 stars because of ambiance - very industrial yet chic, wide selection of craft beer, and wait staff was friendly and attentive. Overall, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"This was the best place for two Michiganders to stop upon arrival to Toronto! The hostess tried to help us find bar seats when there was a small wait upon entering. Enormous beer selection and service among the best we had ever experienced. The bar staff really knows what they are doing; checking on you regularly and impeccable cleanup. I'm pregnant, so a little biased, but the ginger beer with free refills made my night. Additionally, the Mezza platter was maybe the best thing I've ever eaten. Completely addicted to avocado toast now. Wonderful service, crowd, food and drink. Couldn't have asked for a better experience and we will reflect fondly on the memories!"}
{"text":"The chipotle burger was amazing! Well flavoured and perfectly cooked!
Really enjoyed the service and environment.
Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Trying to get away from the cold we randomly found this place which seemed very cozy and inviting from the outside. Surprisingly it was not bad, the staffs recommendations were all great with over 150 craft beers and wines on tap, which can seem overwhelming at first. The drink menu design was very helpful and though we didn't order any food it all looked really good around us, especially the nachos which smelled amazing. Definitely would come back here for bigger group outings, this place is huge!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night for a post-work drinks date, as such we only had beers. 

Beer list was solid, with rotating taps and and more standardized offerings, the menu had a good variety of brews - from imports to small local breweries to more domestic/craft breweries. 

I had the Mill Street Mill-shake Tart, a collab with Mill Street, it was deliciously tart without being too hoppy - and surprisingly has a 7.2abv. Aromas were quite nice. Have recommended this brew to a few friends and they've also enjoyed this exclusive brew. 

Even though it was a Tuesday night, the bar was packed and noisy -
 not idea for a first date. Would happily return again but probably with girlfriends."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised that we stumbled upon and were in for family and friends evening. Though we were not family and friends we enjoy complimentary drinks and food. The chicken salad and the fish tacos were very good. The beer flight was enjoyable too. Okay"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday around 9 pm with no reservations and had to wait 40 minutes for a table for 3. :O They do let you go in and grab a drink while you wait and the bar seats are on a first come first serve basis so you might be able to find two or three seats together. When we went though, it was packed!

They have a very large beer selection though which is amazing and they do flights! They have a special beer list that goes for $5 - usually beers they're trying to finish selling. 

Like any bar - the place is super loud so be prepared to shout to your neighbour! Food selection was okay - your typical bar selection. I got the chipotle cheddar burger ($17.50) and their cheddar and jalapeno soup. Burger is definitely on the pricier side and the soup was not that great. The cheese bits stayed hard in the soup and got kind of crunchy - super weird :\. 

Overall, love the beer selection but I'd probably come on a less busy day and just grab apps!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! We visited for the first time last night, and it was a great experience. We sat at the bar (recommend!) and were treated to A+ service all evening by Chris. He was ready, willing, and very able to recommend some great beers to try, and was friendly and helpful the entire time. We noticed that all of the staff seemed pretty happy to be there, and when we remarked on it, were told that it was a good work environment, so kudos to the management on that!  I love all the tap choices (but I hope you get in some Hop City soon!), and the music on Friday night was great, and it wasn't \"in your face\" loud, so we could talk to each other. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came in on impulse by myself during peak lunch rush. Got a Mac and cheese, with usually comes with bacon but I took it off. Splendid. Got 2 \"All or Nothing Hopfenweisse\" Ales and they were delicious, very refreshing. They have over 100 craft beers on tap so if you're into trying new drinks, this is a good spot for you. It's a bit loud but it's also a Friday. All the staff is very kind and have smiling faces. I didn't get checked on very much, but I was doing work so they may have been leaving me alone to focus. I enjoyed my time, would definitely come back & would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant three times and have been disappointed each time.  The service is extremely slow and lacking.  It takes so long to get a server to come back, it's barely worthwhile to complain that the food is either cold, tasteless, or incomplete.  The first time there was an issue with one of our dishes, and after waiting an hour we didn't have time for it to be replaced.  So, one of our friends left hungry.  The second time the service was slow, and the manager gave us discount cards, on the way out the door.  Today, we went to use the cards.  They did not work, and the servers did not have time to figure out why.  We aren't sure why this bar has such a tough time serving lunch on Fridays.  While it's busy, all the other downtown restaurants are too and can handle the lunchtime crowd.  After three chances, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"A friend recommended to come here and I wish we never did. We ordered the classic burger for a 6 year old and it came uncooked. We showed it to the waiter and she rudely said  \"our burgers come medium that's normal\". Then after a few minutes a manager came and apologized and said \"it was totally uncooked and the waiter was wrong, the chef is ashamed\". The waiter came back again with no sign of remorse. The 20 napkin burger was also very salty. While my friend was paying for the bill, the waiter was standing right above her even while she's imputing her pin LOL what kinda unprofessional service? We would never come back for the food or the service here."}
{"text":"All the beers, all the time!! They have many, so many craft beers on taps and it's a great place to hit up at least once of living in Toronto. Even if you don't drink beer, the place itself is charming and inviting to come by for their food specials.

Came 2x - once with a friend on a weekday and another time with 8 others for a late drink on Saturday night.

There's something for everyone on their beer menu - love the selection. It is a bit pricier than your average pub, but it's definitely worth it to have a flight or try something you usually don't drink here. 

Food is on the pricier end. The nachos are good, but not worth it - save your appetite for elsewhere if you can. I believe they do have weekday deals where appetizers are all $5 (that's a deal!!). 

For such a large place that's always buzzing with folks, the service is good and spread well amongst the crowd."}
{"text":"More like 2.5 for a beer lover like my husband it was a treat! Had a beer cocktail which was really good but then the second one was made by a different bartender and it sucked. Dislike when things are not consistent.

Only had mezze platter to eat. For the cost it was crap. There were literally 5 thin carrot  strips. Even the plate itself looked pathetic. Overall not for me. I must be in the minority's though because the place was crazy busy."}
{"text":"Another drinks spot has been found in Downtown Toronto. The one thing I really didn't like was how loud it was, I could barely hear the person next to me and I had to shout. Overall the service was great and the food was also good. 

Nothing fancy, just the typical bar food. Burgers, Sliders, Nachos etc. I had the Cheeseburger sushi which was really interesting! Bacon wrapped & topped with pickles - I did enjoy eating it. The 20 Napkin burger was lots of fun! The bacon on it was super crispy and the meat on top was juicy, it was just a very messy burger. 

Keep Eating, 
Angela"}
{"text":"Visited them on their 2nd day of opening so maybe they were working out the kinks. Food was baaaaad, nothing exciting except for the fries. Tuna poke was the most disappointing, it was boring and one noted. Followed by the crispy chicken burger that wasn't crispy and the green goodness salad that was over dressed. The ratio of fish to taco on my fish tacos was tiny and it was bland!! The wonton chips were undercooked, which made them unpalatable. Ice cream sandwiches were the worst I have ever had, sticky sauce on the bottom was a bad decision + the foul tasting ice cream. Both my husband and I took a bite and left them. 

The service was decent, the bartenders and Managers were friendly. Although he forgot one of our dishes but he was nice about it. Can't say the same for the rest of the staff. To and from the bathroom, instead of allowing customers to pass first, they would race you to get by first Overall, atmosphere was good, high ceiling, vibrant and laid back. It's a great place to grab drinks but not for food. I would much rather go to Cactus Club or King Taps down the street with much better food, atmosphere, more attentive and better looking staff."}
{"text":"To be honest this place seems like a little slice of the suburbs on Younge st. and would be suitable outside a mall along with Milestones or Jack Astors.
It feels like what the folks in a large corporation would assemble to cash in on the craft brew trend - the lineups are totally manufactured, the staff can't answer questions, and the beer glasses are under-sized."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since it's in a more convenient location than the Libery Village original. 

First of all, before anything really happens be prepared to wait. I came on a Thursday right after work to grab a table for our group. When I got there, they estimated a 35 minute wait. After 35 minutes of waiting, I checked in to see how much longer and they estimated another 25 minutes. If we had known it would take that long, we would have just ordered food at the bar. To add confusion to the situation, you would get bounced from one person to another at the front when asking the same question. 

Even more irritating, was that after I got the text that we were the 'next table', there was enough time to order and finish another drink before our table was ready. I think we waited for over an hour and 20 minutes in total. So don't come hungry, tired, or irritated because you won't be happy. 

Fortunately, there is always beer to pass the time. They do have a great selection of beer. They were missing some of my favorites from the other location but I was able to find something that worked. Finally seated, we ordered food to balance out all the beers. The menu consists of the typical selection of pub food, with some up-scale additions like ahi poke bowls and korean lettuce wraps. I tried the ribs and shrimp tacos. They were both okay, but nothing spectacular. 

Next time, I will skip the food, the wait and the irritation. Just stick to the beers next time."}
{"text":"Kew place. Super busy. Ton of beers on tap. Friendly staff. Prices not great. Food ok. Would come again. Would recommend. Good place to watch sporting events.  Don't bring nagging wife"}
{"text":"We came here to watch a fifa game and it was packed. It's a live bar with decent food and good drinks. I ordered their house salad with steak and a pear cider - it was an enjoyable late lunch."}
{"text":"3.5/5 

I've been here a few times on different days during the week. Mondays are good since all their apps (except nachos) are $9. They have specials every day. 

I have mixed reviews on this place. It's a bit of a wait on a week night. Usually they are pretty accurate but once my 30 min wait turned into 50 mins. Another time my wait was predicted as 30 mins and I was able to sit after 10 mins. Pretty inconsistent. I would have to say majority of the time my service was good, except once I had terrible service. The guy didn't check up on us that often, and when we asked for water he forgot. So again, inconsistent. The food is decent.

The best part about this place is that they have a lot of beer options so there is something for everyone. They even have wine on tap and the house wine wasn't bad at all. Overall I'd recommend people to try this place out but prepare for a wait depending on when you go."}
{"text":"I 1st visited Craft at their Unofficial Opening which was 2 days before they officially opened; I just walked around their bar on the ground floor to get an idea of the layout of the venue.  A friend and I tried to obtain a table for 5 the day after they officially opened but the wait was too long so we went elsewhere.  The same friend arrived around 6 pm yesterday and put her name down for a table for 7 and was told there would be about a 90 min. wait, so she sat at the ground floor bar and waited; others in our party and myself gradually arrived and we did get a table for all of us on time, which was at about 7:30.  So suffice to say that Craft is still very popular/in demand due to having opened so recently, its location and yes, the fact that it currently has 150 beers avail. on tap.

The venue had a $5 cask selection avail. last night (Flying Monkeys Brewery's Grand Slam Breakfast Porter) as it was Tues. night which is Cask Night at the venue, so I chose that for my 1st beer; it's a dark beer with low carbonation (as told by our server at the bar) which I found quite flavourful.  After we moved to our table I ordered Left Field Brewery's Laser Show, a quite hoppy beer which I've had before and quite enjoy.  I didn't order any food but several others in our party did and their choices looked quite interesting and filling.  People at the table next to ours ordered food and the aromas from their orders were very nice.  We had good, attentive service from our server at our table as well.  The venue is fairly upscale and quite spacious and the high ceiling helps give the interior a vast, open look and feel.  While there I briefly took a look at their 2nd floor which is considerably smaller, has its own bar and overlooks the 1st floor.

So I can quite highly recommend Craft based on my 1st visit ordering drinks as well as the fact that they have specials, the details of which can be found by clicking on What's New in their website."}
{"text":"After we saw Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (it was good!), Gord and I had supper this evening at CRAFT Beer Market ... it just opened about three weeks ago in a space that used to house a bank.  It's a big space split over two floors (seats about 400) and there will be a patio in the back in the summer (for another 250 spots).

Gord ordered a Crispy Grilled Cheese & Bacon Sandwich.  He enjoyed it and said he'd get it again.

I ordered a Crispy Chicken Sandwich (minus lettuce and slaw).  The chicken was thigh meat so tender and flavourful.  I didn't find the hot sauce too hot and did catch the sweetness of the maple syrup.  I'd get it again.

For dessert, we shared ice cream sandwiches (Gord had one and I had two!).  They were good.  The cookies were hard and best picked up and eaten rather than with utensils.

It's a great spot if you are a beer lover as they have over 150 beer on tap.  Nav was our server.  She was friendly, chatty and took excellent care of us."}
{"text":"Definitely wanted to try this place once it open! Great place to come after work, the atmosphere was live and bumping. My coworker and I got there around 6pm and put our names on the wait list (quoted approximately 20-25 minute wait). We got a spot at the bar to grab a drink. Their drink menu is amazing...they have over 100+ beers!
Our table wait wasn't bad at all. The menu font could have been a lot bigger as it looked like it was font 8 in a dark atmosphere...this makes it hard on the eyes (yes that sounds like old age but the menu was not pleasing on the eyes). They had $3 fish tacos and I couldn't say no to those. I order 3 fish tacos with a 6 sample of beers around the world. My coworker got a poutine with a burger.
The tacos were great but the fish portion was a tad small. The poutine was delicious and the burger was yummy! The sampler was interesting, but I definitely wouldn't order it again.
All in all, I would come back again with more people. The decor and atmosphere is super chill...price point wasn't too bad"}
{"text":"Absolutely massive, and a solid addition to the place. 

Beer list is excellent, and this place will do really well. There's no doubt about it. Their focus is beer, food, and entertainment. They do all really well. 

It does have a bit of a chain feel to it, so when being compared to Joey's, Jack's, Milestones, Bier Market, etc, this is the clear winner."}
{"text":"I've visited a few times now. The food is decent and they have some great deals on weekdays. Nothing unique, just a good all around place to have a couple beers and an appetizer after work. The online reservation system is also convenient for larger groups."}
{"text":"I attended an event at the Craft Beer Market, and it included free beers! Unfortunately when I RSVPd for the event, I was able to drink, only to learn several weeks later that this was no longer possible (I am pregnant). Anyway, the event sounded great, so I went with a friend. Once there we were in awe of how big the place is! Two floors filled to the rim! We decided to sit upstairs and there was food being passed around. Sadly, we did not really like the food, and only really enjoyed the Hawaiian Ahi Poke (Chopped sashimi grade tuna, cucumber, fresh ginger, garlic and sesame soy vinaigrette served with crispy wontons). All the other dishes being served that night we found to be pretty average (fish tacos, sliders). We figured that their focus is on the beer, and not the food - a bit of a shame for people that can't drink though. Putting the food aside, the service was impeccable, and when I asked if I could have a non-alcoholic Caesar I was told that this would not be possible since only beers were being served, but after speaking to the manager, he made it happen - which was the highlight of my night! 

I highly recommend you check this place out if you are a big beer lover (which I am...sigh), or if you need a large venue.

Shout out: Alison our waitress was amazing! And Brett, the manager went out of his way to get me a virgin cocktail. :)"}
{"text":"Score: 3.5/5 
Excellent selection of beer on tap. Lovely enough  normie space with fun, loud, upbeat music (though not so loud as to impede regular conversation). Try the beer flights; we had the domestic selection (they change each week) & it allowed us to encounter some tasty new Ontario brews. It's not the best (coolest/most interesting) spot in town, but decent for the area -- a crowd pleaser. If you are a craft beer fan, you'll probably enjoy. Lots of screens."}
{"text":"Huge capacity and colossal decor. Great place for work lunch. Service is great and on time. Food was surprisingly good for an establishment that specializes mostly in craft beer. Oh and the beer selection is very unique too. Lot of local ontario brewers to choose from. Will definitely come back here, possibly with a bigger crowd."}
{"text":"This restaurant is super cool, good service and great beer. But I had the rice shrimp curry dish and it was awful I could barely eat it, and just ate the shrimp. The rice was floating in sauce and it was almost soup, I was going to send it back but I was out with my boss and didn't want to be that person. Other ppl in my group had the burgers which looked amazing and the wings looked good too. I recommend sticking to the regular pub food options and stay away from the curry rice."}
{"text":"If you love beer you will love this place! It has the most extensive beer menu I have ever seen and they offer samples of most beers before you order. I'm usually not a fan of beer but I liked some of the sweet/tangy/fruity/sour variations they had. Of course I had to get the Fruli float too which is practically a dessert. There is something for everyone and it's a huge place with lots of seating and some nice decor."}
{"text":"I would give Craft a 4 or 4.5 if it was located in Brampton. A 5 Star if it was in Barrie. It is kind of a tourist trap, but very clean, efficient service and not bad value if you research the menu. Especially on Mondays when the good sized apps are $9.  A lot of money has been put into this Craft so it stands to reason that they play to all potential customers including families. Not a hipster in sight when I was there for a full evening of apps and pints. Although the \"pints\" are similar in size to a standard can of beer volume."}
{"text":"A couple of us showed up around 5.00pm on Saturday afternoon and asked for a table for 6 people. The others hadn't shown up yet. The staff was very accomodating and friendly. Even though the place was full we got a table and no pressure. When two extras turned up, the staff found a way to fit us all in. I enjoyed the Crispy Grilled Cheese and Bacon. The Mediterranian Salad with chicken was also very good and of course the beer selection is great. A typical sports bar/pub. Loud and difficult to talk with friends but with multiple TV screens there is a  variety of sports to watch. A good place to spend a few hours with friends."}
{"text":"In town for a couple days on business.  This became our favorite hangout.  So many beers on tap (100+)...which was great.   The crispy chicken sandwich with hot sauce AND Maple syrup was so good.  Poutine was tasty and the the keg lid full of nachos wasn't bad either.  Solid bar to hang out at late at night.  (2am on a Thursday night)."}
{"text":"Atrocious service!
Called to make reservations. Hostess said \"Sure\" and put me on HOLD for 7minutes. Then another Hostess picked up and said NO, no more reservations today??? But they have plenty of room... came in and NO room... not even at bar! 
There are hundreds of restaurants in Toronto, and more than a dozen gastropubs! There were four around the same area even! For a place to be so rude and obnoxious and refuse reservations is ridiculous. They are not  going to get my money just on principle of bad first impressions! Shame!"}
{"text":"After making a reservation and the restaurant giving my table away after 13 minutes instead of waiting the promised 15 I wasn't expecting much. However, the service was fantastic, the drinks were decent and the food was tasty.  We had the Korean short ribs, lettuce wraps, fast food sushi and fish tacos. The tacos has a little too much stuffing but were still good. The fast food sushi was interestingly tasty. I would order it again. Overall, a little pricey for some beers (a pint of Guinness was $11 incl. tax) but definitely a better option than batch. 

Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Great spot to go for after-work dinner and drinks! Still can't believe how such a large venue gets so packed (was there with 3 friends on a Wednesday!), so definitely make a reservation if you want to ensure you get a table. Their food was awesome (not pictured here were the wings and ice cream sandwiches we also got) and a huge beer selection. The servers were also all extremely sweet, which added to the experience. 

They also have a policy for birthdays, where you get a % discount off your meal equivalent to how old you are turning."}
{"text":"Huge selection of on the tap beers. Liked the blanche de chambly and Kronenbourge. Irdered the loaded nachos and fish tacos. The sides were just ok. The server made us feel at home. Liked the ambience."}
