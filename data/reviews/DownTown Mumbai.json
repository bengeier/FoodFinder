{"text":"**Update I have received a few emails and comments from friends - this place used to be under different management, and the original chef is no longer there.  With that being said the experience is not what it used to be, when it was originally called Cafe Spice**  The food here is some of the best indian food I have ever had.  The quality is great, the thing I love about this place is the chef.  He is very talented and used to own the place when it was called Cafe Spice.  The food is traditional with modern twist.  The flavours are amazing and the food you get here is better than all the other indian restaurants out there - taste, size, price."}
{"text":"I travel a lot, so I found this place close to my hotel. It was okay, not bad. Atmosphere was pleasant. I only had one dish (channa masala) so I don't want to judget too much. It was okay.  I can report that they don't take AMEX."}
{"text":"I am not sure what to make of this place. Initially I was very impressed with the decor of the restaurant, however upon being seated at the table the initial shock and awe of the splendor was soon lost due to how shabby the place had become. There were stains on the carpet by the waterfall, ditto the tablecloth (very off-putting). The menus were adorned with velvet and had once been a showpiece but they were now tatty, and ripped (mine was covered head to toe in crayon). Even the napkins were frayed. Now it has to be said that the proof of the pudding is in the eating and in that respect this place scored high marks. I was disappointed that my tikka-masalla did not come with rice, nor did the waiter tell me that it did not come with rice so I had to consume far more garlic naan than I had expected. I should note here that they took the easy way out with the garlic naan and used to garlic cubes you get from the store as opposed to actually cutting it themselves. The aforementioned waiter was pleasant but with 15 minute wait after we arrived was frustrating, especially as we were all famished. Overall for the price I give this 3 stars on the bunnymeter. I would suggest you skip the dining and order take out from this place. If you want a real dining experience there are far more opulent Indian restaurants in the area."}
