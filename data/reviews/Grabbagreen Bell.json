{"text":"Very disappointed with this restaurant.  Very disorganized, over priced for the portions received, and dirty.  It's a shame it took so long to open and will probably not make it too long.  $10.50 for a tiny salad or grain bowl is out of control.  Lettuce and rice don't cost much please give me a little more!!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this location at all. First of all I made my own salad. I asked for kale and was given spinach. I purchased the salad and a juice and it was $19.00! I don't mind spending more for clean, organic food, but this seemed way overpriced. I only had 3 items on my salad no less. I won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Quick fast casual concept where you can get a fresh juices, smoothies, wraps, bowls and breakfast on the go. I always get the Gogi A Go-Go smoothie (no shave) that is Paleo friendly and if I'm really hungry I'll get a salad. This place is GMO free, mostly organic and 100% gluten free!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious don't get me wrong but the reason I am giving this a 1 star rating is the price and the portions do not add up. First of all I am a health food junkie and a die hard foodie and realize that if you want good quality fresh food you have to pay more and I have no problem with that just give me what I paid for. I was very excited to see a new healthy restaurant open down the street from my work. The food they have meets this expectation but paying 17 dollars for a Togo box that literally fits inside the palm of your hand and is half way filled  is completely unacceptable and a rip off. It's almost comical how small this portion was.    I know plenty of healthy places where they give you what you pay for. I am very disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"We were excited to see a healthy option had finally opened up in this plaza at Tatum & Bell.  The smoothies were delicious, and we opted to have them all made without agave/sweeteners; however, they were on the expensive side at $7 each.  Unfortunately, the quinoa mac & cheese we ordered for our son from the kids menu was inedible.  The pasta was overcooked and the cheese lumpy and gluey.  It went uneaten and right into the garbage.  I saw another customer order a bowl, and it looked good but the portion was tiny.  Service was super slow as well, considering there were 2 staff working with only 2 customers in the place.  Not sure if we will return again."}
{"text":"I got my son a small smoothie, and me a large smoothie. The total came out to $16. I figured that was ok as long as the smoothie was good. My son got the Red Phoenix - it was so bland, and watery tasting. I got Looking Lucious - all I could taste was peanut butter and ice. I wouldn't recommend having a smoothie here. Hopefully I just had a bad experience, but I don't think that I'll be back."}
{"text":"Smelled weird in the shop like old garbage or burnt noodles.  Smoothies were good.  The service was decent but it was hard to enjoy it with  the bad smell and the music was super annoying."}
{"text":"Fist time at this location. Food is good but portions have definitely shrunk. Mine was all edamame barely any rice or protein. Not the friendliest location either, no greeting, thanks you's."}
{"text":"Love the freshness of the juices and breakfast hash ingredients, and the very friendly customer I continue to experience at this location of Grabbagreen. The entire crew here aims to please, and has always been friendly and helpful. Katie, Cameron, Janelle, Julie and Sam...THANK YOU for your excellent customer service! The Chicken Hash with a little brown rice added, with miso ginger sauce (on the side and a 12 oz. \"Power\" juice are my go to menu items, with the hash being a very good value. Affordable, healthy eating..."}
{"text":"Gave it a 1 star because 0 stars was not an option. Ordered the hot Sonoran breakfast sandwich. It was served 3 times cold, the quinoa cakes were still frozen...the kid making them said \"it was just the foil wrapper\". When I asked him if they keep the foil in the freezer? He looked at me like I was stupid. I told him neither do I. Finally the 4th time, they made a mediocre  $7 breakfast sandwich. Not worth the money nor the wait time...boo....grabbagreen."}
{"text":"Finally this place opened! I was passing it during construction works every day and was very pleased to find it finally opening last week. When I entered in the morning to get one of their Acai cups I was greeted very welcoming. They apologized in advance that they are still learning. But my cococabana cup was ready in no time and very delicious! I came back couple of days later to get a smoothie and was not disappointed either. I Smoothie on the spot!! I will be back for the rest of their fabulous and healthy items."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I just recently tried it and I got the 'fab and fruity 'it was so good ! Kinda pricey but amazing smoothie and nice people who work there , I had to come back and get another !"}
{"text":"2 stars are for customer service everyone that works here is really sweet and I honestly feel a little bad for them I don't see that place lasting when you have places like Nekter & really if you own a Nutri bullet. First let's start with the prices completely out of control for this area the fact that you do not have options for sizes is totally ridiculous I have tried to freeze half of the drink and it does not freeze well at all it's just a yucky icy mess once it thaws. Today I ordered the cacao / coffee smoothie a much better version of it at nekter is the choc/date smoothie. There should be a creamy quality to it but clearly they are putting way too much ice or water in the recipe I see you Grabbagreen with your trying to fill up the huge cup by packing in the ice! Also the breakfast is nasty they use some sort of a weird fake egg substitute unacceptable at these prices. Much better places have tried and failed such as modern Grove down the street their food quality was amazing and they recently went out of business. Sorry but I think this all show little substance very cutely decorated mostly ice with a few ingredients smoothie joint will be next"}
{"text":"They Grabbagreen alright! Over $12 for a silly little salad, and they still forgot my dressing then just dumped way too much on top. I'm trying MAD Greens next time. I thought all these places were the same, guess I'll find out."}
{"text":"Your out of your dam mind !!!!   Ok eating healthy should not be such a rip off. My husband did his own salad picking what he wants. You get 1 leaf 1 protein  I think 3 other choice of stuff well my husbands orders like 3 to 4 extra things and a extra protein  I pick what my allowable choices. The bill was 34.00. And when they gave me these 2 little boxes with both with the same amount of salad   Ok if my husband salad had more then 4 extra items it should've been bigger or when big freaken salad for 15.00   Enough for 2 days. Salad tasted good but not for the price.  The Stuff was so chopped up that it look like it was ran through the blender   I think it had 2 table spoon of blended chicken. Give me a break.  Please give me a honest review people cause I do !!!!!    The small box they put your salad to go is half full    Nope sorry not worth it   Oh for the fake reviews other then mine. Be honest if not to yourself at least to other people"}
{"text":"So I love this place but today was just beyond frustrating. I ordered two meals, paid,sit down to wait and then five minutes later I'm contacted by the employee that they are out of the item we ordered (Moroccan Mac). The employees were \"dingy\" and air headed, made no attempts to rectify the situation or add anything for the inconveniences they caused. They just stared at us until we ordered something else.   As a business owner I feel sorry for who owns this place and left these two in charge. Seems more and more this is the case business to business. #shouldhaveateathome"}
{"text":"It was pricey for what we got.  I don't think we had much of an expectation but it wasn't what we expected.  The food was ok, but the fresh juice, even though expensive, was pretty good."}
{"text":"Only got a salad from here, but it wasn't really worth my $10. Dressing wasn't very good and a little too spicy with no warning at all. Associates were just goofing around in the back the whole time. They only have kale and spinach for green options. Probably wouldn't return unless I am desperate for a salad."}
{"text":"Hmmm, website says open til 9, just went by at 8:15, doors were locked and employee was cleaning up. The website should reflect the accurate closing time. I drove out of the way to come ty this for the first time and am disappointed now!"}
{"text":"Great options and friendly atmosphere for those that are new to the Eating Green World. First time here and my vegan choice was pretty good. Brought my 5 year old and her vegan meal was good too. She enjoyed it.  Im a fan will come back. The rule of thumb for marketing is plates starting from $9 for the customers sweet spot. Their plates start at $10.5."}
{"text":"I can't take this location anymore. For the 4th time they forgot to put sauce on my Grab Your Own. In addition there were 4 tiny pieces of chicken and no red pepper, which I ordered and then heard the cashier confirm. This is the most inconsistent location I have ever experienced. I go to the Shea and Frank Lloyd Wright locations as well and I have never had a problem there. This is the closest location to my office so I don't know what to do. I'm six of throwing away $11 on half complete boxes."}
{"text":"Good healthy food. The menu has a diverse blend of international flavors, the smoothies are wonderful, and they open at 7am! Where else can you get food this quality that early? Service has been quick and friendly, with some hiccups months ago when they first opened. I think its a good concept--it works for me and my schedule."}
{"text":"Pros: Exceptional customer service Healthy, fresh food Pretty darn tasty  Cons: A bit slower than your average fast casual restaurant  A tad pricey  My second time here, my food came out and it was still cold but the kid working was obviously new so it's understandable"}
{"text":"My husband really likes grabba green. He appreciates that it's a healthy to go option."}
{"text":"I go here primarily for the fresh pressed juice! All combinations are fantastic! Definitely pricey for the size though... also, my orders don't always come out right. For instance, I like to order a full cup of juice with ice on the side, yet my cup still gets half filled with ice.  Good place for convenience, but if you're just looking for a smoothie or pressed juice, I'd recommend driving an extra few minutes to Paradise Juice.  Update: stopped by for a green juice early this morning and was so pleased with my quick, friendly service. Also, when I requested ice, my drink was put in to a large smoothie cup rather than the normal smaller juice cups. I appreciate the thoughtfulness. Join the rewards program, it's easy to get $1 off your order! Worth it"}
{"text":"Oh my Gosh! Love the concept and it's exactly what I was looking for since I'm very careful about what I eat because of my training and food sensitivities. It's reasonably priced and I love that they even have mini desserts that help satisfy my sweet tooth with little to no guilt. Love the options and menu! Breakfast, muy, dinner, dessert, snacks, smoothies, and elixirs. Way to go grabbagreen!"}
{"text":"Es un lugar excelente para los vegetarianos y ara quie quiera  comer bien e inteligentemente"}
{"text":"First visit. Four employees one appeared to be the manager/owner and three patrons. Ordered the on the border salad as it comes and there was not one piece of cilantro on the salad and the avocado was brown even though it was 11:00 am. Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food, I really liked the southwest grabba grain and my husband made his own. I had the SoCal before and liked that as well. Smoothies and juice are really delicious! Prices are higher but it's all clean ingredients and not surprising."}
{"text":"My first time experience today was fantastic! The lady at the front and explained everything to me. I am very pleased with the food, atmosphere and customer service"}
{"text":"Four times of bad food and drinks. First time the pasta bowl was just ok but my drink was way too sweet.  Second time my smoothie has some black substance in it . I called to ask and the lady on the phone on Heyden said the questioning black substance was coconut husk that was not blend well. I had coconut before this things were small like sesame seeds but unchewable as if I am eating plastic.  Third time my salmon and brown rice was very nasty. The fish smelled very fishy and the flavor was not fresh. Imagine eating bad fish.  Today i went for two drinks and had a chance to talk to a lady on Tatum and Bell road about my unusual smoothie. I told her about the unidentifiable black substance that mixed in my drink and described to her. She said it could be spinach or kale. Hahaha she was so naive. Spinach and Kale are vegetable but what  I found in every zip were plastic!!! I asked her if it was a black part of the coconut but she said the coconut has no black part in it.  Now that make me feel so sick and gross out!   I hope you are more careful with food and drink . I am meaning to see the improvements and want yoir business to do well. You made me so sick."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! I know many are going to knock this place down because of portion size and price, but I come here for healthy/diet purposes and convenience. I personally find this place a great option for when I need to eat something light, fresh, and healthy when I don't particularly have time and just want something quick. The smoothies are where it's at! The energy elevator is a must! Again, many people are just not realizing that they are purchasing really top quality stuff (sustainable, no GMOs, etc) and it comes at a premium. Something I'm more than happy to pay because I want to eat clean and green. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I got the red smoothie. No much fruit in it. She put a lot of ice in it. No taste at all."}
{"text":"Extremely over priced, small portions, cold brew so full of ice with only 1/4 cup of coffee. Our first and last trip."}
{"text":"Good smoothies and healthy food options, but the portions are way too small and overpriced. It's one of the few clean eating options in this area, but it's really hard to justify the price tag. You're $30+ for a couple by the time you're full before realizing you could have gone to a real restaurant."}
{"text":"Average experience. I walked in on a Sunday afternoon and the place was empty. The initial impression was a bit awkward as the two employees on duty - two young guys - stared at me without a prompt greeting. Yes, I was in my fitness clothes as I just left the gym, is that weird? Anyway, I ordered the Immunization Station smoothie with extra soy proteins and it was so so. Perhaps they were just too many ingredients I couldn't taste any of them. Not sure if I'd come back. I did feel a bit uncomfortable and the product wasn't great. Honestly, Jamba Juice, Nekter, or simply Whole Foods taste better."}
