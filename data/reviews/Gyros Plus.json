{"text":"When In Scottsdale.....  Only place to have Gyros.    Great price, great FRESH food, great service.    I went during lunch and got my food pretty quickly.   I know I will always have a great experience here.  I've been to other so called Gyros joints and have been disappointed.     I have literally tried everything on the menu and I'm giving in my review today.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Gyro in town. No question in my mind. That was amazing! I have had the regular and chicken gyros. They are both excellent!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The man at the register (I'm assuming the owner?) is always friendly, and the food is fantastic. I've had the gyros/salad, hummus, dolmas, and falafel, and they are all great. Oh--and I recently just tried the Baba Ghanouj and discovered that, although I am not a huge fan of eggplant, it is good. Although, it may be because they make it well...I might not be able to eat it at just any place.  Oh yeah, and they don't carry marinara or ranch (for my mozz sticks) or sourkraut (for my friend's Chicago dog), and, normally, I would be pretty bummed about that, but the rest of the food makes up for it; it will not deter me from ordering again. And, I discovered that mozzarella sticks dipped in tzatziki sauce are not bad!  [I am not a connoisseur of Chigaco dogs, or any other \"Chicago-style\" food, but my friend said his was very good, and that is a big deal coming from him--especially when missing the kraut.]"}
{"text":"Not great, Not bad... Gyro meat was pretty good, portions were large and I liked the Tazaki sauce. That's about it.   I'm not to familiar with \"Traditional\" Greek food but most of the Gyros I've had have the Romaine lettuce on them and this one didn't. I have also been to some places that season the frys with lemon juice and Tazaki sauce which I really like.   If you want a quick Gyro this is your place but don't expect much more... The atmosphere is ok. You wait in like to place your order and I could see where it might be difficult to find a seat during the lunch rush.   Overall I rated it 3 because everything is very basic which is good, but not great and could do a little more to be creative."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place I have no complaints-Food is Awesome People are Awesome. I always order the Greek Salad and it is great Honestly I find it hard ordering Greek Salads from other locations because I am truly spoiled and this place"}
{"text":"Real authentic Greek food. Great quality. Definitely a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Boo!!! Stale dishwater China Mist iced tea. Had to dump it. Ordered a salad that took 15 minutes to prepare because the chicken wasn't prepared for the lunch rush.  No personality behind the counter. Not impressed"}
{"text":"We love this place! Everything is freshly prepared and delicious. Very authentic Greek/ Middle Eastern. The Greek salad with chicken was tasty and you get good value for your money."}
{"text":"Amazingly yummy. The chicken is so juicy and flavorful and the kafta kabobs were fresh and yummy. Definitely coming back to try more."}
{"text":"Only had to work a half day one day last week so thought I would try lunch here and see if the experience was better than dinner time was.  Unfortunately, it was even worse.    The place was pretty busy so I figured maybe I had misjudged the first time.  I ordered a gyro sandwich, falafel, and a greek salad.  Right after I ordered they loaded a new block of gyros meat onto the skewer to cook.  Unfortunately, they cut my meat off just moments after they started it so the meat was cool and had a congealed fat mouth feel.  I couldn't take more than a couple of bites.  The falafel that had been so good last time tasted like a salt lick!  Whoa boys...back off the salt shaker a bit there!  The greek salad was nothing special at all.  Finally, the ladies preparing the food look like they are simply miserable back there.  Sometimes they would call out an order when they finished it...other times the hot part of the order would sit for 10 minutes (not under any heat source) until the guy taking orders at the counter noticed it was there and called the number.   I probably won't be back as I had nausea the rest of the day (probably from the barely warm gyro meat).  There are a lot of gyro places in the valley.  It would probably be best to go to one that shows greater care in their food prep."}
{"text":"I have been to Gyros about 5 times now for lunch and I really like this place. I typically get the chicken plate and it is always very good. The chicken is always fresh and juicy and for the $9 price you get plenty of food. It comes with a Greek salad that is very good and their yellow rice is amazing. I have also had the hummus plate which is above average and their pita sandwiches are also pretty good. The only negative would be the wait time for the food, but since they make it when you order it, that is expected. Oh and I LOVE their tzatziki sauce. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Favorite place to get a Gyro. Also they have amazing french fries! Don't know about the rest of the Menu because I would never be willing to go there and skip a Gyro. Yumm!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  I ordered 5 items and clearly said no onions multiple times.  When the order was completed I again confirmed that there were no onions by asking.  They said no there weren't.  I got home and guess what...had to throw away food because they have incompetent people working for them.  I called them and their response was that they are only human.  No apology.  No can we refund you or remake it.  Nothing.  Pathetic"}
{"text":"I was so full and satisfied after I ate a gyro, some fries, and some pita and hummus. Great meal for only around ten bucks. The gyro is so loaded with meat it's awesome, these things are huge! You can't even fold the pita closed like you can from some gyro places! (which is going to be my new basis of judging gyros henceforth) There's too much meat it won't fold over! As I was eating it, I was thinking, \"This is the best flippin gyro I've ever flippin had!\" and I've eaten at that gyro place by the Comedy Cellar in NYC. (apparently that place was supposed to have the best gyros ever. But. Meh.) these gyros were a little greasy but I didn't mind at all the pita bread was warm and fluffy and soft, the meat was succulent and juicy and tender, and I really liked the fries. It was one of my favorite meals recently. I will be eating here again, that's a definite."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out for sometime and I finally did. The size of gyro was smaller than I expected (compare to pita jungle) but also cheaper than pita jungle. I couldn't finish gyro from pita jungle, so this was good size and price. Gyro was very tasty and fries were also yummy. Staff was friendly too. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Fast & friendly service. Good place for take-out during a quick lunch break. Gyro salad was healthy & delicious."}
{"text":"Best Gyro in the entire valley by far--trust me.  I grew up in Chicago, lived in AZ for 15 years searching for a \"real\" gyro and finally found it!!  The owner is from Chicago and he knows what he's doing.   Scot O."}
{"text":"We were very impressed with the Quality / Quantity Ratio for Gyros Plus, it was excellent! I had the Kefta Plate that included 2 delicious highly skewers of ground beef, hmmm. Then a great amount of saffron tasting rice and finish off with pita with amazing flavor.  i highly suggest people give this a try.  Its a pleasure to find good quality food at a reasonable price rather than spending a lot for little...Sr Plata out  Sr Platas Granddaughter: I had the chicken pita sandwich and found that it was delicious. The dressing that they used was a nice combination with the the sandwich altogether. I was very happy and will be back."}
{"text":"I recently obliged to getting Greek Gyros for lunch with some of my coworkers, as I had passed on the offer previously. I ordered the Gyro combo.  The Gyro itself was fantastic. Well seasoned, tzatziki sauce was delicious, and the pita was soft. My only complaint was the soft/soggy fries.  I will definitely be back to try some of their platters!"}
{"text":"What a great place for gyros in Scottsdale, the prices are reasonable, the pita is fantastic, the service is great.  It's like being back in Chicago."}
{"text":"First time  visitor..the best Greek food I have ever had. I had the Greek salad with gyro meat with chicken also.  The chicken was awesome..I am glad I listened to the staff  and tried it..The gyro meat was the best I have ever had. The salad dressing and sauce were incredible..The restaurant  was very clean and the staff was very friendly. I can't wait to return to this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"If you like Greek you'll love this place. It's not big or fancy but food is to die for. It occurred to me now as I write this review I should have taken a photo of my amazing chicken salad before I devoured the entire thing...so sadly no photo but happy belly.  I found this place on Uber eats and I love Greek so I thought why not? I didn't have time to get something myself. I have been hooked since the first time. It is by far the best Greek salad with chicken out there. Yes, it even puts other well known Greek places to shame.   What makes it so much better is 1) the chicken is actually grilled fresh per order yum! 2) the homemade Greek dressing! I don't know what they put in that stuff but it's almost  as good as chocolate!    Best part all low carb healthy on everyone's diet!!  If you are in the area it's worth your time and money. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"not bad, but not good enough to make me want to go again. The biggest 'oh no' for me was that their gyros have beef & lamb mixed. This put me off. Not a big fan of mixing meats. Also does not give you the option of picking one meat or the other.   If you really want greek food & this is the only place close enough, it's fine."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here 3 times a week. The food is fantastic and the prices are low. The service is good and everyone is very friendly. You get alot of meat on the gyro. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch and ordered the gyro meal. We got a nice size sandwi h, fries and a drink.  Very tasty with lots of meat on the pita. Loved the tzaki sauce.  Their menu has loafs of Greek foods; spanicopita, donated and of course baklava for dessert. We will be back."}
{"text":"Their gyros are top notch, and their salad with grilled chicken rocks.  I want the secret recipe for their chicken marinade!!  Best gyros in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Decided to order lunch and got the chicken plate. The food was good, salad left much to be desired. The amount of chicken was about half of the gyro place I used to go to in Anthem, AZ. Also, they forgot my co-workers pita for her meal. Price seemed s bit high for the portion of meat."}
{"text":"Tho is probably my least favorite gyro place in town. The prices are a bit ridiculous and the quality is fast food at best. I was given ranch in my bag with my gyro and the meat was salt city . I won't be back"}
{"text":"Gyros Plus is my favorite Greek place that I've tried since moving to the valley. As someone born and raised in Metro Detroit, I love Greek food and all the other cuisines from home. This place is such a gem and reminds me of the amazing Greek food back home.   I've only ever tried the Chicken Pita (#5) as a combo meal here but that's really all I need. They make it to order every time. Unlike other places, the chicken gets grilled and the fries get fried only after your order and you can really tell the difference.   The pita is fresh and hot, the chicken is moist and juicy, and the veggies are never wilted. The tzatziki sauce is perfect, but they are generous with it so maybe ask for it on the side of you don't want a lot of it.  Don't underestimate this place, it's the real deal."}
{"text":"Good quality.  Good prices.  Good portions. Fast service. Excellent gyro sandwich.  What more could you want."}
{"text":"Big fan for lunch. The dressings for the salad and taziki are very good. I love the chicken salad and the Gyro meal special is a great find for a quick lunch. Also love their French fries! Beware on lunch can be a bit of a longer wait - maybe 14 tables inside and outside seating available."}
{"text":"I had the lamb and beef shawarma plate with a side of hummus. The meat was so tender and flavorful.  I honestly thought about this meal for days after. Unable to make another trip there due to where I was working.  If you get a chance, go there! If I work in this area again I will definitely be making a return trip!"}
{"text":"Came here for quick late lunch today and am so happy we found the place. Had only less then an hour for lunch and found this place to be quick place to eat and quite a find for Greek food.   This is a no frills location, small dining area, small tables, not fancy in decor and you get an up close and personal look on how they're preparing and cooking your food.  We got the Kefta combo special which came with with a nice healthy greek salad, a perfectly warm pita, a nice amount of basmati rice and 2 pieces of beautifully cooked and seasoned just right Kefta (ground beef).  Every bite was hot and cooked nicely and again perfectly seasoned. Quality and portions are healthy and if you wanted to there was enough food to be able to take home half the order. Which we did because we wanted to be able to have the rest of the meal the next day.  This a great Greek place and will def be returning."}
{"text":"So good!  It can be busy at lunch but they are quick and its worth the wait.  The hummus and grilled chicken is my fav!  and I am picky when it comes to hummus.  I go here at lest once a week!"}
{"text":"Greek Gyros is my go-to spot when I want a healthy(ish) lunch near my office.  Their gyros are good but unremarkable. I don't mean that in a bad way, I just mean they don't stand out compared to other places in town. Their Dolmas are good, but I wasn't overly impressed with their hummus.  What I find myself ordering most often is their grilled chicken, either on a pita, salad or the plate (with rice and salad). The seasoning is so flavorful and they grill it up to a juicy perfection. If you do order chicken though, be prepared to wait up to 10 minutes for it, as they are grilling it to order and it takes much longer for them to prepare than the gyros they churn out quickly."}
{"text":"I grew up in Scottsdale moved and traveled all over and still this is my number one place get a Gyro, and the Gyro Salad is amazing.  It's not the most visually appealing place to walk into but the owner has always made improvements when needed.  But the food speaks for itself!  The owner always recognizes my family and I each time we go in and always makes an effort to shake a hand and say hello."}
{"text":"I had eaten a pork souvlaki here before so when we wanted to get our Greek-on, this is the place I recommended.  Here's how it went:  Gyro:   hubby said it was a 2.  Found the meat to be a tad salty and somewhat dry.    Pork Souvlaki:  Had lots of pork in it, but the slices were super thick and had no char on them.  Plus,the meat needed to be cut against the grain to avoid the shoe leather effect.  Since it was not, it was difficult to eat... had to tug on it which limited any enjoyment I could have gotten from it.  (Half of it is still in the fridge.) I found it to be excessively garlicky too.   The green yogurt sauce which came with it was delicious.   Vegetarian Platter:  Hummus was a 5, Babaganoush was a 5, Dolmadas a 5, but the falafel was a 1.  Falafel was super dry.  This dish came with a pita which as pillowy soft and a nice thickness.  The portion was small for $6.95 since there were only a few tablespoons of the soft items.    French fries:  Were too greasy to eat.  We put them in the oven hoping to drain some of the fat, but that did not work.    Were really disappointed in our meal.   The young lady who took our order was lovely even though I was concerned that her hair was all over the place and could end up in our food."}
{"text":"Food was tasty but average.  Fallaful could have used a little more seasoning.  Lamb was tasty.  Service was very attentive though.  Will probably come back.  Didn't really have an issue with the place, just didn't stand out.  Prices are reasonably though.  You can get a sandwhich, fries, and a drink for $8."}
{"text":"This is the only place I've tried gyros at ..The prices are pretty fair..The food is great..It's usually not to busy, but today is.They have a small seating area. The young lady that works here is very friendly and has a beautiful smile that makes you glad you came in..And also makes you want to come back..I always get extra sauce which cost extra..The daily combo meal is less then $10.."}
{"text":"A hidden Gem the food is amazing and the prices are too would definitely recommend this place to friends and family. I used to live in Chicago where they have some of the best Gyros shops around and this place is right up there. Btw try the Chicken!!!"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets!!! The food is AMAZING.  It's cooked to order, fresh and quality product.  I have eaten at a thousand different greek places and this one just hits the mark every time.  The prices are reasonable, the portion sizes are huge and the place is clean and friendly.    The location itself if small and at lunch time this place is packed so seating is a bit hard to find and it is easy to drive right by as it is in a strip mall surrounded by nothing that is in business any longer.  All of that aside, it's worth it.  I get either the Gyro special or a chicken salad, the chicken is really great. The bf always gets the chicken plate and it comes with so much food, and a salad and a side of pita and rice for like $9.  Do it, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Quality gyros for quality prices.  I am a huge lover of Greek food, especially gyros. I've been to almost all Greek locations in Scottsdale to satisfy that craving. I've got to say, this is in my top two choices.  Ordering a classic gyro will give you plenty of succulent meat. The salads will have just the right amount of dressing, a problem I've seen at plenty of other Greek restaurants. You can't go wrong with the value meal, with the gyros sandwich, fries, and a drink. The dinner platter is equally worth it, coming with an excellent rice pilaf and a mini salad.  Thankfully this location is near my house, so I try to frequent it at least once a week after work. I've taken friends and family, and they all love it! If you're in the mood for a low key bite of Greek flavor in Scottsdale, I'd put my vote here."}
{"text":"Good gyro; needs more tzatziki sauce (they offer \"extra\" sauce for 35 cents but really the regular gyro has too little). Good fast service."}
{"text":"Not a fancy place. They do make up for that with GREAT FOOD. My husband and I love to eat here once every other week. always Fresh food and Awesome salads. Great service.. Yummy. Our go to for a Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a month. Can't go wrong with their Gyro Combo. Traditional Gyro sandwich, fries and a drink for about $8. Fries are always hot, food is fresh and quick."}
{"text":"This place is amazing it always hits the spot after you eat there.. The chicken is amazing the gyros is amazingly cut into thin juicy pieces.. This place is an automatic 5-Star joint.. One more thing the people are amazingly friendly and have a great sense of humor.. If you haven't tried it you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome chicken pita here yesterday. Food was great, service was a little slow though. I liked the patio seating!"}
{"text":"Found this place after taking a wrong turn.  Ate in and had the gyro plate and small drink for $10."}
{"text":"Food was amazingly delicious. Steak was full of flavor and the pita was amazing. Great service too"}
{"text":"Simply put: Good Food.  No frills.  This place has a steady line out the door at lunch time - even in the hot weather. So worth it. Fair price for great tasting authentic food."}
{"text":"We are from LA and dont have a lot of greek food there.  We came to Scottsdale for the weekend and decided to try their food (be adventurous you know) and we're glad we did. Their food is really good, everyone is super nice and their prices are decent."}
{"text":"Got the gyro and side of rice. My gosh!! This was so delicious! The meat was seasoned so well and the pita bread was perfect. I will definitely be coming back again. Much better than anything you could get at the pita jungle"}
{"text":"I especially loved the hummus and falafels...everything was good and the servings are more than adequate...due to the sonsoon weather it was a little warm inside but overall I would recommend eating there or take out which seemed most popular."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I come here regularly.  There may be some confusion because the previous name was Greek Gyros and now is Gyros Plus.  Everything is the same but the name.  Same excellent food and service.   I usually get a gyro sandwich or Greek salad with gyro meat.  I usually get take out.  If you want a great local Greek restaurant this is the place"}
{"text":"i originally went here bc i was in the mood for kabobs.  but the gentleman working seemed to have no clue what i was talking about. i always thought greek places served awesome kabobs! WHAATT  anyway, i decided to go for the greek salad instead and oh my golly.....so dang good.  they really load you up with all the wonderful ingredients that make a greek salad amazing. the chicken was quite tasty as well! another great lunch spot near work."}
{"text":"In the Scottsdale Airpark is a little gyros place. It's probably the best place up there for just standard gyros and a good way to get a little change from the regular old traditional restaurants. So that's why today I decided to hit Greek Gyros up.    I ordered the Gyro Value Meal. It comes with a gyro sandwich, french fries, and a fountain soda. The gyro is quite tasty. It's freshly cut off of one of those rotating gyro meat cookers, which is key for gyro sandwiches. The tzatziki sauce has little bits of cucumber in it which makes it really good. I like to order an extra side of sauce for mine.  Their french fries are pretty good. They are much like french fries you find in a lot of these gyro places, kind of like smaller steak fries.   All in all, Greek Gyros is a yummy place and a great value."}
{"text":"First Gyro is years and delicious chicken and just the right amount of dressing and not too many onions and perfect fresh lettuce. Will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Solid.  Tons of flavorful meat and very good tatziki sauce adorn a nice fresh, warm pita.  A gyro with fries and fountain drink runs $7.25 and it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Called in an order for lunch. The gal on the phone wasn't very friendly but understood my order just fine :)  Ordered the fried mushrooms and a falafal pita. Went to pick up the order, two gals were in the cook area. Again, no one oozed a whole lotta friendliness or customer service abilities. Was almost $11 for the two items.   The pita was ho-hum. Maybe I'm just spoiled but the pita tasted store bought and not very soft or fluffy. The falafal was was a bit on the dry side and too salty. The fried mushrooms were kinda icky :(. Tasted like a frozen item that was fried thick until the outside is HARD and can make knocking sounds. Their cucumber sauce was not too bad but REALLY thick but had a nice cucumber flavor and the ONLY thing I got that in any way resembled homemade.   For my lunch, I think I will stick with the $7 lunch specials from Eden's Grill, ty very much. :/  Now if I could just get over the fried food coma  O.o"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it was great!   My suggestion: if you want a good, filling lunch (without feeling like a stuffed pig) go with a friend and order the Greek salad with gyro meat on top. It comes with pita and it's so much food it can easily be split :)  Little small inside but yummy food :)"}
{"text":"Great little gyros joint run by what appears to be a real Greek family. The $9'ish gyros plate comes with plenty of food. The rice and salad were the highlight of my meal. There was a little grissle in my meat slices, but maybe that means it's authentic... I wouldn't know as I have never been to greece. It still tasted damn good. Fair warning, the last time I went there for lunch it was very busy and all the tables were full. Several customers ended up eating while sitting on the sidewalk. Maybe it will slow down when all the snowbirds head home."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but good experiences here. This is one of the closest things to a Chicago-style gyro shop that I've been to in the valley, and their food is great!   Recently I decided to make it my mission to find the best gyro in the valley, and I'm slowly making my way through all of the spots. With that said, I'll post a special \"Gyro Review\" in each review.  ***********************************************  Gyro Review:  Fantastic! One of the best in the valley! I'm not even kidding... They do things the \"right\" way at Greek Gyros. Their gyros are classic: meat, tomato, onion and tzatziki. After they shave the meat, the rest it on the grill for a little bit to brown it up some, and this makes a HUGE difference. This is the way I grew up eating gyros back in Chicago, and it's still the way I like it now. Biased? Yes. Flavorful? You best your taste buds! Their tzatziki is also really good, though probably not the best in the valley. I think it need just a tad bit less thyme or more yogurt...not sure. On the whole though, a superb gyro. Two thumbs up!   ***********************************************  Greek Gyros also has a great souvlaki. It's tangy and lemony and all around delicious. If you're not feeling like a gyro or haven't had souvlaki, try that. I've yet to try too much from there, but in time I will. I'm always tempted to go straight for those two sammiches though. One last thing I'll mention is their side salad. It's a great size and their dressing is perfectly Greek!  Go enjoy a great gyro already!"}
{"text":"We've been coming to this place for years, often it is before a weekend movie for a quick dinner. The vacancies around them since the Great Recession should not intimidate you.  The Gyros is the best in town, and they are always happy to see you.  They have lasted so long because of loyal customers who know a good thing when they taste it. Try taking home a side of Gyros meat and heat it up with scrambled eggs in one pan. A great Sunday breakfast. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"I have eaten gyros at this restaurant at least 1-2 times per month for the last couple of years. Have never had a bad experience! Appears to be family owned and operated with a warm atmosphere. Best gyros I have ever eaten!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best pick a meat salad EVER!!! I personally pick the chicken, and the dressing is perfect! This is truly a hidden treasure. I had no idea it existed and now, I can't stop!"}
{"text":"Good place to go and eat gyros if your up in North Scottsdale. The staff is friendly and the food gets to you real fast. The price is somewhere between 7-10 per meal but that's usual for N. Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wonderful gyro! This is the first one i've had outside of Chicago and I absolutely adored it. The sauce is fabulous and I could actually taste the dill. It was just enough and I wasn't stuffed. I will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This place is usually awesome...today was a fail. We showed up at 6:37 to pick up a few gyros. There was a sweet elderly couple eating at a table outside. A female employee was picking up the chairs WHILE the couple was eating. The whole environment was so unfriendly that we ran away. The sweet couple made a comment to us about how rude the situation was. Assuming you lost them as customers too."}
{"text":"Always amazing even tho super busy at lunch. I usually gave the chicken pita or the chicken dinner with rice. Portions are good."}
{"text":"My work isn't very far from here, so we order here a couple times a week. Great food, great price. Can't go wrong with the classic, gyro, fries and soda for their lunch plate.   The place is always busy and there's a reason for it!"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday at the peak of the lunch rush. The place was certainly busy with folks dining in and getting take out, though my order was taken quickly by a very warm and friendly person and I was able to grab a table.  I ordered the chicken plate (see picture). The rice was fluffy, the chicken was well marinated and tender and the salad was fresh and big. The pita bread was the only big miss since it wasn't as fresh as I'd like."}
{"text":"Bring on the MEAT! The gyro here is jam packed with tender and succulent, seared bites of beef and lamb seasoned with zesty spices. You can see it being broiled from the counter. The pita bread is barely big enough to hold it all in with the onions, tomatoes and tzatziki sauce. The \"steak gyro special\" came with piping hot fries and a drink for about 8 bucks. It's the same as the regular gyro on the menu, so I was told. I was craving something on the healthier side, *not* a chain or sit-down restaurant. Luckily I spotted them from Northsight, right next to the Title Boxing Club. Do yourself a favor and check them out when you're in the area."}
{"text":"Ok for gyro's. Not great, Not bad. Just meh. But it's really hard to find good gyro's here in the valley. Don't know why."}
{"text":"Skip everything else on the menu and head straight to the Gyros. I love the Gyros here. They give you a bunch of meat with the right amount of tomatoes, onions and tzatziki sauce. So far, these are the best Gyros I have had in North Scottsdale to date. Although they are mainly a lunch place and close early in the evening."}
{"text":"I ubereats gyro pita's from here. The meat tastes fine. Sauce is great. Overall, probably around a 3.5/5 for taste. If you get it delivered, I've always gotten it lukewarm or room temperature.   BEWARE: I get ridiculously thirsty after eating here. I've had gyro's elsewhere and it only happens here. They either use way too much salt or MSG. Knocked off a star because of this. I will probably stay away eating here because of the post-meal thirst."}
{"text":"What a great spot for a quick, filling and inexpensive lunch! Been here several times for lunch breaks with the Mrs. and we've always been able to get in and out of here in a timely manner and happily full.    They have a variety of options including salads, gyro platters, or a simple gyro with fries. The food is made fresh to order and you can even sit and watch it being made through a glass divider. I like being able to see exactly how my food is handled and they whip through orders with a sense of urgency and understanding that people may want to get back to work.    There are usually a fair number of people grabbing to-go, so this seems like a good option for those who don't have time to sit and eat, but want a good hot, meal at their desk instead of the standard bagged sandwich.   I've no doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in this place for a quick bite with a networking associate. The food was very good but the service was not. This is not a friendly atmosphere. The coke dispenser was not working, and they knew about it but there was no way to know until you started to pour... then getting a new cup was another 5 minute wait in line. Once we got our meal, we asked for some additional dressing. We were advised it would be another .38 cents for about two teaspoons of the gyro dressing. That meant another trip to the register, so we took a pass. The food was good, but if they had better customer service I would drive out of my way to get there."}
{"text":"This place has a great location, super close to lots of large companies around the area and the only Greek place. Honestly though the food is average. Yeah I go here all the time, probably once a week, but everything seems super oily.... More than usual.  Anyway if I were to recommend something get the grilled chicken platter, definitely worth your money with all the food it comes with..  If your feeling wild, get the fries they are awesome!"}
{"text":"Happened to be in North Scottsdale a few week so ago and stopped in with my mom and sister. It was delicious. Had a chicken gyro with fries, taziki sauce was so good I bought extra to dip the fries in. The fries were surprisingly good, extra crispy like they were double fried or something. The chicken gyro was just the right size and meat was tender and delish. Unfortunately I don't go in the area much, but if I do I'll be stopping in for lunch for sure."}
{"text":"Great parking. Its a little hidden off the main shopping area but in the center of the megastores.  Food was good and Gyro seems the the specialty but a mix of food types. Prices good and I'll do it again."}
{"text":"Situated in a strip mall and tucked away in a plaza you will find this hole in the wall Greek restaurant. It's a super tiny shop so don't bring a whole gaggle of people.   They have an enormous menu, full of traditional Greek food, salads, and baklava. They make the food right in front of you behind a glass enclosure so you can see just how the food is prepared with the fresh ingredients.   The food is fantastic! We ordered two gyros with Greek fries and some hummus. Let's just say the gyros were loaded with meat and no lettuce (thankfully) and the pita bread was warm and chewy. The hummus was a bit oily but very tasty.   The prices are super reasonable (there is an up charge for Greek fries with a combo meal). You bus your own table and refill your own drinks.   If you're in the area and craving Greek food, I definitely recommend popping in to Gyros Plus!"}
{"text":"Chicken Pita and Humus with Chicken --- Soooooo Good!!! I got everyone at my work, super addicted lol.  The Gyro is also good.  Chicken Pita - The chicken is marinated, with a perfect blend of spices.   The Pitas are also well made, not sure if they are store bought or not. Owner and his family is super nice and always seem to cater towards their customer.  I am very happy they have decided to partner with UberEats.  Thanks to UberEats, I can have this awesome deliciousness whenever my heart desires - Zia"}
{"text":"Very tempting to give a 5 star.  The gyro was excellent.  They make their own baklava here it was one of the best I've had, most places get theirs from a bakery somewhere and it's usually dry or dripping in Honey syrup theirs is neither it was just right.  My wife had the vegetable pita and loved it.  I need to note that the pitas were really good also, nice and light not tough at all.  The only issue, it is a small place and very busy so tables don't get cleaned fast enough.  All and all we'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. After visiting Greece and searching for something to replicate how the Greek make gyros... I must say, this place does a great job.   The staff is very friendly...I'm going to guess and say family owned. Plenty of Franks Red hot to go around, never knew how good a gyro was until I sprinkled some Franks on it.   At first, I thought the price was a little high, but then, after I had finished my meal, I couldn't have been happier. Well worth the $7.00. The best part of the meal was the amount of taziki sauce was just perfect! This restaurant has become a staple in my local lunch spots, especially when I want to sit outside and enjoy a peaceful lunch on a busy day.  A must try if you love gyros."}
{"text":"A great little place.  I always get the Gyros value meal and have them add feta cheese to the gyro ($1 extra).  The meal comes with great fries and an overloaded pita with Kronos branded meet off of their vertical broiler.  I'm pretty sure it's the lamb/beef original recipe.  Kronos is something I've looked for after moving to the Scottsdale area and this was the first place I found it.  The owner is extremely friendly and willing to strike up a conversation.  I've had nothing but pleasant interactions and experiences at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place for a Gyro. The lunch special is priced right and fills me up, which is rare without adding something to it. Food is hot and fresh every time."}
{"text":"Do you know how to pronounce Tzatziki? Thanks to Youtube, I know now.. Tza tzeekeee....z is pronounced tsi or tzi. It just took me 20 years before I decided to look up on how to pronounce.    Ever since I learned how to pronounce Gyro as my college had a little Gryo shop a very long time ago, I became a fan of Gyro. I ran into this place several years ago and I keep coming back here whenever I am in the area and I recently learned why I like them here so much. It's their Tzatziki sauce. Oh the meat is good too but this sauce I didn't know how to pronounce for a while makes so much difference.   I also like their falafels. They way they were served does not make it look authentic but it sure tastes good to me. I didn't grow up eating Greek, so I can't tell the difference between authentic and what not, but whatever they serve here, it sure does satisfy my appetite. My another favorite dish here is stake combo plate. Love that rice and flavor to the beef.  Great place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Large portions of good food at reasonable prices.  I get their gyro platter combo and it's fantastic."}
{"text":"BEST GYROS IN PHX!! Clean, friendly, fresh, quick and delicious; there's no one I don't bring here for GOOD Greek food!!"}
{"text":"Come here often, treated like family. Forgot my wallet, was told don't worry about it. Foods fresh, doesn't get better! Thank you"}
{"text":"This little spot is great for a delicious meal anytime! I usually get a 2 meat salad w souvlaki and chicken w a little extra tzadziki. I love it so much I'll crave it for days if I don't submit to my Gyros Plus urge.  All pita sandwiches are good. And the staff is very nice. I'd recommend highly. Didn't give it 5 stars because it's a casual local eatery in a strip mall near Home Depot."}
{"text":"O...M....GYRO!!!! One of the best gyros I have ever had. Moist and full of flavor. It was phenomenal. Seemed like all the lovely women working were Greek? Defiantly try this place out. Wish there was one in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Always get the Chicken or lamb gyro. This place is by far my favorite place for greek food valley wide! I have tried a lot of places and nothing compares! Owners are always very nice and always remember me."}
{"text":"This place has amazing gyros. The fries are good and crispy as well. That is all I have tried, but it's a gyro place so it's the review that matters. Why else would you go there :). I will continue coming back. Great for a post workout feed after finishing at EOS across the street. Easy location. Great customer service every time."}
{"text":"It's not bad but lacks the flavor of some of its competition.  I came here a few times before writing this.  Portions are decent but lacks flavor with zing that Greek food is known for.  Had the Gyro salad.  Sparse feta cheese and Italian dressing.  Yuck.  Gyro meet is meant for creamy dressing.  They operate on a numbers system so feels like a factory waiting for your bingo food number.  Gyro combo meal is good though, fries were great previously."}
{"text":"Just always good!  Love the menu in pictures ... Great courteous service  Eat here and enjoy"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic Greek fast food. Everything was cooked to perfection, the food was prepared quickly and tasted great. I can't wait to go back and try their Italian Beef and Chicago Hot Dogs.  If you're looking for fast Greek Food, Greek Gyros will hit the spot!"}
{"text":"We have a lunch spot to add to our rotation!  This place has won several awards for their gyros, and it's no wonder why that's the case!  It's a smaller eatery and there are a limited number of table, but we arrived a bit before the regular lunch crowd and found a seat with no problem on the inside.    We both ordered the gyro special which came with fries and a drink for $7.75 (pics available).  The gyro was packed full, and not just with toppings and sauce, but there was a ton of lamb meat on it as well, which was very filling.  The fries were cooked perfectly and tasted great with a touch of ketchup - my favorite fry topper.    The staff was friendly and greeted all of the customers that came in warmly and moved the line quickly so if someone was in a hurry to get back to work, it didn't take them long to order and get back to the office.  We are thrilled that we can add a new place to our rotation throughout the month for lunch time eats!  Overall: A+ Friendly staff with a sense of lunchtime urgency to really take care of the customer.  Great food that is filling and a deal for the price point.  Try to snag one of the few seats outside and enjoy a lunch break outdoors!"}
{"text":"Greek Gyros is a nice little dive... that is easy to overlook when driving by. I enjoy the gyros they make. I have not really tried anything else but the gyros.   My only critique is that nothing here is \"homemade\".... everything appears to be \"prepared\" in a factory somewhere else. Not that is a \"bad\" thing... but this place is not entirely cheap for what you get.   All that aside... the gyros I have had only several occasions are delicious. The fries are good.   I like it... and I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Will never go back. When I asked for water was told no because \"we are out of water cups\"...Styrofoam cups were on counter...offered to buy a cup for water...\"no...buy a bottle of water if you want water\". Spent 30.00 for two salads and some dalmas with water...there are so many other choices in the area why would I go back there for that kind of service and mediocre food too?"}
{"text":"Liked but didn't love the chicken plate. Wish they allowed substitutions.. I'm on a diet and rice isn't quite on it so I ate the chicken and little pieces of bell peppers. I little disappointed in the lack of marinade, but I'd come back and try something different."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat lunch and/or dinner!  My obsession is the chicken plate. You can get grilled chicken, or the type of chicken carved off the slab like the Gyro meat, in fact I also think you can get it with the Gyro meat... Anyway, I love the regular grilled chicken--it's grilled and seasoned to perfection. Then you get basmati rice, green and red peppers, warm pita and Greek salad--it's almost too much food! Seriously, try it. I would rather have this than a meal from most sit-down restaurants in town--and it's only around $10!  I also love the Gyro value meal--great Gyro meat in a warm pitta with Tzatziki sauce plus fries and a drink for $7.49. Great deal, great food.  They have lots of other choices (including burgers and hot dogs for your friends or girlfriends like mine who don't like great Greek food!), but I have never tried anything else because I love the above listed meals so much!  Check out Greek Gyros. Great food, great staff, affordable prices."}
{"text":"I started working near here last year and I've kept coming back to this restaurant for their sovlaki. Doesn't matter what kind of meat, their lemon sauce is so good, along with the friendly service of the hard working girls, don't hesitate."}
{"text":"Great Gyro joint. Came here with my Greek friend and we had a great time.  I had chicken gyro it was good, tender and juicy."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch since I love Gyros and was in the area.  The place is a small 'joint' just like I like it.  Clean, no frills.  Just fast service and good food.  Reasonable prices.  The meat was flavorful and tender, the pita was nicely toasted and the tatziki was delicious.  The only thing that could be better was the tomato.  Nothing wrong with it but some fresh roma slices or chucks would have been better. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The gyro plate is excellent. Portions are good and fair pricing. Has become a weekly lunch spot for me."}
{"text":"Apparent owner is always at register and is aware of everything in his kitchen, which is great!  Awesome gyros and the greek salad is handmade, meaning it's not pre-packaged which is my biggest gripe with some places. The can actually put extra onions and hold the tomatoes!!! Wow, what a concept. A little pricey for lunch, but then again it's NScottsdale...pita bread is soft and fresh."}
{"text":"Ok, the gyros are out of this world. We eat gyros everywhere we can find a place that looks good.  The gyro meat here is not dry, it's nice and moist and fresh.  The veggies are perfectly crisp and portioned out. The sauce is better than the average and compliments the gyro.  The pita was as fresh as it gets and slightly grilled making it nicely warm.  If you get the combo plate, which is really a good deal the french fries are really excellent and I'm not a huge fan of fries.  This is a small family owned and run place and I hope the community will do its part to continue to support this local business so we can continue having good local food."}
{"text":"The BEST gyro in scottsdale, the people are very friendly and 90% of the time they do a great job. Once in a while during the lunch rush, the food takes too long, but its only happened to me twice. I still love to eat here."}
{"text":"The first bite took me back to Chicago. So good. Not greasy. Not salty. Not too soft but not crunchy. Closest thing to eating king gyros"}
{"text":"Just ate an awesome Gyro Plate and hummus app from here! I called in the order and it was done quickly, food is piping hot and was ready in just a few minutes! I can't wait to try other items!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mediterranean place in town. I work close by and love it here...Soo good. My fav is the chicken salad. The chicken is marinated to perfection.  I crave it! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Best gyros in town. The meat is always tender and moist. Salads are plentiful and generous with the meat on gyro salad.  Great spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  Having tried Z's greek and having the worst gyro of my life, this place reaffirmed my notion that there are good greek joints in Az.  This is my go to place when in north scottsdale and gyros express is my go to place when in the shea/ scottsdale area.  The family at this place is soooo nice and accommodating.  If I could give 6 stars I would."}
{"text":"During a busy day I got a little hangry and was unable to leave. I ordered Greek Plus through Doordash. I was told I would receive my food within in an hour and I got it within 35 minutes. I got the chicken plate with rice, grilled chicken and a greek salad. My food was super fresh and hot. Lots of rice and salad, wish there was a little bit more chicken for the price."}
{"text":"My first time here.  Found a new Greek Pita favorite.  Prices are great, food was made fast.  Great value.  My gyro was so good and I took a picture of the leftover meat that was pouring out of the pita.  Taking that home.  Will be back  Edit, didn't finish review.  I've been back 2 more times in the last week.  Love their lamb.  Going to try something new next time.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Damn good gyros. One of my lunch time favorites. Always consistent. I really only get the gyro but have had the italian beef. That was good too. However, the gyros are the Benchmark for me.. Give them a try.."}
{"text":"Had a chicken gyro and was blown away. Amazing. Friend had the gyro plate and was shocked at how much food you get for ten bucks. The only bust with this place is its a sausage fest inside. Lunch time all the bros flock like pigeons. But great food."}
{"text":"Good food and nice place to go for lunch. Everything I have ordered is top notch. The service is quick for those who need to get back to work on time. A little small but you got to love family owned and operated restaurants. They are always friendly to me and smile. They're worth a visit."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of gyros, and happened by this place while driving around at lunchtime.  I've been twice, and gotten the same thing. The gyro combo (a beef/lamb meat gyro with fries and a drink). Comes to about 8 bucks, and it the perfect sized lunch.  The gyro is good, enough meat and tzatziki along with a soft, yet crispy-warm pita. The fries are fabulous. Fresh, hot and perfectly cooked.   I'd totally recommend it."}
{"text":"When you ask for NO SAUCE and to put it on the side that means no sauce and on the side. Its really annoying and ruins your evening when you have to ring out your gyro before you eat it. Not to mention it was closing as I got my order"}
{"text":"Ordered from here with door dash. SO worth it. Now I will actually go in and try out more items. Ordered the greek salad with chicken. Large portion, everything was spot on. The dressing and chicken were amazing.  OMG yumm. New favorite go to for lunch! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"i used to frequent the salad bar that used to be in this spot before they closed so i had a chip on my shoulder the first time i walked in. lucky for them i absolutely love greek food. and now lucky for me that this place exists. the food is amazing! i absolutely love the gyros, great salads and very good dolmades. if mediterranean food is what does it for you, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Five stars all the way!! Been coming here the last 3 years and it's a fav for sure! I get the chicken plate every time and it's cooked to perfection! So delicious! And it's a fair price too for all the food you get. I hope this place is around for a long time! Kudos to same friendly faces I see behind the counter each time I dine. Best place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Hello my fellow Arizonians......I'm back for another review....]  I will start as always by reminding you I am the PICKIEST person I know!  And as we well know, food is a matter of preference and I know what I like and I am a TRUE foodie...I like good food and I despise spending good money on bad food(or bad anything for that matter)  I saw this place by accident and went home and read reviews.  Although most of the reviews are positive, I was concerned to see people compared it to places with names like Gyros Express(if that is a real place).    It tells me I probably wont like it and sure enough.......  The employees were friendly and service prompt (of course we were the only ones there).  The restaurant felt like a sauna, not sure if the A/C was on the fritz or if the employees enjoy sweating.  I got the Gyros sandwich with fries and a drink for $5.75.  The price was fair but the food?  The meat was tender but to me the seasoning was too salty which took away from the flavor of the meat.  The fries were your everyday, basic, boring kind...no real taste to them.  I enjoy a chunkier  tzatziki that has that flavorful cumcumber taste which this is NOT! (just a matter of preference).  Not much more to say, nothing looked appetizing enough to make me want to return.  If you enjoy a GREAT Gyros you must try \"GEORGES GYROS\" on McKellip/Miller...I will do a review on them next so check it out!     and until you do......  Bon Appetite'"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. It was a nice surprise here in Scottsdale, you don't find too many authentic Mediterranean restaurants here in the valley and this is absolutely one of them!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's close to work, so i hit it fairly regularly. When i come here it's because I'm in the mood for Greek food, so i can't speak to their \"Chicago menu,\" but the gyros, gyro plates, and salads are all awesome. (I love their house dressing on the Greek salad. Dee-lish.) Have also tried the appetizer sampler and enjoyed most everything it came with - even the dolmas, which aren't typically my favorite. (they seemed a bit less sour the others I've had, such as Pita Jungle's, which i liked)  My usual is the chicken gyro plate, which comes with a salad, a pita (cut into 4), tzatziki sauce, and generous portions of both gyro-style chicken and rice, for (i believe) $8.95. I'm usually not a fan of gyro-style chicken, but it's always been melt-in-your-mouth tender whenever I've ordered it here. (and i can mentally trick myself into thinking i just had a \"healthy\" lunch.)  Don't know about the weekends, but weekday lunch rush will be busy. I suggest getting here before noon or just waiting until 1, if that's your plan."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh food, friendly service, I love the gyros but especially like the cheesesteak on a pita, it's great. This place has been around for a while now and Napoleon puts his all into making fantastic food!"}
{"text":"This small Assyrian restaurant is tucked in a strip mall and offers little by way of ambiance or amenities. It does, however, provide darn good food, the gyros is the real stuff and yummy. The salad, while in need of more feta and more olives, is fresh and the dressing quite nice. I loved the baba, which was strongly seasoned and had great texture. The chef and her daughter make a great team and are very nice, this is a good buy, too. We will be back and again sit outside even if that means on the edge of the parking lot. At least we can hear the boxers training in the gym next door while we stuff ourselves."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of gyros from different places and this is one of my favorites.  They load the gyro meat on and it is so flavor filled with the perfect combination of meat, tomatoes, onions and cucumber gyro sauce.  I plan to return over and over again."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good Gyros!!  make sure you ask for extra Tzatziki Sauce.    Can't wait to go back and try their shrimp.  Tough location, but it's worth finding.  Not far from Costco, Wal-Mart and Home Depot.    I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Good Gyros, we have been here numerous times and the product is always good.  You get exactly what you expect, a good Gyros."}
{"text":"How this place DOESNT have 5 stars absolutely blows my mind. I've been eating here for years and it's amazing every time! My go to is the chicken pita because they grill the chicken and it is marinated in the best sauce every! It's always tender juicy and full of flavor. The gyro is also as good as they get and the staff is always super friendly and always fast even when the line is out the door which is practically every day during lunch time. It's a delicious healthy choice and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Really good.  Our office gets lunch there every week.  It's delish."}
{"text":"I actually can't say much about the food, but I can definitely talk about the service. I received a voucher through Belly for a free gyro. When I went there on Friday to redeem it, I was told that it had to be their original gyro, the chicken was not allowed. I pointed out that it doesn't say that on the voucher, the girl just shook her head and shrugged at me. At that point, I turned around and left. Too bad, too, I was looking forward to trying the chicken gyro as they're my favorite and was planning on ordering additional sides and a drink. Her smug \"oh well\" attitude completely turned me off. I will likely not go back if this is the quality of customer service that they want to treat people with. I should add that there was only one family in there finishing up at the time and the girl was shaving meat not far from the door even though there was no one in the restaurant, so not freshly shaved."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place close to work. When you are sick of everything and can't figure out what you want, Greek Gyros is there to solve all your problems (okay, maybe just those of the hunger kind). The gyros are great and PACKED with meat for a reasonable price. I can't get enough of the tzaziki.   Co-workers have really enjoyed their salads as well (the \"pick-a-meat\" with grilled chicken). I must include a dehydration alert, though. Every time we get gyros in the office we all find that we're guzzling water for the rest of the day... that darned meat must be solid sodium!"}
{"text":"If you love gyros, you will love this place! This is a regular lunch stop for my wife and I. I always get the gyro combo for $8.50 which comes with fries and a drink and my wife likes the gyro platter. The platter is definitely big enough to share. They also have a great fish & chips combo that I keep going back for.   This is a small place and gets a big lunch crowd but definitely worth standing in line for!"}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch and so happy I discovered this place. The staff there was so friendly, The food was freshly made and the portions were a great size. I had a Gyro and a Greek salad and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This place was super busy."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and fast. Instead of Wendy's or Taco Bell you should eat here. They have delicious food and you get to know the staff and become like family"}
{"text":"Best Gyro in Scottsdale! Meat shaved perfectly thin, pita warm and fresh and sauce equally as tasty.  My new spot for my gyro cravings. Opa!!!"}
{"text":"My husband likes his traditional gyro platter but my chicken gyro platter was not as fresh as I would've liked. Also, it was more expensive that it should be given the amount of meat."}
{"text":"Place is great with a little Chicago transplant twist.  My husband is from Chicago and we decided to try this place while in AZ.  Apparently pizza puffs are all the rage in the chi (the ones here apparently met the expectation according to my husband), their Chicago dog is super tasty and the gyros are delicioso!! The place isn't awfully big but their gyros and tzatziki are the ISH!!  There are plenty of options on the menu and we certainly wish they had a place like this in the baY!!  I love some tasty Greek food and Chicago food!!  I would recommend any Chicagoan to stop in and give it a whirl!!"}
{"text":"Solid choice for lunch. This restaurant is consistently great with their food and even when at the peak of the lunch rush they still get my order quickly (which is typically for me and a coworker). You won't be disappointed eating here."}
{"text":"I had the order #1 with some hummus. Both are really good here, but stay away from the fries, the fries here are horrible. They got fuze raspberry which I really liked."}
