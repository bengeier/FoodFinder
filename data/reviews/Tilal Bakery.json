{"text":"This place is around a 15-minute drive from my workplace (so really far from where I live), but would totally make the trek cause this bakery is bomb. I've been recently introduced to Lebanese cuisine and I gotta say that the stuff they got happening at this bakery is worth any drive!

Shawarma + Meat Pie (4.5/5): I'm not sure if it's because my friend and I came alittle earlier than the lunch rush, but our shawarmas were perfect. I had the beef shawarma and all the ingredients came in the right proportions plus it was toasted to perfection. I thought the beef was well seasoned well and the pita may have been different as it didn't fall apart at all near the end of the meal! Now the meat pie. I asked what this was called in Lebanese... but I seriously can't pronounce it. So it's going to be called square meat pie. It was damn delicious. With some kind of meat + tomato filling wrapped in a crisp open top square dough bowl, I couldn't of asked for a better appetizer to my shawarma. I want more, and I want to go back, this place really impressed me!

Cost (4/5): $5.50 for a well sized and well-made shawarma + $1 per square meat pie. Definitely worth.

Service (4/5): Lots of Lebanese customers at this joint, but that doesn't mean that they treat you any different if you aren't from their homeland. In fact, I thought it was a nice touch that whether you ordered a chicken or beef shawarma the person making it for you would tell you the traditional ingredients for chicken/beef shawarma and then asked if you wanted anything more above that. Overall, a very friendly joint! 

Ambiance (3.5/5): This bakery has a huge space and although it's kind of in the middle nowhere, and doesn't have a huge focus on decor, I found it was really clean. There is the bakery on one half of the place and a large area on the other side if you'd like to sit in. No complaints here!

Altogether, I will definitely be back. No doubt about it."}
{"text":"The server was extremely friendly and helped me through my first time here. I passed this place many times on my way home from York University and I finally decided to check it out. Boy was i missing out. I tried 3 small pies. A spicy cheese, a yogurt one and another with feta and sun-dried tomatoes. While i waited for them to warm (which my server recommended) I saw a falafel wrap being made. The falafels looked amazing I will definitely be coming back to try. It costed me $4 for everything. The dough was perfect, i couldnt even save half for later."}
{"text":"They can't take big orders when asked for 3 shawarmas the chef just looked overwhelmed and even suggested something else to buy... Toppings are very limited and don't look fresh"}
{"text":"My favourite place when I'm in the mood for shawarma, falafel, or fattoush salad. The food, including the hot food and baked goods, are all delicious. As an ethnically Lebanese person, I can say the food here is as close to quality homemade as you can get - the ingredients are fresh and great quality.

Regarding the space - inside, there are tables to sit and eat, or you can quickly take out. It is very clean and usually a pretty quiet and relaxing atmosphere. Parking can be tight and a bit of an annoyance at the plaza since it's rather small. 

My only reservation about this place is that the service can be quite slow when it comes to getting some lunch. While the staff are very friendly and accommodating, it can still be bothersome waiting around for someone to take your order if there are other customers there. However, that doesn't affect my rating since the food and goods are worth the wait! I always come out of my way to eat at Tilal!"}
