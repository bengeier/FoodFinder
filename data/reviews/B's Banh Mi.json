{"text":"Omiiilord! Get your butt to B's now!   I was looking for some quick dinner ideas and remembered that B's is located very close to Bronte GO station (my stop). Currently they close at 4pm, but I called just before closing and they stayed open a few minutes late for me, ready with my order.  I ordered the Pork Bahn Mi and The Pho (the day's special). Both were amazing!  The sandwich had a perfectly crusty bun and nice crisp julienned veggies along with a deliciously glazed pork loin. I was supposed to save some for the husband to try... the sandwich didn't make it.   The pho is so good. It's perfect; the broth, the noodles, the perfect sprinkle of cilantro and along with tender chicken pieces. Its also a really large portion. My husband and I were able to split one pho for 2 lunch-sized portions (although my husband wanted more because it tasted so good).   Reasonably priced for such awesome quality. You can taste the love. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"If you're craving a good Vietnamese sandwich or even some pho, you'll def love B's Banh Mi. It's a bit tucked away, but if you're near bronte station it shouldn't be hard to find. We had the traditional chicken sandwich and spicy pork meatballs, both tasty and a hefty portion. The chicken was seasoned, soft and you get a big portion for what you pay. Their pho (which they only serve a few days a week as part of their daily special) also wasn't super oily and you get tender pieces of meat. My only wish was that they were open later or on the weekends."}
{"text":"Just came back from lunch at B's (first time there) and it was very good. He persuaded me to try the soup special (Wonton Wednesday) with bok choi, pork, wontons, and noodles and it was delicious and filling. I cant wait to go back and try their other sandwiches they have. They all looked very good. I wanted to order a sandwich after my soup because it looked amazing but I had no room to eat anything else.  Will Recommend."}
{"text":"nice place   they pay attention to freshness here  i recommend the:  MEATBALL SUB (sooo juicy)  and their Chilli is the bomb.......gonna go back this week during my lunch break"}
{"text":"Tasty sandwiches with quality toppings and meat  Not my favourite Pho ever but I would order it again  Everything in the wonton soup special tasted great and worked well together  Great value overall and fantastic lunch hours"}
{"text":"Love it the service is excellent and the perfect location. Great place in oakville will definitely come back and the price is perfect"}
{"text":"It's no wonder this place has a 5-star rating, it's just excellent. I came here for lunch today and the owner was really welcoming when he heard it was my first time. He walked me through the menu and made a recommendation when I asked about two menu items. As per his recommendation I ended up ordering the chicken banh mi. He said he'd bring it out to me when it was prepared. My sandwich with a bottle of water was about $10. Awesome value.  This banh mi was absolutely delicious. The chicken (I believe thighs) was so moist and flavourful with amazing grill marks on it. The vegetables were all fresh and tasty and just the perfect amount (all right, I would have liked more cilantro, but that's because unlike everyone else on the planet I'm a HUGE cilantro fan). The bread was the perfect crusty french baguette.   I love a baguette, I love chicken, I love vegetables and spicy mayo. Put that all together and you have the most satisfying lunch you'll ever eat. I seriously wish I lived right beside this place. I'd be here all the time.  You wouldn't think you'd find an awesome restaurant like this in the midst of Oakville's car dealership district, but here it is. It's worth the drive from anywhere. I'm certainly going to be back to try the pork banh mi."}
{"text":"I found the bahn mi sandwich really filling and delicious. I had the chicken sandwich. The service was prompt and the staff were very friendly. The interior of the shop was very clean and modern. I would return."}
{"text":"Didn't realize his hidden gem was only a few kilometres from my place!  Had the Saigon chicken banh mi on first visit and man was it ever good.  Baguette so fresh and the chicken and toppings were authentic and flavourful.   Only wish these guys were open later and/or on the weekend so I'd have more opportunity to eat here!"}
{"text":"Got the chicken and bbq pork to go...  not going back... the meat was tasteless with only the sauce to flavor the banhmi..."}
{"text":"Well.. the reviews turned out to be pretty accurate. On the drive home from Toronto, and hangry as one could be, I remembered this shops existance and scooted off the highway to score some dinner for my family - 3 bahn mi plus a wonton soup.. because who could say no to Wonton Wednesday. While waiting and chatting with the owner, he let me sample a meatball which was hella good. Meatball bahn mi has been added to my bucket list for next time. Got the food home which we scarfed enthusiastically. My oddly descriptive 4 year old was a particular fan of the wontons. He put it this way.. \"it's like a champion horse in my mouth\" .. which I suppose translates to daaaamn that's good. Oh yeah.. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place as I live close by and they did not disappoint.   Ordered the chicken and pork sandwiches and spring rolls.  The chicken was loaded with healthy slices of meat and garnished with fresh pickled carrots and radish. I opted for a sweet and spicy sauce instead of mayo. The sauce had a underlying heat that gave a peppery after taste...very nicely done.  The pork sandwich was equally as impressive.  Bread used was fresh, soft but had the right amount of chew for the sandwiches.  The spring rolls were stuffed full of meat. I regretted not ordering two batches.  Lucky me got to sample a meatball thanks to the Owner ( I wish I got his name) it was juicy and the meat was seasoned perfectly.  Owner is friendly and will take good care of you.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Glad we don't have to trek into Toronto to get a good Banh Mi anymore."}
{"text":"Yay for wonton soup Wednesday! I've only had the pleasure of visiting once.. but it was great. Appears to be a fan favourite lunch spot for this Oakville industrial park area.  Although they are popular, I don't see them compromising on quality of food/service for fast lunch turnover  What can I say:  -Food Quality (wonton soup): 4.5/5 flavours authentic, good variety & quantity of ingredients, nice shrimp in wontons, broth hot & on point, nice presentation -Service: 4.5/5 was very friendly & fast -Ambiance: 4/5"}
{"text":"Amazing! I've been here twice and tried the Saigon Chicken, the Grilled Pork Wreck Bahn Mi and the Good Morning Vietnam. The Bahn Mi is simple, but it leaves the meat and vegetables being the highlights of the sandwich, which is exactly how I like it.   The meat is grilled very nicely, the Bahn Mi is topped with some very well prepared vegetables including Cucumbers and Radishes, and the bread is fresh and delicious, with just the perfect amount of crisp. Simple and inexpensive. The Good Morning Vietnam is pretty much an omelet Bahn Mi, but with butter and and a couple dashes of soya sauce which I think compliments it perfectly. It's extremely affordable and delicious, and only available at breakfast, so definitely give it a go when you can!  The owner is really nice and friendly to talk to. He also gave my friend and I some meatballs to try, and they were juicy and delicious. I tried half of my friend's pork Bahn Mi and really liked it as well.   I recommend to get the food \"for here\" so there's more room for vegetables. I personally like B's Bahn Mi better than Bahn Mi Boys, because I can focus on the meat and fresh uncooked vegetables."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 almost close to a 4!  So so fresh is the first thing I can think of when writing a review for them. So I accidentally happened to be here after a doctors appointment and was very happy with the discovery.  Goods: So let's start with the goods first and then the not so good. I got a chicken Banh Mi sandwich for lunch which was super fresh all the vegetables used in it were crunchy and delicious. The bread was perfectly toasted and the size of the sandwich was good enough to fill me up fully actually I was more than full once I was done with the sandwich. I would highly recommend this place.I would give the sandwich and give it a four out of five. I would've given the sandwich a full  five if only the chicken used was a little better seasoned than it is, I found the chicken too bland but overall the sandwich was superb and the sauce used on it was delicious.  Not so goods: The owner needs to switch on that OPEN sign he has outside the doors-I almost was going to leave since it looked dark from inside.The restaurant itself it neat and clean but very dark all the blinds are down creating such a gloomy ambiance.I also noticed they have a tv but wasn't running it would be nice to have that tv running.Lastly I saw lots of customers coming in getting a lunch special probably they are customers who have been here before hence know about it, it would be nice if the owner could put down the daily specials on the board or somewhere in the restaurant.  Overall if I'm in the area again would definitely come again to try more sandwiches."}
{"text":"Doing my health and safety training in the area and wanted to find something delicious to wake myself up half way. Sigh 3 days of training will require a lot of good lunches lol  This was the closest of the 3 places I picked for this week and since it is the first day and I'm just getting used to this part of oakville I offered to drive a few people from the course over.   It's in an industrial area and only open from 730 to 4pm, mainly for the lunch crowd. I ordered their savory chicken (ginger and lemongrass). The owner was nice and served us himself while asking where we learned about them. I told him yelp and he said they just opened in November. The sandwiches we got were filled to the brim with fresh pickled radishes, cilantro, jalapeños and chicken. I topped mine off with siracha and some spicy mayo.  This is definitely not authentic bahn mi ' s which I grew up with, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Think healthier and more stream line flavors (I. E. No liver paste).   As we were eating I noticed a few things:  Consistency- the way the owner vs the server was making the same sandwiches were night and day in terms of filling. I'm glad ours were made by the owner, otherwise I'd feel ripped off. At times there seemed to be only half the sandwich with toppings going out.  Organization- you can definitely tell the place is new because they still seem to be getting the footing as to who does which jobs and seems to switch back and forth a lot. There was a lack of communication as to which customer has been served and which is still waiting.    One of my fellow luncher ordered their soup of the day and she was almost done her meal when it was finally brought out. The owner took the order and gave us the sandwiches but waited until the server was available to scoop the soup and bring it to the table. She found the soup too spicy and couldn't eat more than 2 bites? Different organizations do this differently but I think they shouldn't have charged her the $2.99 if they didn't tell her it was spicy, especially since when she ordered the sandwiches she asked for no hot sauce or jalapeños.   The taste of the sandwich was good, the price was what you'd expect from a monopolized location for  lunch sandwiches and the atmosphere was comfy cafeteria style. I'd go back if I'm in the area for sure, I just have to make sure the owner serves me.   Tip: They also have daily specials (more than just sandwiches) and specialty drinks, like tamarind juice."}
{"text":"I went with my wife and we had the roasted pork banh mi and my wife had the chicken banh mi. We also had the pork fresh rolls. The bread was fresh and delicious, crispy on the outside and melt in your mouth soft on the inside. The meat was hardy and the sauce complemented the meat and vegetables with the perfect amount of spice and \"zing\". You won't leave this place hungry and your pocket book with thank you because it is really reasonably priced. Really nice and friendly service and quick too. Nice clean and inviting and bright atmostphere."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the 1st time and ordered the pork meatball banh mi. In one word - delicious. The porkmeatballs are well seasoned, not overcooked and not just bread crumb but actually lean ground pork. The pickled daikon and carrots provide a sweet crunchy contrast that cuts through the richness of the pork. I topped mine with some sweet and spicy sirracha sauce and cilantro which made this a perfect handheld vessel of goodness. I will definitely be back. Price is higher than your regular banh mi but these are more substantial and loses down with high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"B's Banh Mi is simply \"het Xay!\" service was excellent but the food was amazing! I had the Bo Kho which is a vietnamese tender beef stew. Was very homely and hearty just how a viet mom would make it.  As I would always say when I like a Resturant ... \"Fei Jai Approved!\" Would highly recommend anyone in the Oakville area to go for a nice vietnamese lunch!"}
{"text":"Today was my third time to visit this place - and it has always lived up to my expectations. I came hungry and ordered 2 sandwiches - the grilled pork wreck and the pork meatball banh mi. Portions were massive (see pic), filled with lots of veggies that it spilled over my plate. Also spoke to the owner (Bruce) and he is aware of his Yelp reviews (one had commented about the portions). Great value as Both sandwiches were $6.99 each."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for the first time and ordered the Pork Wreck Banh Mi. The sandwich is delicious but the service was slow and confusing. No sign to indicate which end of the counter to order from and the staff were bouncing all over the place and serving customers in a sort of random order. Maybe I'm just used to the fast moving production line of banh mi at places like Nguyen Huong - file in, file out.  Sandwich was really excellent, though. Tender pork, perfect pickles, spicy and fresh. Good quality fillings and warm crusty baguettes."}
{"text":"WOW! I just walked across the street after making a delivery to Kencro Chemicals. I have never had any Vietnamese food before, and this absolutely blew my mind! The ingredients were so fresh! I think I possibly just ate the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out this Banh Mi place for lunch from Mississauga and we were not disappointed. The is easy access from the QEW and was busy with employees from offices around. Everyone knew the owner by name and his service was excellent. We had a the chicken Banh Mi, I wouldn't changea thing to it. Chicken was fresh, juicy and well cooked. Hubby had the jerk chicken with jasmine rice and mango salad. It was nice but the sandwich was phenomenal. We want to go back to try the pho and the other items."}
{"text":"The customer service here is outstanding. He helps you with the menu with respects to choosing something you'd like They even have pho twice a week. The location is very convenient as its just up the street from the Bronte Go station. I walked there from the station as I just wanted a quick healthy bite for lunch. I love Vietnamese subs,when I was in Vancouver I had the best ones ever. So my expectations were slightly high, I guess I bought two subs; one tofu and one chicken I feel a bit bad writing this review as I did not like either of them I'm used to the meat being minced and not chunks, also the meat was not seasoned at all so it lacked flavor. All you tasted was the lemon grass, it was not good at all. I'm quite disappointed, I really wanted to like it.  I don't think I will be back at all it was a waste of money for me. But I mean its nice that all the other Yelpers enjoyed it"}
{"text":"B's Banh Mi is amazing! Their food is absolutely delicious - fresh ingredients and the prices are great. I had the pork sandwich and the spring rolls. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"B's has a small family owned feel and they serve the best Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches and dumpling soup I've had anywhere in the GTA! They're super friendly and make sure you enjoy what you've ordered. I thinks B's banh mi is going to be a place I visit for lunch at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Great place. Had the \"Savoury Saigon\" Grilled Chicken Banh Mi and it was super tasty. Could really taste the lemongrass in the marinade. Meat was super juicy too and the sandwich was well constructed and balanced. Service was great."}
