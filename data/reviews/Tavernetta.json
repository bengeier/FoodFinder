{"text":"Went with a group of 6 and shared a bunch of dishes and wine. The service was fantastic. All of the dishes were very tasty as well. Particularly the pasta ones. Also prices are very reasonable for the quality of the meal. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. The food? Amazing. The ambiance? Who doesn't like to jam out to 90s R&B and rap while they're dining with friends in a place that feels almost like home? (This restaurant is actually a remodelled house!)  Had I known about this place sooner, I would have had my birthday dinner in the summer so we could have sat in the backyard patio and played bocce while we waited for our food.  Every review I've read has mentioned the meatballs so we knew these were a must try. And since it's family style sharing, we did what we do best: EAT. In addition to the meatballs we got: - crudo (beef carpaccio) - skewers: mushroom, summer squash, beef, chicken, calamari and duck wing - beet & pear arugula salad - melon & prosciutto salad - walnut pesto ricotta gnocchi  - casonsei (sausage filled pasta pillows in a brown butter and sage sauce) - meatball sub (yes, more meatballs!)  There was a constant flow for our food, we weren't left too long between the appies and the mains. Although because it's more of a casual vibe, it didn't feel like we had a designated server so getting drinks (and eventually our bill) required a lot of patience (aka a lot of waiting)  The meatballs are as spectacular as everyone makes them out to be. Seriously get them.  The calamari skewer, melon salad and gnocchi were my other faves. The arugula salad had a encompassing vinaigrette but I would have liked more beets. Spiral shavings just don't do it for me. I like the earthiness and heartiness of a beet and it just wasn't there.  I will absolutely be back. For the meatballs for sure. And when the weather warms up again, that patio has a seat with my name on it!"}
{"text":"Wow, we enjoyed a fabulous meal at Tavernetta last night. This new restaurant offers Northern Italian dishes beautifully prepared and plated. We had eight in our party and ordered several dishes under the guidance of our helpful server and shared. Everything was delicious and we were given ample time to enjoy each course. Tavernetta offers a charming setting both indoors and on the patio. There is a small parking area but we found ample two hour parking an 9th."}
{"text":"I'm hoping to love this place,  soon. In the meantime there are a few issues. Please adjust your portion sizes .  Two fork or spoonfuls are not adequate.  Have the food  hotter ,  in temperature, that is ... the food was lukewarm at best. The actual taste of the food was delicious.  The dessert, the crostata... start over with the baking.. that will not do.  The whole plate should look prettier and it should taste fantastic. I should be looking forward to dessert , not going to get it somewhere else. It looked and tasted like a grade 9 home economics group project.  The service was excellent and the atmosphere was very nice . Inside it was clean , modern, but still welcoming. The backyard patio was cosy and fun, with potential to create a true backyard oasis as the restaurant gets more established. It's important to give the place another try, as it can be a true neighbourhood gem, with a few tweaks !"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Let me start with the atmosphere. Who does not love an old remodeled house. They did a great job on the interior. We were greeted pleasantly when we first walked in the door. We sat down to very comfortable chairs and nicely decorated tables. We ordered multiple dishes from the menu and all were made to perfection. The Northern Italian dishes are colorful, flavorful and served up nice and hot. We were not rushed through are meal and each course served at the right time. We had such a wonderful evening of conversation and good food. If you have not gone to this restaurant, then you are really missing out."}
{"text":"There's are few things that need to be said about Tavernetta.   The décor is gorgeous. I find it's very rustic, which I personally love!!! Each time that we were there, we sat outside. There is a long picnic table under a huge tree. I took off my shoes and felt the grass between my toes. I felt like I was sitting in my friends backyard. It was peaceful, relaxing and comfy.    The staff are incredible. They are funny, knowledgeable, creative and respectful. I've been there a few time and each time, my experience was wonderful. One of the nights we were there, the weather started to drop - our group didn't want to go inside and without asking we were offered blankets. The servers were attentive but not annoying - when we needed a refill, more food, or the bill, they were there.    The Food! The meatballs are a MUST - if there are only two of you, I suggest you each order the dish. You won't want to share!! The pasta was cooked perfectly and was very good. Our table could not decide which dessert to try, so we ordered them all....and we ate them all. The calamari apparently needed more flavour - I don't eat seafood, but this is what my fiancé said.   The wine/booze. Yes they serve it, and I drank lots of it. They have this mystery box - where you pay $ and you get to put your hand into a box and you pick out a random beer. I think it was $5.00 if I remember correctly.   I would say Tavernetta is a fancy Italian tapa's house!! It's a must see - I promise you.   When you decide to go there - call to make reservations as it gets busy. The parking lot is in the back and there isn't a lot of spots, so Uber it there. You won't regret it. Here, I'll make it easy for you. This is the phone number (403) 250-8894."}
{"text":"I would say this place is pretty good. Their drink selections were very limited in terms of cocktail choices and could be spiced up a bit with new variety and unique drinks.   Their beef tartar was very bland and not flavourful. The Calamari on the other hand was SPECTACULAR! Their pasta dishes looked amazing that were coming out. They have a small kitchen in the area that would typically be where the drinks are made, instead you can watch them preparing all the different dishes which was neat.  The servers were fantastic and ALL very beautiful.   It's worth a try if you live in the area, for sure."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places in all of Calgary.   First I want to go over the space: I went here during the summer and we were sat outside which was amazing. I really liked the string lights and the large picnic table on the grass (which we didnt use but we'll definitely bring a bunch of our friends next year and take over this spot lol). The inside of the place is really well laid out and my favorite thing about it is the open concept kitchen. I sat here last week and truly enjoyed the guys/gal doing their magic.   Next is the food: I have had the gnocci a couple of times - it's one of their pasta dishes. I have no idea what's in it but its very tender and a really good starch dish for your meal. I have also had the duck leg, calamari with the white sauce, and bunch of other things that i don't know how to spell. But they are all fantastic!   Finally the drinks: I have had their negroni - which by the way is phenomenal, and various wines. They have done a good job of making sure their is a good selection.   Overall I really like this place and I'm glad I don't live too close because I would be here all the time."}
{"text":"My BFF and I went for brunch on Sunday 11 am. Nice and quiet. And no TV screens! Seating is very comfortable at the tables. The Brutus salad was the best Caesar salad I've had in years and was a very generous portion...good for 2 people. The gnocchi was sublime...tender, flavourful with lots of delicious sauce. My new favorite place to eat for sure! And thank heavens they don't do \"skip-the-dishes\" or I would be in trouble!"}
