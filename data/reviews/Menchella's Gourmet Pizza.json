{"text":"This place is no longer Pizzaiolo. Don't fooled, this place has seen a quick  decline in quality in recent months. Crust is hard and makes my jaw hurt (ouch). The sauce usually resembles watered-down catsup (yuck). That being said, I'd probably still smash an XL pepperoni if I had to...but like, reluctantly tho."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza from here because they said that they used typo \"00\" flour to make their pizza dough....... obviously they are lying. The crust tastes like any other fast-food delivery pizza...Nova or GIGI. We also tried a  gluten free pizza, pretty much the worst gluten free pizza I have ever had, seriously, it had the texture of soggy stale toasted potato(???).
The ingredients are cheap and the results are  nothing like they've described. DON\"T waste your time or money here if you enjoy easting pizza."}
{"text":"There is nothing one bit gourmet about this place. One of the worst by-the-slice pieces of pizza I've ever had. Got the spinach, tomato, red pepper, and parmigiano. Completely dried out and tasteless, couldnt even finish half."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would. Ordered two large pizzas off of their menu. Received one large and one medium. Was told it was our fault for mis ordering and it was the greasiest nasty pizza I've seen in a long time."}
{"text":"Not terrible but I definitely am not going to hurry back. This place used to be a pizzaiolo location... And it looks like they took all of PIzzaiolo's recipes and used cheaper ingredients to make half assed versions of their pizzas. The service was good, but that doesn't make up for mediocre pizza when Toronto has many better options. I definitely should've just gone to country style next-door and ordered the schnitzel instead of this under seasoned cardboard like pizza. i'm sorry but I can't give more than two stars for a pizza place that is a step down in quality from a franchised pizza place already."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a pepperoni pizza. Was a good price and a decent slice. Not the best but worth a quick bite to eat. Found the set up and pizza very similar to pizziola."}
{"text":"I was in the hood so i stopped by this pizza joint for a quick slice.  When i first came on here to write the review I saw the poor one they got and I am not too sure why it got a bad review because it was really good to me.

I talked to the guys in the back a bit and they gave me a history lesson about the pizza, sauce, and the love that goes into it.  

For a quick slice this place is bomb! I always like a good slice of pizza especially when the recipe is passed down from generation to generation.  Nonna will be proud and i would definitely come back when in this hood, even though i live on the east side :p

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Pizza's Made everyday fresh using the best ingredients ! Excellent place to walk in a grab a slice with a cold bottle of coke !!! $5 specials everyday for a slice with a can of pop ! Come in and tell us how you liked your slice of pizza !?"}
{"text":"Came here with my son as he had a study group going on at U of T.  I don't know what people are talking about.  I loved it.  We ordered a medium pizza with hot peppers, pinapple, and sun dried tomatoes.  and it was super tasty crispy.   We will definitely come back to this pizza joint next week.  I will try the single slices next time to see if that is what people are complaining about."}
{"text":"Not sure what's with all the terrible reviews. I guess they keep their slices out too long... Never had a slice here but quite a few whole pizzas and they were all very good. Quality seems to be above that of Gigi's or Nova and would definitely pick this place over them any time. I always get the sopressata and Gorgonzola. Yum!"}
