{"text":"could be just 1.5 stars.  Ordered a 8 pieces Chicken, didn't order the family meal as I heard the customer in front of me didn't get any biscuits, I guess it's late and they don't want to make another batch. ordered a regular coleslaw, which they also ran out of, but will make a new one for me. that's really nice. (1 star!)  waited 20 minutes for the fried chicken made to order. (it's late, they don't have anything left.) meanwhile a guy comes in for an order, given some fries because they don't have any biscuits, but the weird thing is, the server offered \"sweet & sour\" sauce to the customer. (I thought it should be hot sauce, since it's \"Cajun\" style?)  Finally when my order is ready, I asked for some hot sauce, the guy gave me a few packets of the Chinese red pepper paste (by Wing's Toronto!) REALLY?! (and no fork for my coleslaw.) (-2 stars)   in less than 10 minutes time I'm home, opened up the box of fried chicken, the chicken was still so hot that the steam actually soften the entire paper box. and when I bite into the first piece, the juice from the chicken almost burned me!  it's not in a heavy batter, just a light coat of flour?   Of course it's crispy, and it's hot. but it's not spicy hot at all. It's just a piece of deep fried chicken, can't taste any spice, a bit lack in salt too. Didn't see any red oil from the chicken being marinated in any red pepper or even just paprika for colouring. (-1 star)  the coleslaw was okay. and if eaten along with the chicken, it made the chicken taste so much better! too bad I don't get a fork to use. (.5 stars)  it's fried chicken, not bad, but it's not anything better than deep frying some chicken yourself. Don't forget to put some region appropriate hot sauce on it, that'll help."}
{"text":"I was in the area today and was looking for the excellent Popeyes I used to visit but was surprised to find it had changed its name to Rotisserie Mom's.  I was welcomed by the cashier who told me the owner is still the same, just the name and menu items had changed.  They still serve Cajun fried chicken, mash potatoes, but now they also do Rotisserie chicken.  They also advertise 100% halal chicken.  I wasn't a fan of the tea biscuits, or the drink included, so the cashier offered me 3 piece fried chicken for $3.99 (which was nice of him since it's usually a Thursday special and it was Monday).  The chicken was noticeably less flavourful than Popeyes.  It was well cooked and tender but was not as juicy and the coating was rather bland.  Since I was still hungry, I ordered a mash potatoes with gravy for $1.89.  I also noticed they no longer have cajun rice which I really liked. The mash potatoes were the same, but the gravy was not as tasty as Popeyes (less Cajun taste, more tomato based).  Unless you're looking for a quick fix and happen to be in the area for the specials, I wouldn't recommend this place for their fried chicken."}
{"text":"This place used to be a Popeye's Chicken and Seafood franchise, but had to change due to their long-standing loyalty to their Muslim customer base by continuing to serve Halal chicken, which Popeye's could no longer promise.  This place has long been run by a fantastic family whose sons have striven to keep the fantastic customer service and atmosphere going.  Although it's not your typical family restaurant, one conversation with any of them and you'll feel right at home.  The chicken, batter, sides are practically the exact same as always, not going to get you amazed but at the same time their deals speak for themselves. Ask for the 14-piece dark meat special, it's probably their best and most popular deal."}
