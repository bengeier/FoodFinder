{"text":"Amazing donuts!!! Soft, sweet, and savory! Their blended vanilla latte is also recommended, it's very silky and good for people that do not like strong coffee. But my absolute favorite item is the ham and cheese filled croissant! Warm gooey cheese and yummy ham (I also eat mine with jalapeños, for those who like a little spice). This place has amazing food/drinks and is a bit expensive, but still,  I highly recommend it at any time of the day!"}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I had donuts this good & my family agrees--my daughter has declared herself addicted! Less than $10 for a dozen donuts can't be beat! Went for the second time today to pick up a dozen assorted donuts for my family of 5 (the lemon filled & the chocolate old-fashioned are in a tie for my favorite) & they were just as exceptionally fresh & delicious as the first dozen. There's a large variety of donuts to choose from so you really can't go wrong. I was amazed at how well they kept, we finished our dozen the day after purchasing & we would have never known they were day-old donuts if we didn't know different! There aren't many other donut shops in the area so the location is very convenient if you're in S Phx/Laveen--just a short walk from Cesar Chavez Public Library too. The owners are two families dividing the labor from what I was told, & the family members working as counter staff are so friendly! Not only is their product wonderful, but the staff delivers excellent customer service. I'm looking forward to getting to taste (& re-taste!) all of the different varieties during my family's many future visits!"}
{"text":"Very good doughnuts with very affordable prices. Walked out with a 2 doughnuts and 2 cups of coffee for less than what I pay for an iced coffee at Starbucks!  This is a mom and pop shop who happen to be very courteous."}
{"text":"No words to describe awesome doesn't even begin to say how tasty the doughnuts are and the staff  is great"}
{"text":"Love this place.  First donut shop in Laveen.  The ladies are friendly, donuts are fresh.  Croissants simply yummy.  A big chain is coming to town, please continue to show our patronage to this independent business in town.  They are fantastic."}
{"text":"Love this place! Tried them for the first time last night. First off, I went in about 20 mins before they close. Typically at the end of the day the selection is lacking in donut shops and often the donuts are starting to get pretty dry, not at this place. These tasted like they had just come out of the oven. Their yeast dough is fantastic and the prices are great. Second, the woman who helped me threw in an extra donut for free along with a couple of donut holes for my toddler. The people at this place genuinely want to make their customers happy and I'll be going back frequently."}
{"text":"We love donuts. This is the best donuts we have had out of all shops we have been. Staff is very friendly. Affordable prices."}
{"text":"Love everything about it, mostly the extra donuts they throw in! They are always friendly, the donuts are always fresh and its clean. Aaple bear claws are my favorite. I dould definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"They have excellent donuts here and as a self-professed donut connoisseur, I don't make that statement lightly. Their smoothies are not bad either. Try the boba!"}
{"text":"Amazing donuts always fresh. Customer service is great as well. You have to try the maple bacon bar"}
{"text":"Best donuts in the West Valley! Very friendly customer service and fresh donuts no matter what time you go. Way better than Dunkin Donuts and Krispy Kreme! You will enjoy! Will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The south valley needed a good donut shop and Sunrise Donuts delivers. The donuts are airy and taste good plain and simple. If you are near 35th Ave & Baseline and looking for a sweet treat stop by and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Deliciously soft donuts, good price and awesome service!! I also tried one of there boba coconut smoothies and that too was great. Best of all we got 2 free donuts for going before close on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Yummy fresh donuts, great service, and a big selection!"}
{"text":"Amazing donuts! The people running the place are very courteous. I know we will be here again and again.  The bagel sandwiches are also top notch!!"}
{"text":"I truly enjoy seeing a mom n Pop shop succeed.  From their Fresh donuts to having great customer service.  From the moment you enter the donut shop, the environment is great and when you take your first bite of any of their donuts my favorite is the Apple Fritter. All I can say is Finger, licking good!  They always add a couple Xtra donuts or donuts holes at no extra cost. To me they truly care about providing excellent customer service from how you are treated to the best tasting goodies around.. Did i forget to mention they have great tasting Thai tea.... Keep up the great work. You have a recipe for success and you can not only see it but taste it! kudos to Sunrise donuts, may you continue on a great journey...."}
{"text":"The five star rating is definitely deserved. The quality of their donuts is second to none. Couple that with the first rate customer service of a family owned business and you have something special in Laveen. Get the maple bacon donut! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great donuts and pastries. We have made this a mandatory stop after church every Sunday. Their donuts are always fresh and delicious. Good variety and we like the fact that they have breakfast croissants, with different varieties every week."}
{"text":"I went in to get my usual, but today I figured I'd try their smoothies that have different flavored Boba I happen to get a Honeydew smoothie with strawberry Boba. It was so good and refreshing. I normally get the Mango smoothie with mango Boba and it's awesome. But I figured I'd try another flavor out and yes I was still very satisfied with my smoothie. So not just do they have delicious donuts but they have great drinks. Plus a large runs under $4.00 which is an awesome price compared to other places I've been to. The only thing I can say that they can improve in is communication with their customers. I don't know if it's because of the language barrier but that shouldn't matter, greeting your customers and just giving eye contact and trying to just ask them how their day has been, they seem very reserved."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place opened and they have boba tea! Good boba tea at that! The donuts are great and the price is extremely reasonable"}
{"text":"This place is so good and the people there are super nice. They always give us free doughnuts and doughnut holes witch are delicious i recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Donuts are super fresh and so good. Try the apple fritters as they're one of the best I've ever had plus it was huge. Service was wonderful and fast. If you're in Laveen or south Phoenix it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"The best donuts in Arizona. Made fresh everyday, I'm telling you they really melt in your mouth lol! Love this place"}
{"text":"Amazing little donut shop in Laveen. The donuts are always fresh and the ham and cheese croissants are to die for. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous donuts and the staff are so nice. Service is quick and the number of choices is almost overwhelming. You cannot go wrong with any choice here.  In all honesty - the donuts are underpriced for what you receive."}
{"text":"Love this place. Super good and amazing food. I highly recommend to anyone. Couldn't beat it"}
{"text":"Love love love!. Always fresh and friendly. This is our only donut place that we will visit. They are affordable and great quality. They are made fresh every morning, and it outshines any other donut shop or chain for sure. If you get there at a decent hour in the morning, they are still warm. The apple fritters are ridiculous! The green tea smoothie is my other go to menu item - add some boba and it's even better. The staff is always friendly and happy. A great way to start your day!"}
{"text":"Their donuts are perfection, all so light and fluffy! They also serve thai iced tea with boba which is hard to come by in this area, with the next closest one being 10 miles away. The prices are $4.89 for half a dozen and $8.39 for a dozen. They also have breakfast, lunch sandwiches, and combo options to choose from with decently priced items. The owners are great and always give me an extra donut with my dozen order. Must give this place a try."}
{"text":"Delicious! Fast and friendly service.  Their breakfast sandwiches and Thai tea are AMAZING too!"}
{"text":"BEST DONUTS EVER! This is not exaggerated...I have been looking for a good donut spot since moving to Phoenix and I am so glad to have accidentally stumbled upon this place."}
{"text":"Another Yelp success, stopped by on vacation, best freshest donuts I've ever had. Seriously amazing.  Also had a ham and cheese croissant (one with and one without jalapeños) the real ones are amazing, but one day they were out and tried nuking a croissant with ham and cheese it wasn't great.  Note to self, go early before they sell out of that awesomeness."}
{"text":"Best place hands down, super soft.  The staff is very friendly & sweet! Definitely recommend coming here earlier rather than later so you don't miss out on any donut goodness, they sell fast!"}
{"text":"OMG! lol im not the biggest donut fan but this place is off the charts. I love going here and getting a donut and a ham n cheese stuffed croissant. Delicious"}
{"text":"Fresh soft donuts always get some every weekend they got many to choose from also very freindly workers always end up giving you something extra"}
{"text":"This place deserves all of the 5 stars it's getting.  We've been a few times now, every donut we've tried is sooooo good.  The employees are all so nice and helpful.  The prices are super reasonable.  If you're anywhere near this place and you are craving donuts, go there, you won't regret it.  Well, you'll probably regret the half-dozen donuts you eat because they're so good."}
{"text":"Their donuts are so good! My mother goes here quite often and is always raving how delicious and fresh there donuts are. We went this past weekend and we order a taro bubble tea and half a dozen donuts. We ended up with little over half! The employees there know my mom and siblings and always throw in a little extra something because they're regulars. That was a nice surprise!  It's really cool when a small business has friendly staff and really good food! The taro was a little less potent than I'm used to but it was still really good! The boba was soft and those donuts. Man, oh, man. You have to try them for your self. But make sure to head there in the morning since by the evening they're running out of product. That's the price to pay for every day freshly made donuts."}
{"text":"Great donuts at a great price!! We really loved the jalapeño ham and cheese croissant."}
{"text":"So good! First off Serena is super nice, always so welcoming and courteous. The donuts are absolutely delicious! The cheese, ham, and jalapeño croissant is also out of this world! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Favorite donut shop of all time! I've never had a better one. This is place is 10 minutes from of and we have a Dunkin Donuts right across the street. I will never go back to Dunkin. Their Kolaches and Thai tea with Boba are amazing too! Everyone is friendly and they always throw in extra donut holes with your order. I don't know how they get such amazing flavors and textures!"}
{"text":"I always get excited when I see 5 stars for any business with a decent amount of reviews.  This place is small and offers plenty of choices for donuts, croissants, breakfast sandwiches & boba drinks.   I went for a ham & cheese croissant and maple & bacon bar. The croissant was huge and had lots of ham & gooey cheese in it served warm and the donut was very light & airy with a perfectly balanced topping. I was so impressed!   I ate at the shop as they have plenty of seating and the ladies who work here were very sweet. It was a great way to start my morning with a croissant, donut and milk for under $7! What a value!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for boba in the area! Donuts are also always really good and fresh. Staff is friendly and very professional."}
{"text":"Good selection of donuts to start the day. Especially enjoy the simple glazed and the donut holes."}
{"text":"A place reasonably close to us in Surprise to get Boba. Second time back in 2 days. The person at the register today gave a vibe of being a little perturbed that we walked in. The donuts we bought the day before were delight. I recommend coming here. 3 stars today due to register girl."}
{"text":"I was I was here again today this place is awesome love the variety you have to stop in and experience the freshness of this place and I believe that they cook Donuts throughout the day they're open until 8 p.m. and the donuts bad just got didn't taste stale and felt a little warm so I give it up to the sunrise donut shop you guys are continuing to do an amazing job especially when you get up first thing in the morning to make the donuts  If you haven't stopped by you need to stop by this place they also have colachis you got to try to collages collages are just great they have breakfast ones and other varieties of client is coming up on Fat Tuesday so I know I'm going to get my field for punchkees when you get around to this point"}
{"text":"Donuts are definitely good! But I was overcharged a couple dollars, I didn't catch it until after I left (which is my fault) and I don't feel like driving back. Plus the customer service was just mediocre at best. And every time I go they never have turkey, only ham. When I asked why they replied \"no one ever orders it\". I think maybe this should be taken off the menu :). 5 stars for donuts, just irritated I had to over pay. They are good but not that good lol."}
{"text":"Amazing and yummy!!!!!!!! Great service, great selection. We will definitely be coming back here for our donuts and coffee! Gotta try the croissants next!!!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Sunrise Donuts and it did not disappoint! The staff was really friendly and the donuts were awesome. Some of the best that I've ever had."}
{"text":"We used to say Bosa Donuts were the best in town...until Sunrise Donuts opened. Now, it's no comparison! Sunrise is sooooo yummy. The donuts are always fresh and amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! So glad to have this place in my neighborhood. While I am not trying to disparage the other reviewers, but....these guys deserve 5 stars.  Why would you give a glowing review of this place and then only give 4 stars?  The ham, cheese and jalapeño croissant is so tasty.  The donuts are light and fluffy and oh so fresh. They will be my go to place for breakfast on the weekends."}
{"text":"Very good customer service. The croissants were delicious and the donuts were a reasonable price. Would go again :)"}
{"text":"Just delicious!  Super friendly staff. Had a bacon, ham, cheese, and egg crossaint. Best. Breakfast. Ever. The donuts are so tasty as well! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love this place, best donuts so fresh! Beats Dunkin' Donuts for sure... and their croissant breakfast sandwiches are bomb!"}
{"text":"OK, the reviews are right!! These donuts are AWESOME, and I'm not even a big fan of donuts! Family looks forward to my visits because now I bring a big box of these little bites of deliciousness! We get an assortment and cut them in half so everyone can try more than one flavor...and it's hard to have a favorite because they're all so darn good! Yum!"}
{"text":"Yummy donuts. If you like express donuts then you will definitely like this place. Staff is friendly as well. Would get these over Krispy Kreme any day."}
{"text":"These Donuts are amazing!!!! Very friendly ppl there, always hook u up with an extra donut. The glazed and sugar donuts are excellent!"}
{"text":"This donut shop is by far the very best of the best....I love donuts and I have eaten donuts at every donut shop in the valley, and the donuts here are the very best....light and fluffy ànd fresh, not greasy and messy like most donuts I've tried...I give it 5 stars and  2thumbs up"}
{"text":"Delious Donuts. Just have to get there early in morning to get your favorite donut. Staff is always kind and courteous."}
{"text":"These donuts are amazing! They are so soft and airy and after you eat one you don't feel like you just ate a pound of bread, they are delicious! Normally in the valley the best donut shop has really been bosa donuts but I got to say Sunrise Donuts is blowing them out of the water!"}
{"text":"Ok,, I'm not a coffee n donut lover BUT they have hooked on theirs, I stop by almost every day to get coffee and donuts, highly recommended"}
{"text":"Been here at least 5 times and I can say it's always been consistent good quality. Soft and warm and there's no after taste that some donuts give you. I haven't tried the coffee yet. Employees are friendly as well."}
{"text":"I went here just for the boba because I love boba but the donuts looks so good so I have to try it. The boba is ok but the donuts are AMAZING! It's so soft and delicious! Went back the next morning to try their ham and cheese croissants and it's so good. I highly reccomend their donuts!!! My husband and I keep on coming back ever since we tried this place!"}
{"text":"Bomb ass donuts, get there early otherwise the different options and the best ones go fast."}
{"text":"So yummy and the freshness is out of this world it was so amazingly executed and the coffee was super yummy!!! I will defiantly be back for more!!!!"}
{"text":"Recently found this place. Delicious donuts and they always give us more than a dozen. Extra points for being open late."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and delicious donuts. From the Apple fritters to the glazed this place does donuts right. A little disappointed in the jelly donut.  The filing was a bit thick and tasted processed. My daughter had the Boston cream and loved it."}
{"text":"If I could give them 10 stars I would there donuts are the best I've had since cali. There service is fast an great friendly.  And they always give the kids a extra donut hole"}
{"text":"It's a nice change, prices are acceptable , selection fine , not a corporate giant so it needs love from locals to grow and survive, I will give my effort to be a loyal customer upon quality consistancy."}
{"text":"Went to sunrise for breakfast because we heard that had breakfast sandwiches, so ordered 2 one with sausage and egg and one with bacon and egg. They were good, asked for Tabasco or Tapatio ( so wanted spicy) and they didn't have anything. Also bought donuts and they were very soft so definitely fresh. The woman behind counter that took our ordered had to call over another lady because she couldn't understand that we didn't want cheese on one of the sandwiches but that's ok the order was right. Will go back for donuts but maybe not so much the breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great donuts and the ham & cheese croissants melt in your mouth. The employees are very friendly and the prices are good. I've been there twice and both times they had the shelves fully stocked with fresh donuts."}
{"text":"I love this place! The Thai Tea Boba is absolutely delicious. The donuts are always fresh and tasty. I am glad Laveen has a cool little place like this."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's always busy when I visit. My husband refuses to eat any other donut besides here. They have amazing ham and cheese baked inside croissants."}
{"text":"The donut here is really good and very inexpensive. It's fluffy and not so sweet. Good variety of choices. There's some sweet and some savory ones too. They had maple bacon donut one time I was there. It's not for me but if you like bacon on everything then it would hit the spot."}
{"text":"Delicious fluffy donuts, inexpensive and great, friendly customer service!"}
{"text":"So, i stopped by this donut shop with no expectations, WOW was i surprised!  The donuts were fantastic,  and the glazed donut holes were lil' morsels of yummy goodness!  I'M IN LOVE, and i never eat sweets! Hahaha!"}
{"text":"Thank you Groupon for the opportunity to go to this little donut shop across the street from the WalMart in Avondale! We went for a dozen donuts-reasonably priced but, Beware-their selection can, as others have indicated, vary. The highlight of our visit was purchasing several donuts and having them filled while we waited. We tried the blueberry and the lemon and wished we had gotten more! Next time we try the strawberry! The apple fritters looked appetizing, too. The store operator was friendly and very accommodating, too."}
{"text":"Super nice staff, fresh donuts, quick service...what more could you ask for. Btw we showed up and noon and they still had plenty of donuts and all types unlike other shops, where if u dont go early your out of luck. Good recommendation Yelp, def 5 stars."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. The donuts are great and customer service is amazing. If you're in the area and need a coffee and donut fix you must give this place a try."}
{"text":"Grand Opening!  Be sure to visit Sunrise Donuts  as soon as you get the chance.  Sunrise Donuts offers a large  variety of delicious donuts to choose from, in addition to  pastries & coffee.  The donuts are really big & generously covered with a variety of toppings.  The staff is friendly and helpful in describing the different flavors that they offer.  You have to try the  Maple Bacon donut,  it is delicious covered with pieces of bacon and will melt in your mouth."}

{"text":"OMG. this place has amazing donuts. I've been going to them since I moved to Litchfield. The couple that owns the place are cool and they always seem happy to do what they do! Would recommend to anyone who is in need of donuts in the Avondale area! BOOM!"}
{"text":"The donuts are amazingly fluffy and fresh! This neighborhood lacked any donut shop whatsoever before this place opened. They also have some little breakfast sandwiches and boba as well. The indoor seating is lacking but it's clean and the donuts are killer."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh donuts. The apple fritter is delicious. The donut holes will disappear before you get home. The service is always friendly & quick. Thank you Sunrise donuts!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Unlike Dunkin Donuts they actually have donuts and they are big, fresh, and good! The owners are very nice and friendly and even gave a few donut holes for free! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Best donuts I've ever had. Seriously had them three weekends in a row. Consitent. Delicious. Perfect donuts. I dream about these and the next time I can have one."}
{"text":"I came from LA where there were donut joints abound and this was the first spot that reminded me of shops at home. They also have smoothies, milk and Thai tea boba ! The staff is really friendly and you can always count on them to have tasty fresh pastries in stock. Take some treats to work or treat the kiddos on the weekend. If you're looking for something fancy hipster and gentrified this ain't it! Sunrise is just simple folk providing friendly service."}
{"text":"Great place to go...good doughnuts!!!"}
{"text":"A diamond I the rough this place. Definitely a great location my husband and I discovered it not that long ago and we were pleasantly surprised. The donut are soft and delectable. The staff is always so friendly and the place is squeaky clean. Oh and the milk tea is to die for. Every time my husband and I go somewhere else for milk tea we always compare it to sunrise and no one has ever matched their taste. This place is beyond amazing. If you have not been there you must!!!"}
{"text":"So I decided to give Sunrise another chance.... It didn't go well... I asked for a Chocolate Mint Boba which I've had before I got like a caramel coffee tasting one... Lady working didn't seem knowledgeable on products they had. I hope owner reads this and takes action I really do enjoy your product when its correct."}
{"text":"Had a small bad experience, they fixed it and all is well in the world! Such yummy doughnuts and let me tell you their croissant with ham and cheese OMG so good!"}
{"text":"I stopped by one Sunday to get some donuts for my kids and let me tell you I normally go to Dunkin' Donuts which is literally half a mile from my house maybe less but I no longer go there rather drive The extra time and get quality donuts they are fast they're clean and the donuts are amazing. Also we try the croissants and they are so good I love this place we get donuts every Sunday from here and I get my croissant"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Fresh Donuts, tasty boba, and very clean.  Not only do they have a variety of tasty donuts, but their Ham, Cheese and Jalapeno croissant will have you coming their everyday for lunch or a snack."}
{"text":"Gave Sunrise Donuts a try today and I have to say the donut was very good. I enjoyed a braided donut that was not only huge but very warm as well. Given other reviews have stated the same, I think it's safe to say that Sunrise puts out very fresh product daily. The price was great at $1.40. Only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars was no bacon donut and/or cream filled.  Both of which I was looking forward to trying. All in all though, one dang good donut. Community will have to rally behind this location if it's to last, especially when you have a Krispy Kreme down the street. If they regularly carried a cream filled I would be locked in given the quality I had today."}
{"text":"This is better than Krispy Kreme donuts!  I got the maple bacon donut. It doesn't have to be warm for it to melt in your mouth!  A hidden treasure in Lavern AZ!"}
{"text":"Delicious donut shop, probably the best Blueberry  Donut I've ever had. Quick and very inexpensive!"}
{"text":"As a self proclaimed \"fritter-phile\" that was the best damn fritter I've had in decades. The glaze was crispy, the breading was moist, the cinnamon & apples were plentiful. I had been at the gym, so I displayed a rare level of self-control & only got one, but I doubt I'll ever make that mistake again. It'll be a half dozen (at least) in the future and I look forward to trying each and every type of pastry they have ."}
{"text":"Such delicious donuts  They sell Boba drinks too which are also scrumptious. They are very friendly, very clean and pretty fast service wise. I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"These are probably the best donuts I've ever had , they're incredibly soft and delicious.  Also , customer service was amazing , the woman was really nice and patient ."}
{"text":"The ABC's and D's n life shall include but not limited to Apples, Beets and Cream filled Doughnuts. The letters \"C\" and \"D\" are extremely well represented here at Sunrise doughnuts! These guys should just be Laveens  Kept secret.   Please note, their ham, cheese and jalapeño croissants are on point. Super yum point!"}
{"text":"Your traditional donut shop I love it because it's not a nationwide chain still has that old school feel to it with the pink boxes. I don't think Siri knows exactly where the place is but it will take you to the common area I had to drive around a bit to finally find it behind the Popeyes there. I walked in the employee was nice I was literally in and out in 5 minutes. Everything looks tremendously clean. Not gonna lie I am a plain Jane when it comes to the donuts so I got a glazed regular and chocolate donut. All fairly priced. the bread is nicely cooked and flavorful I could only imagine with these babies taste like when they first come out the oven. If your in the area and feel like something sweet at a reasonable price stop by sunrise donuts!"}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom... Go here, you won't be sorry!!   Positives:  I honestly think these may be the best donuts I have ever had? These bites of goodness are SO soft and moist, no such thing as a dry donut here! They melt in your mouth.   This place lets you pick your donut AND pick your FILLING! So you aren't stuck with whatever everyone else didn't want! Create your own . Brilliant!   The white cream filled and the cream cheese filled are my favorite! They are all so good though! They threw in some free glazed donut holes for us and I couldn't believe how good those things are?!? I ate half of them in the car before I even got home!   Negatives: Nope. None. Nada.  Tips:  I went here at 5:30 am before work and they were already open! This place is a MUST try!!!!!"}
{"text":"So good, light and fluffy. I'm officially in charge of bringing donuts to the office because everyone agrees they are the best. And i Work in construction so we know donuts."}
{"text":"These Donuts are light, fluffy, and never over-fried! These people know the art of doughnut making. What's even great about this spot is that they're open early on Christmas morning. It's my go-to spot on every Christmas!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out and it didn't disappoint. The croissant breakfast sandwiches are delicious"}
{"text":"It would be nice to find what you are looking for in the morning,most of the times now they are out of something.  NO BUENO AMIGOS"}
{"text":"this place is awesome for so many reason! - the store location is on the same block of my residence. - the buttermilk donuts are awesome! - the apple fritters a a double awesome. - 1/2 dozen donuts were only $5! - the donuts were fresh and being made while i was in line!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They are very friendly, and their donuts are so fresh, also their coffee is good too. I love local places like this, and will for sure be going back to try different things."}
{"text":"Sunrise is poppin'!! Everyone in Laveen knows Sunrise. Definitely better than the service you will receive at Dunkin. And even the donuts taste better (baked there fresh every day. They always have a wide selection."}
{"text":"Got the ice coffee and it was so good! I love this donut shop so much!!! I love living so close to it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I like to bring our son here on occasion to satisfy our sweet tooth. This place has consistently created great tasting donuts! For us, flaky on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside is the perfect combination. Sunrise Donuts is spot on! My husband always gets their Boston cream and my son love the strawberry donut! I have no preference and could go for any! So far, I've yet to find one that disappoints.  Aside from the donuts, the staff has always been warm and friendly. I think that is a major reason for why we hesitate to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"If you manage to get the donuts while they're fresh, cop at least 1 regular glazed donut for me."}
{"text":"Very tasty donuts, always fresh. I enjoy the Boba drinks. Staff is friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Treated myself to a breakfast sandwich with bacon, egg, and cheese on a croissant.  AMAZING.  I love their huge buttery croissants.  I wish the bacon were a little better (2 thick slices of apple wood smoked bacon would be better)...but for the price, I can't complain.  They have added to their donut offerings...chocolate and powdered donut holes! YAY!    Word to the wise...if you are picking up a couple dozen for the office, go early.  By 8:15, they were out of a lot of donuts!  Of course though, they were making more!"}
{"text":"We love our weekend croissant sandwiches and glazed donut holes. Tip, when you heat the donut holes, they remind me of Krispy Kreme donuts. We definitely recommend this Laveen gem."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best donut shop I have ever experienced! All their delicious delights are fresh and they always give my kids donut holes for the ride home! Last week, I want to say 1/17/2016 the cream for the Boston creme was bad. They reimbursed us and let us know it was the company they received their cream from. Totally not their fault and the pulled all donuts that had the cream in them. They are so super friendly and FRESH! The croissants that have the jalapeño and cheese and ham are incredible! I would like to say that I am a pretty healthy eater but they are worth every delicious bite! I think it's dumb that there is going to be a Dunkin Donuts on 51st Ave and Baseline. GROSS!! Sunrise is where it's at! Cake donuts, raised and glazed, fancy ones...they are amazing. And it feels good to support a local business. Mmmm I want donuts when I wake up!"}
{"text":"Everything is so good! Except the pineapple doughnut. It tasted like the smell of a pineapple air freshener.  Besides that the powder, long john, maple glaze, custard filled, and cinnamon crumb were delicious! Yes we ate them in one sitting with a glass of whole milk. My soul was content after that. The girl working was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"The lady behind the counter was sneezing and cleaning herself with her sleeve as she was boxing my order."}
{"text":"Sad they have closed. Stopped by on a Saturday  as usual and I was confused to find that they are permanently  closed! They had the best donuts. Very nice couple  and they always gave us free donuts."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I didn't even liked donuts till the day I had Sunrise Donuts! They have place to improve when it comes to customer service but over all I recommend it! You won't regret!"}
{"text":"Great donut holes and soft donuts!  This place is exactly like Fresh Donuts in Buckeye, AZ."}
{"text":"So sad to see sunrise donuts is no longer in operation. Their donuts were the best and kolaches were out of this world. We'll miss you, sunrise donuts."}
{"text":"The language barrier here is pretty strong. Ordered a jalepeno sausage and cheese crossiant and they gave me one without jalapeno. Ordered a sausage, egg and cheese kolache and they gave me a potato and egg one. I asked them to heat it up and they were both cold in the center. Food was good, just cold and not what I ordered."}
{"text":"Had donuts and croissants from here for my daughters bridal shower. Excellent in tast, texture and price. Thanks"}
{"text":"Oh my... There isn't much in Laveen worth giving a 5 star rating, but this place is it! Hidden in one of the many strip malls on Baseline Road, this place is legit if you have a serious donut craving.  They also have breakfast sandwiches, coffee, and boba tea if you've got a hankering for those and not donuts.   The donuts are super fresh, LARGE, and very fluffy.  My personal favorite is the maple bacon donut but their toasted coconut donut is worth drooling over as well.  The prices are really reasonable and everyone that works there is very friendly and helpful. Give yourself a few extra minutes in the morning because this place is very busy.  Fortunately, they are very efficient with their service and I have never waited in line longer than 10 minutes, even on a weekend morning.  If you're in the area, stop in.  You definitely won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went back and their donuts are AMAZING. Best than any donut I have In my life!!!  The service is great and the employees are so nice it makes the experience that much better! Def my go to donut spot from now on."}
{"text":"Donuts are soft, fluffy, and just delicious. Their breakfast sandwiches are just as good served at a great price."}
{"text":"This place is just phenomenal.   Everything is fresh baked daily and delish.  I won't buy my donuts or croissants anywhere else."}
{"text":"boba tea is awesome!!! the last time I had boba was in California. the donuts are good the prices are good. cant complain, the place is clean and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Sunrise donuts are the best. The customer service is awesome. They are very friendly. Their donuts are fresh and outright delicious."}
{"text":"This donut shop is your typical donut shop. It has a variety of donuts. The only downside is that not all the donuts are ready when they open. I stopped there a few times to pick up some donuts for my co workers, but all they had was glazed donuts. I was actually surprised."}
{"text":"Me and my son tried this place for the first time we just stumbled upon it leaving the grocery store. First off the customer service is great they are very nice we got breakfast bagels w/ egg, bacon and cheese very yummy. Second the prices are awesome great breakfast food for the price, we also ordered 1/2 dozen and he gave us an extra one for free! 3rd the foods yummy haha we will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Delicious donuts and friendly service! My family and I have enjoyed their donuts on several occasions and our experience has always been great. My kids LOVE the inexpensive donut holes and my husband really likes the old fashioned. We would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Delicious. My only complaint would be all the weight I'm going to gain from eating here. Haha!! Friendly people and delicious choices, can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Why is it that donut shop owners are just the sweetest? Maybe because they are delivering circular globs of happiness and the sugar just seeps into their blood?   Anyway, I'm from California and was visiting Phoenix with my sisters to meet our newest little nephew whose family lives down the street from Sunrise. We just consumed an ungodly amount of tacos at La Santisima- side note that place is my Phoenix addiction! I have to get a mahi mahi taco every time I'm here (http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-santisima-gourmet-taco-shop-phoenix).   Ok, sorry for the fish taco tangent, back to the donuts. My sister who lives here had been telling us about Sunrise and my other sister, who is preggo btw, yells at me to immediately turn when she sees the sign for it as we are driving home. It is literally 7:58pm, meaning 2 minutes till closing, and we are already stuffed to the rafters. Yet I can't help but follow the commanding shrieks. And I'm so glad we did. The girl at the counter was such a doll. We bought a half dozen but she threw in a couple extra since they were closing and she was so personable and friendly. They had a smaller selection since it was the end of the day but our favorites were the cinnamon glaze (there's cinnamon baled on the inside making it taste like a cinnamon roll), the blueberry donut, maple bacon bar, and surprisingly the vanilla cake donut. I prefer cake donuts anyway but this was like a fluffy vanilla cupcake.   My recommendation is start your sunrise with Sunrise :]"}
{"text":"The donuts here are phenomenal. The experience and atmosphere inside the restraunt is not that thrilling, however."}
{"text":"Love their donuts!! Best in the business!! I will keep going back! They definitely have my loyalty!!"}
{"text":"Should be after sun rise donuts.  I went to this place at exactly 5AM on the date of this posting, and I was greeted with a locked door and \"we don't have anything yet\". Why open at 5 if the treats aren't ready? I  was so prepared, especially after reading the reviews here on YELP.  So very disappointed. Some of us are not on banker's hours :). Better luck next time, I hope."}
{"text":"I love, love this place. The donuts are so good and fresh, not matter what time of day. They have a wide variety of different types of donuts. The people are so friendly and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"Great friendly,fast service. Anything I've ever eaten there has been amazing! My favorite is the ham egg and cheese croissant with jalapeño! Fire!"}
{"text":"My new favorite donut place! Their donuts are always fresh, light and just really delicious!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the service here! The woman who was working this morning was so friendly and helpful! Donuts are great too! Thanks for making my morning a little brighter!"}
{"text":"Love their boba Thai tea and apple fritter! My brothers and I go here a few times a week. Amazing treats and great customer service. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Donuts, breakfast sandwiches... What else could you possibly need?! The donut holes are little pillows of heaven melting in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Awesome donuts!  Tough decision between the apple fritters or the buttermilk glazed, but you can't go wrong either way.  Donuts are really fresh and delicious, much better than you can find at the grocery store or anywhere else.  The owners are really nice and aim to please.  There's nothing like fresh donuts for the whole family on the weekend from a great local neighborhood donut shop, brings back fond memories from when I was a kid!"}
{"text":"This local donut shop is amazing I've never had a bad experience and I'm a donut lover so I go often, the staff is friendly and the donuts are always fresh. Definitely a place to return to often and its great to support local shops."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts! Great price! And their Thai tea is pretty good! So glad it's near our home."}
{"text":"These donuts are amazing. They are fresh and delicious! Staff is very kind and friendly and price wise, this is very affordable. Some of the best donuts in Arizona. Not a ton of sitting room. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I am not really a Donut fan but their donuts were ridiculous! Fresh, delicious, melts in your mouth Fantastic. Sadly, the bagels were lacking: can't really call it a bagel as it tasted more like just regular bread. I'd ordered the egg & cheese bagel and it didn't have butter on it or anything, very dry, I asked and they did put cream cheese on it though. Important to note is my concern for the flies in the shop. I understand flies can get into a shop but when your cases are open and there are flies on the actual donuts that's not good for business. I saw a couple people walk in and then leave without ordering, must've seen the flies. Also, while we sat I noticed the employees in the back were working but if someone came in the door, they were not aware. Maybe they should have a bell or monitor in the back or something. Overall just an OK experience for me."}
{"text":"Really good donuts. I love taking my son and wife here. Service is also great. The girl that works here, Serena, always treats us very nicely and is very generous with free treats."}
{"text":"It's been tough since most of the Krispy Kreme donut shops were closed in Arizona. There were no donut shops in Laveen until this one opened up. It's amazing!! My favorite donut place now. Wide variety, always fresh and soft. I am a huge fan on creme filled (not custard) and they have a delicious one. Also, they have a maple bacon donut. Enough said!!"}
{"text":"Sunrise Donuts is the place for Donuts!! They have everything from chocolate to strawberry to even vanilla! All sorts of flavors and donuts! You have to stop on by and try their amazing sweets you cant miss out!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been waiting for a donut place closer to Laveen and I'm so glad this place opened up. Every time I visit I am greeted with smiles and it really makes a difference! Oh and the donuts are delicious! Only downside is that if you go a little later in the day they run out of my favorites, but it makes sense and I'm glad they don't keep old donuts."}
{"text":"Tasty doughnuts and great staff. They know their stuff, just ask them for recommendations."}
{"text":"Love this place! Ham & Cheese croissant...I think yes!"}
{"text":"Quick & friendly service! I love to support local biz & will definitely be back.  I actually came for the boba because normally I would have to go all the way to the far East or West side of town to get some, so this is super convenient!!  The Thai tea boba was great! Not too bitter or sweet like it can be sometimes, and the boba was nice & soft.  Awesome prices as well."}
{"text":"Stay away if you are watching your weight. This place is delicious and so reasonably priced. Where else can you go and only pay $3 for breakfast??? Love this place, family owned and operated."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Fresh donuts, great prices and great food. I've tried: -Bacon & Maple Bar -Chocolate Bar -Donut Holes -Glaze Donuts  -Pink Frosted w/ Sprinkles -Thai Iced Tea w/ Boba   All of the donuts were good... Soft, flavorful and not too sweet, just made perfectly. The Thai Iced Tea is worth drop kicking someone for; and this establishment is easily a 4/5 stars. Highly recommend... In fact, writing this makes me want to see them tomorrow so I will!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. I'm convinced they have round the clock elves working here, because they are always open. Who has heard of a donut shop open during the evening?! Aside from their workhorse hours, the donuts are top notch. They are super friendly and accomodating too. I'm a weirdo and actually love unfrosted donuts, and the workers are always more than happy to grab a fresh naked donut for me. Even more delish: the croissants. They are possibly the best croissants I've ever had, and I'm pretty snobby about butter pastries.   The staff here are so friendly and sweet. They love it when I bring my toddler in and they always throw in several generous handfuls of fresh donut holes to our box just for her.   Laveen is proud of Sunrise Donuts!"}
{"text":"Best donuts I've ever had. I don't eat here anymore as I have gluten issues now but when I did they were the only donut shop I went too. Here's hoping they start doing gluten free :)"}
{"text":"I love this place.  This location opened several months ago and we finally got a chance to check it out a little while ago.  The ratings were really good and it's just down the street so we figured, why not?  The staff is super friendly and nice.  It never takes very long to get donuts even if there is a line.  We have been a few times now and the donuts have been delicious.  If you live in the area are or are just passing through, I recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"Great selection for a good price what more could you ask for. When you get a box get some doughnut holes they pile a good amount in."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place yesterday and it was closed down. Too bad, they had such a great selection."}
{"text":"Definitely better than dunkin!! These donuts are made fresh by the friendliest donut makers in Phoenix. To bad they open at five in the morning, that's the time I usually have to be at work. Sometimes I go when I'm already late. They also make really good bacon egg and cheese croissant."}
{"text":"Family run business. Very sweet who can seriously bake. Very delicious and huge donuts. Go support!"}
{"text":"Great doughnuts. Beats DD 100%. I would give 5 stars, but they do not have a good coffee selection. But stop by SB's, then head to this place for some tasty doughnuts."}
{"text":"Love that this place is five minutes up the street and their donuts are amazing... Service is quick and friendly... Prices are great... And yummy yummy yummy!"}
{"text":"I've been to this shop a couple of times now and have not been disappointed. The doughnuts are tasty and always so fresh. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the prices are reasonable. It's great to have an excellent doughnut shop in the area. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So far great donuts , yummy Apple fritters and tasty croissants I love how fresh it is and how friendly they are."}
{"text":"When I think doughnuts it's usually typical store doughnuts. Not the case at Sunrise Doughnuts their amazingly chewy pillows of doughy goodness are outstanding but be careful because they are addicting! What's crazy amazing is a dozen is only $8.89 so get two!"}
{"text":"Sunrise Donuts have great donuts and I love there drinks my favorite is to get a mango smoothies with strawberry popping pearls it tastes so amazing"}
{"text":"I highly recommend Sunrise Donuts! Donuts are fresh, soft and of course delicious!!! I am a big fan of ham and cheese croissants and let me tell you, this place has the best ham and cheese croissant around! I swear to you it is second to none! Not only are their donuts and baked goods wonderful and tasty but their boba is fresh and incomparable to your boba shops. I personally prefer boba here!!!   Now enough about the food and beverages. Good food and beverages is nice but what makes this business a 5 star business in my book is the employees. I've never had bad service here! The employees are extremely friendly. Great service, wonderful food and something delicious to wash it down with... What more can you ask for? Only if I can give and extra star!"}
{"text":"Had my first donut today from Sunrise and it was excellent. My son even took two jelly donuts to my mother and she ate both right away, that's how good they were. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Best bacon maple doughnuts I've ever had. Best raised doughnuts I've ever had. This place deserves every single star in their five star rating."}
{"text":"I went in to get a dozen donuts and there was only 1 tray to choose from so I thought ok I will only take 6.  I asked the lady for a small box because I was buying them for someone else as a gift.  She did not like the idea of giving me a box.  She got a small box but after I selected the donuts I wanted she took the donuts out of the box and squashed them into 3 small bags.   Like whats up with that??? Six dollars + tax and I am going to give them to someone as a thank you NO way.   I paid her and left and went to Dunkin Donuts up the street they gave me a box and I didn't have to ask for it that was presentable.  I will never go back to sunrise again.  I don't like Dunkin Donuts but what the heck they give you a box and you don't have to ask for it.   Not enough selection at Sunrise they need to step up their act."}
{"text":"Best donuts ever! If you like melt in your mouth type of donuts then this is going to be your favorite donut shop. They have an amazing group of people working behind the counter. Everyone is always smiling and you are greeted the moment you walk in the door. They deserve more than 5 stars"}
{"text":"I'm going to start off with I am not a donut person. I prefer pastries i.e. croissants and such. These donuts though. Light, flavorful, a tad greasy, satisfying. We ordered a dozen of all flavors and we were completely satisfied. Also had the Thai tea with boba, this was a bit too sweet. It tasted better as the ice melted and watered it down."}
{"text":"Quick & very friendly service, clean, tasty donuts, yummy boba - so happy to have a spot like this in Laveen!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Large variety of flavors and such a sweet staff. It was my first time coming in and I got 3 donuts, my favorite was the bacon maple bar! (All were fluffy and delicious btw) very pleased with the service and quality of the food!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Great breakfast sandwich - homemade croissant with egg cheese and ham. Wonderful donuts. Will be returning. Large enough to eat in and enjoy some company."}
{"text":"If you own the new location in El Mirage on Greenway, I think it would be a great idea to list donuts at petite and a lessor price than a regular size, normal size donut. This is ridiculous. Also why open I'm only half of your display cabinet is less than 1/4 filled. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"I always get excited when I see 5 stars for any business with a decent amount of reviews.  This place is small and offers plenty of choices for donuts, croissants, breakfast sandwiches & boba drinks."}
{"text":"I landed in Phoenix last night and based on the amazing yelp reviews I had to stop and see what all the fuss was about. And I must say, 5 stars is completely appropriate. The donuts here are absolute amazing, melt in your mouth delicious. On top of that the woman behind the counter was amazingly friendly and even gave us each a donut hole to try when I mentioned it was our first time stopping in. We were overwhelmed with the selection and easily could have ordered one of everything if our stomachs would allow. AND we had 1 donut, a specialty donut, and 2 medium coffees for only $5! You can't beat that.  If you're in Phoenix, stop in!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Cantaloupe drink and French crueller donuts are the best!great customer service and family owned and operated. A must in Laveen!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! If I could give Sunrise 10 stars I would!! Best doughnuts I've ever tasted...light fluffy crispy and always fresh! The maple bacon are the BEST and the ham and cheese croissants are to die for!! The staff there are the most friendly people and they will always include a bag of doughnut holes when you buy a dozen and sometimes give you a bonus doughnut too!! We love this place and it has now become a family tradition to get at least 2 dozen on Christmas morning!! You rock Sunrise Doughnuts!!!!"}
