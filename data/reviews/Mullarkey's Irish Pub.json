{"text":"Classic Willoughby dive bar. They always have a good Irish musician on Saturday nights. Cool place to grab a beer. They have good happy hour specials Monday - thursday. $1 domestics and wells from 4-7"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar with okay beers on tap and a warm, inviting atmosphere. They had a great guitarist/singer last night with a young/hipster vibe. Lots of seating and also room for dancing."}
{"text":"I'm not shocked that there aren't any reviews here. A few co-workers and I walked in on a Tuesday evening after 1899 was getting a little crowded, hoping to enjoy some pub games and catch a little basketball on TV. Our wishes were granted. We got whatever we wanted. Because we were the only customers in the (rather large) bar for the 90 minutes we were there.

Mullarkey's had just about everything we wanted:  multiple Irish beers on tap, a foosball table, a dart board, and a bunch of flatscreen TV's with our choice of programming. If we had been hungry, they had plenty of candlelit tables at which we could have enjoyed a snack. But between the emptiness, the rotten egg smell (we asked if there was a gas leak), and the people stomping around in the apartment upstairs, the amenities were hard to enjoy. The restroom was isolated downstairs and looked like the perfect location for a mugging (with a nearby back door exit). Oh, and they had a $15 minimum for debit/credit cards. I've never heard of a minimum higher that $5.

Mullarkey's has some good building blocks, but it was easy to see why 1899 had a bigger crowd."}
{"text":"Jesus what happened to this place.  Back in the day it used to be a fun place to swill whiskey and hear Mossy play rebel tunes.  Worst part was dodging the parasite Willoughby cops on the way home.  Now, its run down and kinda crusty.  Don't get me wrong, I like crusty but not THIS crusty.  Still has a weird sports undertone too which I find odd, but ok.  Having the high school football helmets on the wall and all.  Let it go, Al Bundy.  Lost the feel of an Irish pub.  The rest of Willoughby is becoming this swanky, wanna-be Tremont (but 10years too late) vibe.  I just see this place falling behind..."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I walked in on Sat. Afternoon. There were 6 people in there during a festival right outside. We sat at a table. Nobody ever came over to even greet us or anything. After a while we thought we might have a better chance if we sat at the bar. The bartender saw us immediately but took 5-10 minutes before she came over to say be right with you. She never came back. Don't forget, there were 6 people in the place.We walked across the street to Ballantines & spent our $$"}
{"text":"I frequent this place because I know a few staff members but I actually don't really care for it. It's dingy And needs revamped to bring in that Irish pub appeal instead of a dive. The drafts are all irish except for miller light (which is free refills on your birthday ) which is a nice quality flare but it needs much more than that. The live music is alright but usually gets old by the end of the night. Staff/service is hit or miss really and the crowd isn't always desirable."}
{"text":"This is a fun pub with a lot of character and personality inside. They recently got some new tvs that are great to watch the games on. 

Get the Gold-certified Guinness! I don't think you can find that too many places in NEO."}
{"text":"Athens, Ohio. That's where this place belongs. Or, shudder, Bowling Green. Reminds me of every college dive i've ever had the misfortune of thinking wouldn't completely revolt me. Narrow, dark and full of cheap wooden booths. It was half empty as my b-day crawl wound down around 1. But the people left there were the dregs of Willoughby. The bathroom was absolutely atrocious and didn't even have a tp dispenser. Hope you just have to go #1. Or puke.

So seeing as how this was such a dump, hell, let's do another shot! I had Jage. Probably my douchiest moment in recent memory. Buttery crotch guy had Jameson, the wife had vodka. Two Rolling Rocks and a draught Newcastle were downed as well. It might be slightly more civilized for a Browns game, i suppose. But when the kids invade Willoughby, this place is a bit much."}
{"text":"Really fun vibe!  

Great bar with live music.  It's a little divey, but that's a good thing!  Great mix of a crowd, fun fishbowl options, beer, liquor and generally fun times!  

Really liked the Irish singer.  He got the crowd dancing and you could tell who was Irish because they were singing along.  

Great party bar!"}
