{"text":"Hey all, my 5 star is solely based on the food. I've visited at various times during the day and it seems run well enough, and though it seems to have a fairly large group of regulars it really doesn't bother me, but I know that that could turn some patrons off. HOWEVER, as a Chicagoian who values quality food I can honestly say that Jolies has a menu that's unrivaled in the valley. I've easily tried half a dozen dishes and everything was MUCH better than I expected. The service is always good, and it's easy to flag down a server when things get busy and they seem on top of it. So thanks, Jolie's, for being a place that's been reliably good."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere and awesome local bands, great place too check out if your looking for a cool little dive bar."}
{"text":"Great Place to hang out!! Waitresses are very efficient and fun!! The live entertainment is very diverse and caters to all types of people! The food is also very good and very reasonable!! I tell everyone that is looking to have some fun and a great place to hang out about Jolie's and her staff!!"}
{"text":"I'm reading through some of the reviews, and had to check to make sure I'm reading the right place.. Jolie's Place to be certain.  First off, we love this joint. The few times we have been were very good experiences. The negative reviews I'm reading about racism and bad food is pretty off compared to our visits. To be honest, my husband is not white, but just as we are polite to everyone we meet, we have never met any staff here to be anything but friendly and attentive. I rate the service to be excellent, actually, and that's very hard to find anymore.  That being said, we stop in for breakfast burritos and bloody mary's from time to time as a treat to ourselves. Not a greasy, messy burrito you expect from fast food, but really tasty, and I'm actually craving the fresh salsa right now. We can always count on good beer on tap, and really enjoy the jukebox. Its a great little spot to relax and unwind. We have never had a bad time here, and it continues to be one of our favorite spots in Chandler."}
{"text":"Dont come here unless your planning on sitting at the bar!  We took our two small kids thinking it was a decent place.  Always drive by and see lots of cars in the parking lot so decided to try it.  Dark !! Not Family friendly.  Service was HORRIBLE! Food was poor!  Took at least 7 minutes for someone to even noticed we sat down. Perfect place if you are 60+ and want to sit at a bar and drink all day!  Two thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Fish and chips. Terrible unless you like your fish batter soaked in oil. It was like eating fish covered in a wet soggy pretzel. It was very oily probably cooking wasn't hot."}
{"text":"Horrible serive. Warm drinks. Greasy food. We tried this place several times; we really wanted to like it! But after about five or six times of the worst service I've ever had we decided no more. Not to mention they allow children at their little \"casino\" (which is weird anyway that they have it)....it was 11 at night. The servers also take their friends in the back allllllllll the time. Happened every time we went there. Why? Strange and unwelcoming place"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to come hangout with friends and family. Have a cold beer or drink. Shoot pool, play cornhole or other games they have. Love the lady's behind the bar and the ones who serve you. And Stephanie Upton makes one of the best Bloody Mary's I've had. If your ever in Chandler,  come bye. I think you'll like the place."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place! So much to do great music people are great. Foods amazing especially the morning! I go here to play pool and have a few and enjoy the friendly staff they here and I never had a bad time there."}
{"text":"I'm currently waiting for my food, which I ordered over 40 minutes ago!!  Last time I ordered food here the wait was the same. I gave them the benefit of the doubt last time and didn't write about it.  I don't know what the major delay is but it seems to habitual. If you literally have nothing to do for awhile, the food is decent, but you'll earn it"}
{"text":"Always a dynamic crowd... staff is always very, very friendly ..   The food is always really good.... honestly one of the best kept food secrets in town"}
{"text":"great place to relax, have a couple of beers and listen to cool bands. good bar food with all the standards. bike night on Thursdays."}
{"text":"Always a great place to hang out!! Great people friendly staff and great service and great food! Always some kind of entertainment morning day or night, with the local scene appeal! Been going here since it opened up and I always enjoy the time spent here."}
{"text":"Really good bar food! The fried mac n cheese was delicious! Prices were very reasonable... everything on the menu was under $10. The service was really good too! The only thing that kind of sucked was the music blasting the entire time we were there. I had to yell to the person next to me and it wasn't even a busy night."}
{"text":"This place is where you get your greasy bar food fix. When you need some tasty bar apps then go to this place. I've been here a couple times.   However, there are a couple things I'd like to point out. One the service can be really crappy at times. Depending on what time of day you go or what time of season sport it is you'll get decent service when you go around that time. One thing that's iffy noise. The couple times I've been there I noticed that people literally have to yell at each other because the music or tvs are so loud. Yes, I understand it's a bar but it would be nice to properly give your order."}
{"text":"Great place to hang, relax and watch sports on tv.   Great happy hour prices and happy hour food are large portions.    Ask for Jamie.  She is awesome behind the bar!"}
{"text":"We love Jolie's Place! I'm not usually here for bar hours but it is one of my favorite places to come into for a bite at lunch. The staff is friendly and both Jolie and Jessica take great care to make sure we are satisfied every time. The bbq burger is my total fav because it reminds me so much of a delicious burger from back home I just can't get anywhere out here. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great place great food . It is a lot of fun the staff are very good to us. Try the grilled wings .  the best we've ever had"}
{"text":"Great specials, great service, fast, and affordable.  This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Love love Jolie's! Everyone there is so friendly and welcoming.  I had the most amazing chicken parm sandwich. The portion was huge and the chicken was succulent. They must make their marinara in house because it tasted fresh and had a little zest. Beers were cold and the band keeps everyone hopping. The bartenders are fun and attentive. (We've only sat at the bar not tables)  We'll be back again. It's always nice to go to a bar that is packed with people."}
{"text":"After reading the 5-star reviews, I was so excited to try this place. We drive by it all the time, so I was hoping we would have a new neighborhood favorite. There are always a lot of cars in the parking lot, so I thought it was a good sign. When we walked in, I realized all the cars belong to the people at the bar. It is a very large bar and was nearly packed with people at 1pm. As we sat down in a booth, we quickly noticed the long looks of the people at the other tables. Someone finally came over to give us a menu and asked the table next to us if they also needed menus too but they said they had been waiting for their food for a long time. They finally got their apps but had to ask for their entrees to go because it was so long of a wait. We finally got our order in and waited and waited and waited. Someone from the bar came out to see how we were and we told her that we were waiting for a long time and my husband needed a refill on his drink. She said she would check on our order and refill the drink, then went behind the bar, put down his cup and asked someone at the bar for his order. She never came back and never went to check on the food. The waitress finally comes back (we're there for 45 minutes at this time) and we ask her to just box up the food because we were getting light headed from the paint fumes. We took the food home and it was just OK. The parmesan fries were pretty good but the onion rings, while a great texture, were way too salty. My BBQ pulled pork was more of a chunks of fatty pork, not pulled but the bun was good. My husband's shrimp po'boy was OK but he didn't think he could taste the shrimp. Good bun, though. I wouldn't recommend Jolie's place for food but maybe you can just go for a beer. We won't be back."}
{"text":"My buddy and I were looking for a new local bar since the Drummer and FR Draft closed. This isn't it. We walked in on a Sunday night. There were 2 people sitting at the bar and probably abt 20 people in other areas. Two employees talking to each other, I'm going to guess at least one was a barmaid since she was behind the bar. We waited 6 minutes.... AFTER I checked the time..to see how long it would be before we were asked if we wanted a drink. No one came over. We left, Tried again another night since I figured maybe the lousy service was a one time deal. It's not the service sux. It appears they only serve you if they know you."}
{"text":"Nice place but bartenders change the jukebox for songs they don't like even though I paid to hear them.....minor thing but it should be addressed"}
{"text":"DAY DRINKERS PARADISE!!!  I stopped in here while on a dive bar crawl around 10am on a Monday.  It sits in the corner of a dead mall, in a not so good area of Chandler.  So looking at Jolie's from the outside I was expecting to walk into a typical, dirty, smelly, dive bar with a half dozen or so professional drinkers perched on their stools being fed cheap drinks by a bar maid who wanted to be anywhere but there; have my one beer and adventure on to the next place.  I stepped into Jolie's and boy was I in for a SHOCK.  First off I noticed that this place is big and CLEAN!!!   Everything in the place looked new or just painted or just cleaned.  So I sit down at the bar and am quickly greeted by a friendly, cute, and very busy bartender who introduces herself and asks what she can get me.  I ordered a large draft and received an ice cold beer in a huge FROZEN \"man sized\" mug for a couple of bucks!    Damm...I am kinda liking this place...lots of sports on big NEW HD TVs...great service...And it looks like somebody decorated the place too...I mean,  I am looking around and notice curtains on the windows...pillars behind the bar....chrome... wood...stone tile in the head, lots of designy type stuff I know nothing about but women do....stuff I don't recall ever seeing in a dive or sports bar.  The decor gave the place a comfortable, home-y kinda feel.  So half way through my second ICE COLD GIANT MUG I am being addressed by first name and offered food. Normally I would not eat bar food, especially \"dive bar\" food.  But ...well...hell... everything else has been way better than expected, why not try the food...  My sandwich was really good and the fries were awesome!  I mean the fries smelled and tasted like they came from an actual real potato and not from a frozen food factory in Bejing.    This was NOT the usual greasy-fatty-salty-over breaded, nasty stuff usually served at bars. This was fresh, hot, home cooking kind of food with generous portions and priced really low...in a \"dead mall bar\"....Un-frigging-believable...  Before leaving I visited the head and it was spotlessly clean, with not one line of graffiti on the walls. How the heck did they pulled that off??????  Now maybe this visit was a fluke or I just got lucky and hit this place on their best day but for now my impression is, they got something \"special\" going on at Jolie's Place and the next time I get the opportunity to do some \"day drinking\",  I'm starting at Jolie's."}
{"text":"Fun place to come have a beer, play some pool and throw darts. I haven't eaten food here but I've heard it's good."}
{"text":"I have come to this establishment numerous times to spend time with friends and family. Every time I pay cash for my tab the waitress keeps the coin portion of my change and expect the tip. Today I went there to eat with family and friends my food was cold I could not eat it I sent it back when I asked for my tab I was expected to pay for the food I didn't eat because it was not edible. The waitress was rude the staff is rude and unfortunately I will never return to this establishment."}
{"text":"My first time tonight - pretty good food. Service lacked BUT Heather saved the night by stepping in and up.   Parm Fries yum. Green Chili Pork - meat needed seasoning but put with the tortilla, squeeze of lime and pico made it tastier. Will be back to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of bars within walking distance of my house.  Jolies place is less than a 5 minute walk.  That, as well as good beers on tap, live music, and friendly/good looking bartenders make this a place I very much enjoy going.    Never a shortage of fun people here, especially on weekends!  Go ahead and order the 32 oz size, you know you want to."}
{"text":"Normally a good place to go. Brought some new customs to check it out. Waited five minutes. No one served us. Left."}
{"text":"My name is Daryl.  I'm a patron at Jolie's.  I'm also a member of the local music community and the band I'm a member of (Two Night Stand) played in her place on a few occasions.  I have been there at noon, and late at night. I've never had a situation there.  I've had some odd looks, but guess what...you can get odd looks at any bar in any city in any country.   I can't speak on your experience LeRoy, and I wouldn't ever downplay it.  But, I know Charli personally and professionally. Neither she, Jolie nor her staff would ever tolerate rascist behavior.  I don't say what I heard, I'm telling you what I know.  In fact, I was going to go by there tonight and I'm definitely going to go now.  So far as grubbage goes, I've always liked what I've got...I have no prob asking for something if I want it.  If the service is slow...there's usually a reason, and if I don't feel like waiting, I'll ask another server for it...and it's always served without an attitude.   If it weren't true, I wouldn't be saying so.  LeRoy..don't know you, but I hope you give Jolie's another shot man."}
{"text":"This place is actually a great local spot. Not exactly a dive bar but a little seedy. If you're looking for a place to sit at the bar for a couple drinks, have some pretty good bar food, and people watch this is a great spot. Very eclectic crowd makes for great people watching. Be prepared because even when there isn't live music this is the loudest bar I've been in a long time.   The reason I gave only 3 stars is because if you're seated at a table the service is spotty at best. We sat for 15 minutes before we even got acknowledged- then We ordered an appetizer and a couple burgers. The appetizer actually came out 10 minutes after we finished the burgers. They try to play the \"everything is made from scratch\" angle - which really means they don't have a clue on how to run the kitchen. Lastly, no apology or offer to do anything to offset the poor experience. Will only be back if we are dice bar hopping."}
{"text":"Been in Arizona for 2 years now, so far Jolies place is my favorite bar. Good food, good drinks nice employees."}
{"text":"This place is a bar that serves some food. What surprise me the most is that there are a lot of people who are here at 6:30 AM doing bar stuff. The waitress are really here for the bar not for the restaurant, they brought me the food but no utensils. The food is A-OK not great but not bad, nothing special. The atmosphere is really bad though, real dark and most people here are drinking or playing pool or just doing bar stuff but at 6:30 in the morning. These people must be real hard core drinkers or just poor loney folks. I am not one that cares about atmosphere but hey at least have some lights so you can read a newspaper with your breakfast, no one is reading in this place for sure."}
{"text":"Update May 2017: I'm changing my orginal rating from 5 stars down to 3 stars. After visiting about 10 times now, some of the polish has come off. Any establishment is only as good as the management, and I've observed several key areas where there is definitely room for improvement. The weeknight \"patio therapy\" that I found so attractive at first has now shown some serious flaws. First and foremost, a group of \"regulars\" consistently occupy a large table, usually front and center for the musicians, and they have grown increasingly loud and obnoxious, in direct correlation to the alcohol consumed - go figure. This can only happen when the servers cater to them and over-serve them instead of cutting them off. It's so blatant that the casual observer can scan the crowd and see the looks of disgust and annoyance on the faces of the other customers in the proximity of this group. Also,  as the crowds have grown for these events, the quality of the service has plummeted. On a Thursday night in April, there was a large patio crowd to see Harry Luge perform. Our server disappeared for over 30 minutes so we finally snagged another server passing by, who confided in us that our server was in the ladies room having a meltdown because she was overwhelmed. Seriously? Either she is not capable of handling a busy night, and/or the bar was understaffed, either of which scenarios reflects on the management.  Lastly, it's been seldom that my wife and I could attend on a weekend night due to me working a weekend shift myself. However, due to a change in my schedule, we were actually able to get out on. Saturday night to have dinner. We decided to stay for the band, as we had heard they were really good. We arrived at 8 PM and had dinner, and the band started at 9 PM. When I tabbed out after 11PM, I was surprised to see that our drinks had a band surcharge added to the price after 9 PM. When I asked the bartender, she said that since they do not charge a cover charge for the band, the drink prices go up once the band starts. Oh really? And you don't inform people of this policy in advance? Don't get me wrong, it's not the extra 3 dollars or so that I paid with the surcharge, it's the principal of the matter. I mean, I dropped a $65 tab in addition to the $7 Lyft fee that we paid each way, plus tips. So another $3 - $5 isn't gonna break me. But even clubs that do charge a cover have an option to beat the cover charge by arriving early, knowing you will be spending money while you're there before the band starts. But for us, having arrived earlier and having dinner and drinks, and then to find out after the fact that there is a surcharge being assessed without informing us made us feel like we were being nickel and dimed.  That's ok, next time we will go to another local club that doesn't charge a cover and doesn't gouge patrons by raising drink prices. Jolie's needs to get their act together to avoid being labeled \"just another bar\" which is currently my opinion. The food itself is not bad and the quality of the bands and live music are generally solid, which is why I'm now rating it a 3 instead of lowering it more after my recent disappointments."}
{"text":"shout out to jessica the kick ass manager who has an amazing tolerance to drunk latino men like myself. :)  i love this bar."}
{"text":"Jolie's has the most all-inclusive bar food menu of any places I've been. Great breakfasts, lunches and snacks. Friendly staff and reasonable prices. Try the Cowboy Smothered Tots. They are amazing."}
{"text":"It's very hard to find a sports bar that serves breakfast. On Sunday mornings I want a good breakfast and I want to watch football. This place has that. And the food is delicious, and made to order! I had the smothered hash browns, which I loved. The portion was actually one I could finish, which is unheard of in the world of breakfast foods. My boyfriend had a breakfast burrito with chorizo, and he enjoyed that as well. The service was good and everyone was super friendly. I know why the parking lot is full all the time now. We will definitely be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have been to Jolie's Place A number of times. The times I have been there, I was there to perform and provide entertainment with my band. We have six members in the band, three are black, two are white, and one is of unknown origins or exact race is questionable. We have never had anything but great responses from the patrons and the staff  alike. In fact the dance floor was packed with people of every ethnic background.   I do understand there are people with crappy attitudes out there. I nor any of my band members have ever experienced that at Jolie's. Always good times and good fun and will be doing it again in the not to distant future. Sincerely Jim Porter Manager Outside the line https://www.facebook.com/outsidethelinemusic/videos/1043219835690115/"}
{"text":"Never have I ever had good service here. I go back for the good food and good prices, but not once have I been satisfied with the service. The bartenders will ignore you long after your drink is empty, not checking in on you once. I find myself always needing to ask for everything, if they even care to acknowledge me. It doesn't ever seem to be overwhelmingly busy, so what else are the servers doing when they aren't at my table for 20 minutes at a time? I'm not a needy customer, but I at least expect the bare minimum."}
{"text":"I started going to Jolie's Place because they are across the street from my dog groomer and they open early.  I could pop in there for breakfast and a drink while I waited for my dog. I have always had excellent service and even ended up hiring one of the bartender's band for a gig. Jolie is friendly and welcomes everyone."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful selection of beers - much more than you would expect from a 'biker bar'.  Far from it!  Great entertainment on the patio too - can't beat this place!"}
{"text":"Open early for all of us night shift workers. They always serve up a great breakfast. I've been coming here religiously after my shift and they've never disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place! Biker friendly, sports, live music. The food takes forever because it AWESOME. As a server myself, I get it. It's always busy, chaotic for someone working there I'm sure. But always friendly and good prices too. I love breakfast and the sandwiches :) it's our neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"SEND HELP! I've  been sitting at this table for 45 minutes past finishing my meal and I can find my waitress to pay!  Let me give you my money! I'm  seriously  considering creating a makeshift flag out of napkins and straws, or finding the manager again.  I don't want to be trapped here till closing.    The food is good, it's bar fare that is above average, yes a little greasy as other have said but this is bar food and it's right where it should be for that.    The bartenders or managers are really nice too, especially when it comes to finding your M.I.A. waitress (it took 30 minutes to even find a waitress to order)  Wait staff is often impossible to find without help, I've been twice before for music but didn't eat because I just couldn't find anyone to order from.  They also seem to get confused about orders and in my experience what actually belongs on the bill.    So I say again, send help! Specifically better wait staff."}
{"text":"My friend was telling me about how he was in a singing contest and wanted me to go cheer him on. I came right away and just like the other review yeah everyone stares at you when you walk in *awkward. So found my friend and I told him I'm gonna go get a beer at the bar, it literally took me 10 mins to get a beer, because the waitresses where like flirting with old men trying to get a tip, hey I get it but they were trying TOO hard. Finally got my brew and it was karaoke night so signed up for a song didn't get to sing until a hour later even though the singing competition was over and kept seeing the same people sing again and again , my friend that I met there was like hold on let me see when your next , so finally she called my name and I know she turned my mic down on purpose, cuz I could here HER  loud and proud then when I got on the mic she just walked away and got another beer and even my friends who where there went up to her and said Hey! Can you turn her mic up cuz I can't hear her! She's like oh sorry ( I used to be a Karaoke Dj my self and I would never treat my customers the way she does) like when people are done singing, the singers are looking around like Ummm.. Where's the Dj!?! And she's over taking shots at the bar , and it's awkward and silence then she finally grabs the mic and doesn't really cheer them on like good job my friend, she just moves on to the next singer then once again when the singer is done there looking around for the Dj and she's no where to be found , oh wait she's at the bar taking shots, I mean I drank a couple of beers when I Dj but damn why is she trying to hard to get all liquored up. She's unprofessional and that's why I would never recommend this bar for karaoke night, she doesn't make the singers fill welcome not important. Horrible Service and Horrible Dj!"}
{"text":"Awesome bar, right around the corner, with a real neighborhood feel. Courtney and Jessica were awesome and a real hoot!!! The food blew away my expectations and the my glass never went empty!!! And the TVs, they have a ton, and were even able to get the hockey game I wanted. I will be back again!!!"}
{"text":"I come to jolies place frequently for there food, drinks and service, all of which are very good."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast with a group of people.  Myself and one other person were the only 2 that didn't eat.  I had coffee and he had a few beers while everyone else ate.  We were getting ready to leave so I went to the bar to pay my bill and was charged $4.00 for a cup of coffee!  I am not sure if it was a mistake or what but I think that's a little steep!"}
{"text":"Not great, not completely horrendous. The atmosphere inside is way too dark, even during the day. It's also not in the best part of Chandler, so I'd hate to be there alone at night. We sat out on the patio and while it was only around 1 in the afternoon there were plenty of people drinking. Our waitress was nice, although a bit slow to fulfill our requests because she was too preoccupied with chatting. California chicken sandwich was decent, but the parmesan fries were too caked with parmesan to even taste the fry. Pretty standard price on everything. I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go here to watch some games. He use to frequent the place until a waitress never came back with his change one night. So two years later he decides to take me, mind you I've never been.   Immediately when we walked in all eyes were on us. Like the whole place stopped. I know I'm a beautiful woman but WOW. I feel the glares were coming because my boyfriend is white and I'm mixed race. Now I use to to frequent real biker bars that catered to HA. I was not impressed with these wannabe bikers at this watering hole. Everyone in the bar sneered at us. Look was as if you outsiders are not welcome in our bar. It was truly unbelievable. Something straight out of a movie. I have never felt such racism going into a place as I did Jolie's. Your in the hood of Chandler and the area has tons of Latin people.   My boyfriend use to rave about this place. He will never go back and he works with a few hundred guys. I know he'll spread the word. I'm self employed and will tell clients to steer clear of this racist bar. It was very busy with white trashy and biker types. It's a hole in the wall which I don't mind. It's not a welcoming environment if your of any ethnicity but white. I thought they were  going to tar and feather me. If it was not for the bikers this place would not survive. Hey owner white people will soon be the minority in AZ soon. Apparently the owner is from Buffalo so she must of grew up around African American people hmmmm?"}
{"text":"Jolie's Place is \"The Place\" to be in Chandler. I consider myself a proud patron and a true fan of Jolie, as well as her sidekick Jessica. These two chicks are an unstoppable duo. They have done an unbelievable job in establishing a brand that represents their values in providing the coolest place to hangout, socialize and reenergize with great food and drink specials that are second to none. They've built a team of staff that serves drinks and food with spunk and a smile. The food is fabulous; everything on the menu is worth trying at least once, and especially before you decide your favorite be sure to have one of the unique dishes that you may not find anywhere else. Jolie's is not just a bar. It's a place you're welcome to make your own. Come and play, eat and have a blast! If you don't, that's your fault! ;)"}
{"text":"This is definitely a cool spot, full of a nice Mix of cool people.  Food was good, service was good!  Rachel our server was personable and sweet, did a great job coming back around in timely fashion.  We stayed all night, ran up a sizable tab and saw a phenomenal band, met some interesting people to say the least, and had a great time for the most part!  I do believe we'll be back despite living in Scottsdale!  This is really a fun place, bottom line!  Keep up the great job!  Best bar I've been to in Chandler and I've lived in the valley off an on for 25 years!"}
{"text":"Good food. Neat environment but consistently slow service.  Recently had an order take 45 minutes before I had to cancel it and leave. Disappointing because this spot could be so much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I went to a company breakfast at Jolie's Place.  It has long been a favorite of people who work in my company.  I found the waitstaff to be really, really sweet and nice.  The food quantity, price and taste was excellent.  I would like to revisit when it is not so busy as service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Sat at booth for almost 10 minutes without being greeted, waited on or anything else and finally got up and walked out. Maybe if I had worn my biker gear??  Would have given \"0\" stars if that has been an option."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere, great service, awesome servers! Their staff is one of a kind and are hilarious. One of the best places to kick back, relax and have a good laugh. They have darts, pool, corn hole, poker, karaoke, jam sessions, live music four days a week, there's literally something for everyone. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent service at the bar and when I ordered fish and chips I almost chocked on the large amount for such a low price. Excellent all around."}
{"text":"Best burger and fries I've ever had. The burger bun is heavenly. I just love this place. Beer is cold. Vibe is warm. Outdoor patio is private and comfy. The staff is really friendly and look like they really love what they do. Jolie is the bomb! It's going to be my next home away from home.   Also so yummy: the fried PB'n'J on the late night menu, wings and Phil 'Shrooms! Nice place to come at 6am for breakfast too.  ; )"}
{"text":"The times I've been here I haven't been disappointed. Prices are good, it's clean, staff are always friendly, food is delicious with big portions so a take home bag is probably needed. I can't complain on that. The times we came here we brought our daughter here and she loves it. Family friendly for all ages."}
{"text":"I gave this place two stars because they open at 6am.  The staff are all female which I don't care about except I like to see some eye candy from time to time myself.  They have daily regulars so even if you get here first you might not get waited on first.  They obviously favor their regulars, which might make you feel like a bit of an outsider.  I'm also a little afraid to dine here as they've been on channel 5's dirty dining before.  Outside of that they have a good drink selection and good outside seating.  Oh, and if your having a bad weekend, again they open bright and early."}
{"text":"Very nice place for after work cocktails! Morning or night! Food was great and price is good for what you order! Service very good! Very clean! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"I give them 4 stars becsuse the band gets 5 and the service gets 3. I mean it was fine ..the wings were good ...really good.  And drink specials from 6-6 you cant beat that.  But our service was just so so."}
{"text":"Jolie's Place takes Bar Food to a whole new level.  Delicious meals alongside cold drinks from beautiful bartendars and plenty of action!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Jolie's Place. It is full of character and life. Once you walk in the door, it feels like home! The large bar is very inviting and is stocked full of a wide array of drinks to choose from. Once you make your way out to the biggest patio in Chandler, you'll fall in love all over again with this establishment! The food is incredible, I recommend the Green chili pork.   You'll always see Jolie herself going around the bar and mingling with the patrons to make sure all is well and if it's not, she will make sure that you get what you need, no questions asked!  Stop in on a Tuesday night, it's people watching and Karaoke night with the best Bartender tandem of Courtney and Jess! You'll also experience an awesome Karaoke Host that can sing!  Jolie's Place, where there's never a dull moment indeed. I proposed to my fiancé here! I love this bar!"}
{"text":"Of all the bars in the Chandler area, Jolie's Place is by far my favorite. Everything from the food to the staff is amazing, every time! One of my favorite things about this place is that it's open at 6 AM! Even if you're not there for a tasty mimosa or a bloody mary (which are super yummy!), the breakfast alone can make you not want to miss it. I highly recommend the biscuits & gravy and definitely the loaded hashbrowns.   Weekends are great too! There are live bands Thursday through Saturday nights but the best part is, there are NO COVER CHARGES! There is always something fun going on, whether it is bike night or fireball Friday. I definitely love me some fireball and on Friday night's, it's only $3! The staff and regulars are great to be around and you can always count on having a good time.   Lastly, if you are looking for a great place to hang out for \"Sunday Funday's\", this is it. As if all the TV's and the music on the jukebox wasn't enough, they also have corn hole, darts, AND poker tournaments. All which are free!   Definitely go check out Jolie's Place. They have such a variety of things to do day to day; you're bound to find something you love! Not to mention, it's clear that the staff loves their job and are proud of where they work. That alone says a lot!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place. Jaime, Mandy, Danielle and Tammy are by far the best servers and friends I have had the pleasure to meet. I have never seen anyone in this business work as hard as them. Without saying, it goes unnoticed by many and their reputation has plagued all establishments in the area because the bar is set so high."}
{"text":"My favorite biker bar. Good drinks, awesome bar staff and good food. They have a pretty kickass breakfast and I'm a big fan of their green chile pork stew. The live music is nice as are the pool tables and darts. When the weather is right I like to hang out on the patio. It's a good place to catch a game, but good luck trying to hear what's going on. Like I said, you can watch a game, they do have TVs all around the bar. I have become a weekend regular."}
{"text":"This is one of the most versatile bars in the entire Chandler area.  There are great specials daily and something exciting going on each and every night of the week.    If live music is your thing, this is a great spot to hit up on Thursday, Friday and Saturdays. Thursday nights and Saturday afternoon's you can find some of the valley's best musicians, such as Jeremy Graham of Sour Diesel Trainwreck and the well known Harry Luge, playing their acoustic sets.  Also, every Friday and Saturday night you can catch an array of full live bands.  The bands change every week and you will find anything from rockabilly to country to classic rock.  Put your dancin' shoes on and head to Jolie's for a great time!  If live music isn't your thing, check this place out during the week.  Happy hour runs every day from 6am-6pm with great drink specials..and the breakfast is to die for.  The biscuits and gravy are some of the best around.  They also have fun activities throughout the week like poker, dart tournaments, pool leagues, and cornhold tournaments out on the huge patio.  This place seriously has it all going on."}
{"text":"Ever feeling down about yourself? Ever want to venture into a place that smells like a homeless person farted into a gym sock? Ever want to go to a place with bad food and worse service? Then Jolie's place is the place for you! I'm not joking when I say these things. Went in for brunch with some friends and was met with attitude from the service staff and bad food. The establishment was not busy enough to wait 45 minutes for our food to arrive and when it finally showed up it tasted like it sat in cardboard under a heat lamp for an hour. It's not worth your time or money to come here."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks, good prices and good vibe. Set up like a dive bar but run as a serious business. You'll find all walks of life and tons of regulars. Hard to find a bar open from 6am to 2am. Try the green chili pork...it's awesome."}
{"text":"Jolies Place is my home away from home. Where else can you get the best smothered and covered hash browns with an ice cold beer or a bloody Mary. The whole menu is awsome and has a little bit of everything on it. They are definitely generous with their  portions so you will not leave hungry. Happy hour is all day long from 6 am- 6 pm. If you like live entertainment. They have live music 4 nights a week Wednesday and Saturday there is an acoustic bad that plays on the patio, Thursday night there is a jam session so bring your instermant and play with the band, and Friday and Saturday night there is a full band that plays from 9pm-1am. If your a sports nut like I am there are plenty of tvs set up around the bar so they have every NFL games on Sundays and any college football game on Saturday. I've been coming here for 3 years now mornings, afternoon, nights and every time I'm there I'm greeted and treated with respect. The staff is awsome always cheerful no matter what time of day I'm there. I recomend Jolie's Place to everyone who is looking for a place to just chill and hang out. Like I said this is my home away from home."}
{"text":"I waited 20 min for someone to even come to my table or acknowledge that I was there. After I ordered my drinks and a menu she took forever to bring them back. I have now been sitting for 20-30 more minutes for her to even come back and take my food order. This is the second time I have been here and both times have been horrible service. I won't ever be back. Worst place EVER!  We are headed to Sawtooth Bar and Grill... go there they have amazing service and food!"}
{"text":"They have the best Huevos Rancheros I have ever had! The environment is calm and relaxing, they also play great music! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone! My dad always craves their steak and eggs, and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Awesome food for lunch. Bring your appetite though!!! Huge portions but very decent prices. Happy hour all day. We had the street tacos with drunken beans. Yummy along with the carne asada nachos. Oh my god they are huge but the guacamole is so fresh and tasty. Brought home the leftover and can't wait to dive in again. Very friendly staff. A little dark inside but they do have a nice patio outside.  Food was flavorful. Can't wait to try them for breakfast or come back to listen to a band."}
{"text":"I've frequented this location in the past when it operating by other names.  The previous owners kept a reasonably respective operation that one would call middle of the road in appearance and service. Although they were respectable they may have lost the business acumen to stay profitable enough to stay afloat.  This new establishment has found a niche in the market that has attracted a group of clientele that appear to not value good service or reasonably appointed surroundings.   I decided to visit this location to hear a band that I was familiar with and had liked on precious occasions. In face, this was the first time I believe that this group had played at this location. Knowing the band and Aeroflot the patrons that were there it became evident that the two did not match.  After entering the establishment I had to find someone to ask about a table or a booth to sit. There were a number of servers standing around and none appeared to have a clue. When I asked the bartender who to talk to he said \"find one of the girls in the short shorts\". That helped a lot since most of the girls in the place had short shorts. After finally finding at least one server who had a small semblance  of a clue I got a seat. That was round one of my night. Round two was trying to get a drink. Had to go to the bar to get my own after sitting invisibly for quite a long time. The one couple with me wanted to get something to eat.  Round three, had to find someone for a menu, finally got a server to bring one menu for 4 people. Thinking that any smart server would know that we were planning on eating she would return to take an order. Nope, had to get the bartender to order the food and bring it to the table. Never saw a server or were asked if we needed anything the entire time we were there.   This may be the place to bring your own drinks and just sit and listen to the music. They are still in business, but, I just see a lot of profits missed.   By the way, the food was good, a star for that.  Service was non existent. If you visit, pack a bottle."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some beer to finish off the coffee.   Great food too come here for the burgers.   Live music,  poker tournaments,  pool tournaments,  nice waitresses,  good beer on tap.   Like coming here, close to the house and taco Tuesday rocks."}
{"text":"Typically this bar is great, great food and great service but last night a \"regular\" by the name of Todd ruined my great view of Jolie's. I would like to warn people of this guy, a bigger man with a long red beard. He placed his hands on me rudely, while he demanded I move but I wasn't in the way of anyone. As I asked him politely to not touch me and just ask next time, he continued by flipped me the bird. I'm a 5'2 120lb girl, why would he feel the need to act in such demeaning way. Well, it doesn't end there all night he was egging on my group I was with and making rude comments. Todd then went up to my fiance's GRANDPA and told him to \"watch his back\". This is more than unacceptable. The security guard and bar tenders apologized for his actions but didn't kick him out. Since he's a \"regular\" I felt they were defending him and that's what disappoints me. I brought my family here, my grandparents and this is what Joiles Place allows. If he's the \"regular\" why is he disrespecting YOUR name. So by the end of the night they wanted to \"patch it up\" by offering a round of free drinks... Very disappointed in this bar. If they want patrons in their bar like Todd they will lose business because they lost ours."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The hours are great too. But good god JESUS I've been coming here for years and the service has always been HORRID. There is no reason why it should take 20 minutes to get a server to come take a drink order on a Sunday morning when the place isn't that busy. If you come check this place out, make sure you sit at the bar. Otherwise you will be waiting awhile!"}
{"text":"Walked in with 3 ppl to watch football game. Sat down and took waitress 15mins to come over and barked at us. Asked for food specials and she said ita over there. $12.25 for a pitcher and a corona bottle. Wish the waitress was better so i can eat. Heading to 480."}
{"text":"First time at Jolie's - a little rowdy for the Steeler's game, but prompt service and friendly staff! The Gouda mac & cheese bites are beer-battered and just absolutely stellar. Black & blue burger and turkey melt were great choices, and both came with the option of Parmesan fries! We will be back for the mac burger & carne asada fries. Great beers on tap, to top it off!"}
{"text":"Jolie, Jolie, Jolie.....JOLIE\"s........I've been past this bar 100 times, it's busy from 6am to 2am. ALWAYS has cars in front of it. There must be cock fights in the back or they're giving something away for free. Saturday night we stopped in because the Stiletto's were playing there, and to a packed house of course.  Big spacious bar, couple of pool tables, nice looking bar staff, reasonable drink prices. This is just an average bar. Thats all I can say, nothing bad, nothing great, a solid C I give it. I went to the bathroom before I left at about 1am, a couple of guys came out of a stall together, so I'm assuming it possibly has that element about it."}
{"text":"Jolie's place is just fun! If you're looking for a cool place to go hang out with your friend and let loose, I would definitely recommend this establishment. I like the food too, and the beer. Their fries are also pretty delicious. Jolie's place is a really cool place to kick back, play some games, and really just unwind! Check it out and I don't think you'll be disappointed in it whatsoever. I know I enjoyed my time spent there."}
{"text":"This place is great! Great food, drinks and entertainment. Haven't done Karaoke there yet....But Im going to."}
{"text":"Oh man, breakfast here is utterly amazing!  Huuuuuuge portions not huge prices. Biscuits  and gravely were superb!  Can't believe I never made it to this place in the past, but will definitely be coming here on my day off during the week on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Great place to go before or after work since they are open 6am-2am everyday and have a great food menu.  Breakfast is served from 6-11 m-f and 6am-2pm on the weekends.  My personal favorite is the Breakfast burrito.  Once you have placed your order you can queue up some music on the Touch Tunes Juke Box, Play Golden Tee or Pool.  For lunch or dinner I'll often times order the Hot wings grilled soooooooo good, but the Burgers or Soup are also a couple of my go to meals.  The outdoor patio is huge and they have Corn Hole Boards you can challenge a friend to a game.  Check the events page on their website for a calendar list of Karaoke and live music.  The Food, Drinks and Service are all really really good."}
{"text":"wel me & a few friends wnt over there last sat. morning for some drinks(we work night shif),anyway, the waitress(she wore a cap & had a sexy chinese tat on her arm) was very helpful and curtious along wih the other waitress. it looks like a place i'l be going back too  in he near future thank you"}
{"text":"Always a fun room. Good meals, attentive service. And sometimes a server sings with the band Adrenaline."}
{"text":"Jolies has always been a pleasure to go to.  However, on 6-22-18, we arrived hungry, then we had a bad experience due the watress assumption that we were part of a group and did not want to serve us if we did not sit with that group.  We complained to the manager, Matt,  who got her to serve us.   Rachel was very rude to us, and twisted it by saying we were rude to her.  Rachel took her time to bring the drinks then brought the bill out before the food.  We waited over 40 min for the food with out her coming back to refill drinks.  I had to go to the mgr, Matt, to fix my order because she wrote the wrong thing.  Mgr, Matt, just justified her actions by stating they were busy,  But we have been there when it was really busy and had better service.  I was still eating when  \"Rachel\" insisted on my paying the bill right then & there or she would have me \"86'd\"...I paid the manager, and let him know, I have never been treated like this before.   Manager said he is changing his policy to this.   Pay before or while your eating or give a credit card.....I like to enjoy my meal.  I will not be ordering any food here and may not come back simply because of the rudeness the waitess exhibited and the manager backing her up.....instead of a good meal, I got indigestion....Totally unbelievable."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time last night and I can easily say... one of the worst customer service I have ever gotten. It was a Wednesday night, so the place wasn't too packed and they know this volleyball group shows up every Wednesday around the same time - which is why they have specials for that group - but they understaffed and the female waitress played favorites to the males, but even the guys got sh*tty service. Among the people around me, the guy sitting across from me was given the wrong beer, the guy next to me had to chase her down just to get a beer ordered and again cause she kept forgetting to bring a beer. I ordered a water with the intent of ordering food. Took about 20 minutes to get my first glass and the second time I tried to get a water, I asked her at least four times and watched three other people around me get a water before I finally pulled her aside and asked her where it was. 5-10 minutes later, she finally brought it no lemon. I'm not typically that picky... but Jesus it's a water.. how can you screw that up? I ordered a plate of chicken strips with my first water then later my friends ordered food. They all received their meals before I received what was designated on their menu as an APPETIZER! Meaning an appetizer shouldn't have taken over an HOUR to cook. My friends all ordered received ate and got their bills before I even received my meal. When I asked her about it she came back and said, \"You're order isn't up yet because it just isn't up yet.\" ok neat, get some customer service skills and say something like I'm sorry about the wait, I'll make sure the kitchen gets your order up as I know you've been waiting. Finally, I just canceled my order with some bus boy who came out of the kitchen because I 1. couldn't find my waitress and 2. he was the only person on the staff who stopped to talk to me. He just asked who my waitress was and told her cause he didn't know how to help me - not as a big of a deal, but if the owner/ manager had trained his staff on customer service they would've known to say, oh I'm sorry about the wait, let me take care of that for you. I'll go talk to your waitress to figure out what's happening. The waitress came back and said so you want to cancel? and I said yes, I'd rather eat somewhere else that will actually bring me my food. 30 minutes later - I'm only still there so my friend can finish his food and pay - and she brings out the chicken strips that she clearly didn't cancel. She drops it on the other side of our long table and says, \"I don't know where the fuck there go. Take them. I don't fucking care.\" Maybe if she had offered them to me since i was still there I would've actually paid for them and she wouldn't have just gave away free product.... I'm typically an understanding person but the customer service for this company was less than mediocre and that was NOT ok. The wait staff needs to spend less time flirting and more time serving."}
{"text":"Great food and entertainment. For the most part staff is usually right on it ready to take your order. Darts and pool. Have an outside area as well with live music on the weekends. Fairly large venue and can be very loud inside."}
{"text":"Begging for a bar rescue...... Ordered a martini and received a stemless wine glass with the opposite mixture of vodka and olive juice, passed it around to 4 separate people to verify the drink was made correctly.  When confronting the bartender (because it was a confrontation not a communication) she was wearing a unicorn horn on her head asked her to correct the drink she offered me the husband to come behind the bar to make the drink properly. Then after accepting the offer she declined and told me I wasn't allowed, threw the drink with glass in the garbage and proceeded to tell us she would no longer serve us and introduced another coworker to hangout drink service who was extremely polite and respectful, she then offered to make a new drink and complete our order. Shortly after we decided to leave and finish our Jolie's place experience.   Secondary notes..... Husband ordered a draft beer(hard to mess up) and attitude was politely sarcastic with a smile."}
{"text":"Good place for cold beer after work especially early morning. Can get loud sometimes but always fun when I go. Love the bartenders and never disappointed"}
{"text":"I love Jolie's place!  Jolie's has the hardest working bartenders I have ever seen. If they are not pouring drinks, they are busy making sure the bar is spotless.  They aren't light handed pours either.  The food however, is the highlight here.  Just look at all the pictures of the food served here and you will soon realize this more than just a bar, it is a gastropub to be sure.  We have tried most of the food on the menu and have not been disappointed even one time.  Highly recommend the club sandwich and the Stromboli.  Breakfast is great too!  I think they open at 6am."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Been here several times and it's a favorite.  Jessica goes out of her way to make you feel welcome, and she makes a mean Bloody Mary!   Try the green chili pork, amazing! Haven't tried the breakfast but I hear its crazy good. Great watering hole with yummy food!"}
{"text":"Drove by Jolie's Place way too many times and finally stopped in. It was around 11pm on a weeknight and the place was alive! The bar stools were just about full and there was a good crowd playing pool/darts/etc...The bartenders were very nice, attentive, and willing to tell us a little about the place. I definitely want to hit up breakfast and check out the morning crowd. They open at 6am, get some of the graveyard shift crew coming in, and according to the bartender, do breakfast right! Beer selection is decent, but I am pretty sure that's not why people come to Jolie's. My guess is bottles of beer and mixed drinks are more sought after than the craft brews. It feels like a neighborhood bar, where a lot of people know each other and aren't shy to strike up conversation. We didn't check out the menu, but next time we'll get into it for sure. My new goal in life may be to become a regular at Jolie's. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place has it all .. Package deal! Opens 6am and takes off from there Jolie's had no problem with not having customers or turning profit.. Funny thing is that it has none of the qualities of what makes a successful bar.. Location is random but parking lot always full .. Nothing out of ordinary at Jolie's for sure average dive bar with food and cheap drinks.. Not sure on why Jolie's is always blessed with patrons just yet but unless this Jolie is super popular and all her friends always support her bar or the are vampire's... Lol...jk..but for reals something doesn't smell right don't believe me stop in anytime and see for self."}
{"text":"Very good place to hear live music and dance on the weekends.  Also, a good place to watch football.  Plenty of TVs and the chairs have backs to them, so more comfy than just a bar stool.  Although the bar stools that are actually around the bar are normal with no back, which is to be expected.  I don't drink so I have no idea about alcoholic beverages or the price.  Service is just ok in this very busy place on a football Sunday. The waitress was running around like mad.  Good thing she's young!    The reason I only gave 3 stars is because of the food.  The fries, tomato, lettuce, and fixings were good.  But I ordered the hamburger medium and it was extremely well done.  Actually, it was burnt. Even though I got a discount on the bill, I would expect an offer to have the burger replaced with one that was done right.  I also wasn't told by the waitress that she would take some off the bill, I just saw it when I got the check.  Which I had to walk around the bar to find someone to ask.  I think it was the owner who finally gave me the check.  I probably won't order food again.  I encourage people to check it out when there is live music.  However, as another person wrote, the small parking lot does get full fast."}
{"text":"Everyone has been telling me to try their breakfast so I finally did. Great food, nice patio area and friendly staff but they appear to be understaffed. I will be back for breakfast. I recommend the biscuits and gravy and the smothered hash browns. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great neighborhood bar with live music Saturday from 1:00 until the wee hours. Jessica, our waitress, brought the drinks faster than we could have gone into our own fridge to get them! If you're looking for a place to chill this is it! The food was also delicious and petty fast coming out of the kitchen on a busy evening"}
{"text":"Great local place to grab a drink or a bite to eat. I have been here many times and have never been disappointed with their food. Their burgers and chicken sandwiches are very tasty. They even have good breakfast! Had some relatives over for the weekend and we were looking for a good local breakfast place and decided on Jolie's, based on reviews. I was amazed at the quality of breakfast that came out of this biker bar nightlife hangout. Huge omelets, perfectly cooked hash browns, awesome biscuits and gravy!  Also, they have taco Tuesdays. 99¢ Tacos,. Cheap and delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Good environment, good food, music and just sets the tone for a fun night!!"}
{"text":"Holy snikees, best cheese sticks I have ever had! Place always has a crowd! Great bar that always brings in quality entertainment, never had so much fun!!  Huge patio that compliments the giant bar and dining area. Opens at six for you third shift workers and with that being said the place is extremely clean! Great place for happy hour, especially street taco day."}
{"text":"Stopped by Jollies today for a beer and pool.  One of the guys (Matt) was a real dick!  We were playing pool and placed a couple bar stools so people wouldn't walk into us while playing.  Matt got his panties in a wad and made a big deal about bar stools in the way.  Seriously?  I've been to this bar several times and if people are sitting on the bar stools they never say or do anyrhing.  Today Matt wanted to be a Jerk about it.   I wont ever go back!!!!  Good job Matt, Customer Service key to any successfully business!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times over the years and I can tell you that the staff and ownership is amazing! Top that with good company, very tasty food, pool, darts and a great juke box and you can't go wrong. Great neighborhood place. Love the fish and chips! I found out about this place from my Dad. He loved this place and all the people there. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been here with friends about a dozen times now over the past few years since I don't live on this side of town. The food is excellent. If you want great food go here. If you want a good mixed drink do NOT go here. Each time I've been here they have not made a good mixed drink. You're better off getting a beer, a shot, or a soda. Maybe some training by a professional mixologist would be helpful for this staff?"}
{"text":"Worse customer service ever experienced at a bar. I have been to this bar in the past and occasionally play bar poker at this place. Their beer mugs don't fit into their cup holders and don't have near tables to set your beer on so I put it on the floor under my chair. A guy was trying to squeeze behind my chair so I lifted my beer out of the way and it broke off the bottom edge of the bar stool. I had just got my beer too, anyways I asked my waitress if she would kindly replace it and she laughed at the situation and walked away saying you beer does not belong on the floor in the first place. She then brings me a beer to my table - I thought as a kind understanding of the situation and I ask what's this? She replies you didn't order another beer? I tell her no I asked if she would replace the broken one for free since I barely even drank any of it. She laughs again and says 'Oh! Thats right, I had your beer mixed up for someone else' and walks off with it. At this point i'm utmost disrespected so I close my bar tab and waiting on some friends to finish their beer. I write to the manager of the building an she basically ignores the situation for over 2 weeks then decides to investigate both sides of the story. Her bar ladies tell her a false story saying they did replace my beer and that I had broken it again after putting it back on the floor. Any customer would know not to repeat the situation twice. I never got any apology and was basically called a liar. As a bartender I would have gone out of my way for something so small and never accuse the customer of being a liar especially over a beer."}
{"text":"I'd like to give 2.5 stars for Jolie's. One of my buddies eats here all the time and he says he loves this place. When they're not out of something he loves their meals. I've been in here before for sports events at a birthday,  all we ordered was chicken wings and drinks.   I decided to try their chicken fried steak and eggs. My girl went for the biscuits and gravy. I ordered an orange juice and was sadly disappointed because it was that orange juice used for mixing drinks. It took a little over an hour for us to get our food and we watched 2 other tables come in after us and get their food before us. The food came out a little overcooked. The biscuits were hard and so was the fried chicken. I had asked for my hashbrowns to be \"smothered\"-cheese, onions, sausage gravy,etc..... They came out with cheese only on them. Considering the food was over cooked it wasn't too bad. The waitress was pleasant and she tried to be accommodating. She apologized for the length of time it took for us to get our food.   On to the next best thing."}
{"text":"Update 2 Oct 16: Danielle is one heck of a bartender. Not only did she mention ticket times may be long, she listened to my concerns from previous food orders. The poached eggs were actually done right and food was delivered in 15 minutes. Thanks for the best experience so far Danielle.   Great place to hang out with awesome music, still average on service and below average on food. My last visit was 30 September 16 at 6 pm:  1. Greeted with 38 seconds (5 stars there) 2. Took 5 minutes to be asked about my drink order (1 star) 3. Took 5 minutes to receive my drink (1 star) 4. Took 30 minutes to receive a sub-par, bland grilled cheese sandwich (0 stars)"}
{"text":"Came here on Christmas Eve and received excellent service from the bartender Matt. He recommended the dry rub wings, and they were absolutely amazing. The food and service coupled with the laid back atmosphere left us to conclude that this bar is our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Great local find! Found it online for breakfast. Got there and the outside is pretty rough. Don't let that daunt you! The inside has a beautiful rectangular bar and the service is fantastic. Our breakfast came quickly and food is great. Jolie's is a bar and it looks like it would be allot of fun in the evenings so will have to check it out for something other than breakfast. Hours are great too. 6am-2am all week! Must try!"}
{"text":"Great spot to hang out, cold drinks, GREAT Food, friendly staff!!!  Always try the weekly specials!!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Waitress refused to get me water until I had to yell at her to do her job. It was a fun place from the beginning but the quality of service and girls are slowly sliding backwards."}
{"text":"Just a typical dive, nothing more. The fries were good. The burger tasted like a  elementary school cafeteria lunch,  not good."}
{"text":"Fantastic fun neighborhood bar with good food, good people, good times...don't be surprised if you go there more than once they know your name, yes a CHEERS kind of place with music, sports, games, and leprechauns (Ok, I have never seen a Leprechaun there, but I am just a boy with a dream)...highly recommend, check this place out...casual fun during the week and more good people on the weekends with a loads of music fun on Thursday evenings...some fun local bands and music in a surprising location...with plenty of parking..."}
{"text":"Great dive bar BUT how can they not play Cardinals broadcast for game?  It is supposedly Bills bar but most people watching Cards!  Should be some flexibility.   I would have rated them a 5 otherwise."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Finally a locally owned bar in Chandler with a fantastic owner who surrounds herself with great people! The live music is always good, and it has the best patio in town!  The food is excellent, always made from scratch, and the beers are always cold. If you want a fun place to go to pretty much any night of the week, check it out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went to lunch there today. Nice atmosphere, very cheerful and welcoming staff. Plenty of TV's and even changed from the news to football when asked. I tried the burger because of the reviews here and was very disappointed. it was totally over cooked and took at least a half hour to make? I ordered medium and it was completely cooked to death, texture of a hockey puck. I told my server and she seemed concerned and took 25% off but in today's world  bad food won't cut it at any price. I gave some suggestions and will try again, only this time a Monte Cristo."}
{"text":"Good bar, friendly staff and good fun. Good selection of beers and an extensive menu.  Monthly food specials.  Live band, karaoke, trivia, jukebox.  Outside patio with bar and games."}
{"text":"My family loves coming here so much. The fish & chips are the Best   Special Thank you to Rachel for taking such great care of us"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place by accident driving to a friends house one night. The sign was big and seemed like a very inviting place so we went in. We were immediately greeted by Jessica the bartender. She made good drinks, not overly strong but not weak either just right. I was hungry so I got a menu and inquired about some of the items on the menu. I had never heard of a Monte Cristo before but it looked odd and I was nervous to try it. Jessica assured me that I would love it and if I didn't she would buy it. Well needless to say she DIDN'T have to buy it, it was amazing! I'm sure I got my entire days worth of calories in that one meal but hey it was worth it. We go there regularly now on Tuesday night karaoke and occasionally to check out the bands. Everyone is always friendly and their patio is awesome. 100% recommend"}
{"text":"Biker bar with tons of sass. Lots to do, pool tables, juke, darts. Its a full round bar so you can stare at everyone. Which we did. The servers were great and everyone was friendly. They serve a kick ass breakfast in case you don't want hot wings. I wish I lived closer. I would be there every day. I will be back, though. And yes, they have hot wings."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we've been here and I have to say...WONDERFUL!  Service is spot on!  Food was delicious and not over priced, you also get great sized portions.  We had enough to take home for another meal!  Beer is cold, Service is warm and ambience is hot!  Plenty to do if you are into Darts, Wii(like) golf, Cornhole and Poker.  They have TV screens everywhere to watch whatever game(s) are on, they have an outdoor seating area with bar for smokers.  It's well lite and they provide misters on warm nights.  We went to another place and sat there for over 8 minutes when we left without being served.  We came here and within a minute or less the server was there to take our order AND apologized for not getting there sooner.  All in all, I think we will be repeat customers...Thanks Jolie's Place for making us feel VISIBLE!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just happened upon this place and decided to go in for breakfast. Loved it!!!Fresh cooked food and great music. Food is very fresh, not frozen so dont expect to go in fast and get out fast its not McDonalds. Wait was not bad though and the food was worth it.Very  great atmosphere. Totally coming back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this bar... I typically like to come on Tuesdays because I know Jessica will be my bartender and I'm there to hang out with a lot of our mutual friends... which is usually a recipe for a great night. The staff is super friendly and I'd consider some of them close friends after all the years I have been coming here. This is definitely my \"cheers\" bar.   I always get fantastic service, have a lot of fun with all of the games available inside as well as outside (when it's cooler out, obviously... lol!), and I have to say that I have never had any bad food from their kitchen.  I'd highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"As long as you don't ask for a mixed drink you are fine. Stick with beer. Watched them poor my front not even a full shot and when Asked to talk to manager they said directly. \" they don't care we will get business anyway, we are a beer and shot place our liquor popes don't matter \" Stay away and go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Good dive bar and like their food. Decent prices too. Had to deduct a star because the music can get some loud in there during happy hour that you can't hold a conversation at you table."}
{"text":"Jolie's is awesome! It's our local hangout and we love the staff. They always remember us. On top of that, the food from breakfast to dinner is always delicious and we've had several things from the menu. And of course you can't forget the drinks. They're really good and reasonably priced! Thanks Jolie's for being awesome."}
{"text":"I had a customer and employees that said this is the \"Go-To\" local spot. We pulled into the parking and it seemed busy which is always a good thing.  When I opened the door it was super dark, and after my eyes had adjusted inside the bar it was still really dark.   Our waitress was overly flirty, but slow to take our order. Once we got our food she never came back to check on us until she dropped off the check.    I'd say overall the food was bar food and over priced."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and great prices! Amazing live music, karaoke on Tuesdays, lots of TVs, darts whatever you want!"}
{"text":"Just ok. This location won't last very long unless they have a ton of neighborhood people that like it???"}
{"text":"Heard about this new bar a few months ago from a friend and decided to go check it out.The way the bar is setup is perfect to where the bartender can reach a bunch of customers at one time.The food was great and I had my pregnant gf with me at the time,so she asked if they serve deep fried pickles.It wasn't on the menu but the waitress made em' for her anyways and only charged us $4.It was a big to go box full of fried pickles.My gf was happy and I've been back there a few more times since and always have a good time.The service is excellent and the type of people that go in there are real nice.Never had a bad experience at this place ever."}
{"text":"Great place. Huge bar, patio, great service. Multiple Bartenders know your name on your very first visit!  Happy hour 7 days a week 6AM - 6pm!  Very good homemade, excellent food. Over 50 menu items. Breakfast too - served 6am-12pm M-F and till 2pm Sa/Su.   Some great beers on tap (20 taps).  Nice bathrooms. Juke box. Darts. Pool tables. Golden Tee.  Live music several nights a week.  Outdoor covered patio with separate bar, misters/cooling units, Cornhole and a couple TVs. Outdoor lounge seating too."}
{"text":"Love this bar!! Great food. This bar is as busy at 7am as it is at 4pm!!! Best bartenders around and they all pour a stiff drink!"}
{"text":"Ok.  Here's the deal.  To the degenerate reviewers concerned with this establishment:  I just visited Jolie's for the 1st time tonight and witnessed the following; overweight people, African Americans, Hispanic bikers, short people, tall people, tattooed people, ugly people, attractive people, Canadians and yes even an 80 years old man wearing a flowered shirt that was STRAIGHT BUSTING IT on the dance floor. To anyone that actually believes that this establishment doesn't have diversity I simply say this- YOU are insane.  Please know what this place represents: AMERICA. Pure and simple.   Great BAR food (very high end for a great dive bar) get the PB&J....... Cold beer Cheap food!!! Tough to find these days... A very eclectic range of people Darts Pool  Music And VINYL bar stools (the way it should be)  It is not freaking North Scottsdale. If you want that, go there. There are no red ropes out front, no valet and thankfully no crazy yuppies sniffing their own brand and ruining the type of place it is.  If you want to know what good bars looked like 20 years ago COME TO THIS PLACE.  If you want some yuppy joint filled with today's Nouveau riche, go somewhere else (preferably far away from me).....  For me, I will be coming back here soon for a little piece of Americana."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous local bar, and I do mean local. Any place serving Guinness from 6 am to 4 pm earns my loyalty. A great patio area, and live music only add to its attraction. Plus, the food is quite tasty! If you're down for a chill environment, and don't rely on fancy perks, come in down for a beverage."}
{"text":"What a great dive! Came in on Sunday and got a huge frosty mug for $4. I was shocked at how great the menu was and the food did not disappoint. You're going to get a bang for your buck here and I for sure will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The bartenders are AWFUL! They don't even \"act\" nice - no smile no how are you just what do you want no small talk NOTHING  Enjoy the food and random band that's all not good service at all they act like they're doing you a favor"}
{"text":"We've driven past this place for years but never went inside till now. It's a large place with lots of tvs, pool tables and great food. I was surprised at how tasty everything was. We ordered steak sandwich (recommended by our server) and Black and Bleu burger. They were very good. But my favorite were the Parmesan fries!  Must have those!!!  Service was great too. Rachel was our server and she kept our drinks coming and was very pleasant. We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Came here recently for a girls night.  Besides the great company the place was a total bust.  The service was awful and the food was sub par.  The waitress, who's name I never got,  would disappear for long stretches at a time, especially when one of us wanted something, so we were constantly out of drinks and didn't get the food we wanted to order.  The food I was able to order was more fat than meat and when I mentioned it to her she didn't even respond, much less apologize.  The sweet potato fries were the only good thing that my table said they ordered. To top it off after we requested our checks she cashed out my friends paying with credit cards but totally refused to take the cash I was paying with.  I even tried handing it to her once and she looked at it and walked away.  I ended up leaving it on the table when I left  20 minutes later, too mad to care that she got a 40% tip.  Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Started going to Jolies's several years ago with a work group for happy hour. Since it is only a mile from me it became by new \"meeting\" place to meet friends. The atmosphere is dark and kicked back and I enjoy the crowd that frequents Jolies. Now to the food... up until 6 months or so ago I would meet friends for breakfast and a sunday bloody mary. Their gravy was to die for!  WHAT HAPPENED?.. I had some a few months ago and it was loaded with ground meat of some sort and hardly any gravy... the meat does not taste good nor does the gravy any longer. I asked a server about this, and she agreed saying many people have noticed the change. The eggs are never cooked properly, as I like my scrabbled eggs done EASY...never is. the last 2 bloody marys I had was way too peppered!! not sure what has happened to my two fav things but...I stopped going for breakfast. I still meet friends there as the servers are awesome and I enjoy the atmosphere. the burgers are good as are the fries. They do have an outdoor area which is a nice place to enjoy the outside..however...it is VERY rundown and is in desperate need of new chairs. I will keep my eye on the reviews to see if the gravy has gone back to what it used to be... Jolies i a nice local dive with friendly servers and questionable bar food. Give it a try and enjoy"}
{"text":"The food at Jolie's is excellent! Try the green chili turkey enchiladas. They are amazing! Just don't eat the beans. I don't know what it is about those beans ... they taste so good but are so wrong haha. The bacon wrapped jalapeños are delicious!! Service is good. The bartenders are awesome."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant and bar to meet up with friends and family. Laid back atmosphere, pool table and good service. By 10:00pm kiddos must go... adults, drinks and fun only!"}
{"text":"I was surprise when I had their food. AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS !! Huge location. A lot of space. AC was amazing. A sports bar with great food? It's unheard of. I will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the atmosphere at Jolie's. I've been going here for 3+ years a few times a month and they are pretty consistent. I love the patio and drinks are reasonably priced. I also really like some of the bands that come through. There food is usually pretty excellent as well!"}
{"text":"I would have given them no stars if possible. The reason for the low rating was the bar back challenging my friend to fight for asking him how they sanitize their drinking glasses. We were sitting at the bar and the bar back was busy rinsing glass in front of us.  it appeared to us he wasn't really cleaning them. My friend asked the simple question how do you sanitize your glasses. The bar back's first reply is what do you care you drinking from a bottle. My friend replied I'm just curious on the process cause I don't know. At that point the bar back became more enraged and said he didn't have time for this and told us to go sit somewhere else. My friend told him he doesn't tell us what to do. The bar back next reply was is that he got off at 2 and they could talk then outside. My other friend then told him to get his manager. Bar back told him there is no manager on duty and the bartender was in charge. The bartender was called over and the bar back said we were giving him a hard time. Which we were not. The bartender never asked what was going and told us to leave her employee alone, her words not ours. So the service there sucks. Not to mention the nachos we ordered the meat on them tasted spoiled and smelled bad. I didn't dare bring that to their attention. I would've probably been hit in the head with a dirty glass. This place is a joke a typical dive bar, with no customer service from the bar back to the blonde bar tender. I will not be back!"}
{"text":"First off, this is a bar! If you're looking for a restaurant to take the kiddies or have a romantic dinner then this is not the right place! Better than average \"bar food\" with HUGE  portions! Extremely cold beer! The entire staff moves fast to keep your drink full. Pool tables, darts, corn hole, ntn, nice patio with coolers, decent amount of tv's. Live music. . . What else do you need from a bar?"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to hangout for a beer and food this is the place to do it. Food is great !! I had the green chilli and pork for breakfast and couldn't be more pleased. I met new people and everyone seemed very nice and friendly. The service was super awesome and our bartender Mandy was super friendly happy and very affable."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my First Experience was Awesome...2nd Experience was not so good But Then a couple of days later I got a personal call from the Manager.....She heard of my Experience and called me immediately from home.....This is the \"Old School Customer Service\" I love....We had a long conversation and definitely I felt like my concerns were heard.....Changes were made and my next Experience was as Awesome as the First....This place really cares about its guest and they consider you like Family....We had Great fun and The food was Awesome~!   Thank You Jolies~!"}
{"text":"I can never give 5, but I have gone during weekend-day or during week happy hour and this place has great prices and good bar food for anytime.  Great Sunday Funday during football season.  Bar is a mix of folks guys and girls, which makes it great to meet or just people watch..Pool, darts, live music, or jukebox and games you can play from your phone, your sports game on anyone of the TVs, and cannot say enough good things about the staff from Sam, Tammy, Jamie, Dani, Rachel the list goes on (sorry if spelled names wrong) but you all are RockStars...  The \"House\" loves this place..."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it's been great nearly every time.  Today was an exception.  I had a real lack of service.  The bartender really turned not only me but both of my friends off.  Actually, one of my friends didn't even order anything due to the fact that he was not  acknowledged for about 10 minutes while the bartender ate another customers salad after she was finished with it, which I'm hoping was her friend's.  She then proceeded to just make rude obscene gestures but throwing her leg up on the cooler and making gestures towards her vagina Area while telling some obnoxious story.   I get the fact that this is a bar but when you are trying to order food you really don't want your server making obscene gestures towards their privates.  She also pulled her tank top down and exposed her bra.  It was just really unappealing.  We eventually got the the attention of the other bartender who was a well dressed man.  He made an effort to help us out, and by that time my friends were over it.   It took us another several minutes to get them to cash us out.  It's sad to say we won't be back for quite a while.  The thing of it is I do understand that bartenders have fun but Jessica should have quit acting like this at the club 10 years ago, let alone while she was serving food. I feel bad for the other bartender who was doing everything and the cook who actually puts out quality bar food in a timely manner. I like to think maybe because she was drunk. It's just pretty unprofessional. There is defiantly a bunch of great bartenders who work here, but this girl has got to be bringing everyone down. :/"}
{"text":"4 stars for HOLE in WALL bar review and not a Restaurant Review.   Yes, I have had food here multiple times, and its a step above most Bar Food type places. Atmosphere, is pretty great, and the live Music OFTEN is badass. Beer Selections and Service is spot on.. Smoking patio to keep clear of for non smokers like me !!   Jolies Place remains on the brink of being an actual Hole in the Wall vs Bar n Grill as at Times, the crowd sways from one to another, but that never shuts out either or from coming in and having a great time !!   Cheers"}
{"text":"OMG I can't believe I have lived here a little over a year and haven't came here yet what a mistake!! We decided to go here today tired of the same old thing so glad we did the food is out of this world! I had a French dip and my hubby had a mushroom and Swiss hamburger everything was homemade and delish. This is our new favorite place to go. The inside is awesome very clean and they have an awesome outside area. Can't wait to come back and try there dinner and breakfast."}
{"text":"Live band indoors and a large outdoor area that plays a mix of different music. No cover and great service..What's not to love here?.  I haven't eaten here yet but if you want to hear a live band and relax with some friends this is the place. Usually rock inside and top 40 outside."}
{"text":"This place is great!! EXCEPT if you dont have much time dont bother. Second time here and its taken an hr to get breakfast. 3 people at the bar have food, no one else. Its breakfast not rocket science"}
{"text":"Pool tables, darts, and other neighborhood bar games. A small drink selection. Don't expect to find your favorite mixed drink spirit here. Tart options are a zero. Buzztime Trivia if you're interested. Biker bar at heart. Live music on occasion and karaoke some nights.  A menu the size of Asia, but no dessert. Average."}
{"text":"We used to go to another bar to watch football. It was ok but not a lot of variety on the menu. A friend recommended Jolie's and wow are we happy we went there. The food is phenomenal, they have weekly specials which are always yummy and add variety. The menu is huge and has a little bit of everything! We've tried several things, I love their French dip sandwich, my husband loves their grilled chicken and fruit salad. Honestly, everything we have tried there we have loved. Great burgers, yummy sandwiches and fresh salads! Oh, and wonderful breakfasts! The portions are very generous and the prices are very reasonable. If that's not enough to get you there, the staff are exceptional, friendly and knowledgeable. We just enjoy hanging out there, having a few drinks and some great food! We go here often and will continue to do so!!"}
{"text":"This biker bar is super close to my house and every time I pass it , it's always extremely packed, so one day the bf and I decided to check it out.   He's really into biker bars so he loved it! They have so many specials for you to enjoy. $1.00 tacos on Tuesdays, drink specials all day everyday,  2 for 1 domestic and pints on Tuesdays, live music, lunch specials, you name it!   I ended up ordering the classic club. It's a good size and comes with Parmesan fries. They were good but I wish they were a bit crispier. It's definitely good for bar food. My cranberry vodka was only $4.50!   They also have darts, tvs, pool tables, and an outdoor patio for you to enjoy their live music. If you come during lunch time they have lunch specials for $5.99 that includes a pint of beer! We'll definitely be back! =)"}
{"text":"I love this place..... I have never had an item that i didn't love!! Try the Monti Cristo Sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff, great food and drink specials. Trivia on Mondays. Pool and dart leagues. Bands on Sunday afternoon, Wednesday evenings, and on the weekends. GREAT place to chill and hang with friends."}
{"text":"Great service!!! Our server came by often to check on our drinks & recommended what's great from the kitchen. Don't let this place fool you with it's looks (looks dirty). Food is awesome...great presentation & great portion for it's price. Live entertainment on top! The band was awesone. Playing the 70-80's music & they were great. Out door patio for smokers too. Thank you for a great night Jolie!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious!  We had the fried PB&J for an appetizer, which was every bit as good as I thought...I would actually have it for dessert next time though.  My fish and chips were good.  My friends French Dip was to die for.  The meat was super tender and the bread was just right.  Definitely something I would order next time!  I also loved the handcut french fries...next time I'm going to try the sweet potato ones!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Large menu with a lot of options, need to go back for breakfast some time.  Love a spot that doesn't upcharge for tots AND has happy hour from 6am-6pm!"}
{"text":"I moved back 3 months ago and stumbled across this little gem. JP's, as I like to call it, is a great place!! I'm a huge fan of live music, which is here often, and the wait staff is honestly one of the best I have ever seen. Thank you ladies! I also highly recommend the scratch kitchen, the food here is pretty damn good. I'll be seeing you tomorrow."}
{"text":"For all ur low raters, obvious you don't won't work in food or service industry. Everyone work in jolie place work hard provide excellent customer service. Only whiners and racist will feel need to put someone down. How do you feel if I wrote about you customer service skill. This is still best bar in Chandler and for you haters, go f*** yourself and hope you choke on it."}
{"text":"JP is a cool, low key spot. If you like places that are chill and give you good food and drinks for a good price, look no further. A co-worker took me there and I fell in love with the brisket Taylor tots. Took another co-worker there and she confirmed!   Drinks are poured right and always have games on. Food is fresh and comes out hot!"}
{"text":"Walked out of the place without even being acknowledged by the staff while they were talking with each other. We were completely ig"}
{"text":"The menu leaves a lot to be desired with only a handful of lackluster choices and the service was questionable at best. Our waitress was painfully hung over though pleasant enough. The mimosas were watered down and oddly served in snifters. The bloody Mary's were a crime against humanity. The bartender should be sanctioned by the UN. The breakfast burritos are mediocre. The french toast is NOT french toast, it was just a soggy mess.  Calling it a restaurant is an overstatement. It's a bar that serves some food. Overall it's a bar well suited to the NASCAR crowd but for anyone interested in eating quality food or ambience Jolie's place probably isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"Omg this place is the best food you will ever get in a bar atmosphere. Restaurant speed and gourmet food. Drinks are always spot on perfect. I never leave reviews but this mothers day has been the best yet!!!! Rachel was a fantastic server while Tammy knocked it out of the park as a bartender. I will always come back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Hey Jolie's ... You just might be my new favorite Sports Bar!! We had a party of 7 and your service could not have been better. Our wait staff was quick, efficient, knowledgeable, and didn't ever forget one item. She was fantastic (a bartender I believe...) Anyway - the Sunday morning Football breakfast items were all really delicious, especially for a bar. So thank you for that. We couldn't stop talking about you all week long. Thanks a bunch... see you soon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good prices! The food is great! In an area that has only dark bars that you wouldn't bring your child (or grandma to), it's so great to finally have a nice place with a good menu! There are plenty of healthy options, and also lots of comfort foods!  The patio is awesome with lots of room! I am so glad to have a good neighborhood place to go to!"}
{"text":"I don't get it.  Not only this place has excellent reviews, but the parking lot is packed from 5 am till well past midnight.  And I see it every day, I'm not exaggerating. So finally I dragged my husband in there for lunch.  We wanted to see what all they hype was about.  And???  we still want to know what the hype is all about. Ok, so I get it must be a great bar, so I understand it being crowded during typical \"bar hours\".  But what's up with 6 am, or 10 am, or 12 pm?   The service was good, I admit.  The lady that helped us was very friendly. But the food, well, it was just average bar food.  And the place is dark and cavernous...again, great for a bar, but breakfast or lunch?  I So I'm still baffled..."}
