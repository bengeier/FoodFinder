{"text":"Like other reviewers, I've passed this store driving on 14th street about a million times and always craned my neck to see what glowy, beautiful things they had on display. I finally decided I need to go inside. Yesterday I went in and made an instant connection with the people working there who are also the owners (Greg & Kim). While they have beautiful, authentic items from Mexico, they said they have recently branched out to \"anything they love\" which includes paintings, fountains, standing vases, garden ornaments, furniture, jewellery and some of the best cards I've found in the city for under $5. I spent $40 in cards because there were so many that were just so soulful and beautiful. If you are looking for unique home decor items, or gifts for your worldly and soulful friends, this is a great place to check out. Or if you need a little escape from the everyday, the energy of the store will swoop you away and make you feel some magic. I loved it!"}
{"text":"Tiempo is a cool, calming space that carries a wide range of imported home decor products from around the globe, highlighted by a extensive collection of Mexican handicrafts. They boast a wealth of ornate and exotic mirrors, Mayan sun sculptures, elaborate candelabras, and a bevvy of hanging star sculptures that'd be sure to liven up any room. It's a warm place to stroll about, the soothing sounds of their trickling fountains bring a sense of serenity.  Serenity Now!  And serenity you're sure to find at Tiempo, along with many treasures from around the world to decorate your abode."}
{"text":"I think Ive passed this store a million times, but finally decided to walk in because Fair's Fair was closed. From the outside, it looks like it may be filled with tacky trinkets, but as I walked in I realized I was only half right.  There are a few items in there, that I question if someone would actually buy, but I guess they wouldnt sell them in the first place if they didnt.  Having said that, there have a ton of  beautiful Mexican pots, blankets and gorgeous wood furniture. They also have a selection of candles, cards, and incense.  The girl at the front seemed shy to approach us, so I cant comment on the service, but if youre looking for a gift that is a little different, Im thinking you could find it here."}
{"text":"I was hit by the smell of incense when I walked through the door. As I ventured a bit further inside, the sound of trickling water made it's way to my ears. This store's got good energy.   It's filled with statues, fountains, artwork, notecards, journals, purses, scarves, furniture, picture frames and jewelry-even a painting of Frida hanging at the back.  What surprised me here was the variety in pricing. Items ranging in price from $4 to $1,400, it'll be tricky to find something that doesn't fit your budget.   I'll be back again soon for a refill on the good vibes, and perhaps one of their stylin' journals."}
