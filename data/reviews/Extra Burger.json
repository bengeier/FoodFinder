{"text":"Just what this area needed - a classic burgers and fries restaurant with good food, great prices and awesome service. I had been eagerly awaiting their opening for months, and last night the time finally came to sample their food.   I ordered their classic cheeseburger for $6 which came with lettuce, pickle, tomato and burger sauce. The ingredients were fresh and of excellent quality, and it was reassuring to see that their burger patties were homemade and not frozen.  The burger tasted amazing, was well seasoned and perfectly cooked. Their other items include double cheeseburgers ($8) and hand cut fries ($3). They also have a family combo (four burgers and fries) for $30 which is pretty hard to beat.   Inside is pretty basic with a diner-inspired decor. There are a couple of seats for those who wish to eat in, but it's really a no-frills kind of place which I can definitely appreciate.  While my waistline might not agree, I'm really glad they've finally opened and can't wait to try the other items on the menu.  Rob and his team are doing a great job. Come try their food, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place rules!!!   Extra burger seems tongue-in-cheek because of their limited menu (2 kinds of burgers, 1 kind of fries , about a dozen kinds of pop) but what they lack in variety they more than make up for in service and execution.  This is a burger and fries straight-up.   Do you want a pile of fries covered in BS? No, neither do I! Just some good old French Fries with some Ketchup, maybe some malt vinegar if we want to get wild.  Do you want a ultra mondo venison-boar-geese burger with a quail egg on top of a brioche bun? I don't! If you do, look else where friend!  This is a Burger with a capital B, made fresh to order with lettuce, tomato, pickle and cheese!  This is just good honest food without having to decide between a million different options.  I, for one, am totally smitten with the idea!"}
{"text":"Wicked burger. Microscopic menu but they have it down. Very well seasoned and crispy fries. Friendly service too and great tunes playing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hold your horses hipsters! A new burger joint is in town: Extra Burger. This place opened around March 2, 2018 and we stumbled into this hidden local gem on our way to EL Ruddy for drinks.   For those carnivores who are craving a burger ($6 with tax) - or two! - you get a freshly made burger topped with tomato, onions, cheese, and all the good stuff. It's reminiscent of Ruddy's on College. Simple yet elegantly made, inexpensive but delicious, unpretentious but cool.   Extra Burger is a perfect foodie stop for any Dundas to Ossington pub crawl circuit. There is no signage at the front current, but just follow your nose. It's a few steps east of EL Ruddy. We met Rob and the team and they're super cool!"}
