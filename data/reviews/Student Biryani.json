{"text":"Out of all the limited options available this is the best one! 
Service: Pathetic! Whether you dine in or take away, they will provide you food in take away boxes. Serving time more then 40 mins


If I would have been In Pakistani this would be my last option as there are too many options available there but not in Ontario!"}
{"text":"My wife ordered take out from here this past weekend, We called in our order at 8 advising we will pick it up for 8:45 and food was not ready till close to 9:30. Another gentlemen order food around 7 and he left shortly before myself frustrated as he had people at home waiting to eat. Common complaints amongst other yelpers as well. 

Food was OK, My wife really liked how moist her chicken sandwich was but that was only because of extra mayo. I got the haleem and chicken biryani. Haleem was very spicy and biryani lacked flavor. 

Again like other's, went in with high expectations which were not met. Just too many other South Asian options in the area (same plaza even) that are better. 

Wife wants to try it again, not sure if I want to go back, not worth it for the price"}
{"text":"Visited there for the first time as recommended by my friend just for paratha roll..paratha roll can b compare with shawarma of middle east. Price ,quantity and meat with salad n sauces shawarma is richer n cheaper than paratha roll..but in 9$+ for a roll seems lil higher..will go back soon to try there speciality...beryani...then will update the stars..for final time..2 stars for cleaness"}
{"text":"Worst Biryani for the name. Made us wait 50 minutes after we ordered. We we all starving and couldn't wait to try it, when we opened the box and discover that only 1 piece of meat in chicken and beef biryani and 3 pieces of potatoes. What a joke this place is. Bad customer service, dirty place. You really need good cleaning in this place."}
{"text":"One of the best biryanis in the GTA for sure. Their chicken rolls especially the garlic mayo roll is good. Do not expect exceptional service here. Probably good for take out. The pops are usually warm than cold. Raita is good."}
{"text":"After a long time I wanted to give it a second try. So I went today and I should say I am pretty disappointed. I read other reviews on Yelp and thought may be they are better now. But not to my liking. 

Things that I didn't like in Biryani:
A big Potato in my Chicken Biryani I am not talking baby potato here a baseball ball sized one. 

Bland, no flavour on the chicken. 

Price - it's too much for the quality. By the way you can get way better Biryani from Tandoori Flame which is far more fancier place and charges the same for Biryani. 

I feel the food is westernized and far from the authentic taste you would expect from a place like this. 

I would go here again only when every one else is closed."}
{"text":"There's not much to say about this place. We went in to check it out as this is supposed to be a really popular chain from Pakistan. The service was really bad. The girl at the counter had no knowledge of customer service. She was rude and arrogant. After we placed and paid for our order we were informed it was going to be 1/2 hr because they were going to cook per order. This is fine at least we knew we were getting a fresh bat h but a little heads up before payment would've been nice. The food was mediocre combined with the bad service they are lucky I'm still giving them a 2 rating!"}
{"text":"Before it was good but now it's not good. Place was not clean and biryaani was just orange. Not alot of taste and they charge for yogurt and salad."}
{"text":"Their fried chicken is bland with no spices and oozing with oil making KFC look healthy in comparison.

Chicken Biryani is decent, but price is a bit high, but only by a few dollars."}
{"text":"Great tasting biryani, of all the meats. What they need to learn quick is other key elements that make a restaurant in Canada great.
This is my ranking on a scale of 1 to 10. 10 being the best
Biryani. 8/10
Fish: 1/10. Could have given negative. Horrible near black batter and excessive salt with soggy fries.
Service: 2/10. Didn't see the first order for 30 minutes and till 60 minutes 20% people in group of only 9 didn't see their order.
Staff courtesy: 2/10. Not once anyone came to give update and asked about the food.
Cleanliness: 5/10. There was water spilled on floor all over the place.
Not sure if I am coming back"}
{"text":"Food was great!!!
Staff was very professional !!! 
Manpreet and Aditya were AWESOME !!!"}
{"text":"Worst biryani don't waste your money. It's oil fry rice and super size with bone chicken. I also found hair in my biryani. Will not buy again."}
{"text":"Took 55 mins to get one plate of biryani and it sucked!! Never go there if you re in a rush!"}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday evening and there were a lot of families enjoying their food there. We ordered chicken biryani, chicken chargha, Bihari boti, boneless chicken tikka, beef kabab and malayi tikka, salad and chutney. Biryani was good but wasn't the best in town. Malayi tikka and Bihar boti were ok but if you want some amazing bihari boti and malayi tikka then Cafe De Khan is the best place to go. Chicken boneless tikka was really good and beef kabab were ok too. Chicken chargha was amazing. It tasted just like the chargha we used to eat in Pakistan. Overall it was a good family experience and I will come back to try more stuff."}
{"text":"Biryani is tasty and spicy . The best part is \"Aaloo\" in the biryani which I always craved for. Salad and raita is fresh. A must must try biryani. Bbq Chicken and Crispy burger is tasty too. Parhata is just ok. But I M in love with biryani. Best biryani i ever had in sauga."}
{"text":"Visited from USA, friend of us took us to the SB..  Biryani was tasty but not close to  a taste of Khi; little delayed in service however  Manager Mr. Tufail is very professional & courteous.. 
Recommend to visit ****"}
{"text":"Worst food ever! Student biriyani is big name in Pakistan and I thought I will get the same here. All the food we ordered was not authentic at all. Nihari was watery and meet was full of fat. Malai tika was dry and tasteless. Hakeem was watery as well with no meet. Worst of all everything was served in to go boxes. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I like their biryani. Never tried anything else and always ordered to go. Chicken pieces in the biryani are well done and deserve 5/5 but big chunks of potatoes in it is not very appealing. The rice is little too oily and no matter what spice level you choose, they all taste the same."}
{"text":"This here is restaurant which uses a legendary name. This is kind of franchise now, which reminds my dad and father-in-law about their Student days. This name is famous as the first owner started this business selling Biryani on a roadside in a Pakistani city to students and then it grew from there.  

I came here with the family so we ordered a bunch of stuff to try. Although they have quiet a bit of seating the design frame of the restaurant is more of a take out location. The food is packed as a take out order but they do give you disposable plates and cutlery if you want to dine in. The restaurant was clean and their was plenty of parking. 

After looking into the menu, we decide to order Chicken Biryani (offcourse), Chicken Karahi, two types of kabab and some naans. The food was very fresh and hot but the service was extremely slow in bring the food out.  The chicken biryani was very good but even the mild was very spicy and could cause a heartburn. The other stuff were average but hot and freshly cooked!

For my Muslim brother and sisters - they are halal meat!"}
{"text":"Loved their biryani and their service was great student biryani is awesome and the restaurant was very clean"}
{"text":"Their biryani is pretty good. We also like the paratha wraps. However, we ordered Grilled Chicken Tikka sandwich and they were not even close to cutting it. First they screwed up the order and forgot to provide fries and drinks with the combos. The burger was nothing but some chicken tikka meat between two stale buns. There was a shred of lettuce, no sauce, no condiments or anything else on it. Just dry meat on a bun. The lower bun was so soggy that it instantly disintegrated when I tried to pick up the burger. I also ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and there was no buffalo sauce in it. I am not sure what was in it. Maybe just the chicken tikka again. I think I will stick to the Chicken Chutney wraps and the biryani which seems to be the two things they get right. This was a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"No doubt the biryani has flavour but let me tell you, one of the worst services ever. Ordered at 3pm and also let them know I will be coming to pick up at 6 pm. When I got here they asked what time I had ordered. The man from the kitchen came out and assured it would be ready in ten to fifteen minutes. The girl up at the front really did not care, no apology and showed she just does not care. I really don't think I would be going back there."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. 
Think twice before ordering the rolls - they are oily and not in a paratha but instead use bhathuras... disgusting owner and his service - did not want to cancel the order and said that the good biryani will compensate for the bad rolls! Think before you eat here! Horrible! 
There are zillion Pakistani biryani places in town - please try Desi corner or even Silver Spoon (silver spoon has poor service) but much better quality food.
The best chicken rolls are at Al Kahan (heartland) and ask for paratha roll!"}
{"text":"tasteless and overpriced biryani. these guys think stealing a name from a well established business in Pakistan and copy-cating them will earn them name? no, they earn shame from me and my family.

we ordered 5 biryanis to go so i was first hoping they will give us in 5 individual containers. instead they gave us 5 equivalent in a tray. when i brought it over to someone's house we were all shocked to see how less biryani they gave us and very less chicken.

besides the quantity, there is no taste at all. sorry sir but you have a lot to work on."}
{"text":"Ordered food, person at front didn't seem like they knew what was on the menu. Had to point out they served butter chicken. Ordered food at 10:15. Told me it was a 15 - 20 minute wait. Came back at 10:35 and person at cash explained it was another 20 minute wait. Went to discuss with the rest of the group if they willing to wait. When they said no, I went back to cancel the order and apparently now it only took 5 more minutes. So decided to entertain the idea. Every 5 minutes they kept stringing me along saying it's done and coming up. Lastly, at 10:55 I was upset and ready to demand my money back. He said only 1 minute and surprisingly it came out. We ordered a chicken roll, chicken Briyani, and butter chicken. The chicken roll and Briyani was cold. The Briyani was lacking flavour. The butter chicken was hot. The food at best is average. Definitely wouldn't go back again. Overall, food wasn't good, service was a nightmare, and nothing special about pricing. Wouldn't go back, and wouldn't recommend it either."}
{"text":"I hope and wish the owner/management is reading this review!!I'm sorry you all are running a very bad show!Poor management, chaotic ordering and beyond dirty bathroom!!!You are giving this legendary name and a very bad image!!

So on a Saturday night me and my husband walk in to try their food..order is chaotically taken by two different ladies who really had no knowledge about their own menu!I ordered a deal 5 with Malia tikkah and she said we don't keep that?!?!I literally had to to show her the hand menu in order to for her to place my order!Second we ordered a haleem combo!!

While I was waiting for the food I used their restrooms which were dirty/filthy beyond disgust!Thankfully I just went in them to wash my hand pre-food! :-/


Our number was soon called and we went up to collect the food.Even dine-ins are given in togo packing with disposable plates to eat.There was again confusion and the staff literally began to feel the food from the bags to verify if it was our order?!!It all seemed quite chaotic and badly run!!

Tables were dirty and we had to call the lady to clean it up for us!For me that just breaks the deal!!

The Malia tikkah tasted pretty good but the paratha was pretty average!!The haleem lacked flavor and salt!!I wasn't quite excited with the flavoring of the food!Their zardas and firni are pretty good!I have tried their biryani before at a friends place and wasn't quite impressed!!Its got too much of masala in it where as the actual Student locations in Karachi don't put so much masala on their biryanis, I have had student biryani at least 20/30 times in Karachi so I know what I'm talking about!!!

Lastly owners on a Saturday night pls keep adults behind the counters and not high school going kids!!This place has potential but lots needs to be corrected and workerd upon!!"}
{"text":"The child behind the counter who took my order was just plain rude. When I inquired why he was being short on answering questions he said he was tired. I told him to go home and find another job. If I over-pay for average food, the customer service should be point on. In addition, the bathroom smelled like something had died in there. The AC was NOT on and the food was terrible. If I could give below a one-star I would. Please save your money friends and go to another place."}
{"text":"I dunno maybe I'm not a biriyani type of guy but still if I just break down my experience as a whole wasn't really good. The music was annoyingly loud in this place and every thing looked kinda dirty and I almost left immediately but a co worker told me this was good food so I just accepted my surroundings and didn't judge a book by its cover, I usually don't anyways. So biriyani is basically a seasoned rice with a different types of meat mixed in with it, I chose the boneless chicken. About 10 mins later and with a small headache developing from the noise my food was finally ready, the portion size was good, lots of rice with chunks of chicken hidden underneath. But the rice was kinda dry in quite a unappealing way like I was already desperate for water because of just the spices (I'm just a white dude so I can't handle spices well, don't judge) but having this dry rice wasn't helping either. The flavors were not overly appealing in anything, at least the chicken itself was pretty moist but really nothing special. The coriander yogurt mixture offered me a bit of relief and was pretty good except it was way watery. Meh... I could imagine that finding a better place for this type of food would change my overall impression of it but I'm not feeling inspired to look much after this experience."}
{"text":"If you're in mood of Biryani, this is amongst the best you will get !! We have tasted many but keep returning to this one. 
They have several combos available with curries as well. Honesty not much of a fan of their curries but a die hard fan of their Biryani, it comes in Mild and Spicy, so you can pick as per your taste as well. Each Biryani costs $7.50+ taxes, higher than the average take out joints. The quantity is good and makes worth the price. 
They also have Paratha Rolls, again they are good but not to compare with Biryani. The Parathas are oily and heavy as well. Try the Chicken Chutney Roll but avoid the Cheese Roll, it was too greasy the last time we had it. 
If you are doing take out, many a times they may not pick up the call as they are very busy but keep trying, they are open till late as well. 
Dining wise they have good seating, the staff is cooperative as well. 
To sum it up, a great place and excellent Biryani !!!"}
{"text":"A fan of spicy Indian foods, I accompanied my friends to this newly opened restaurant in Mississauga. I was told that this restaurant was kind of a \"legend\" in its native country, Pakistan where the founder started selling biryani in a push cart near a school or college and was flocked by students; hence the name \"Students\"..

The restaurant is decorated simply, the furniture is \"run of the mill\" and not very clean for a restaurant that just opened. The prices are a bit high when compared to nearby eateries serving the same kind of food but their biryani is to die for. We ordered the chicken and lamb biryani, the chicken biryani was good but their lamb biryani was out of the world. Having visited several Indian and Pakistan joints in the USA and across Canada, I have never eaten such delicious biryani in my life. Would recommend that patrons stick to the medium spice as the spicy biryani could burn you... when they say spicy... they really mean it. Medium spice is what I would recommend going for unless you have the palate to handle spice or are on a Kamikaze mission.

The owner, came around personally to ask if everything was up to our satisfaction and requested our feedback. I mentioned that the food was good and commented that:

1. The price was a bit steep when compared to other restaurants offering the same kind of food.

2. Rice was flavorful in both, chicken and lamb biryani but the lamb biryani was way better.

He explained that most of the places we were comparing the price with were take-out joints whereas his was a full service restaurant; hence a slightly higher price.

For the difference in taste between chicken and lamb, he explained that the spices are actually cooked in the meat for lamb, making the dis more flavorful whereas chicken is added when the spices are almost done.

I would recommend the lamb biryani, have enjoyed better chicken biryani at other places. Gave a 4star rating as the place was not as clean as I expected it to be despite the fact that the restaurant opened only a couple of mopnths ago.

Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is very popular as its this companies first Canadian location. They are known in Pakistan and the UAE for their Biryani. As I walked in there with this high expectancy I was kinda sorta let down as I did not find the food to be all that great. Perhaps the style isn't to my liking or I just went on an off day. Nevertheless I will probably go back another day and update this review."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place, since \"Student Biryani\" is a well-known spot in Karachi. This place didn't live up... Interior design was nice (credit where it is due), but we went there for the name and taste, not looks. Over priced and mediocre taste at best. Better Biryanis elsewhere already. If owners are reading, please get the actual recipe that made the brand popular in Pakistan. Not some homemade dish."}
{"text":"Not sure if they changed things but I ordered a chicken biryani spicy for 7.50 plus taxes. Which is roughly the average now a days for biryani. And yes the raitaa was included.  I actually really liked the biryani. It tasted different than the typical biryani you find at SS or KK. I would recommend biryani lovers to give this place a try"}
{"text":"Bad food, very bad service. I would never go again. There food contained too much oil and salt. It's like they inject oil into their meat. Only thing that was decent was the fries"}
{"text":"The service for take out is extremely slow. I waited 45 minutes for a single box of biryani for take out. I saw 3 other tables receive food before me, but when I asked about the status of my order, they said the rice was still cooking. Please at least tell the customer to expect a wait when ordering if the rice is still cooking, instead of keeping them guessing and saying \"it's coming it's next\" for a long time. No apologies, other explanation or a estimated wait time was given when asked. 
Took the biryani home and it wasn't even hot when I opened the box. 
Disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here many times since it opened. 
Its not a dine in kind of restaurant, but more like a takeout kind of environment.

Service is not that great, for dine in customers there's no glass plates but paper.
Prices for just about everything are a little expensive for the portions. 
Lamb Biryani good though."}
{"text":"I've never had the student biryani from pakistan i was taken here by friends who raved about the biryani. I found it to be acceptable, nothing extraordinary but not bad either the customer service is a little slow but they are generally polite."}
{"text":"Loved the. Biryani. Tried it the first time . It tastes as good as the original one in Karachi ! Will go there again when in the mood of having good biryani. 
The price of $7.50 per plate ain't bad considering that it is a huge serving."}
