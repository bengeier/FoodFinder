{"text":"Best wings around. Their garlic parm wings have the best flavor ever. Sesame ginger are also really great!  All other ones are out of this world too. Only negative here that takes away a star is they went to a coated French fry. Why? The old fries were so good."}
{"text":"Exactly what you need in Glenshaw.  Solid specials. Awesome fish sandwich. Salads with French fries on top.  I have only been for lunch, and it's just what I'm looking for in a bar in Glenshaw for lunch.  
The wait staff, the decor, the menu is wonderful. Sparkys isn't trying to be anything but itself. Genuine. 
I'll keep coming back. Always!"}
{"text":"It's is no longer in business . Waiting  to see what's gonna take over. Used to be a good place to eat. Always looking for some thing new to go on rt. 8."}
{"text":"I have to up my rating by a star after going back.  Why?  Three words: Chicken.  Parm. Sandwich.  I went back with my Mom to use my Living Social deal worth $15.  I had the sandwich and fries, she had the country fried steak dinner.  Our total bill after the deal?  Under $3.  Can't beat it.  And I went home with half my sandwich.

Service, as before, was attentive and friendly.  As I said the last time, I won't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it's not too bad.    The look inside is dated and immediately you are going to feel that you are in for a bad meal inside, however once you get something on the menu it's not too bad, mostly bar food/sandwich choices but what they do they do well.     Not a place I would go for a \"nice\" dinner out but a sandwich and a beer place that you can't go wrong with."}
{"text":"I had dinner tonight at Sparkys in Glenshaw with my Parkinson's disabled brother and had the absolute worst treatment I have ever experienced in a dining establishment from who I believe was the owner and his wife. They assumed he was drunk because he has a hard time walking and talking and without even asking if he had a problem, took his beer away and were going to refuse him service until I explained his condition. Even then they did not even offer a hint of an apology to try and make him feel at ease with his condition or their ignorance.If this is how they treat someone with a clearly visible physical condition, I have no respect for them as human beings. My advice to everyone is to eat somewhere else and save yourself the rude experience. I'm so disgusted from the experience I will be contacting KDKA to bring this behavior to everyone's attention and would like to start a boycott of the place from everyone that knows anyone with a debilitating disease. This may sound a little harsh but these people just took the wind out of his life by blatantly throwing his condition in his face with no remorse or sense of dignity. I could go on and on but I've said my piece and will follow through with my goal to expose these people for what they are."}
{"text":"Needs a face lift big time. I'm not even quite sure Robert irvine could save this place."}
{"text":"I don't know the financial problems or if they have any or not ? This looks like a  place for Robert Irvine. But the food I had was good ( Wings and a Fish Sandwich ) Both were perfectly cooked. I especially like my wings well done in the deep fryer and they cam out very crisp,yet not burnt !  Generous sized burgers for not a arm and a leg.
Only problem is they seem to be under staffed. And the food \"on hand\" might have been ordered in not enough quantity to fill demand. Something that should be anticipated n'nat ?"}
