{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Everything we ordered was beautifully prepared and tasted amazing!  With so much average Asian cuisine out there, it was awesome to find such a great place - and in Aurora, no less!  Room is lovely, quiet - perfect for date night or a family dinner."}
{"text":"Shan is the best restaurant in Aurora. They have the most flavourful tofu I have ever had and absolutely everything on the menu is good. The decor is nice, and the staff is so kind and helpful! My loved ones and I LIVE for this place"}
{"text":"Friendly service and fresh food. Portions are a bit small, but good enough to satisfy. Upscale ambience - a little dark though!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese/Thai in Aurora.  I have been ordering from Shan for years.  Food is always great!"}
{"text":"Came to this place for lunch few days ago with some colleagues and did enjoy it.  The place is very morden and nicely decorated.  Lunch menu has a good selection of Thai and Chinese food.  I had the vegetarian stir fry glass noodle lunch set and added a soup for $2.  Overall, the food was decent however it would be better if it was less oily.  I would come back for lunch occasionally since it is close to my workplace and price is reasonable."}
{"text":"I ate dinner therea few weeks back after work and I must say I enjoyed it. Previously I had ordered the lunch specials they had going, pad thai or sushi dragon rolls for $5, and they weren't bad. They were quick and they hit the spot. The dinner however had a better presentation and was far tastier than expected. I ordered the general tao chicken and it was very good.  I will try them for lunch again soon!"}
{"text":"portions are small, but the food is really good, ginger Chicken and hargaw are always my favorite, I wish they gave bigger portions for the price you pay, but they always get it right so we keep going back."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, servers are very friendly and good Asian fusion dishes, but not a lot of choices. If you prefer a cozy, quiet a bit upscale ambiance with Asian food, this is the place to go. I love the fact that they serve wine :)"}
{"text":"The best Asian restaurant in Aurora! It is classy inside and has a wide array of menu options. If you aren't into all Asian food there is still something for you. Never too busy and the staff are the sweetest!"}
