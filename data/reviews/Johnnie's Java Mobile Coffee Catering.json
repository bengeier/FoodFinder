{"text":"Excellent service & quality is what you can expect from Lydia & her team! We've used them now twice for a holiday office event and employee appreciation event for approx. 300 employees. The espresso bar is a huge hit, and most recently, the iced coffee options were enjoyed! Lydia has been able to efficiently accommodate the large crowd, and make the service run very smoothly! The team has been well prepared and everything was delicious! No complaints at all. Thanks again!"}
