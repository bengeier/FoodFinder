{"text":"I love this place. Service is always stunning and they accommodate you with some changes on the menu, as per food allergies or because you don't like something. Manager lady is also super friendly, I usually go there to have a drink or a meal before that shows, and if you go sometimes, she will remember you and feel super welcome and make you a deal if you get there late (food wise), Sometimes they have a buffet for the evening (very famous shows night) and the food is also amazing, does not taste as old food standing there for the whole day as regular buffet places  Good selection on while also to pair with your meals"}
{"text":"This was part of a package with a musical show at the Bell Centre. We had no idea what was waiting for us.  Let me start off that this is a high class restaurant with a very limited choice of three appetizers, three entrees, and three deserts. Nothing else. And a combination of three is slightly more than $40 before taxes and tip.  The good: The food is excellent! We both got the pasta and it was cooked on point! The sauce was chunky and full of flavour. The appetizer (we took the salad) was fresh and very tasty. The deserts (chocolate mousse for one, Masson jar caramel for me) were a great way yo end our meal. Great wine selection for wine drinkers. The timing between serving is perfect so we can enjoy our evening and chat. We finished our meal just before the opening of the doors for the show. Great view to the city.  The bad: Statues at the entrance were dusty at eye level, and if you took the time to look at the ledge of the wall, it is worse. Bathrooms were very dark. Took me a minute and a half to understand how the faucet works in there. Waitress was nice but over-friendly and over-smiling. The television sets on the walls that shows the upcoming shows are very bright and very distracting.  But if your budget permits it, this is a very nice experience, and the food is simply awesome."}
{"text":"Very bad service. We almost missed our show at the bell center! Food was very underwhelming."}
