{"text":"Merchant and Trade is another example of how well the Kimpton brand sets its standards!! This place is absolutely amazing!! Stepping into the elevator to make the journey up to the rooftop's reveal is worth the wait! Great drinks, class and elegance also mix style and sexiness. Finally a big city vibe so needed in Charlotte. I travel everywhere for work, and I make it a point to at least visit a Kimpton property when I am in a different city. Charlotte, you are lucky to have this company in your town. It is obvious from the minute that you walk into a Kimpton property, customer service and a sense of pride is always present. You definitely set the bar high for future properties in the Queen City!!"}
{"text":"This place by far one of the best spot for panoramic views. Stopped in for a drink last night. Def like the ambiance, highly recommend."}
{"text":"We went in with a group on a saturday night and they said we couldnt get in because we had laced up shoes.  The person was extrmeley rude about it. We sat outside for 5 min and they  let a group of guys with laced shoes in???"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon the entrance to Merchant & Trade last night while walking around Uptown. 

When you walk in, you are immediately escorted to an elevator that is a straight ride to the top. When we got up there, we went to the bar for a drink. The inside space is super open with glass windows all around. My husband and I both settled on the M&T Old Fashion. Very delish and well made! The drink menu had a handful of fun cocktails, beer, and wine.

I noticed that alot of tables outside had a reserved sign. Since we were only going to be there for 20 minutes as we had tickets for a show, I asked the hostess if we could sit at one. She quickly and sweetly showed me which table we could grab for a bit. 

Impressive is the first word that comes to mind when walking outside. Loads of beautiful couches, tables, chairs, and fire pits overlooking a great view of Uptown!!! The ambiance was relaxing but with a classy twist.

We didnt try any food or look at the food menu so I cannot comment on that. Next time we go, we will grab a small bite with our drinks and I'll update the review.

Nice job M&T and welcome to Uptown!"}
{"text":"Love this new Uptown spot. The view is awesome and overlooks the Romare Bearden Park. It's nice and roomy. I suggest going on a weekday as the weekends it is packed and a little hard to get in. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Show up in a suit right after work and you're good to go. You'll pay an extra $3-5 per drink, but it's a very nice rooftop bar with a beautiful view. Better than Fahrenheit and City Lights Social in my opinion. The staff was friendly the first time I went, but a little pretentious the second time around.

My second visit didn't go so well. We showed up in dress shoes, slacks, sweaters, and light jackets and were turned away at 9pm on a Friday. Apparently there is a \"strict collared shirts\" policy, even though it was 45 degrees in late November (and it's a rooftop bar exposed to the elements). Also, the social program manager is someone I know from his days at Hotel Van Zandt / Geraldine's in Austin, having lived there for five years, and he was completely unwilling to accommodate us because of the lack of \"collared shirts\". A hotel guest was refused immediately after us because he was wearing sneakers. I don't know this guy, but he was paying a premium to stay at a Kimpton boutique hotel and couldn't even get a drink at the hotel bar. I've never seen such a thing anywhere else, and I travel 2-3 weeks per month for work. \"Sorry you didn't pack dress shoes\" was the bouncer's way of addressing that situation, and it's pretty much on par for the greeting you should expect at Merchant and Trade. Reminds me of that movie Date Night - Claw, you're welcome!"}
{"text":"Views, Views, Views. This is the \"IT\" spot for 2018. It just opened up and is located on top of the Kimpton Hotel. The rooftop spot overlooks Romare Beardon Park and the baseball field in Uptown. It also has a great skyline view of the city. 
There's a wrap around outdoor patio with fire pits, rocking chairs, and soft seating. Inside, there is a large bar and more seating.

Tip: There is a dress code that they strictly enforce."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful rooftop area and comfortable chairs. It's more than able to accommodate large parties. The prices are a bit on the heavy side but the experience made up for it. I loved the cocktails and the best appetizer was the Cuban sandwich. I will definitely be back just for that sandwich."}
{"text":"Gorgeous views. Fancy cocktail menu. I have never eaten here so can't speak to that, to be honest I haven't seen any plates of food coming out any time I've been here. More of a place to grab a drink. The vibe they go for is very high end which has pros and cons. I see many reviews with complaints of inconsistency of the enforcement of the dress code and I agree with those. They at times enforce a strict sneaker rule and then other times I have seen people in there with sneakers on? They may want to figure that out so people aren't confused and/or angry. Also it seems that lots of seating says \"reserved\" yet you can be there for over an hour without seeing anyone sit there. Overall it's a nice place to go if you want to get outside and see the city but we sometimes can't go due to someone in your group perhaps not being the right footwear."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs.   If you are in Charlotte and want a better view of the city with much better food, check out Fahrenheit.  With regard to M&T, their management is awful.  They keep a big line out front to generate interest.  They have an OVERLY strict dress code that isn't consistent.  Their cocktails are overpriced and awful."}
{"text":"\"We want you to look good and feel good, bring your best next time\" 

There won't be a next time. I'm not wearing \"dress clothes\" when I'm in them for work. The point of going out is to have a good time and relax."}
{"text":"A very neat and cool atmosphere! It was crowded but service was not slow. The seating was comfortable and had a very trendy vibe. The bartenders were not the friendliest and drinks were way over priced. It was cold outside but when it is warm the outside part of the roof will be amazing. It has fire places outside and a great view of the city."}
{"text":"4 stars because if you go to a place like this, you really should be smart enough realize what you're getting to begin with - expensive drinks, people who want to be seen, etc.  If this wasn't a really awesome rooftop, I'd f***ing hate this place.  And, I probably won't go back anytime soon.  But, I do recommend that you go, at least once, because it's a really awesome view."}
{"text":"Classy. Hip. Contemporary. Stellar views. Charlotte is a metropolitan city and ought to have places like this. I'm sure the lines will die down as this place settles in to the uptown nightlife scene and the \"newness wears off.\" I agree with the other reviewer - this is not New York City. It's better. M&T is not trying to be anything but what we are - kudos. This place will thrive. And, Charlotteans, it is okay to have a few places which have a higher standard of dress code than backward baseballs caps and jeans with holes in them. There are plenty of places you can patronize for that."}
{"text":"I never reviewed after the first time we visited Merchant & Trade, so we have been twice now...

We don't like waiting in lines, and were lucky on this Saturday afternoon to go right in. They are pretty sticklers with the dress code, so be sure to call before going and check your attire our you might get turned away.

I am so surprised to see *at time of writing this* just 3 stars for M&T. This venue is elevated, upscale, and as many have mentioned before, serve great cocktails with an amazing view.

I haven't experienced slow service here.

One particular welcomed feature of Merchant & Trade is that they don't serve $15 cocktails in a plastic glass because you're on a roof. Instead you are handed a crystal-like actual glass to enjoy your adult beverage. I'm over the age of being on a rooftop to drink bubbles out of a plastic flute. Please. Even at the W in DC overlooking the White House. No thanks."}
{"text":"Their food was awful, but their service and drinks (sort of) made up for it. If you like bourbon I highly recommend the wanderlust cocktail. They also had an exquisite espresso martini. It's a snobby place so be prepared for that. This is a good celebration location, not just a weekend venture."}
{"text":"This space is absolutely gorgeous! It didn't feel like I was in Charlotte. The space is very chic and modern. We were greeted buy a friendly door man and elevator hostess. Once we arrived, we were greeted again by the hostess that seated us outside. The covered patio area have a beautiful view of Knights Stadium and beyond. The dj played a mix of house and techno music that wasn't obnoxious. With all of those glows, I'm giving M&T three stars because the table service was sub par. Our waitress was mediocre at best. She came off as cold and inattentive. I don't know if there were special cocktails because we were just handed the menu and she walked off. They carry a wide variety of spirits and the prices are about the same at similar venues. I will return to M&T and hopefully I'll be seated in a section with a friendlier waitress."}
{"text":"The vibe + the view + the bubbles. What more could we ask for? Checked out this rooftop bar/lounge with hopes that it matched all the buzz we've hearing. And it did! Great spot to grab drinks and catch up with friends or nice pre/ post dinner drinks with with a view. The server was even nice enough to bring us a blanket as the night air started getting a little cooler. Can't wait to check out this place in the warmer seasons."}
{"text":"We had a tremendous experience last Monday before and after the Panthers game.  We ate a few bites, especially enjoying the kale chips and the mac and cheese (surprisingly since we are rare to find a good mac and cheese).  We also appreciated the wine selection on top of the cocktail choices.  Our server was attentive despite the crowd and the GM offered us a nice greeting.

Most of all, the setting is outstanding, inside and out.  The views are great but the decor really offers a lot and makes us say (sorry but it's still true), we don't even feel like we're in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We stood in line for over thirty minutes with completely drunk people screaming only to get in and realize that the wait for drinks was longer than the wait to get in. The door staff also could be more hospitable to those wanting to get into their venue."}
{"text":"Candace is the best server!!!! She took care of us so well!!!! I enjoyed my experience at merchant and trade. Will def come back as long as she is my server!!"}
{"text":"The only great thing about this place was the view.  The music was pretty bad... I'm really open minded, but this felt more like RAVE venue than a upscale bar. The vibe was not what I was expecting. 

My group ordered super simple drinks, mostly bottled beer. It took at least 20 minutes for them to arrive"}
{"text":"Brandon the bouncer was awesome! He knew a table wouldn't be taken up for about two hours and seeing my friends and I be without a table prompted him to ask the hostess to let us sit at the reserved table for about an hour and a half! Will definitely recommend because he thought quickly in his feet! Thanks so much Brandon! You're the man!"}
{"text":"I would recommend going anywhere else in Charlotte besides here. Local McDonald's have better food, there are places with better views that aren't as pretentious or overpriced."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! DRINKS ONLY! They have a small menu of small plates but the food was horrible. The chicken wings had zero flavor at all-very bland. The tater tots were not good either and I'm not sure how you mess that up. The view and layout of the facility are beautiful and has a great outdoor space. This place is perfect for drinks. Maybe they should ditch the food idea entirely.  I think the reviews would be much better if they just capitalized on drinks, the space, and the view."}
{"text":"Jaw-dropping view, comparable to Fahrenheit.  Their food menu is short, but the items we ordered were very good.  The most unique outdoor seating that makes you feel like you're on vacation.  Service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Stay away, there are better places than this place.  Waited outside for 45 minutes and finally got up and the place was empty. Drinks were average dive bar taste with NYC prices. Spend your money else where. This is Charlotte.  He attitude of the staff sucked and went across the street to Ink N Ivey and had a blast.  Much better places to hang in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Kimpton for the weekend, so the SO and I decided to check out M&T for drinks before dinner on a Saturday. This was the Saturday before Christmas. The whole city of Charlotte was pretty quiet and empty. We noticed a line late Friday night. I think the staff at the hotel informed us that Kimpton customers go through a different line. Not 100% sure, but when we arrived around 7pm there was no line whatsoever. The doormen greeted us and directed us to the elevator.

We did not experience any issues with the dress code. We looked up M&T prior to going and read about the dress code. We also checked with
the front desk to make sure jeans were allowed. They informed us that \"nice\" jeans (meaning no logos, rips, etc) were fine. I wore a dress and booties and my SO wore \"nice\" jeans, a dress shirt, jacket, and dress shoes. 

Located on the 19th floor of the hotel, M&T has an amazing view of Charlotte. We did not stay long because we had dinner reservations for 8:30 elsewhere. We stayed for a few drinks and enough time to take in the view. The doormen, hostesses, bartenders and the rest of the staff were all enthusiastic and helpful from start to finish. All were happy to take our picture for us... which should be expected if you work at a rooftop bar. Lol. We enjoyed the drinks and outdoor seating areas. The drinks cost a little bit more than your average bar, but nothing outrageous. We look forward to returning and trying their food."}
{"text":"Turned away from the bar in Charlotte, NC because you're not wearing a \"collared shirt\".

First...

It's Charlotte. 

Second...

It's Charlotte.

Best of luck with your business."}
{"text":"My girls and I went here for the first time on a Thursday night. The atmosphere was very welcoming and we literally felt as if we were in another city. The rooftop vibe is just what Charlotte needs! I gave it 4 stars as it took quite some time to get my glass of prosecco, even after asking for it again. Otherwise, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant five stars because my experience was great from start to finish. We had no problems with the doorman or the dress code upon entrance; the dress code is listed on the website and VERY easy to follow. They were not as strict as the complaints lead me to believe, just look nice and you won't have a problem! The hostesses were great as well. 

We had 4 people in our group in total and had to wait about 10 minutes to be sat which gave us time to look around and take advantage of the view. The inside is small and cozy which is perfect for social interaction. 

After being sat, our waitress greeted us and gave drink suggestions she was very helpful and polite. We ordered burgers, kale chips, wings, crab rolls, and tater tots. Everything was AMAZING considering the small selection and interesting ingredients and my cocktail was delicious. No complaints at all, we had a great experience from start to finish and will be returning."}
{"text":"This place was cool, but I wasn't terribly impressed with the menu or selection of drinks. You definitely are paying for the view. 

It seemed excessive to have someone check our ids and a separate person to let us on the elevator before 5 on a weekday. Once we arrived inside, I liked the fire place and the space outside seemed nice, but it was Late December so we stayed indoors. Once it struck 5, the lights dimmed and made it hard to read the menu, but staff brought out some table lights-- that looked like dumbbells. 

The fries were good, and my prosecco was good too, but nothing too special."}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 and wanted to get drinks and dinner and they turned us away because one of the members in our party was wearing (nice) sneakers. They said they had a strict dress code. Guess we will be taking our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice location, great views and good atmosphere. Very pretentious however everything does not match the upscale atmosphere they are going for. Hostesses and servers wear sneakers, softsoap hand soap in restrooms, no toilet paper etc. Also if you're there with a big group. Order separately at the bar and not at the table with the group as they cannot effectively split checks. I went after work on a Monday so it wasn't that busy. May try a weekend to enjoy a bigger crowd and hopefully the music."}
{"text":"The cocktails are pricey but what you would expect for an upscale rooftop bar uptown. I think it's worth it for the atmosphere and would love to come back during a Knights game since it overlooks the stadium."}
{"text":"Overpriced, but my cocktail wasn't that bad. The novelty of a rooftop bar overlooking the Knight's Stadium is what you are paying for."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. The ambiance and interior are great but the food is over priced and average at best. We had the calamari and short rib pasta and neither were particularly good. Won't be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place and made it a stop on a Charlotte tour with visitors on Saturday. We were wearing casual brewery clothes (think flannels, etc) and they let us in around 4pm. Based on other reviews they probably would not have let us in at a later hour. We were seated right away and I love the ambiance and the decorations. Very classy and well put together. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We ordered cocktails and I ordered tater tots. The cocktails were very good, but the tots might have changed my life. They were huge and hand made and gourmet and yum. I really want to come back here after work dressed up and enjoy properly after dark. My guests loved the views. I only remove one star because the doorman was a little much for 4pm on a Saturday. Will definitely come back and I also can't wait to try Angeline's."}
{"text":"It's a nice vibe but it's too much of a forced club scene into a bar atmosphere. I'm excited to go and check out the outside area in the summer though. I really loved my drink but too pricey for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not impressed! It's deece, but not the nice classy establishment I was hoping for.   Very small place.  You can tell it's going to fizzle down. The outside furniture is cheezy with a green tarp my dog would probably enjoy.  The inside doesn't have a great \"feel.\"  You know one when you walk in and this place doesn't have it.   Promise."}
{"text":"Come here for the view. It's an upscale rooftop bar for drinks and appetizers, but they're definitely overpriced. The view overlooks Romare Bearden Park and the BB&T stadium, so is opposite of the city, but still makes for great pictures of the sunset."}
{"text":"So, where do I start? OK let's start with the fact that we have yet another new bar in uptown with inattentive bartenders that are RUDE and seem to hate serving. I explicitly remember looking up both Angeline's down stairs and this place for the food and their drinks. I was excited to try both places since, they are new. The line is long and the processes to get up needs to be worked on. When you go up, no doubt, it's beautiful. The views is just OK, you overlook Romare park and the BBT ballpark. The terrace is huge, and has lots of lounge seating, which is great. The drinks, well, I am still wondering. I asked the bar tender if he could provide me with the list of cocktails for which he handed me a very large book with only the options to make my own drink, no specialty drinks. I go online today, and what do you know, there are specialty drinks. So why this particular bartender was so kind to shove a book in my face to build my own drink, is beyond me. So I went with my standard of vodka soda, all I could taste is soda but it's got the $14 price of the specialty cocktails I see online today. I wish they would raise the bar on all levels."}
{"text":"Ambiance on 100! The views are stunning and this place just exudes sexy. For food there are more tapas and light fare options than traditional entrees and though they all look AMAZING but there just aren't enough of them. 

I was only here for a cocktail so I can't wait to come back and try the food. There are only 7 cocktails on the menu and they're all as eclectic as the food. I ordered the cyclone and though it was very tasty, for it to be the most expensive item on the cocktail menu at $16, it was a bit too small for my liking.

I was here by myself because I was just killing time however this is a great place for a group of friends to come and hang out. I'm excited for my next time here."}
{"text":"Great vibe! The best views! The wait to get up was ok, the line moved fairly quickly and once up stairs while packed not crammed in like sardines, and the not so packed that service suffered. Can't wait to go back we had a blast!"}
{"text":"Terrible place, they have the worst service, terrible food.  Definitely would not recommend!  Angeline's below is much better.  Avoid wasting time in line and at his place.  Much better bars with roof tops!"}
{"text":"Not worth the time. But if you decide to give it a try make sure you dress to the nines or they might not let you in."}
{"text":"Incredibly rude and pretentious bouncer at the entrance/elevator. I do not normally leave reviews but this is an exception. I am a tourist to Charlotte and was treated very inferior because my brother had on (very nice) sneakers and shorts (it's warm this weekend!!). I was not aware Charlotte was so serious about attire to enter hotel bars...."}
{"text":"First time at Merchant and Trade and what a view!  Tried the Lamb Meatballs, duck Bao buns, crab buns , and vanilla bean pot de Creme.  Also had a nice cocktails Old Fashioned And Whiskey Sour.  All was very good and the service was great."}
{"text":"I really like this space. 

Of course it's new and hip but the decor is very nice and they have a fabulous patio!

Plenty of seating, a retractable cover, great views, good drinks and really good appetizers!  I'm craving the tater tots again.  

They have a dress code so don't schlep in with flip flops and expect to get in.  You are vetted before you can even go up the elevator.

The service is top-notch & professional.  I especially like Aislinn, the hostess/manager.  She is very good at making you feel welcome and taken care of.

Seating is reserved so check in or call ahead."}
{"text":"Took my uncle and his wife here last Friday night for drinks after having dinner downstairs at Angeline's. The drinks were watered down and the service could of been a lot better. A lot of my friends referred this place to me but l don't  think I will be returning back. The DJ also didn't play a mixed of music just mainly house music but the host was very friendly and the rooftop is nice."}
{"text":"First off, we started inside and our server Kate was fantastic! She was very patient and knowledgeable of the menu, quick service and great personality. We really enjoyed her. Then we decided to go outside and everything changed. This thin blonde server, I am unaware of her name because she was so rude, she was the worst server we have ever had. We're both former workers of the hospitality industry and could not believe this girl. We had to wave her over to order a drink, and she asked so rudely what my husband wanted  - as if it was annoying to her that we were asking. Then she got the drink and slammed it on the table and ran away. I really couldn't believe in a upper scale type of environment that a server was acting like this. If you hate your life when assisting people with their food and drink, do something else! So thanks Kate for your service, along with the good drinks and ambiance of the place we will be back. But we will make sure to steer clear of the other server, as their job is important to provide a good experience."}
{"text":"Turned away because my friend wasn't wearing the proper shoes and then turned away again the next night because my husband was wearing the proper shoes. Please! After attending Charlotte City Club, which has a dress code and then arriving at Merchant and Trade and being turned away due to shoes! Come on! Unfortunately, my friends and I won't be back. Oh well. Good luck."}
{"text":"Too pretentious to take my money on a Wednesday night when I'm wearing casual shoes on a rainy night. I've lived in many cities that would expect this, but not Charlotte. No need to spend my money here."}
{"text":"Merchant & Trade is exactly what you'd expect from another uptown, rooftop bar.

We waited for about 20 minutes to get in on Friday (around 6pm). Once escorted up to the 19th floor of the hotel, the doors opened to a well-decorated bar and indoor/outdoor seating area. As far as rooftop bar decor goes, I think Merchant & Trade slays the other options in Charlotte. They've used a navy and green theme to give it a vibrant feel while providing an overall relaxed environment. Seating options include rocking chairs, coaches, benches, stools, and everything in-between. The view is GREAT, especially if you want to watch a Knights game while drinking overpriced cocktails instead of overpriced beer (oh wait, they have that too!).

The drink and food menu were pretty average compared to its peer institutions. I'd been really hoping for a knockout cocktail menu, but they only had a handful of options, none of which sounded appealing to either my guy or me (and we have pretty different palates). The wine menu is okay, and they've got a good selection of liquors. Like many other uptown locales, you can buy a local craft brew for twice as much as you'll pay for it at the brewery its made at.

The food menu had some promise, and I hope they'll expand it. There were only a handful of appetizers, a few larger dishes, and a couple desserts. The lavash we had was really good, but I would've loved to get something more substantial here. Their vegetarian options were lacking, which is why I hope they'll start offering more selections.

Definitely worth one trip for the view and ambiance. I think it would make a great first date locale!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is laid back and nice. The view alone is worth a visit. I definitely recommend for a birthday, girl's night out or date night."}
{"text":"This place is very reminiscent of the rooftop bar I visited while in Las Vegas, Nevada. Upon entry you are greeted by a guard who checks your ID and stamps your hand. Next you're whisked off to an elevator where another guard has to input your floor destination. There are no floor call buttons inside of the elevator. When you arrive on the 19th floor there is a hostess stand that leads into the establishment. Unlike other bars where you can leisurely walk in and step up to the bar and order a drink, you have to be seated and served at a table or seated at the bar. 
The space is very open and airy with a covered bar area and open roof seating with a fire pit. Gorgeous city view. There are few TVs throughout but none of them were on at the time. 
The service was good and prompt. We enjoyed the fact that all of the juices at the bar were freshly squeezed, so our drinks were super delicious. We ordered the kale chips just to have something to snack on. The chips were crisp and flavorful, but a little messy to eat with all of the loose shaved Parmesan cheese on top. Also be careful of any draft winds. They will knock over your chips and spill them out on the table. 
Overall this seemed like a very chill place to hang out after work with a few people. I went on a Thursday afternoon, but I could really see the place transforming over the weekend with a different crowd."}
{"text":"Wearing an Andy Warhol T (DURING THE DAY) After watching a white woman with hiking boots and a backpack walk up 10 mins before. Was denied access because of the t shirt I'm wearing featured below. Not the first time I've watched a black person be turned away for while simultaneously watch another person gain access in the same attire."}
{"text":"Merchant & Trade nailed it here! I've frequented Kimpton Hotels and their luxurious spaces when visiting D.C so my expectations were already high. Until visiting M&T, The Donovan's Rooftop was my favorite, the pool, the view and the service was all just spot on. Upon entry Brandon greeted me at the door and wished us a great evening, once upstairs the music was alive and the drinks were flowing. You immediately get greeted off the elevator and taken back by how large the space actually is. The \"grassy\" dance floor with the DJ booth, the sections, THE VIEW! It appeared there was a nook for whatever type of experience you wanted. Seated, standing, dancing, grouped together with friends, or just solo and taking in the view. I love the energy from staff and Kate assisted me all evening with drinks. Some beers are a bit pricier here than at other venues but you're paying for an experience, a view and class. This isn't a dive bar, bring your best threads and some spending money. Treat yourself, you deserve it. 

I will say this place could benefit with a mobile bar maybe near the DJ booth. If you don't have a waiter or waitress then you'll be waiting at the bar for some time. Just a small bar that has beers ready to go especially as this place gets busier this summer. 

Outside of that, great work. A little jealous I'll prolly never experience the hotel part since I actually LIVE in Charlotte and LOVE Kimpton but happy to have M&T when friends visit. Maybe I'll get to do a staycation one day. All in all, two thumbs up here."}
{"text":"This place was really nice. This was my first visit and it was on a Wednesday after work. The staff was pretty friendly and the drinks were nice, but the best part about this place is the atmosphere and views. The decor is upscale and invites the same of its patrons which is a good idea for those looking for that crowd. The outside area is inviting and spacious and has great conversation areas to meet with friends, coworkers, etc. I didn't have any of the food on this trip, but I'm sure I will as I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ooh la la, Merchant & Trade is hands down my new favorite spot in uptown Charlotte. Entertaining out of towners on a weekday night, I decided to give M&T a try after seeing it pop up on my Yelp feed. I went with a group of four on a Thursday night. We were seated right away around 8:00 ish in a dimly lit open room with thumping music that wasn't overpowering. We didn't have to scream to have a conversation. The waitress was over immediately and took our drink orders. We had a blueberry cider, as I'm not a beer drinker that was delicious. Good pour, $7. The waitress made great recommendations and we had kale chips, wings, and the lobster rolls. Kale chips ($9) melted in my mouth. Very airy, as all decent kale chips are. Wings were a little suspect, as I've never seen a wing shaped like a ball at the end of a bone, but they were decent. I would not get the wings in the future. Last were the lobster rolls. I was expecting a lobster egg roll, but the mini sandwiches were GREAT. We shared, so I only had one. The dish came with two rolls ($17 A little steep), but they were fresh and I had no regrets except that I couldn't keep it all to myself.

The best part of Merchant and Trade was the atmosphere. They did a great job with decor and the crowd was 30+ which is nice. Very sexy vibe and you can make it a date night, or come with friends to hang out. There were plenty of post work groups. Long story short, I'll be returning to Merchant & Trade soon."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  If you get here too late, you may have to wait in line, but only because of one elevator to the top floor.  The views of the city are nice and the entire atmosphere reminds you of a large Cosmopolitan City.  Light appetizers only so perfect for a snack while you enjoy the drinks and the view."}
{"text":"Went to Merchant & Trade for a Friday night out with the girls. We arrived around 8:15, there wasn't a wait and we were able to grab a table for 4. 

We had cocktails and a few small plates. Great vibes and views overlooking Romare Bearden Park. 

There was a DJ playing house music."}
{"text":"Charlotte's new rooftop bar!  It's like most swanky rooftop bars you find in Charlotte. Fire pits, beautiful views, fancy cocktails, people in business attire and SLOW service.  I'm hoping this will improve because this place has the best views in Charlotte.  On one side you are looking straight at BB&T park and then on another you see the infamous BOA tower. They do have a strict dress code, so you might want to read up on it before you head there for a cocktail.  
Coolest Feature:  Retractable roof for inclement weather.  That's right....Rain or Shine you can enjoy a rooftop in Charlotte.  It's worth giving it a try.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Omg! Rip and rave about this place! It's amazing the view and ambience is a 10/10 it was packed yet my service was still on point!! Food and drinks were also superb , a little pricey but worth it. Food also came out super fast considering how busy they were. Great crowd of people as well. Very impressed, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I can here with a big group on a Thursday night. Once we got inside they were happy to accommodate our large group and they directed us to an outdoor area that could fit ~30. 

The service was so so slow, which I would have understood if they were swamped or if we all had our own tabs, however we were all on 1 tab and the bar was only half full. They gave us 1 server for our huge group, and this was not sufficient at all. Our server worked hard and did the best she could. However they lost a lot of possible sales to us because we couldn't order as many drinks as we wanted with just the 1 server (and yes we asked for more servers, but they could help us).

Even after we got drink orders in, it took more than 30 minutes for them to come out. We also ordered a few apps and they were average at best. The fried mushrooms were soggy and lacked flavor. The duck steak buns were mehhh. The lobster corn dogs were cold. 

Overall, the view is great. Come for the view, pictures, and 1 overpriced drink."}
{"text":"Horrible, HORRIBLE experience 

I had friends in town from Greece, Spain,England and Turkey , wanted to show them a good time but it didn't happen.  
First, we had to be in line for almost 1 hr to get in ( we thought the place was packed inside) when we finally went up , turns out the place was nearly empty, so what's the hold up ? Probably trying to make you feel like it's packed so they can attract more people to go to this place 
Second , the drinks are horrible , if you're looking a  good mixeologist, go somewhere else 
Third, not only they made us wait in line for an hour and the place was nearly empty but all the Firepits were off ! What kind of place makes you do all that for S** experience ?? I had to apologize to my friends and say , sorry - this is just Charlotte and they think they are Miami or something. 

Out of all the loungues in 202 world wide cities I've been to, this is rank # 202"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the upscale vibe here. Glad they have a strict dress code enforced- keeps it classy. Came here for a couple cocktails on a beautiful night and loved it. Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"The vibes and the views are better than most places uptown that tout vibes and views 
The food is tasty. Comes in small plate form and can easily be shared with friends. It's a standing room kinda bar, but it's comfortable at the same time. A Charlotte sunset paired with a whiskey on the rocks (for him) and a Malbec (for me) is the perfect start to an evening or date night. 

Keep the dress code in mind don't show up in jeans or sneakers. This place has quality standards and it shows!!"}
{"text":"If there was an option for zero stars, it would be a more accurate review. 

To keep this short, M&T had blocked two of my friends due to the \"sporty\" nature of their loafers (remember, this is Charlotte, the cultural hotbed of the southeast). They were enforcing a dress code expecting 100% of their patrons to be dressed in cocktail attire, as this is what the normal Charlottean looks like on a Thursday night. 

Once we made it past the bouncers, the bar itself was underwhelming, close to empty, and took forever to make overpriced drinks and undercooked food. 

If you want to spend a nice evening setting cash on fire and playing Russian roulette with salmonella, Merchant & Trade is the spot for you. If you are a decent human being that just wants a good drink, go to literally any place outside of uptown."}
{"text":"The place is nice, vibrant, with more of cosmopolitan feel to it (compared to other CLT's hot spots). I would give 5 stars but the hostesses need some training on how to be nicer and more accommodating. They definitely don't do their job the way they should."}
{"text":"We had a good experience, at this place the rooftop views and the place is probably the best so far in the city for a restaurant bar lounge. We haven't had the food yet but this is a definite keeper so far I'll keep you posted"}
{"text":"This place is a joke!  The bouncers are rude and the the food is way overpriced for what you get.  I feel bad for the servers bc it doesn't seem like management gives them a chance to succeed.  I was excited to visit, seeing how the city doesn't have many spots like this but in the end, the whole experience was very disappointing. It had kind of a trashy pretentious feel, which was a little strange seeing how most spots just know they're either/or and own it.  Def better bars/restaurants to spend your money in and around Charlotte that won't make you stand in a line for 30+ mins just to make you think they're busy.  Even with the views, I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Merchant & Trade 5 stars I really do. From first arriving the bouncer/doorman and the elevator hostess were so friendly & inviting, we were even joking around with the doorman before the elevator came. We get to the top and we are greeted by another friendly hostess & we ask to be seated outside. She escorted us to a table & informed us that our server would be right there. 5 stars so far for M&T especially with the retractable cover so we could enjoy the view even though it was drizzling. 
We were seating talking and taking in this gorgeous rooftop bar and the beautiful view! Our waitress finally comes but she hands us our menus and walks away, like barely greets us. The whole time she was very inattentive and our drinks kept taking forever to come out. Then me & a friend had ordered the same drink twice and both times one was extremely lower than the other. When we asked her she said it was the ice but both glasses where filled to the top with ice that you could see haven't melted yet. Then she stated \"well I don't know I didn't make them I just put the order in\" with a very rude attitude. If the rest of night had been mediocre I would not go back but she is the reason I would give this place a 2.5 rating because service is everything I especially for a brand new business. I will go back but if the service is this bad again, I can't say there would be a third time supporting this establishment."}
{"text":"I will preface my review by saying that this is really about how you market yourself. I'm all for upscale and trendy, but I'm not for inconsistent. My friends and I stopped by for drinks today and were turned away for our shoes. Again, very much understand dress code but do it understand why we were turned away and others with the same clothing were not. There was no point in arguing, as we were already turned off. Hopefully, they learn to treat people better and consistently. Word of mouth can really hurt a business."}
{"text":"Reviewing only the bar experience.

This is one of my favorite bars in uptown. The atmosphere is top notch. Fun, exciting, beautiful views of the city. The drinks are always good!! They usually have a DJ on Saturday night.

Why I took off a star. The line for this bar gets insane. And I'm not talking about the drink line, I'm talking about the line you stand in to go up to the bar. What is the most frustrating thing is that you'll stand in the line for 30 (or more) minutes and when you finally are allowed to go up to the bar it is not crowded at all. It seems that they hold the line to 'create interest'. 

Some helpful tips if you decide to visit. They have a dress code (which I am a fan of) and they enforce it. I've seen people turned away because they weren't dressed properly so don't think the bouncer won't notice if you don't comply with the dress code, they will notice and they will turn you away after waiting in line.
Get there as early as you can so you won't have to wait in line for very long and you can grab seats upstairs. Or make a reservation so you don't have to wait in line and you will have reserved seats. I do think in order to make a reservation you have to have a certain number in your party and spend a pre-determined minimum."}
{"text":"Great views, especially at night.  When you sit at a table along the glass you get a very peaceful view. Off in the distance you can see the planes methodically landing at CLT, and closer you get a great view of the park and if you time it right, the Knights stadium.

The drinks are good and they are about as pricey expected for a place like this, but this is a great place to check out and relax at on a nice night.  The servers were very nice and accommodating as well.

The only downside is this place seems to be very popular, and with the hotel crowd, it seems to get crowded quick.  If you are looking for a relaxing time, I would recommend heading there on a week night."}
{"text":"Merchant & Trade is trying to hard, and is very underwhelming for what you going in expecting. I went with two other girls on a Tuesday evening for some drinks and appetizers. It was a gorgeous night weather wise and we were looking forward to hanging out on a roof top.  It took us about 15 minutes to get from the bottom of the building to Merchant & Trade because the two bouncers that worked there had us \"fake wait\" in a line ACROSS from the elevator, not even next to it....in a section by itself. We were the only people waiting. This was absolutely absurd, not sure what message Merchant & Trade is trying to send by making three girls wait behind a velvet rope on a Tuesday when there is more than plenty of available seating upstairs.  Once we were seated we ordered a few drinks which were very disappointing. I ordered the pineapple vodka cocktail, insanely sweet and anything but smooth. My friend ordered a dirty martini with blue cheese olives which were stale. After that we played it safe and ordered a Tito's with club soda and lime.... the soda water was flat! The appetizers were OK, the tator tots are very interesting but a little mushy in my opinion. I gave two stars for the view, that is def by far the reason to come here. The view is absolutely gorgeous, and they have very modern fire pits outside which compliments the décor of the bar perfectly.  I gave one additional star for the server assistant, Jaquon (sorry if I am spelling wrong?) Jaquon was BY FAR the nicest, most attentive, and most helpful person who works at this entire establishment."}
{"text":"Talk about poor service...avoid this place.  DJ is out of control with crazy loud music to the point you cannot think.  Drinks are stupid over priced..$16 for house wine????  Manager could have cared less about our requests to reduce the piercing music.  Other tables around us were just as frustrated."}
{"text":"I attempted to go to M&T during the opening and turned away because I had on sneakers (which is fine since that was the dress code). A month later attempted with slacks and shoes and was told I couldn't go up (after waiting 35 min on a line) because I had on a sweater and not a collared shirt even though it was the middle of December. I told myself that I wouldn't go back but 2 weeks ago after a wedding I was invited so I went. Surely, I was good to go since I had on a suit. The line was 45 min long and had about 20 people on it which is ridiculous. I saw a buddy of my walk straight up to the bouncer with two women and had a small conversation and was let up in 5 min. I asked and the bouncer said they stayed at the hotel, not knowing that I knew the guy. Once upstairs my buddy said he wasn't staying there that the bouncer knew one of the ladies so he let them up!!! There was also a guy on line with a hooded sweater and Gucci sneakers on so in my head I knew he wouldn't get upstairs. About 15 mins after I got up I saw the guy at the bar!!! WTF if you are going to attempt to have a dress code and make people wait at least an hour to get upstairs be consistent. We got a table and ordered food and the waitress came back after taking our order and said they just closed the kitchen less than 5 min ago so they couldn't accommodate our order. The only thing that was good was the view and the cool bartender Henry that made bad ass drinks. Third times a charm and they failed. I won't be back!!!"}
{"text":"9Great view! In front of the basetball stadium. The drinks are great. Food is good pretty good also, except they under cook my chicken wings. Replaced w/lamb meatball, delicious"}
{"text":"This place provides beautiful views a thousand times over... perfect for pictures! If you're visiting and see a line under the Merchant & Trade don't worry, it goes semi-fast. However, I believe the method of getting people upstairs could be improved, as the number of groups going up at once wasn't based on an actual count and the actual indoor space doesn't provide much standing room, so capacity may become an issue as it gets warmer. Also, dress code is enforced so athletic outfits, shoes and baseball caps will more than likely get you turned around. 

Nonetheless, the ambiance was beautiful and rewarding after a long day. The tables are reserved for those that actually request them, so be sure to check with the hostess if you would like to get a table. After getting to the bar, the bartender was friendly and let me know that I would taken care of shortly. I ordered an Apple Eclipse($14) and it was good and came with a kick. But I will say, be mindful of keeping a tab open or ordering multiple drinks. Two drinks cost $30, without food.

Overall, I look forward to visiting this place again for another girls night out! Hope to see my fellow Yelp people there!"}
{"text":"Have tried to show my friends this bar several times but have been impeded by long lines. Was excited to show them to the bar this weekend when the line was short. Was rudely turned away at the door for wearing tennis shoes. I make enough to spend my money on a nice cocktail. Will never be back. Thanks for changing my mind."}
{"text":"This is one place in town that has one of the best scenery's. We have been talking about coming here since they opened and just now making our way here. Merchant and trade is an upscale restaurant and lounge with a view of Charlotte's skyline and facing the ball park stadium . We were meeting friends for dinner somewhere else so we stopped in to have a drink. The ambiance was on point. This place makes for the perfect selfies. Sorry can't tell you much about the food since we actually didn't eat dinner here. I will put merchant and trade on my list of go to places for the summer because I am the rooftop queen in the summer and spring so look forward to seeing more of myself and friends."}
