{"text":"Great place, great food, great atmosphere!! Best drinks you can find anywhere and of course the atmosphere is fun...the patio has a vacation feel all its own, plus a menu all its own!! This place is amazing, and don't listen to any negative reviews, they are just haters trying to keep people away from the busiest place around....parking can be a bit of a problem as the place is always very busy, so I would recommend reservations!! Go go go and enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"The waitress had chronic resting b*tch face. Food was cold and bland. Prices outrageous."}
{"text":"Only big complaint is the room where they seated us was COLD. Asked waitress if she could turn down Ac and answer was she couldn't. Otherwise food was very good and lots of choices.  Shrimp scAmpi was good with lots of garlic. Rolls were stale and appeared to be Acmes off the shelf.  Herb butter inedible. Clam chowder great. Prices high. Will go again but make reservations for better table."}
{"text":"Usually like coming here, the outdoor bar is a nice place for drinks.  Last Sunday when we arrived, the bartender (outside) was having fun with a few of the patrons but was using really raunchy language ~ which everyone on the patio could hear.  Then we were told that they ran out of ice.  It's a cool place but managed very poorly!"}
{"text":"I had a delicious cod dinner and excellent cocktails at the bar, on the deck, overlooking the lake at sunset, on a warm summer night. It doesn't get any better than that!"}
{"text":"Nice lake view if they would clean the windows. All I saw was bug splatter. Food was way overpriced for the quality. Nothing fresh. Calamari was bland and frankly nasty. Bread was old. Salad in a bag. Only thing that was good was the broccoli. The outside bar looks like a fun place for drinks if you can put up with a 50 year old who thinks he's 30 and can't stop checking out every lady that walks by him."}
{"text":"What a place for geriatrics and tank topped locals. Food was lousy. Frozen seafood, nothing fresh. No flavor and food was WAY overpriced. The reviews you read are from locals who wouldn't know bud light from Coors light. Oh, the warm air conditioning just added to the ambiance. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Our favorite hangout.  Walking distance to home is a big plus!  Food is wonderful. Richard does a great job as does all of his staff.  Beautiful views of the East Lake."}
{"text":"Tasteless seafood and grainy scallops. Salad was from a bag and shrimp bisque was blah"}
{"text":"There is something special about this place. I feel like I'm away on vacation when I eat here. Sit near the back and get a window view of the lake. I like the seafood in the summer; fresh walleye, crab legs, and salmon. And the pork chop or filet in the winter. I still drive by here more then I eat here. Though I wish I stopped in more often something about coming in just a few times a year gives it that relaxing vacation like feel. If you're coming in the winter call to check hours as I believe the owner shuts down for the month of February."}
{"text":"Our experience at the Tavern At Twin Lakes was probably the worse dining experience my husband and I have had in our 56 years. We were seated with the message from a sour waitress that we would have to be done in 1 1/2 hrs because the table was reserved later. After placing and receiving our wine order, we waited for 20 minutes for a waitress. When we arrived the restaurant was serving lunch. When the waitress returned it was 15 minutes til dinner so we asked to see the dinner menu. We were told ok as long as we could've done by 6 when the next party was expected. Sounded doable if we would have received menus and placed an order. But no we wait 10 more minutes and when we grabbed a waitress she said we could not get a menu til 5 which was less than 10 minutes away. Seems to me that the best way to insure the table would have been ready by 6 would have been to serve us. Not our responsibility to work the tables!  What about service?!?! Give us the menus and place our order at 5 and we'd be out by 6. We were so disgusted with this rudeness and incompetence we paid for our wine and left.  This once favorite place of ours will not see us again. And with the competition of downtown Kent I don't think they can afford to continue on the same path or they will be a bar full of drunks vs a reputable establishment."}
{"text":"We went here a few weeks ago.  To start, we loved the atmosphere! Our server was super sweet and one of the best we've had. Our food was very good. We tried the crab legs, prime rib,  seafood pasta,  calamari and mussles. We all enjoyed everything.  We will definitely be back to sit outside when it's nice out!"}
{"text":"Prices are decent. Wait staff is quick and friendly and you can't beat their specials!  Clam chowder is awesome and full of big chunks of clams!!  Will be back next weekend for their clambake!!  Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Terrible!  I have been here 2 times, wasn't impressed the first time and now will never go back again.  My party of 2 waited over an hour on the deck for our food, which was served to us cold. Chicken breast sandwich was dry and bland.  Rachel the server was good , however she made excuses for the wait and kept apologizing. The owner is a hot mess. When he came to our table to clear , my friend asked if she could talk to him. He walked away from her in mid sentence. Really!  Great view, but not worth the $$$ or aggravation."}
{"text":"There were 7 of us there on Mothers Day. The outside patio looked like a fun place to be on a warm evening, the inside isn't much to talk about.  The service was Ok; the food was Ok.  I wouldn't go there again for dinner, but would go for drinks/beer on the outside patio."}
{"text":"Wow, holy toot! This place is neat. And I'm not talking about your clothes nicely put away neat; I'm talking neat!! Any who you know the saying \" location, location, elation\" welp! That sure does apply to this place. An absolute (not the vodka) (or maybe the vodka)  (hehe) (inside joke) beautiful view of the cold lake! Grand dad service! And well priced cooly chilled beers. Enjoyed thoroughly. YELP!"}
{"text":"We stopped at twin Lakes Tavern for lunch today. Sat a dirty table for 10 minutes then waited 20 more minutes for our drinks to come. We ordered what we thought was going to be a delicious lunch. We decided to leave when the table behind us had been waiting for an hour and a half for their lunch. We thought well we'll wait and eat until the owner came out and started yelling at them. He continued to yell at them as they left the restaurant walk down the back stairs and he continue to yell at them in the parking lot. We decided to leave and snuck out like the Secret Service"}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable lunch here. The prices can be expensive here - but it is affordable if you're careful. Had a lovely crab cake aandwich. Wasn't as fried as I'm used to, for better and worse, but my goodness was the crab succulent and flavorful. Fries were unusually good - surprisingly large and perfectly crisped. Onion rings were delicious, too. Of course what really makes this place is the patio. Sitting out there with the gorgeous view of the lake, the long bar, the old-time music, it feels like a beachside vacation, not some place off 43. A must-try for my fellow Portage County residents!!!"}
{"text":"We have driven by here many times on our way to Beckwith Orchards. Decided to stop and boy is it good. Lake perch sandwiches, just perfect. A really cute plscet with a spectacular lake view. Nice end to our little road trip. Nice menu, the shrimp chowder was very good also."}
{"text":"Terrible service. A couple walked in and the bartender said do you have a reservation? They said no and they said we will just sit outside and she said to the other bartender, I love when that happens (not having to deal with more customers) the other bartender said, me too. Food wasn't good and the bartender never once asked if our food was good or if we wanted dessert. The two bartenders walked by 20 times and never asked if we wanted a refill, had to call them and ask for a beer.  First time visit, last time I will go."}
{"text":"Great soft opening!! Halibut was cooked perfectly! Great salad And the bartenders were awesome! We will definitely be back! Love the view. Best in Portage County!"}
{"text":"Food service was kinda slow & got our apps after we are dinner but was good seafood nonetheless! beautiful outdoor patio & view of Lake. Good experience! I had crab legs & clams & the shrimp cocktail. Yum!"}
{"text":"Had another great meal here last week with family. The food was delicious as usual. We had walleye with mussels as appetizer and it was great. Improvements to the salad are greatly appreciated. Good food, great atmosphere, and a beautiful view. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"We were fairly regular customers on weekends, special occasions, and for their killer clambakes in fall, until one time, the Saturday before Mother's Day, we walked out, angry and disappointed, not to mention hungry. I had called the week before, and a man I assume is the manager, Richard, grudgingly took my reservation. I'd had to wait almost 5 minutes for him to come to the phone. Why he is the only one who can take reservations,I don't know.  He had a real rude 'tude. I should have known then.   When we got to the tavern on that Saturday, it was loud and crowded. The bartenders were busy and we finally got the attention of this Richard. He gave a hurried glance at the reservation book and proclaimed there was no reservation for us. I told him I'd called the week before. He said, \"Well, your name isn't on the list!\" And walked away. So did we and we've never been back."}
{"text":"This is a great pub with great food and awesome views of the lake.  They always have great specials for dinners, appetizers and desserts.  I find the prices to be reasonable and the service to be good."}
{"text":"We just stopped in for a glass of wine and a bowl of clam chowder. Yummy! We'll be back!!! Clam bake season is coming!"}
{"text":"Internet says they are open at 11:30am Monday. They don't open Monday until 4:30. Call before coming. We drove an hour to find out they aren't open. Apparently, owner died and family is trying to keep things going."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? This place is wonderful!  I wish they had more seating. Food is excellent, price is nothing unexpected. And service is outstanding. I would recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"This restaurant sits between the east and west shore lakes in Kent, OH. The view from inside or from their patio is very nice. The have 2 bars. One inside and one outside. They offer a lunch menu until 5pm. At 5pm they switch to their dinner menu. They offer a wide variety of meat and seafood appetizers and entrees as well as salad. I posted the dinner menu.   I ordered the clam chowder which was delicious but could have been warned a bit more. For my entree I  had the shrimp and scallops over penne. It was good.  For dessert I ordered the homemade apple pie with caramel sauce was out of this world! The coffee was delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner and lunch selections. My family goes here often for special occasions. I would say it is one of the best sea food establishments in the area.  Sea Food pizza with crab is a solid bet for an appetizer. The Maryland Chicken is also fantastic. Last time I was there I had the Cajun Duck special and it was delicious. I never have enough room left for dessert, so that would be the only thing I'm not sure about. This place gets packed on the weekends around dinner time, so I suggest making a reservation."}
{"text":"I'd like to start by saying that I worked in the restaurant industry for 12 years and never complain, but we did not have a good experience and I feel like I need to write a review (this is my first Yelp review).  I cannot believe how this restaurant has earned good ratings in other reviews.  We were there this past Sunday (Father's Day) with my family of four, plus my parents, father in law, brother in law and niece - a party of 9.  We were seated indoors because it was 91 degrees outside (otherwise the patio would have been great!) and I understand that there was only one table to accommodate a party of 8 or more, but the room was so freezing we couldn't bear it.  I mean, so arctic freezing I was shivering.  They couldn't turn the wall unit ac down because it cooled the entire restaurant.  We had no other option but to go outside and sit in the heat.  Once outside, our menus were pretty much taken from our hands by a waitress who told us that we couldn't order from that menu.  I had my heart set on a few items on the menu, but had to order from a basic chicken nugget / french fries - type bar menu... and then was told that they were out of fish, onion rings, and sweet potatoes.  Grrrr.  Basic sub-par bar food was our only option.  We ordered.  The food took FOREVER.  Not sure why since they cook the patio food outside on a grill and there were only 4 other people out there.   We NEVER got waters.  We NEVER got napkins.  The food was brought out and my \"crispy chicken sandwich\" was over-fried nuggets on a bun.  Everyone else's food was over-fried and disgusting.  I was embarrassed because we invited everyone here for father's day and it was nothing but stressful and a joke.  This place has so much potential but it completely lacks in service and quality.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Great seating area overlooking the lake. Polite, friendly wait staff. Excellent seafood selection. Dinner entrees started at $12 for beer battered fish sandwich up to $40 for surf(half lobster) and turf(8 oz. strip steak) meal. I opted for the calamari appetizer which was fresh tasting and a perfectly cooked medium rare Strip Steak. Oh, and I can't leave out the yummy Bloody Marys"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to really love this place but the last 3 times we've been there we've noticed a significant change. I tried to give it a chance (that's why I went back for the third time) but the quality has really gone down. My favorite dish were the clam strips and I ordered them every time. Each time I ordered them recently they were clam crumbs. Not what I used to get at all. We used to get a nice basket of bread now we get dry tasteless rolls and the owner seemed to be more worried about having a good time with the guests vs. making sure the guests were having a good time and an enjoyable experience. If I do go back it will be for the professional and friendly staff who seemed to apologize and know exactly what we were experiencing."}
{"text":"I think if I had to do it all over again I'd skip eating inside and eat at their bar outside over looking the water. The different menu they use outside  is a little more my style. Less fancy, cheaper prices, and the view is awesome. Getting drinks there was great.   However-  Inside- the apps were all great. And the fried fish sandwich and fish and chips were tasty. For what you pay for some of the grilled fish meals, none of those dishes seemed out of this world, or worth the price. I know seafood is expensive, I get it, but just didn't do it for me.   Server was awesome but the owner seemed annoyed that we combined two tables together. The inside is a little dated, but fine.  They were also out of scallops, and that was one of the main reasons my dad wanted to go to a seafood joint."}
{"text":"Great patio with a great view! Anything I've ever had here has been good! I always look forward to coming!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent valentines dinner here last night. I had some awesome Halibut and my Girl had an excellent shrimp and scampi pasta. Her pasta was in a white sauce that was excellent, not the traditional overpowering alfredo but light and tasty.  Service was excellent, and the food was excellent. The tables overlooking the lake are a nice touch as well. I will for sure go again."}
{"text":"Had lunch at my fav little hang out right around the corner of my house. Such a quaint, relaxing place to chill and have a cocktail or glass of wine after unpacking from our trip. This place has decent food. The options are limited but the view and atmosphere makes up for it."}
{"text":"Great food and beer. Try the cod sandwhich  with onion rings. Plays nice variety of music in bar outside by lake also."}
{"text":"First time going here,Hubby got steak, I got shrimp scampi, food was good, nothing spectacular but nothing to complain about.  Atmosphere was laid back, service was fast, nice and friendly.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Location, location, location! The Tavern overlooks picturesque East Twin Lake on State Route 43, located between Kent and Streetsboro. Whether you're on the patio or seated at the lakeside window, the view can't be beat and is worth the visit alone.  The grounds of the restaurant, as well as the quirky, fun decor inside, set the mood and take me back to Key West. The patio is landscaped beautifully with plants, boulders and water elements that belie route 43's presence on the other side of the privacy fence.   The food has always been very good, but was taken up a notch since the Tavern's reopening. The dinner salad is fresh with lots of greens and served with good bread. On my last 2 visits, I've had the strip steak - perfectly medium rare, and the crab stuffed lobster tail - satisfyingly loaded. The sides, baked potato, pasta, and asparagus, were also good. On both occasions, the food came out quickly and was timed very well with no awkward gaps in service.   Even though it was VERY busy both times, the service was top notch. The waitresses hustle and are a blur of activity. The beer selection has also improved since the reopening and the bartenders make sure you aren't thirsty. A lot of locals eat and drink here so there's a friendly, casual vibe. If you want stuffy formal service, go to Cleveland. You're at the lake. Have fun!"}
{"text":"Sat out on the back patio at the bar. Great view looking out at the water. Bartender was very friendly and struck up conversation. Great service and the lobster wrap was delicious. Will come back!"}
{"text":"The worst dining experience in all my life. The owner is very rude, psyco  coke head. I will never eat here again. Came to our table and yelled at us about the mud on our shoes. Told us their is a hose out back. And it's pouring rain outside. Dumb ass"}
{"text":"Went there with friends from California.  Pleasant drive from Hudson on Ravenna Rd.  The restaurant exterior shows its age but the setting beside the eastern Twin lake is wonderful.  We wanted a place to relax for lunch.  A window table inside the Tavern on a lazy, sunny summer day produced the desired atmosphere.  It was very relaxing and pleasant.  Unfortunately, can't say the same for the food.  Three of us had the soups - I had the clam chowder which was pretty bland while the two others had the lemon grass broth which was pricey at $5.95.  The fourth had a shrimp cocktail with, I believe, six large shrimp.  Very appetizing and tasty.   She also had the crab cake which also was large and plump with crab meat.    However, the rest of us had the shrimp salad.  The salad consisted of 3 small-medium shrimp that were sliced in half to make it appear that we were getting six shrimp.  Two grape tomatoes, two cucumber slices, half a hard boiled egg on a bed of lettuce completed the salad.   Priced at one dollar more than the shrimp cocktail, the salads' pricing seemed to be at odds with the shrimp cocktail and the other items on the menu.    We really liked the atmosphere and I think our food selection suffered from inexperience.  So we will give the restaurant another try."}
{"text":"My wife and I recommend this place!  The filet is simply perfect.  This place truly knows how to make a flavorful, perfectly prepared steak.  Their portion sizes are perfect.  Not too much not too little....imagine, you can actually have dessert and have a full meal and leave satisfied.  The service can be on the slow side, but I will take that all day long for good food.  I will caution anyone looking for ambiance....not really going to get it here.  It is a neat, very casual place with a smaller, tailored menu with great featured items.  The outdoor area is such a bonus on warm days.  Although, the outdoor menu is different, it is just as good..  I call this place a tucked away secret.  You would never expect to get such good food from the looks of it....you will be pleasantly surprised!  I have brought several business associates, friends, and family and I can honestly say, we have never had a bad experience and everyone says the same thing....never thought by the look of it the food would have been that good."}
