{"text":"The food was really good and cheaply priced too. For about 5 dollars I got a grilled chicken with rice noodle soup, which was perfect for a cold winter day. The mango salad was delicious but the chicken skewers could have been a little less fatty.   As the previous reviewer says, the menu is very extensive and should have something for every palate, even for the pickiest eater. My 4 year old is a very fussy eater and she really enjoyed some of my soup and some chicken fried rice, which by the way was nowhere near as greasy as the rice dishes at other establishments.  I will go back to try some of their other dishes. But beware - the portions are rather large and if you are not a bottomless pit or are not so hungry, you likely will be taking some of  your food to go.  The servers were very nice as well. In sum, good food, great prices, and good service makes this place one that I will go back to numerous times."}
{"text":"I had a small bowl of Pho here. It's actually quite filling, even without drinking the soup. I've generally liked all places that prepare Pho and it all tastes the same to me for the most part, so I can't say whether the quality was above, below, or at average. Good stuff, and served quickly. $5.50 for a bowl makes it a cheap and delicious lunch ($6.50 for a large).   I had a mango fruit shake here too. Very nicely done. I find most viet restaurants that I go to where I order a mango fruit smoothie or equivalent do it well. This place is no exception.   The only thing I didn't really like, that brings it down to 3 stars, is the service. It's not abysmal, but it wasn't friendly either. Not that the restaurant was trying to be perceived as a high-service establishment, but even so, I would have liked to have seen friendlier service.  Service was fast though, I'll give it that. But then again, I went when there were only two other tables being attended to (plus me). It was fairly dead at around 5:45pm.   If I'm in the area though, and craving some Pho, I would come back. I might even try their thai dishes next time."}
{"text":"2 stars because I can't figure out if the place is not good or just not my type of Thai/Malay. I ordered my absolute favorite Laksa. It was only $6! When it arrived, I had mix feelings with the way it looks.  The color was funky. It reminded me of the peach bridesmaid dress I am going to wear later this year. (see Laksa photo)  I am not a Laksa expert but have had my fair share, so safe to say I know what a bowl of Laksa should look like.   Once I moved beyond the appearance, I figured perhaps the funky colour will make it stand out like no other.  The taste also gave me mix feelings. It was a tad sweeter and coconutty than usual, and gave me a funky vibe.  It was one of those moment where you expected to taste something, but it completely threw you off.  Another yelper also commented that their Pho was also a bit funky. Good to know I am not alone.  It's been a funky experience and not sure if I would step in here again."}
{"text":"ok so I came here twice.  first time I loved it: cheap prices, yummy food and quite a few veg options. so for $8 I had a dinner (spring rolls with noodles) and mango smoothie.  but 2nd visit ruined my whole positive impression. we came here after a late party. so arrived around 4am. the place was half full. we were seated and after we spent few minutes choosing dishes and we announced what we want - the waiters told us that all the veg menu is not available because the chef left for the night and they have only few dishes (all with meat) left.   ok I understand that it might be an issue but can't there be a note on the entrance or couldn't they inform us before we spent 15min choosing dishes and waiting for them  to place the order??? honestly, not impressed.  there are tons of other places that you can go in the mid of the night for late night snack and this one is not recommended."}
{"text":"Golden pineapple on Spadina is one of the few restaurants in addition to Swatow (an awesome Chinese restaurant) that I often go to for a small meal. I always go there for their Satay skewers. For $4 you get 3 skewers that are pretty decently sized and for a petite person like me, it surely fills me up. So if you are a tourist in Toronto and are looking for an appetizer in a cheap restaurant, Golden Pineapple is the place to go. Their other entrees are also reasonably priced and the food is safe here."}
{"text":"A very solid 3 stars for this new addition to Chinatown. I guess it helps to stand out from the usual look and feel of a Chinatown establishment which is what attracted me to check this place out. It's new, spacey and clean inside but they were playing some very loud dance type music and along with the holiday decorations it was a little too much for the senses on first arrival.   The menu was one of the largest I have seen, they must have had close to or over 100 items which resulted in us taking 15 or so minutes to decide on a appetizer, drink and main dish. Each time we would settle on something, another would pop up as appealing.   We ordered a tom yum soup but with chicken instead of the usual shrimp, and it did pretty well with me actually. I got a vermicelli chicken dish which sadly was just fine but nothing amazing. Kept wondering \"what if\" I had ordered one of my many other options on the menu.   There's certainly a lot of interesting sounding dishes and beverage options that will bring me here another day to explore and I'm confident a 4 star rating is possible here.   Service whilst friendly to an extent could have been faster and the prices were cheap but I'm pretty sure I could get a better deal at other Chinatown restaurants."}
{"text":"I took my mom here for lunch while we were walking through the neighbourhood.  We found the place to be very clean and spacious.  I ordered a delicious coconut water drink with fresh young coconut pieces, very refreshing.  For lunch, I ordered a crispy spring roll for each of us, it was pretty good.  My mom had a shrimp and chicken dish which she really enjoyed and I ordered a beef and noodle dish, which was also pretty tasty.  The menu is quite extensive and everything honestly looked good and their prices are reasonable.  While we enjoyed the food the service was slow given that there were 20 people in the restaurant at most.  The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I had the pho, it was at best mediocre.  There was something funky about it, and it didn't taste authentic.  The place is kind of run down, but you get what you pay for.  It think it was $7 for pho, which is pretty good.  Would I go again? Nope, not worth it even if it is cheap."}
