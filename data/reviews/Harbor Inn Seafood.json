{"text":"In short, service was excellent. Chowder was good not great. I had the flounder and it was fresh and good. Portions were big, fries crisp and Cole slaw so so. I don't do hushpuppies but my wife said that they may be the best she ever had. So I tried one, ended up eating the 3 she left me. Dessert case looked amazing but who has room with portions like this. Wife had the tuna salad and enjoyed it. So, after all that food with 2 iced teas the bill was under 20 bucks. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"First time here, hubby and I had the broiled cod and grouper.Came with salad ,sweet potato and hush puppies. Good for a fish camp type of place. Had the delicious chocolate cake for desert. price was good. Definitely will be back again to try the shrimp."}
{"text":"Now if your a lover of fresh and flavorful seafood this is the place all their dishes are great trust me iv had them all I believe but my favorite is the whole broiled flounder OMG..the best iv ever had flavor portions and great service friendly staff what else could you ask for live this place"}
{"text":"Delicious fried scallops & oysters and a great value for the money.  They cook seafood the way it is supposed to be cooked!"}
{"text":"I have eaten there my reason for the 5 stars is because the first time I eat there I ordered the whole catfish, the fish was too gimme for me an management had no problem taking it back and replaced it with my second choice.  The food is good I can honestly say I enjoyed the food and the staff.  And I must say the price's are very reasonable ."}
{"text":"The crab legs were good, but I felt like I was in a cafeteria. The service was horrible. I didn't get my salad because they were out of lettuce.  I won't go back , but it looks like they have people who love it. I guess if I pay a fine dining price, I want a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Broiled shrimp, scallops, and flounder with salad and bread for both of us. $45. Jaye was a great waitress. Fast service."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is pretty casual but it's always quiet and there's good food, big portions and not expensive, staff is so nice every time."}
{"text":"Worse swordfish I've ever had!  Hush puppies were the best part of my dinner. Fried mushrooms were also very good.... I recommend if you come here go to take out window , the smell of the ocean will meet you at the door"}
{"text":"Great seafood! Hot, fresh and tasty. Lightly battered with many options to choose from. And you can't beat the price!   Servers are very friendly, patient and helpful.   Ask for hush puppies because they aren't always served, which is odd. But ask for the cinnamon butter so you can experience a mouth orgasm.   The setting is typical for a seafood place. Nothing special here but it's clean. That's extremely important.   Jumbo shrimp are really jumbo!  Fish is great!  Oysters are small but good.   I didn't care for the stuffed crab or clam but others did."}
{"text":"As a Midwest girl, who loves seafood, I found this place to be very good.  The hostess was great and our waitress Joy, was the best.  We orderetd our food, one from the broiled, one from the fried and the hubby had to have crab legs.  The food was served quickly and was hot.  We were all stuffed beyond measure when we were done. Most all of the food was delicious.  I didn't care much for the coleslaw, it wasn't bad, just not very flavorful.  I recommend trying the salt and pepper seasoning on your fried seafood, delicious.    We will definitely go again, the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I had went there on the advice of my niece. So glad that I did! They have great fried foods seafood and is on the same line as a \"fish camp\" type of food! I have been looking for a alternative to having to go to Captain D's. It is right in the area and have a great take out menu also. More than just fried seafood, I get the take out fish platter and they give generous portions, great food at a great price. Also have a broiled menu for ppl with diet plans and have a full menu of different types of foods. I am a fan. My son is Autistic and a picky eater he loved it and he was FULL! Anyone out their with a teenage boy knows what I mean! Great place!"}
{"text":"Food good for the price. Do not get stuffed crab, all bread crumbs and no crab meat. DO GET the fried oysters! Maybe the best I've had. The desserts look awesome. We are sad that  all the cakes were gone when we came back tonite for carry out ."}
{"text":"Staff seems disinterested in being there. Had mixed seafood platter-tasted like they just bought some stuff from Sysco and threw it in the fryer. Really bland, not much texture. It's a big venue, but there were few customers-that should have been a tip off."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location many times over the years and may have only had one mildly bad experience, which was immediately resolved by management, and they will bend over backwards to ensure their patrons are happy. No fish substitutions here; you get the fish you order: red snapper is red snapper and cod is cod. This is a no-frills family restaurant. No alcohol served here, so no pre-meal beer to enjoy. Side-salads are simple. Complimentary hush puppies are provided before your meal, and with most meals, so if you love hush puppies, you won't be disappointed. Harbor Inn is my first choice for good seafood in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"Wasn't good wasn't bad flounder was kinda mushy. Stuffing was bland. Service is great hush puppies are nice and salad was great"}
{"text":"server was nice, grilled salmon (slightly overcooked) shrimp was good. Baked sweet potato was too mushy/almost watery. very plain iceberg salad, got me sick to my tummy."}
{"text":"Everything was hot, fried perfectly, and delicious!! You don't have to break your pockets for great seafood!!! Don't be fooled by the appearance of the building"}
{"text":"Scallop dinner was delicious (a tad bit salty) : ) We also tried they everyday special which is fried flounder, baby shrimp and deviled crab. Traditional fish camp food, prepare for fried glory.  I am definitely thinking I will go with broiled as I felt a bit overwhelmed with all the fried foods. I must say their tartar was perfect as well as delicious hush puppies.  P.S: I did not try and cake (I was stuffed!) but man oh man the pieces had to be at least 8 inches tall....."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hype around this place is about.  After reading all the reviews I went to Harbor Inn yesterday for take out. I got fried flounder, cocktail shrimp, fried shrimp, crab cakes , carrot cake and red velvet cake. The two stars are for the cake. I'm so disappointed. I trusted you Yelp why have you forsaken me?"}
{"text":"Not being an avid seafood fan...it's gonna be hard to get me excited enough for four or more stars, but this place is okay for fish I suppose.  HUGE portions, decently priced and very busy!  I had fried shrimp, crab cake and flounder (I think). I ate th shrimp and crab cake and passed off the fish, just not being a fan, and not having room after eating lots of yummy hushpuppies...not the best I've ever had, but very good!  Great for a group, plenty of room and our waitress was super friendly and made suggestions from the specials and for the seniors in our group to save a few $.  If you are looking for seafood locally, give it a try..."}
{"text":"New to the area and looking for seafood.  Saw the sign and did a quick Yelp check.  It fit the bill perfectly!  I had fried shrimp and cod combo my husband had the grilled plater both were very good.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place was ok. I've had better in Charlotte. I've seen this place before and I wanted to try it and I was in the area so I decided to stop. I had the whiting platter with baked sweet potato and a side of fries. I didn't like the kind of fries that they serve, I love French fries especially the crinkle cut but there is one particular kind of FF's that I don't like and they just so happen to serve them. Another thing I didn't like was that the fish still had the skin on  it, not too much of a big deal cause I ate it but I prefer my fish without it. I do like the face that they give u the option of a regular baked potato or sweet potato.  My server was very nice but she was running around like she had a lot of tables and that place wasn't that busy considering it was lunch time. She forgot my straws for my drinks and my extra napkins until I was able to get her attention again. Other than that this place was look. Would I come back? Maybe but there are some other nice restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for business and tried out the Harbor Inn based on good reviews on Yelp and my craving for seafood. I tried the fried (as in deep) seafood platter and was quickly won over by the flavor. The platter included fish, crab, shrimp, clam, scallops and fries.  Calorie counters should probably stay away from this place. You could have gained a pound or two just by being exposed to the aroma of my meal. My only let down was that there was no bar where solo diners can have a beer and watch tv while eating, so I took my meal back to the hotel. I will definitely go back and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Normally I avoid 'fish camps' but I desperately wanted some seafood  and I didn't want to drive far to get it.  I didn't expect much but it was actually very tasty!  I had the catfish fillet, crab cakes, hush puppies and a baked sweet potato....yummy:-).  The fish was nicely battered and seasoned, I was told the crab cakes are made in house, and were seasoned with scallions, red and green peppers and deep fried...not bad, not bad at all...very good hush puppies and baked sweet potato. They have a walk up window to order takeout and the food was served up fast and hot."}
{"text":"We love this place, so it's difficult to be unbiased about my review. First, there's no illusion here, this is, as the red necks say, a fish camp, so don't be surprised when your flatware arrives in a plastic bag. The menu has its share of deeply fried fish fare and your side choices include the also fried, french fries and hush puppies. However, once you make your way past the fried with fried dishes, there is a great broiled section, that offers a variety of fish and shellfish broiled to perfection with some nice seasoning. Although your choice of non-fried sides is limited, you can find a moderately healthy meal here. I always get the broiled scallops and although one of the more expensive items on the menu, it is delicious, filling, and not \"break the bank\" expensive. But before you get too full, remember to leave room for the Crazy Cake! you cannot leave without picking up a slice, even if it is to take home. We are talking about a rainbow sprinkle topped cake made up of individual layers of chocolate, red velvet, carrot, and strawberry jam topped vanilla cake - that's right 4 layers, each with their complementary frostings holiding it together.   The kitsch of this place is everywhere, from the porthole shaped windows, to the nets and seashells hanging up on the dining floor. The waitstaff is always friendly, your glass is always full and the restaurant just has a sort of feel good quality about it that is difficult to explain."}
{"text":"Ok, not a big fan of \"fried seafood\", but if I was I would say this place is pretty good. I did order some salt n pepper fried Alaskan Whitefish (asked to have it salt n pepper as it wasn't listed as an option like the other items). That wasn't a problem. Good service, the place was very clean compared to other \"fish camp style places\" and condiment squeeze bottles were not greasy or caked with dried tarter sauce. It was a good place and I would go back. The only regret is they don't have Lobster or shrimp scampi on the menu, but other than that a winner with excellent prices. Very reasonable."}
{"text":"Wow! Fresh seafood has been found in Charlotte NC! I am a Miami boy, so I know fresh, and this was fresh. The Inn was busy, it was right after Sunday church wen we arrived, but we were seated immediately. The server was very nice, and attentive to our needs, and was quick to refill our drinks without being asked. Always a plus.  The Sunday special is fried baby shrimp for $7, and my Daughter Alex ordered hers with a baked potato and cole slaw. She doesn't eat any seafood except shrimp, and they have to be tail free, so this fit her requirements. Alina ordered the everyday special, which was $10. The special includes flounder fillet, deviled crab and baby shrimp, a side and cole slaw. I ordered the salt & pepper catfish fillet, with fries and cole slaw. My girls don't eat cole slaw, so Daddy gets all 3. The dishes were served quickly, and we were blown away at how much food there was. Being Sunday, these were not lunch sized portions, you can only order those Tue-Sat. But even for a dinner portion, they were very generous.   Everything was very tasty, at least half of everything came home with us (except the cole slaw, which I finished). The people kept pouring in while we were there, and the staff managed to handle things without an issue. We didn't order dessert, but the cakes in the display case in front of the restaurant looked decadent. Maybe next time. Less than $40 for lunch for 3, with a ton of leftovers. Oh, and a Diet Coke in a to go cup. Well worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Harbor Inn is a solid seafood restaurant.  It's one of the places that I occasionally visit since moving to the area.  Never had any issues with the staff as they are always very friendly and courteous.  The main reason to come here though is for the fried food.  The portions are very large, rarely am I able to actually finish the entire meal.  The price is very reasonable for what you get as well.  When going all out fried I usually go for the Fried Seafood Platter which gets you flounder fillet, jumbo shrimp, deviled crap, baby shrimp, a stuffed clam, and fried oysters for only around $13.  It also comes with hush puppies and a side.  So it's quite a bit of food.  Great tasting food at that.  Lately however, I've been trying out the broiled menu and while it's much better for you, it's just not as tasty as the fried stuff.  So if you're worried about your calories then you should probably stay away for now.  I limit my trips to Harbor Inn for those occasions where I can afford to eat all the fried stuff because no way will I sit back and inhale the pleasant fumes of fried seafood and not take part in the fun.  Good food, great price, great service. Recommended."}
{"text":"My family love Harbor Inn and we visit here often.  In Feburary I came here with my husband and ordered a side of crab cake as an appetizer and it was fantastic. Twice after that I order the crab platter and it is more filler with a little bit of crab meat that you can not see or even taste. It reminds me of their devil crab. I am out of $45 cause my daughter and I tried it twice. Never again will I order the crab cake. Everything else their is ok."}
{"text":"Terrible service and mediocre food. Fried pickles were way too salty, and the stuffed crab and stuffed clam weren't good. First and last time going there."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the hush puppies and our waitress was good about refilling drinks. The food flavor could have been better and the portion sizes larger for what you're paying for. It was our first and last time here. We will be at captain steves. This place is decent for a quick craving of seafood.  Our waitress did spill a sauce bottle on my boyfriend and did not bother to apologize, but another waitress nearby complimented him on his hair. We would have liked to have a different waitress."}
{"text":"I'm one sucker for fried seafood and this place was heaven to me. All the waitresses were clean and helpful, my own waitress, Joy was delightful and a pleasure to talk to. The tables and floors were spotless and I saw waitstaff ensuring that the floors and tables were clean. The food was delicious and the menu was easy to read and very informational. This now my go to for fried seafood!"}
{"text":"This place used to be our family favorite seafood place but lately has fallen off a bit..after not eating here for over a year I decided to order some take out ...Get home and my fish is undone in the inside..fish was just falling apart and had a bad taste to it. I called them and was told could replace my meal if I make it back before close. But was already a 15 min drive so she took my name down for when I return. After spending $15+ for a box of food it should be cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"Visited NC for two weeks and I ate here pretty much every other day! That Salt & Pepper catfish and hush puppies were so darn good! The pricing is reasonable. Can't wait to get back to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Your basic Carolinas fish camp. Nothing too surprising but with plenty of daily specials.  As ever, you can go broiled or fried but if you are jonesing for real fish camp, you'll go fried. Their fish fry isn't too heavy or greasy, good portion. Polite, attentive service and VERY clean.  Unlike a lot of other fish camp joints, they do have a beer/wine license so you can enjoy a bottle of brew while you get your fish camp on. Also plenty of seating for big parties and no problem handling them."}
{"text":"We are seafood lovers! Our whole family. Unfortunately there are just not enough seafood restaurants in Charlotte. Harbor Inn is great for the price. It is what it is-- food is as described - no surprise.   Family friendly for sure. We looked over the menu - saw the price and knew exactly what to expect.   Food was good."}
{"text":"Had a good meal at Harbor Inn Seafood. Waitress was very good also, which always makes the meal better"}
{"text":"Me my grandmother and a close friend of mine eat here often no matter what day or what time the food is always fresh and hot they give you a lot of food for the price service is average but the restaurant is a traditional seafood place and always clean I wish there were more locations here In Charlotte"}
{"text":"My experience today for dinner was horrible. I've been coming here frequently for the past couple of months getting the tilapia fillet sandwich with hush puppies and fries. I was expecting to enjoy dinner with my family but nope! Waited in the lobby for a seat for about 5 minutes, just to be seated and wait another 20 minutes. Got the attention of someone who works there to see if we were going to be served or not, then the server decides to turn around and ask what we would like to drink. This took another 5 minutes just to make 1 sweet tea and 2 sprites. Im a server as well and I know how hard it is to keep up with multiple tables but when you are just walking around slowly with nothing in your hand, it gives off the impression that you dont care about your tables. We asked for silverware and did not get any until we had to ask the server again once our food came out. They were clearly understaffed but I did not expect to be this disappointed. The food was another issue. I asked for a salt and peppered sandwich but all i tasted was pepper. I wrote a nice little list of what was disappointing on the back of the ticket, so hopefully the server will take that into consideration. I will just stick to coming here during the day time. The service is usually great and the food is as well."}
{"text":"If u want good food and great price stop here! Their crab corn chowder is heaven on earth!!!"}
{"text":"Just ate here and had literally the fastest service I have had in quite some time. Food was delicious and priced fairly. I will return for sure."}
{"text":"Best Seafood in town! They have a great selection of food. I love that they have a beer and wine. We had excellent service! Defiantly a place you should stop by."}
{"text":"Stick with the seafood. Tried the sirloin on waitress recommendation. Very disappointed..good flavor but way too much fat"}
{"text":"Of all the casual seafood restaurants in the Charlotte area , this is the absolute best . I eat here every chance I get and even drive across town when I am craving their baby flounder. Every time I am there the food is hot , fresh and delicious . They have a wide variety of fried and broiled seafood . I was so happy when I saw my favorite , Oysters Rockefeller on the new menu . The house made ranch is amazing , you can even buy to go . The service is great . They all make you feel like part of the family . I highly recommend making this your go to seafood restaurant ."}
{"text":"If you are part of Charlotte's largest religious denomination then you need to be aware of Harbor Inn Seafood.  As Roman Catholics celebrate lent, meatless Fridays open up the opportunities for Friday fish fries.  I have been looking for a large portioned and aggressively priced provider of scrumptious fish.  I tried other places and service left much to be desired, but Harbor Inn was flawless.  I called in an order and they said ten minutes, I got there nine minutes later and I waited one minute and my food was ready.  This compares favorably to the hour and a half I spent elsewhere waiting ten minutes.  The flavor - perfect.  The food is greasy, but it is minimally greasy to accomplish that perfect flavor profile without making you feel weighted down.  The portions - massive.  I got the Friday special and for $7 I was stuffed to the gills.  A healthy portion of fish, an abundance of shrimp (I almost couldn't finish it all), along with about ten hush puppies.  The only thing I would want more of is the fish, I would gladly trade some shrimp and sides to get another filet in there.  The sauces - spot on.  The cocktail sauce is just the right amount of kick to make you take notice.  The tartar sauce is rich and mild and goes well with everything.  They give you butter for the puppies if you are so inclined.  I will be here every Friday until Lent ends, and then I will probably just keep coming back.  The largest negative is the divided highway, this far East W. T. Harris is a pain to turn around on."}
{"text":"Food was great & service wasn't bad .. atmosphere was nice !! First good crab legs we've had since bing in the Carolinas ! A little sad when I got home and realized I knew I was missing something on my plate ! & I didn't get all of my food . As we were leaving we went to the restroom .. & if I had went in that bathroom before we ate, we would have left . That bathroom was disgusting ! & I can't imagine what the kitchen looks like . Not to mention, we witnessed two employees leave the restroom without washing their hands ! Super disgusted walking out & wish I would have seen the restroom beforehand . Sad cause food was good, but probably wouldn't be back .."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars. If you like Southern fried seafood, broiled seafood, or steaks, this place will do in a pinch. We live about two miles away, so we get here a few times a year for fish and seafood.  We kicked off our meal with an order of fried pickles. Pinky's Westside Grill makes them a little better, but these were lightly breaded, fried to a golden, crispy brown, and served hot, with a creamy dill dressing: They're addictive fare for sure!   I'm partial to broiled fare, but my wife and kids like fried shrimp. Tonight, my wife and I had their broiled special, which is salmon strips, jumbo shrimp, hush puppies, sweet potato (you can choose fries or baked), and salad or slaw. The salad was nothing special, just iceberg, shredded carrots, cucumber chips, and a couple of grape tomatoes. The sweet potato was a little over-baked, but tasted fine. The hush pupples were tasty. The salmon was seasoned lightly and broiled in a little butter, I believe. The same can be said for the shrimp. They were very tasty.  One of my sons had lobster bisque, and the other one had fried shrimp. They were both stuffed when they left.  This is a little more upscale than the traditional Carolina fish camp. It isn't quite as compelling as the Mayflower near Concord Mills, and it's not quite the same as going to the coast, but if you're in the area and hungry for fish and seafood, it's definitely worth the visit. Prices are reasonable, service is adequate, and they're friendly and flexible."}
{"text":"Usually good, not great, chain seafood. I tried the shrimp tacos today. Seemed like what someone who had heard of but never seen a taco might throw together to try. It was a pile of shrimp on a soft taco round with a small amount of something someone who had heard of pico de gallo but had never seen or tasted it would throw.... You get the gist. Terrible. No way will I try the fish tacos."}
{"text":"I only got carry out.  The prices, especially for lunch were pretty good. The food was very greasy and ultimately gave me a stomachache.  I would probably not go back.  A lot of fried food, so if you enjoy that, it's good for you. Service was good."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Love the seafood selection and child friendly atmosphere. The homemade crab cakes are my favorite.  And I love variety  of beers:"}
{"text":"Food was OKAY! Literally just okay, and maybe even a little disappointing considering the other reviews I had higher expectations. Service was okay, our server was a little uninformed, and food took awhile to come out."}
{"text":"Great place to get good sized portions, fresh and hot seafood platters. They also have steak and chicken. Service was very good and the staff is very friendly. Inside and outside dining as well as take out !  Prices are more than fair for the portions of food. Can't wait to take friends and family."}
{"text":"All of the workers are very nice and kind. The food is absolutely amazing . The cake is worth it and delicious !"}
{"text":"Wow! My meal tonight was near perfection. i ordered the Fried seafood platter. It came with baby shrimp, jumbo shrimp, flounder, stuffed clam, deviled crab, and oysters... hey I was hungry lol.   Jumbo shrimp: They were big and juicy. They were not fried too hard and had a light coating. Very delicious.  Baby shrimp: They were pretty tasty. Not stringy at all. Did not leave a greasy taste in my mouth.  Flounder: It was decent. I thought it was a bit dry. This was remedied with tartar sauce, but definitely not the favorite part of my meal.   Stuffed Clam: The stuffed clam tasted great. I don't know if many people would like it, but I was a big fan.   Deviled crab: Cooked very well. It was not greasy or overly \"crabby\" in taste.   Oysters: They were my favorite part of the meal. I love that distinct taste and texture from deep fried oysters.   Although the food was great, I enjoyed the service as well. Staff was attentive, kind, and efficient. I felt as if they appreciated my business.   I know Harbor Inn, like any place, has it's good days and bad days. Today was definitely a good day. Today's meal is the type of meal that can turn a stranger into a fan. Keep up the excellent work!"}
{"text":"After a not so pleasant experience during Queen Feast Resturante Week. I finally had a chance to come back.  This is how it usually is  very nice friendly atmosphere. My service is prompt and my food was hot . my waitress was friendly and always keep my cup full. This is how I remember all the rest of my visits. Thank you to the Manager for allowing me to have another experience.."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for seafood that tastes great and won't break the bank. All of their wait staff is super friendly and go above and beyond. The portions are enough for 2 and the cakes....OMG!!! The red velvet is heaven. I also love the corn, crab chowder which I believe is seasonal. The clam chowder is OK but not as good and the ranch dressing is made in house. It beats Hidden Valley hands down."}
{"text":"Food was sub par. Absolutely terrible customer service. Hostess didn't even greet us with a \"hey how are you\" just smirked and sat us down. It was our first time there so we had no idea you had to pay up front so we sat their waiting for a check for a good 10 minutes because our server didn't even hand us a bill or tell us to have a good night. So we asked her if we paid at the table and she said \"no up front\". Again, didn't even tell us to have a good day or anything and clearly if we are asking where we pay we aren't sure what to do so she could have at least told us we needed a bill to give the front counter because when we walked up there the cashier was asking for our check. Just not friendly at all."}
{"text":"This place has really improved over the last few years, and it's a staple with the folks at the neighboring offices.  I believe they brought in new management a few years ago and it's made a WORLD of difference in both service and quality of food.  Unfortunately I'm a fan of fried (yah, I know) popcorn shrimp and Alaskan whitefish, and they prepare both beautifully here, in traditional \"fish camp\" style.  They really shine at lunch time, where daily specials are around FIVE BUCKS and you get dinner-size portions!  They do have broiled options, but those aren't available as lunch specials (however they're still priced reasonably).  One thing I like about them is that they're flexible.  This means that you don't HAVE to get fries with your meal; you can opt for a baked potato if you prefer and they don't say anything or get confused as some places do.  Or you can get double fries/no hush puppies...whatever works for YOU, not them.  I think one of their star options is the \"family pack\" they offer.  This has got to be one of THE best deals in town, especially when trying to feed a family at dinner.  You get a TON of food for $27 & change (including tax!).   For under thirty dollars you get your choice of TWO seafood options (ie two lbs of baby shrimp and eight pieces of flounder), a very large box of hush puppies, and a very large box of fries or four baked potatoes.  You also get a TUB each of cocktail sauce, tarter sauce and cole slaw.  Plenty of food for a family of 2-4.  OH - you also get a half gallon of tea.  Service here is always speedy and friendly as well, and that has a lot to do w/the change in management I believe.  I worked in the neighboring office for many years & for a while a few years ago we actually boycotted them for quite some time BECAUSE of their service.  But now they're wonderful!  Orders are always correct and on time (especially important when time is of the essence), and the employees are always super friendly and accommodating, and seem genuinely interested in making sure your experience is the best it can be.  Harbor Inn - a great option for traditional seafood in the University City area."}
{"text":"Best hush puppies! I've been having harbor inn for many many years. One of the first restaurants I've had in Charlotte. The portions are very generous, everything comes with a side. The steamed vegetable, baked potato, cole slaw, is all great. Pickup experience is always on point."}
