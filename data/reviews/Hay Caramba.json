{"text":"Great food, great service and friendly staff. Just found a new go-to place when we're craving authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked through the door of Hay Caramba I was all ready for a positive experience. The place screams Mexico, with great, vibrant colours and decorations, and some great music playing for atmosphere. 
There are no written instructions as to what to do when you get inside (ie: no sign saying \"wait to be seated\" or \"seat yourself\"), but the staff keep an eye out, and nobody stood in the doorway for more than a few seconds. 
I was ordering takeout, so I headed straight for the bar, where I was greeted quickly and pleasantly, and given a menu to order from. I put in my order, asked how long it would take to be ready, and waited. My food was packed and ready to go just when they said it would be, and I was on my way in no time. 
Where the staff and atmosphere excelled, I felt the food fell short. When I got to my destination, I opened everything up, and right off the bat noticed I was missing the rice and beans that were supposed to be included as side dishes (the menu was very clear that all taco entrees included rice and beans as sides). The sides would have really rounded out the meal. 
I ordered the fish tacos, and in my opinion they were just okay. Taste-wise, the sauce and toppings were very good, but the fish was very hard to find (it seemed to be chopped up into smaller pieces), and of what was there, some of it was hard and chewy, leaving me with the feeling that it wasn't so fresh. There were 5 of the tacos, but they lacked substance, and so afterward I was left feeling unsatisfied. 
I think I'll try some of the other Mexican restaurants in the area before going back here again."}
{"text":"My friend and I tried out this restaurant today for the first time and it was amazing! Great drinks, delicious food, friendly service. Such a vibrant and fun atmosphere. Will definitely be back!! :)"}
{"text":"Have been to the restaurant a few times!! Both the soups are amazing! Nachos are really good and the tacos are really good as well! Full of flavour and very fresh ingredients!! The server was very good and quick and even the owner made his way to the table and made sure everything was good! We went on a night where there was a live band! It was over all a great experience!"}
{"text":"Wow. Best Mexican food I've had in ages. So surprised to find this up in Bradford! The waiter was friendly and attentive (but not too attentive). As it was our first time here he suggested a sampler platter for two, which contained 2 tacos, 2 burritos, two quesadillas and two other things that most closely resembled a small taco pizza (using a crispy tortilla for the \"crust\"). My wife had them as mild, and I went for the spicy. We were both thrilled with our choices. I had a bit more hot sauce on the side, as it was so flavorful. 
Afterwards we were so full, but wanted to explore their menu more, so we split an order of churros, and had their specialty coffee (black coffee with cinnamon and sugarcane). Sooooo good. Especially the coffee. 

It's not a question of will we be back, but when!"}
{"text":"I had the combo plate, burrito, taco, tostada and quesadilla - a mix of beef chicken and pork.   The chicken quesadilla was exceptional.   The salsa which comes with the tortilla chips was not my favourite.  It was made fresh - chopped tomato, onion and cilantro, not saucy.  I prefer a more runny salsa.  Great meal.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tonight my wife and I went to Hay Caramba in Bradford. We've been waiting to try it since we first heard about it back in the spring. Well, we weren't disappointed. For those of you who were fans of La Mexicanada under the old ownership you'll find their new place worth a visit. We had tamales and sopes for apps and were impressed with both. Tamales are a particular favourite of mine and it's so difficult to find them around here. These were great... heartily recommended. For mains, we had the carne asada and enchiladas and all of it was great. Along with a couple of margaritas each and a Mexican coffee at the end the bill came in at $95 plus tip. The food was great, Saul, our server, was attentive and friendly and the portions were enough that we were ready for a nap afterwards! All in all a great meal at our new go-to Mexican place."}
{"text":"Great and very welcoming service! The restaurant has a very authentic and cute aesthetic. The food was really good. They offer a good variety of different mexican dishes. The dessert was yummy , highly suggest the bunuelo."}
