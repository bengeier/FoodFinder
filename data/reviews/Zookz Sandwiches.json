{"text":"Very tasty and good value. Works well for staff lunches and the sandwiches have sealed ends and are great car food."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Zooks. I drove by Zooks for months always wanting to try it and now I regret waiting so long! The staff was excellent and gave us some great recommendations since it was our first time. I had the Turkey, bacon, avocado (sorry, I can't remember the number!) and my boyfriend had the #22 breakfast sandwich. Both were delicious. I wish we would have split our sandwiches instead of both eating our own! For sides, we had the potato salad and garbanzo bean salad, both were great. They had a slight lemon zest flavor which was a nice touch. The owner stopped by to check on us and she was very friendly. The lack of parking doesn't bother me because we walked from my apartment and it is walking distance from the light rail. Overall, we will be returning and recommending Zooks!"}
{"text":"I brought my dad here while we were driving cross country. The service was great and the sandwiches were everything the reviews promised. I had the# 35, roast beef with horseradish and dad had the #25, ham and cheese with many delicious things. both were great, but we agreed that the roast beef was the better of the two. It's all about the horseradish!Each sandwich comes with either a salad or chips, we had the kale salad, it was pretty good. The owner came out to chat with us for a bit; it's exciting to talk to passionate people, and she is passionate about her business and the concept. Over all, we were very satisfied. It's worth getting off the highway for some true local flavor and to support a local business. Google maps navigated us there perfectly,."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich place it 's delicious.  All the fresh ingredients come together perfectly in this wonderful mouth watering pocket of goodness.  Everyone is extremely friendly & welcoming.  I love the people there & they make my lunch enjoyable every time I stop in.  The kale salad is amazing & If you get a chance to try the special on a Wednesday your mouth will be pleased."}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS!!! I don't even know where to start with this restaurant! I ordered a turkey with brie and apricot jam, and it was one of the best things I have ever tasted! I totally recommend this place. There might be a little but of a wait depending on which sandwich you get, but its totally worth it."}
{"text":"What a lovely place! The owner came out to my table and talked with my mom and I about our order. She talked about how those sandwiches came to be and about how this new location was working wonders.   The food is excellent! My sandwich had green Chile and macaroni on it (it was a special that day). And holy hand grenades it was amazing! So warm and toasty, spicy but not hot, and made with love.   I chose to have the side kale salad with my sandwich as well. I didn't think I liked kale but gosh d*rn it was really good! It had this tangy vinaigrette on it and came with mandarin slices. I give it an excellent out of 10!   I just wish the sandwhich was a little bigger. But other than that this place is great and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great place and I can't wait until I come back!  I got the #20, a delicious turkey, bacon, avocado, tomato, and cheese concoction alongside the garbanzo bean salad.  Service was friendly and efficient. You just walk up to the register and order, and when your order is done, they will bring it out to your table.   They have water cups out in the table area and also a public sink where you can wash up without having to go to the bathroom.   Parking lot is a little small, but manageable. They have indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"A good place to grab a quick lunch.   The sandwiches are uniquely packaged and yummy! The inside was clean and designed for in-and-out customers. The service was great and the manager came to each table to greet and ask about the food.   I will come back again."}
{"text":"Delicious. Love the press making the bread nice and crispy. Great side salads. Def recommend."}
{"text":"Still a huge fan.  Love the new location in Uptown Plaza, the new menu additions, logo and vibe.  If you have yet to experience Zookz, drop your boring sub sandwich in the trash and try these unique, fresh, toasted sandwiches.  I am hooked for life!"}
{"text":"Tasty sandwiches and an extremely friendly owner. The last time I was in, she noticed I hadn't eaten my salad and offered me my choice of another salad or chips. Wonderful customer service, great food and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great Sunday morning breakfast!. No long wait as is typical of most places at this time . super cute atmosphere. Our order came up fast. We ha the zingger. No longer on the menu but they put a picture up because everyone likes it so much. I can see why soooo good.I was happy to see the owner out and checking food talked with us to make sure we were happy . overall pleasant experience great food and awesome customer service. Will return for more! On a side not 2 sandwiches for ten bucks can't beat that"}
{"text":"Unique, delicious take on the sandwich. The owner is always there, and will guide you through her culinary delights, which she preserved from her grandmother's cooking."}
{"text":"We discovered Zookz today after driving around endlessly looking for something \"different\" and finally finding it! This is the best sandwich I have had in YEARS. I used to love Bennigan's Monte Cristo sandwich but they went out of business quite some time ago and I couldn't find anything even remotely close afterward; Padre Murphy's Monte Cristo didn't cut it. Zookz' #30 with thinly sliced ham, brie, apricot preserves and roasted almonds isn't a Monte Cristo but it's just as tasty in it's own way. We will definitely be back to try everything on their menu - Zookz is that good! The Kale salad is awesome too. I have a feeling that everything will be delicious, no matter what we order. Thank you, Carol, for opening such a great restaurant! :0)"}
{"text":"Delicious! The bread is buttery, soft in the center and a little crispy on the outside. The kale salad it fantastic as well as the potato salad. I had the turkey bacon sandwich. Very good!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Wonderful little unique sandwiches bursting with flavor, leaving you feeling very satisfied. Pride of ownership is apparent with such a cool little story about the founders grandmother and her influence on the restaurant. Will definitely be back for breakfast or lunch when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Exactly what I expected! Sandwiches were perfect, creative, and fresh. Great atmosphere and service. I would eat here weekly if it was closer! Well done ZOOKZ!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Everything was amazing! The service and food! The cashier and chef were extremely nice and they said that if I didn't like my food they can make me a new one. Of course that wasn't necessary because I loved what I ordered. 100% recommended."}
{"text":"Yelp brought me here as I was downtown in the morning and needed breakfast. Zookz had great reviews so I figured I would give them a try... Well the reviews were right! Great place. Nice atmosphere, great friendly service and decent prices. I had the Number 33 and it was so good I went back to try the Zinger special sandwich. So much flavor! Excellent place! Outstanding offerings! New favorite spot for sandwiches."}
{"text":"Phenomenal sandwiches, lame hours. If they were open past 3:00PM, I might be able to make it more often than once in every fourteen weekends."}
{"text":"This was one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had! I had the No. 22 with the chipotle sauce! It was super yummy! The sandwiches came out fast, and hot and tasted so fresh. Service was great and the restaurant was clean! Definitely will be coming back soon"}
{"text":"We saw this restaurant today after we saw it featured on the morning news show. We walked into a very clean bright happy atmosphere love the yellow flowers in the flower boxes on the outdoor patio. We were greeted by the owner and truly wanted us to have the best experience by explaining the menu. I had a #45 with a side of Kale and husband had a #60 with a side of Potato salad. The food was really good but the kale salad was amazing. I would stop by just for the salad alone. I am a diabetic and this meal really agreed with me. No spikes or crashes witch says a lot about the quality. For drinks I had a delish pomegranate ice tea and husband had a fountain cola. He would of loved to see a root beer. That was the only thing missing for his drink but they do have many other choices. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Tried it on a whim Sunday morning and I don't regret it. The staff was super friendly, and checked on us twice. We ordered the #44, #66 and the peanut butter Nutella sandwich.   The bread was nice and toasted. The ingredients were fresh. I also got their special, which was a mimosa with the sandwich, and it was yummy! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were a little small but delicious and very different as a toasted circle. The chipotle potato salad was worth the price of admission!"}
{"text":"My pops swears by this place! The best local central Phoenix spot for something fast, easy and delicious. Especially for breakfast. The owner carol is always on hand to make sure everything is perfect which speaks a lot for place."}
{"text":"I love this place. Came here with my girlfriend and her sister for breakfast. Customer service was superb and the sandwiches were delightful. And the manager is so nice always checking up on how everything is going. Definitely coming back for more.  I got the sandwich #20"}
{"text":"Yummy sandwiches, the price is unbeatable! The restaurant is cute and clean, the staff is friendly. I had # 66 it was SO good. My kids had a bacon, cheese and egg sandwich and loved it. I'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and had the #66. Great crispy texture of toasted bread surrounding filling that included two perfectly poached eggs for $5.95."}
{"text":"I was in downtown Phoenix and planned to find a local place to pick up breakfast. Thank you, Yelp, for showing me Zookz around the corner from the office building I was at! Thanks to Zookz for an awesome, smooth cup of coffee (dispensed from pump decanter instead of burning on a hot plate of the coffee maker). The breakfast sandwich lived up to the Yelp reviews. It was a delicious use of premium soft cheese, poached eggs, tomato, etc. My tummy gave me a high five on the way back to the west valley. That's why I adore local eateries! So good!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in AZ so far. We ordered #20 and #11. So good! Everyhing tastes fresh and they have good coffee too. Great ambiance, friendly staff. I will keep coming here."}
{"text":"Excellent food quality & variety, pleasant ambiance, misters for warm days. Had the special chile relleno with ham & side kale salad. Salad and sandwich were delicious. Sandwich was hot and yummy, great taste. Salad was moist, mandarin orange, nuts, really good. Staff and owner are some of the best people Phoenix has to offer. Friendly and genuine. The restaurant is open, airy and very inviting. Best sandwich place around. Great place to visit."}
{"text":"This is my first my time eating here Zookz. An Interesting and tasty twist to the typical sandwich. The potato salad was tasty too."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwiches served all day long. It is like a dream come true. If you also a late riser, missing the preposterously early 10:30 AM mark, then, my friend, this is also a dream come true for you. They close early-ish so no breakfast sandwiches are to be had for dinner. But, hey, first world problem.  The bread is odd and tasty...like a cross between a pita and a hot pocket. I dig it."}
{"text":"WOW- I've never tasted anything like it- the method of sandwich-making at Zooks is unique and delicious. They perfectly toast the edges of the bread to encapsulate the ingredients. I got a breakfast sandwich and made my sister get a turkey sandwich so we could trade halves. It's the perfect serving size- not too big; not too small. Also the Coco Loco was a perfect sweet tooth satisfier. Service was great and the owner was very kind!"}
{"text":"These sandwiches are nothing short of spectacular. Fresh, flavorful ingredients in a unique, easy to eat sandwich. You must first get over the shock of just how beautiful the cross section of these are but once you do I assure you it will be one of the greatest sandwich experiences of your life. The options and combinations let you make any sandwich you can imagine but I went with a simple regular menu item and I was not disappointed. On top of it all the restaurant itself is lovely to be in, open to the outdoors with water misters and greenery make it very comfortable and pleasant to wait for your to go order or dine in with some friends. Great place all around and I will be spreading the word and taking everyone I know."}
{"text":"After months of having this place bookmarked I finally went. Me & my coworker ordered a #20 (turkey, bacon, avocado,  tomatoes & cheese, sounds delish I thought) & I got  the kale salad...we got it to go because I work way too far for for my 1hr lunch.  I got to my desk and to my surprise they're was no avocado in my sandwich :( & I love avocado!! I thought they just maybe had my order wrong but as I moved on to my other half there was one tiny piece in there. My coworker had the same issue.  Also the edges on their sandwiches are really hard. But honestly that's just a nitpicking complaint.  So the kale salad was really flavorful if you like greens, their green tea is pretty good. & I give the sandwich I got a 6/10. I'd try this place again but I'll ask for extra avocado even if I have to pay for it. (Which I shouldn't have to since it should be already in there, but whatevs)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Server at the front was very helpful and explained if there is anything you order and don't like, you can choose something new. We had the #25 and #35, the food came quick and the iced tea selection was superb. Will come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Super yummy toasted sandwiches!! The potato salad is AMAZING!! The owner came by our table and is just a lovely person! Great choices of iced teas and Coke products. Hubby had the #10 Turkey sandwich and I chose the #17 roast beef. Excellent lunch and service!! And breakfast sandwiches are served all day. Patio with misters and indoor dining."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Fresh ingredients and incredible service! The owner, Carol, is a rock star!!! Go there!!!"}
{"text":"Really delicious and unique sandwiches. My favorite are the breakfast selections, which are served all day!! The garbanzo bean salad is also very tasty. Stop in...You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Zookz wasn't even on my gastronomic radar as I was driving south on Central Avenue on my way to Burton Barr Library around lunch time today.  However, it was the first restaurant on Yelp's list as I searched on my phone.  I caught a glimpse of it as I drove by to my right and immediately took the first right to circle back to it.   Very friendly staff is what greeted me upon walking in.  They could sense immediately it was my first because I most likely gave an impression of a Golden Retriever puppy that walked into the neighbor's house: confused, lost and maybe a little intimidated due to unfamiliarity.  The staff eased me in however and made me feel at home within moments, explaining what they offer and serve.  I asked what their recommendations were and both gladly obliged.  Tara (I didn't get her name but calling her that because she looks like the young Tara Reid) chose No 11; while Guy (just because he was a guy) picked No 45. Both choices looked equally appetizing based on the ingredients' description from the overhead menu, but I was leaning towards No 11 because it was Tara's choice plus it had cream cheese which we both like.   As Tara was taking my order, Guy threw in a last-second recommendation - No 25 - which he said I could customize by adding cream cheese (yay Tara) and bacon.  I decided to sit outside on the patio so I could enjoy this fantastic weather and have a chance to observe the surroundings.  Soon after, my order was brought to my table, enclosed in the paper bag Tara had written my order on.  Taking the sandwich out of the bag, the aroma alone whetted my appetite even more, but I was a little disappointed because a wall picture inside had me visualizing a more substantial delight.  I stared at it for a few seconds as I struggled to mentally grasp what I was looking at because it looked like two slightly larger dollar-sized pancakes fused together in a panini fashion. Nonetheless, my first bite could not have prepared me for the explosion of flavors in my mouth; all the ingredients popped and the flavors blended well together with every bite.  The consistency of the sandwich was toasted/baked/paninied (however they made it) perfectly.  It was crusty on the edges but soft and gooey in the middle.  As unsubstantial as I thought it was, I took my time relishing it anyway because the place invited me to just relax and to enjoy the moment.  The head cook/chef perhaps owner even took the time to check on each customer which added to the relaxed and welcoming atmosphere.    Overall, it was a worthwhile snappy decision to choose this place and I'll definitely be back.  P.S.  Owners of Zookz, give Tara and Guy raises because those two were excellent wait/counter staff.  They were both helpful, engaging and definitely knew what the cafe had to offer.  One last thing, can I get Tara's number?  ;)"}
{"text":"I feel in love with Zookz the first time popped in one Friday in March 2013.  I ordered a breakfast sandwich requesting no meat and was immediately offered fresh spinach as a substitute! Wow!! I have been hooked ever since and absolutely adore the curried turkey sandwich with kale salad. Alone or together these elements are outstanding!! Truly delicious with a wonderful melange of ingredients and a mild curry sauce. I like really hot curry but this subtle sauce works well for a general palate. The physical space is light and airy and the outdoor seats are nice. The place is always spotless (including the restroom.) This locally-owned eatery should be a must go-to place on a foodie's list. The pastry of the \"sandwich\" is neither heavy nor greasy and provides a nice crunch to the ingredients. Do yourself a favor and support a local business and enjoy some tasty food."}
{"text":"Zookz is the place to go for breakfast and lunch doesn't matter the time it's all so very good! you get a nice yummy sandwich with and edge and a side of your choice. All the side foods are so darn good it's a challenge to pick which one you'd like to eat. there are millions of good things I can say about zookz. I highly recommend this place for sure !!!!"}
{"text":"Such a delightful, fabulous find. So refreshing to find a delicious, hands on (the owner is there everyday), perfectly priced breakfast and lunch joint.  I can't say enough about how unusually scrumptious these pressed sandwiches are with their unique fillings, both for breakfast and lunch. And, I'm so glad the restaurant as moved into a new location around the corner with MORE parking.  The sides are amazing as well (your choice comes with each lunch. The ymmy kale salad has already been positively hailed in the other reviews). Do your taste buds a favor and give Zooks a try-I guarantee you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm still not completely sold on the concept as a regular thing but these \"Zooks\" are pretty dang tasty.  They make the sandwiches to order (expect a couple minutes wait) using a few simple but fresh ingredient combinations (ie. mozzarella, tomato, greens or egg, bacon, cheese, beans).  The owner is very friendly (and the other staff for that matter) and the place is always clean (why can't all other fast casual places do this?).  I do wish the sandwiches were just a little bit bigger though.  If you're looking for a unique 'sandwich' option give it a shot for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Zookz is my new favorite weekend lunch spot!  Their sandwiches are unique (they are crunchy and shaped in a circle) with great ingredients.  You can't find these anywhere else (that I'm aware of) so check it out when you are in the mood for something different.  The owner is always there and is very nice.  They are still new but I really hope they make it!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and EXCELLENT customer service! My husband and I place pick-up orders often, and today there was a mistake on my sandwich. I called to let them know and Carol offered, practically insisted, to drop off a new sandwich for me without even knowing where we live!!  That's what I call amazing customer service- thank you!!! We're happy that your kindness will keep us coming back because we love your food!!  If you haven't been to Zookz, support local and eat delicious food from caring people! ** The above portion was written for Zookz Facebook page. I've decided to add it to Yelp, too!  Again, the food here is delicious- every sandwich is amazing!  Don't forget to get the kale salad on the side- I could drink the dressing.  Carol and her staff simply know how to treat customers- they are the best!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Best sandwiches around.  The owner is always there and she genuinely cares about her food and the service is awesome.  Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place for months; I bookmarked it over 7 months ago. Mr. B. and I decided to give it a try on Sat. (we loved it so much that we went again after our Monday morning workout). The customer service here is second to none and the menu is perfect (not too little, not too much).  Saturday the cashier suggested we try the potato salad along with the jalapeño chips (key here is to use the chips as the spoon..holy toledo Batman!). As a first timer she asked if we like Kale salad and offered it up for free (another excellent selection). The dressing is made of mandarin oranges and it is good.  I had a #33 (feta, parmesan, tomatoes, spinach, fresh basil and 2 poached eggs [they were more on the soft boiled side in my opinion but, good nonetheless]) and added bacon. My entire face was in my plate but, Mr. B. had a #66 (cheddar, 2 poached eggs, bacon, tomatoes, green onions and zookz ginger cream cheese sauce). That sauce that was absolutely divine.   Monday we tried #'s 45 & 60 with a few modifications that didn't disappoint. This is definitely a place to stop by if you're in the area or drive the distance if you're not. Regardless, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Omg!!! I absolutely love this place. I came in here one day after seeing the billboard at camelback & central. The sandwich looked soooo delicious. I tried the #11 and now I'm hooked. I brought a sandwich in with me to work and now my coworkers are hooked too. So now I'm ordering for my coworkers and myself on certain days. Nothing like ordering 7+ sandwiches at a time.  This is a great concept. All the employees are super friendly. And the food is super delicious."}
{"text":"What a cute fun way to eat sandwiches! They look small but don't let that deceive you. My sandwich was very filling but it did not make me feel disgustingly full after. I loved that it comes with a side of salad of your choice. I will come back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I usually go for the kale salad with chicken, but today I tried the pulled pork sandwich. Delicious! Sweet pork and a spicy cole slaw in the sandwich with potato salad for side - absolutely wonderful! A new favorite. The new location is easy to get to and has plenty of parking."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop in all of the Phoenix area. The salads are amazing, so flavorful and unique. The sandwiches are like nothing I've ever had. We drive about 30 minutes each way so often to come here - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love the new location.  Great energy, music and now some local brews.  Nice updates! Only wish I saw the 10% off on yelp to use on my order. Will be back to do so!"}
{"text":"The freshest looking wall of all time. Beware:there are patrons that hold the sriracha hostage."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Hot sandwiches come out quickly and everybody here is so friendly. Highly recommend. Worth the 30 minute drive from Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Really cool concept. They have a special griddle that can take two pieces of bread that grills your sandwich while piching around the edges to create a sill, thus making a pouch to hold all the yummy goodness inside. Nice atmosphere and staff was very helpful. Only downside is the sandwiches are on the small side and do not feel up my teens."}
{"text":"We first tried this place a long time ago at their old location off Central. I still love Zookz and their new location is not far from their old location. It's the perfect little spot for a light/healthy lunch or breakfast! My favorite sandwich is the No. 25. The side kale salad is amazing too!"}
{"text":"A place we found after flying in to the Airport and starting our day.  Very unique sandwiches with a French flair on the toasted bread.  The breakfast sandwiches, which are served all day, were particularly delicious and included great flavor profiles and poached eggs.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwhich places. Much better than others in the area. I got the #20 and it was delish."}
{"text":"This is the best place ever try the number 66 always on point and always smiles . I love the inside of this place especially the sunflowers , if your looking for the best toasted sandwiches in PHX and a wholesome welcome then zookz is the place ."}
{"text":"Overall: Best sandwich shop in town! (Possibly ever). Can't wait to go back!  The food:  Delicious! We tried 7 different sandwiches and the 3 sides--everything was excellent--fresh and flavorful.  The service: Exceptional! Very friendly staff, made me and my family feel welcome.  I especially loved how involved and incredibly gracious the owner was. She came around to every table to ask about their experience and seemed genuinely interested in making everyone feel welcome and happy with their meal."}
{"text":"The owner was kind and friendly to us. The kale salad and potato salad were very unique and delicious! Our sandwiches (The Zinger and #25) were very tasty too."}
{"text":"I agree with most everything Greg W said, though I don't think they are overpriced as he implied. The sandwich was pretty good, but small. I had the #15-- turkey, dried cranberries, almonds, shredded carrots, and curry sauce. All of the ingredients were really good but still not sure about the bread/wrap. Definitely unique, not offensive in any way, just don't know that I like it as much as regular good old fashioned bread. It's a nice change of pace at least. You also get a side salad or chips. I had the kale salad and it was quite tasty. Service is very friendly and they care about what they do so my review is really a 3.5. Bottom line: good quality food and friendly service but maybe just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! The food was amazing and fresh, they even know my order! The teas are refreshing! And the owner is awsome!!!"}
{"text":"Our intention was to go to Mazie's next door, but there was a 30 minute wait so we decided to give Zookz a try and we are so glad we did!     I'm not exactly sure how to describe their sandwich:  a round panini,? a round grilled cheese sandwich with other stuff in it, or as they say \"a warmly toasted, round and sealed sandwich?   However you describe it -- it is fabulous!  My adventurous hubby tried the No. 15 Thinly sliced turkey, dried cranberries, shredded carrots, roasted almonds and a mild curry sauce.   My adventurous 12 year old son tried the No. 45 Fresh Mozzarella, tomatoes, fresh spinach, roasted red peppers and fresh basil with honey Balsamic Vinaigrette.  And, I, probably the least adventurous on this day, ordered the No. 20 Thinly sliced turkey, crisp bacon, fresh avocado, tomatoes, shredded cheddar and Sweet Heat Mustard Sauce ( I was told it was the most popular sandwich ordered).  All three  of us tried each others sandwich by proclaimed our respective sandwich the best.  The sandwiches are served with a little side of Kale salad.    Price point for sandwiches is around $5.75  They do serve breakfast sandwiches as well, which we plan to try!  Operational Notes:  Hopefully you are enticed enough to give them a try, but beware of their hours - M- F 7am - 3:30pm (they aren't open in the evening).  I believe they are closed on Saturdays (that seemed like an odd decision), but they are open on Sunday's (which is the day we happily came across them).   The interior is cute, and they have outdoor patio seating.  Staff is super friendly as noted on other reviews.  No alcohol is served, but who needs the alcohol... will only numb your tastebud's from savoring those flavorful sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Different but great.  The sandwiches, sides are awesome. In a nice plaza with outdoor and indoor seating.  For your health."}
{"text":"Great place! Love the food, love the atmosphere, love the service! All around a great place to eat. Carol is the best I love her glowing smile. Shout out to #22 sandwiches"}
{"text":"Stayed in a place up the road from this place. We came in on a Sunday morning and beat the rush. The restaurant is really nice and the windows were open because the weather was fantastic. The sandwiches were so good, unlike any other breakfast sandwich I've had. The owner took the time to welcome us and thanked us for coming in. Also, their iced teas are really refreshing and have a great variety of flavors. I will definitely come back when I'm around these parts."}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time with coworkers as it's super close to our office. My husband has raved about it so I had to bring friends to try it out!   We ordered a variety of different sandwiches - both lunch and breakfast sammies - and we all enjoyed what we ordered. I got the curried turkey sandwich and side kale salad. The real star here is the customer service and friendly staff. The owner came out to personally ask if we enjoyed our meals and offered to replace the sandwich, no questions asked, if we were unsatisfied. They were super fresh and delicious! I also really liked the kale salad.   The only thing I would agree with about other reviewers is that the portions are not huge. In many ways this is great, and I left feeling satisfied, but I was STARVING in about 2 hours. I think many local places overserve you and Zookz does not. I would have probably had room for dessert. However, the prices are fantastic.   I can't say enough pleasant things about the customer service and that will bring me back for another lunch experience. Next on my list is the ham sandwich with black beans and chipotle sauce...yum!"}
{"text":"Very cute interior and the staff could not have been friendlier. They were so pleasant!  Craving a sandwich of some kind, I went here on a Friday afternoon. I'd read a few reviews prior to going so I was expecting to be little disappointed in the size of the sandwiches but not the quality. And that was true.  Greeted so kindly by a host at the door (which is an old garage door, very cool) with a menu and suggestions for what to order at lunch, I knew the place was so hip and cool. The guy at the counter greeted me and again helped me order a sandwich with plenty of helpful suggestions. I ordered thier most poplar sandwich, #25. Anything with turkey and avacado is my weakness. I grabbed bag of chips and paid like $8 for it. The register girl complimented me on literally everything I was wearing. Um, hello new best friend.  The sandwich was hand delivered to me and was so delish. They're more like sandwich pockets. We used to make the same things as a kid but put pizza in them. Just take 2 slices of bread, add your ingredients in the middle, take a circle cookie cutter to punch it out. Then Glaze it with butter or something and bake in the oven. Zooks did the same thing but way better. Was I sad to see the sandwich was so small? Yes, I was. But was I pleased with the shredded turkey, avacado, tomato, and spicy mustard... you betcha.  I'd give Zooks a 4 but I wasn't exceptionally im pressed with the interior or seating arrangement of the place. But don't get me wrong, it's still really good!"}
{"text":"I've been to Zookz 3 or 4 times and haven't had a sandwich I didn't like. I plan on working my way through the menu and Carole and the rest of the staff are outstanding.  Zooks is close to work so it is easy to pick up a quick breakfast or lunch sandwich and get back in our 30 minute time frame.    I don't eat my green veggies like I should (or at all) but I can survive on the Kale Salad.  It is to die for.   I would recommend Zookz to anyone.  It is located on Central across from St. Francis RC Church.    Try the Nutella, peanut butter banana sandwich as a dessert.   My friend and I share it as it is too sweet and filling to eat after a full sandwich.  Prices are great too."}
{"text":"Wow! I was really surprised! I have never had a sandwich like this! It was so good. I had a breakfast sandwich and my husband had a turkey. They were both really good. The staff was really helpful!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and such a pleasant atmosphere! Sandwiches are not your run-of-the-mill like you find everywhere else....tasty & reasonably priced. Owner and staff do a great job!"}
{"text":"Zookz makes outstanding, unique and affordable sandwiches and salads. Their new location in Uptown Plaza is terrific.   What separates Zookz is their care. They have a custom panini press, special-made bread, fresh ingredients and attention to detail. You won't find a traditional sandwich on their menu. The owner used to bottle salad dressings for AJs, and their kale + tangerine salad is heaven. Some restaurants have fantastic food, some restaurants have fantastic service, some restaurants have fantastic atmosphere, but finding a place that excels at all three -- and is affordable -- is rare. Love supporting local businesses where the people are just as exceptional as the food they make.  Great place for families, lunch dates, solo bites and indoor/outdoor eating in the cooler months."}
{"text":"These are hot pockets. Portion size way too small. Taste of sandwich was ok, but I'm an adult and need an adult sandwich. Does not live up to the hype, sorry."}
{"text":"Delicious, unique, and you will be so glad you tried it! Best. Sandwich. Ever. Plus, amazing service!!!!! Thank you Zooks!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't want to sound like a broken record but...place is amazing. Order the #25 and chase it with the #55 peanut butter banana masterpiece. The kale salad was excellent and this is coming from one serving of vegetables a week guy.  The establishment was immaculate and the staff friendly and efficient. I highly recommend it. Parking is tight so you may have to walk a bit. It will do you good. People should move around more."}
{"text":"This place is great pretty awesome! My girlfriend and I come to Phoenix every year for at least a few days for Spring Training. Found this little place and it was amazing. I was referred here by the Dutch bros coffee place down the street and we were so happy we visited. The sandwiches are great! Such a cool take on breakfast sandwiches that I wish we had one of these in socal. Service was also great l, very fast and efficient."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich place I have been to, hands down! Went in here with family and each of us ordered a different sandwich. We all loved it except my daughter decided she didn't care for the one she ordered without even tasting it. The owner was so nice she decided she was going to make her an other sandwich to her liking - on the house!! Who does that?.. wow!   This place is a little far for us but anytime I am near the area, I'll make sure to visit this joint again."}
{"text":"It's not that Zookz Sandwiches are bad... they just aren't good.  The location is nice and the staff is great, but the sandwiches are very bland and unsatisfying.  The bread is grilled in a novel fashion but that was the highlight of our visit.  There are better options if you are looking for something with flavor."}
{"text":"Occasionally, you find a place you like so much, if the staff is bad, you eat there anyway.  Then, there are places with food that comes out so-so, but the service is so amazing you choose to support them in spite.  This place is the best of both those worlds.  I needed some breakfast, and the wonderful yelp community pointed me to here.  That's where the story gets better.  After being greeted by the owner when I walked in the door, conversing with her gorgeous self for a few minutes, and staring at all the amazing sandwiches, she finally convinced me to try the zinger.  I thought it was amazing!!  A sandwich that easily fits the Aristotle creed \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\". This sandwich had poached eggs, which I thoroughly enjoy, some ham and various vegetables. Then, they put that between some delightful bread and make it into more or less my favorite sandwich in the whole wide world. GRILLED CHEESE!!  I think when you grill a sandwich, it can only be as good as the bread allows it to be, and they don't lack in this.  I heard her say the bread was fresh baked for them, and I should find out from where cuz I would buy bread from that place any day.    So, to be short, this place is amazing, I want to try every thing on the menu, but I don't get to visit Phoenix often.  I will be visiting this place whenever I have a chance though!!"}
{"text":"Very unique sandwich shop.  The ham, Brie and apricot preserve was great.  And don't miss out on the kale salad - seriously - not what you think it will be - its really good.   Top notch place."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a few months now and finally had the opportunity to make it here today. The staff was very helpful and polite. The sandwiches that my girl and I ate were the number 45 and 35. Both were excellent in flavor and taste. The only thing that I felt was missing was the portion size.  I felt it was a tad bit small for one person.  The kale salad was excellent as well. I would recommend this place to anyone and will definitely be coming back to try other variations of panini style sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Not only does this place have some of the BEST and creative sandwiches in town, but the staff is amazing. They have made a sandwich and side for me 2 times now that was a special at one time, but not on the menu, they are so sweet and extremely accommodating. Their salads are fantastic and I love that the sandwiches are stuffed with so much great stuff and it wont fall out because its pressed. YUMMMY toooo"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The sandwiches are reasonably priced and very filling! If you get a non-breakfast sandwich it will also come with a side. Both times I have visited the owner is there and she is very pleasant and will explain the menu in depth to first timers. The zookz chipotle sauce is also quite tasty and adds a special taste to the sandwiches. I would recommend this place to anyone. The only downside is that it is on central and parking is very limited, especially because the hotel behind the restaurant won't allow parking on their lot."}
{"text":"Zookz never disappoints.  The flavors in each sandwich are perfectly balanced to make your mouth water.  Plus since the sandwiches are made fresh if you don't like an ingredient just ask for it to be left out.  However with the quality ingredients they use I doubt you will want to have anything taken out.    My only complaint (as if it's really a complaint) is that I can't convince Carole or the Zookz crew to become my free personal chef."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday. The cashier was extremely friendly and was patience while I stared at the menu for a good hour deciding what I wanted (everything looks good). Finally, I ordered the one with poached eggs, spinach, and tomatoes. The sandwich was small but filling, it was nice and toasty, and the bread was delicious."}
{"text":"Great for lunch, perfect portions....(unless you just finished trying out for the Cardinals then you might needs something a little more substantial)."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time! I got the #35 with the cabbage salad. My boyfriend had the #20 with potato salad. He said its one of the best lunches he's had in downtown Phoenix. Great customer service too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just had Zookz for the first time. Got the breakfast sandwich and roast beef. Couldn't wait to take a bite so we jumped in on the breakfast one when we got in the car. What a flavor blast!! We live far but we will definitely be back. The owner Carole took time to talk with us and was very sweet. Highly recommended! !"}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch today and we are so happy we did! We walked In and right away were greeted by the owner. She was so sweet and explained the menu to us. We got two sandwiches and a desert and they were all so delicious! Our meals came with a salad option and we got the kale salad and the potato salad. Both were so good! Definitely recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! I went there today and it was awesome! I went with my boyfriend and his sisters, and we all fell in love with it from the moment we stepped in.  I had one of the breakfast sandwiches and I about stopped in my tracks. The owner was so sweet in helping me make my decision -- something I struggle with. LOL. I wanted a salad as well, and was about to buy one. The owner gave me a fresh serving of the kale salad for free. I have never tried kale before, and it is amazing!!!  The salad was delicious! It was so good I ordered another one to bring home. I also had one of their desserts. YUMMY! Everyone left happy and full. Definitely coming back for more.   Everyone there was so nice, I can't wait to go back. Maybe next weekend... :)"}
{"text":"Zookz was great! I went because of all the reviews and the pictures just looked awesome. Very unique concept. The owner was behind the counter and introduced herself, and thanked me for coming in. You don't see that much anymore....you can tell she cares about her business and her customers. Great sandwiches, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The food is incredible. I thought it wasn't going to be very filling, but it was very filling and tasted great.  service was unbeatable and at a fair price. I will definitely be coming back when i am on central for lunch!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Every single item we ate (two different turkey sandwiches, the peanut butter/Nutella/banana sandwich, chickpea salad, and the kale salad) was an absolute delight!  The owner is lovely and what a great story gave birth to the idea and the restaurant."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find in the Central Phoenix area!  We just finished the Children's Museum and wanted to get a quick, healthy bite to eat before heading home.  After two attempts at different deli establishments (both closed on Sundays), we stumbled upon Zookz.   I had #15 (the turkey, cranberries, roasted almonds, and a light curry sauce) with a side of Kale salad.  It was light, tasty, filling, and satisfying!  The combination of these wonderful, fresh ingredients made my mouth as happy has can be.  Of course, the best part was the toasted bread-you've got to experience it!  You'll see nothing like this anywhere.  My boyfriend had a breakfast sandwich (don't recall which one it actually was), but he said it was delicious too!    If you crave something fresh, healthy, and original (the toasted bread-like Panini pocket), you have to try this place, it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Yelp brought us here. Very cute and trendy little place. Great service and reasonable prices. But we were disappointed given all the very positive Yelp reviews. The food just isn't anything special. Decent but not great.  I have to believe the Yelp ratings are based on service and price rather than flavor. All these things are important but food should be king. My wife ordered a #10 (by mistake she really wanted to try the #15; our fault ) and I had a #20. For the ingredients in my sandwich it should have had a lot more flavor. Turkey is shredded so more like a turkey salad. I saw the avocado and the bacon but no discernible flavors from them. Off day? Not fresh? The toasted bread itself was just really dry and the crust extra hard. My wife's was dry too and felt the apples were to overpowering. Maybe too many? Any way there are a lot of great places to eat in this area so I see no compelling reason to come back. Feel like Yelp failed me this time."}
{"text":"I got the #11 breakfast sandwich with eggs, bacon, cream cheese, shredded cheddar, tomato, and basil. Sounds delicious, but it was not. It was bland, overpriced, small, and chewy. The bread seemed to be regular white bread that was microwaved making the crust too hard and chewy to eat and then pressed into a round mold to look toasty. Not impressed."}
{"text":"First time goers.  Three of us really enjoyed the unique sandwiches there yesterday.  Talked with the owner, Carole, and very interesting background.  Loved the kale salad that she suggested.  Definitely a repeat place."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since it opened and when my dental hygienist told me to go because she loved it, I finally decided to stop by. I'm not too big on eggs so I went with their lunch sandwich. I got the #20; which is turkey, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, and cheese. It was delicious! I devoured it! The way the sandwiches look reminded me of the frozen PB & J's we used to get in school. It's sealed along the sides and stuffed with goodness. Loved it! The place itself is small but they do also have outdoor seating. The customer service was great! Also, if you check-in while you're there, they offer a 10% discount! Give this place a try, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood spot! Their bread is from Wild Flower A local bakery that delivers it fresh every morning. Everyone of their sandwiches comes in a delicious pocket. The Coco loco is a great after sandwich treat. It is like a mounds in a pocket. If you haven't gone you are missing out on this downtown Phoenix gem!"}
{"text":"My buddy Jared has been telling me about this place more months. Now that I finally live here and he had a day off we ran down here for brunch. I had the number 33 plus bacon. So good; fresh, and perfectly cooked. I will definitely be back with my wife. Zookz is where it's at for a grilled sandwich and the value was incredible!"}
{"text":"First time here and we will absolutely be back! Stopped in for a quick bite before golf and we were pleasantly surprised. Food is delicious and homemade. It's like being at your moms house. Service is great and the owner is very friendly and you can tell she really cares. Great job! Great food!"}
{"text":"Zookz is trendy and modern with delicious breakfast sandwiches. I got the No 22 and it was really good. The bread used for the sandwiches were different from your typical sandwich. This is a very cool little spot and I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Was craving sandwiches but wanted something different. Really glad we found this place! Love the decor and the open concept. The restaurant was bright, colorful and friendly. The server was very friendly and provided us with great recommendations. I was curious what their mustard sauce tasted like and before I could ask the owner came out of with a spoon for me to taste. We ordered one breakfast sandwich and one lunch sandwich. Both were delicious but I liked the breakfast one better.   Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and original! Need to go back again soon to try some other sandwiches. They should get some decent locally roasted coffee."}
{"text":"I've had both their salads and sandwiches and it is my favorite lunch spot. The people are always so nice and the food is always so amazing. They have a lot of interesting sandwiches; i suggest that you go out of your comfort zone and try out something new!"}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service! Delicious food! My sandwich was soooo yummy! And reasonably priced! So glad I came in!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  I love the story behind the place and the sandwiches are very unique."}
{"text":"Soooooo good. Lives up to yelp reviews. Although not big portions, it was just the right amount so I didn't feel like I was going into a food coma. Ordered the Zinger and it was so tasty. Cream cheese made it different than your average breakfast sandwich. The man who took my ordered was so friendly and helped me sift through the menu. He even came by after to see what I thought and like he said the cream cheese adds some \"zing or pizzaz\". Service was great."}
{"text":"This is great, fresh and delish.  My only complaint would be that I would love more salads.  I am a wheat free, gluten free person and can't eat the \"bread.\"   I love the kale salad and hope that in the future, they will expand their salad menu.  Love the crew that own and work here."}
{"text":"In town for business and caught a cold, I looked up sandwich places so I could get soup.  Ended up that soup was a brand new menu item.  I loved the sandwiches and the soups were also very good.  The owner came over and asked how my meal was, always a nice touch.    Definitely going to try and return before I head back to Chicago."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to visit Zookz twice over this past weekend.  The menu was amazing with both traditional and nouveau flavor combinations that were absolutely delicious.  Two of my favorites were the pulled pork sandwich with zookz cole slaw and sauce, and the poached egg sandwich with bacon spinach and zookz cream cheese sauce.    The owner was charming and treated us just like family.  A must go!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my sandwich very much, I don't eat meat and the veggie sandwich was probably the best veggie sandwich I have ever eaten. The flavors collided together to provide such a unique taste that was delicious! I will definitely return for another sandwich!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here; but won't be my last. I enjoyed a #25 off their menu. The way they craft their sandwiches is innovative. These pressed and baked sandwiches have several intesting types of combinations. The staff is real friendly too. Just the right size. -Andy"}
{"text":"All I have to say is the food is delish! If you want to grab a quick delicious sandwich come to this place. The owner is super sweet too!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today. Ordered a breakfast sandwich and coffee. It was so good I immediately ordered another, different kind to enjoy on the spot! Nice lady at counter; good and fast service."}
{"text":"Really tasty sandwiches!  The menu has good options and the sandwich style is different, creative, and delicious.  The restaurant is clean and has a minimalist feel to it.  The service was great and the price of the menu is easy on your wallet.  I got a #22 and I cannot remember a better tasting breakfast sandwich.  My girlfriend is vegetarian and the manager was very accommodating: offering to make her additional items not on the menu.  I wish there were more locations."}
{"text":"Been hearing good things about this strange sandwich shop. I love a warm, toasty sandwich and these were definitely Tasty. The Zook is served with a choice of side salad, unfortunately all their salads have nuts. I have nut allergies as do many people in this world, so be aware of the ingredient list when you order. I complained about the nuts, the owner said she would make me a new salad. I was not in a mood to wait after driving around for 5 mins. trying to park. So I took my order and went back to work. 15 mins later the owner showed up at my shop with a nut free salad! WOW, now that is customer service. I'm not even sure how she tracked me down, I was amazed. Thanks Zooks Lady. She even said she is going to rethink having nuts in so many menu items."}
{"text":"Although our offices are in North Scottsdale,. We always get a yearning for one of these great sandwiches.  And although the drive is 35 minutes one way we come and partake in these unique sandwiches and desserts.  The only complaint I have,  is they do not have a location in Scottsdale.  I hope the people of Central Phoenix and Downtown Phoenix appreciate this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"I really appreciate the creativity of this place. It's more than just your average sandwich. I personally enjoy the breakfast themed items. The staff always have great recommendations and the owner always comes out to ensure my food was made correctly and thank me for visiting. It's a cute place to grab a quick bite to eat or to hang out and enjoy the fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I typically don't like warm pressed sandwiches but this is totally different. The bread is really good, great sides (we had potato salad and kale salad), easy to eat on the go, can be eaten with one hand if necessary, reasonably priced, filling.   What I like most: fast, variety, healthy options, truly unique, great staff. The owner is very nice and truly passionate about this business.   Will be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I can't believe this was my first time here. This place was amazing! We ordered a #66 (breakfast sandwich with eggs,bacon, cheese, tomatoes, and green onion) and #20 (lunch sandwich with turkey, bacon, cheese, tomatoes, and avocado). They were both equally delicious! I also got a freshly squeezed orange juice and it was worth the $4.  We sat outside since it was a beautiful day and enjoyed our delicious sandwiches. I love the vibes and ambience and I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Unique spin on the sandwich & a delicious one!  We brought in a large group with no prior notice and still got all of our food within 10min.  Everyone was very helpful & the variety was excellent."}
{"text":"After taking a look at reviews on Yelp, a friend and I decided to chance it and head over to Zookz.  We found an empty restaurant at 11:45am on a Monday, which piqued our curiosity.  The inside was adorned with a few flat screens, a gourmet beverage station, and the clerks even took our orders on iPads.    The staff was attentive and helpful, explaining that their sandwiches required a custom-ordered machine - sounded enticing.  We ordered and received our food promptly.  They were tasty, but the sandwiches are literally the size (and shape) of a baseball.  They are kind enough to serve their sammies with a side of salad (potato or kale salad), that is around 1oz. That's right - a baseball sized sandwich with a 1oz. salad - for approximately $8, not including a drink.  The sandwiches were solid, albeit a bit different than your usual fare.  But we left unsatisfied, and headed over to AJ's to grab an additional bite.  Check it out if you must, but you'll leave hungry."}
{"text":"Zookz gave me one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. We actually went for lunch and liked it so much that we went the next morning for breakfast.   Carol, the owner, was incredibly personable and made me want to come back. She has put a lot of work into making a great business, and I highly recommend Zookz for breakfast and/or lunch (they serve both all day).   Get the #22 if you go for breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm here at least once a week getting sandwiches and salads to go.  The sandwiches are creative, delicious, healthy and made fresh while you wait.  And service is fast and efficient.  I have gotten hooked on #60 and #10.  Salads are creative, delicious, and healthy too.  Owner Carole and staff are fantastic.  I actually dream about these sandwiches."}
{"text":"We just strolled over this morning to the new location at Uptown Plaza.  The modern rustic-luxe environment is perfect for Zookz.  Located directly next door to the trendy organic and healthy Flower Child by Sam Fox, Zookz has delectable unique sandwiches that hit the spot.  They offer about 20-25 variations and even have a few that are for dessert.  We chatted with the owner this morning and she informed us that since moving from their previous location near Maizie's on Central, their numbers are up about 300%!!!  We love supporting unique local eateries that offer great food in a cool environment.  Check them out soon!  Also, they are hiring due to the increase in foot traffic."}
{"text":"Always amazing service, and the food is delicious and different. I like how the owner is always involved in the day to day, and interacts with the guests."}
{"text":"Very, very over rated!  The only thing that stands out is the service.  If you are the person that raves about a market sandwich from Pane Bianco this is not for you.  Very simple and very average ingredients. My mom has been making sandwiches like this for me my entire life. I think I was expecting similar flair like the sandwiches from Culinary Dropout.   Food Guy Out!"}
{"text":"Super yummy!! My husband and I ate at Zookz today and it was truly delicious. We ordered the breakfast Zinger and the lunch #20 and shared-both were fabulous. You wouldn't believe how many restaurants can screw up a poached egg, but Zookz is great. Oh, and the potato salad was superb. My husband is not a potato salad fan and he loved it. The Owner was so nice-very engaging with all of the customers, helped with setting a highchair at our table for our baby boy, and made sure we knew about the specials available. All in all great food and service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it was it the hunger or it was just that amazing, but I devoured my sandwich! I had the No. 40 which is one of their veggie sandwiches that has carrots, kale, roasted almonds, & this amazing dressing that brought out a great combination of amazingness all in one sandwich! They pretty much just have salads & sandwiches. I did wish they offered some lattes or something, but that's okay there is plenty nearby."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We called for directions because we were a little lost. It was a wonderful experience from that phone call to the time we left. The sandwich we ate was #33..from the billboard! It DID NOT DISAPPOINT! The owner and manager came out to greet us. You can tell much love and attention-to-detail that went into, not just the restaurant, but also the phenomenal sandwich.   Why can't more places be like this place?"}
{"text":"Why don't I come here every week?! Delicious food! The staff are very friendly and the place is cute. Most importantly, the food concept is great. I ordered a #10, turkey with cheese, apples, and mustard. The flavors are complex but Mix together in a perfect arrangement. They do a neat thing with their bread, toasting it together like a pita. My boyfriend had the #35, roast beef, cheddar, horseradish. It tasted like prime rib! The sandwiches came with sides, we ordered kale salad with mandarin oranges and potato salad. Again, many ingredients that come together in perfect harmonious flavors. The portions seem small but they are perfect and fill you up."}
{"text":"Okay, brought my hubby here to try and he loved the #35.  He did say pastrami one would be good. Carol also made some amazing potato soup that was the best I had especially on this cold day. Hopefully they keep making it!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches. My coworker would eat the egg sandwich everyday if she could. I had a salad which was incredible fresh but could have had more chicken.  I understand they are mostly a sandwich shop but I wish their other menu items got as much lovin! The entire staff was very friendly, great location, clean, and inviting."}
{"text":"Charming place and a story to go along with the excellent food. We had the #10 and #66 and both were wonderful. I give this place my highest praise which is \"great food!\". We will be back!"}
{"text":"Solid sandwiches (4 star) and great service (5 star). They were very helpful at the counter in explaining the food and gave great suggestions. The #20 and #25 were excellent. Owner and staff very welcoming."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service! :) #20 was good, so was the Zinger and mozzarella sandwiches."}
{"text":"We got sandwich #25 and it was probably the best sandwich I've ever tasted. The bread, the meat, the cheese... Everything was just perfect! You get a side salad with the sandwich so it's totally worth it. I also ordered a green tea pomegranate which was super refreshing.   The service was exceptional. They offered my dog a treat while we were eating out at the patio. The owner, carol, also came out to survey for our opinion. She is a very neat lady and I'm so glad that we found this place."}
{"text":"Food was great along with the service, everyone was friendly and welcoming and made sure we enjoyed ourselves. We will be making this place one of our regular spots."}
{"text":"A wonderful, casual \"sandwich\" place.  My friend and I had ordered the #35 lunch sandwich and the #11 breakfast sandwich and traded halves.  We also got the #7 salad to share.  The lunch sandwich also came with a side of potato salad, so it was a bit of a sampler on my first time there.  Everything was excellent.  The owner picked up on my deer in headlights look and came out from behind the counter to explain the menu in a bit more detail.  I really appreciated that.   Apparently the breakfast sandwiches can have the eggs tailored if you prefer scrambled as opposed to poached/over-medium consistency.  There are some spicy items, which I did refrain from because I knew my friend wasn't a fan and we'd be trading halves.  However, he must've missed the fact that there was horseradish in the lunch sandwich we picked...and although I detected it, he didn't seem to notice (or maybe didn't mind) so I assume spices here are not overpowering.  I will definitely be back if I am in the area.   The space itself is decorated in a homey, cute, cozy, charming way.  There ceiling fans inside keep the fresh air flowing in from the giant window-type bar area.  The 20 foot bench up against the wall provides seating for the east side of 5 different tables, and has cute accent pillows.  The vibe is chill, the clientele is a good mix  (young, old, hispanic, caucasian, families, lunch dates)"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here for lunch on the weekends.  I've tried just about every sandwich on the menu, and I've loved them all.  Definitely made with love.  They come with a little side salad of your choice, which are also really good.  Not huge portions if that's what you're looking for, but perfect, in my opinion, and decently priced.  The front patio area is nice too.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Found this place on accident. Pleasant surprise. Super friendly staff, they seem to really like the place and excited to talk about menu. The sandwiches are round with a crunchy crust. All seemed very fresh. Price point is at the higher end but still within range.   I would definitely come back. Great food, clean, fast, friendly and nice vibe and patio. Small so not a lot of people but..."}
{"text":"Today I took my two teenagers into Zookz and we had not been there before.  We were greeted by Carol, the owner and she was so so so nice and sweet and helpful.  She provided stellar customer service and made us feel welcome. She gave a few recommendations and explained that they serve the breakfast sandwiches all day. We ordered two of the turkey bacon avocado sandwiches and one of the roast beef.  This is going to be our new fave place.  The food hit the spot and tasted amazing.  The potato salad is to die for and they even have a few different flavors of fresh brewed tea to choose from. Our favorite tea was the peach flavor.  We also tasted the Nutella banana and peanut butter dessert and it was so good! I will definitely be back.  Next time I will go for breakfast."}
{"text":"Amazing. Simply amazing sandwich. I came here on a weekday afternoon and it was PACKED. The interior was fresh, bright, and airy. The story on how Zookz was created was on the wall and tables which was nice to touch to learn about. Carol, the owner, was so pleasant and truly doing her part to make sure everything was running smoothly and personally ensuring that the customers were happy.  I was starving so I grabbed a garbanzo salad from their grab and go fridge and ordered a number 20. I had every intention of eating a little bit of the salad while I waited and saving the rest for later. Yeah, that totally didn't happen. I ended up eating the whole dang thing. The sandwich was delicious as well. I can't wait to try more flavors. I also split a nutella peanut butter sandwich as a dessert. Can you talk about heavenly?!   I will definitely be back.... often.."}
{"text":"Very yummy! Staff was uber friendly and enthusiastic. I had the Zinger minus the bacon and the sauce was awesome."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, friendly staff and the food is good!  I like the unique style..definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"It was alright. Not sure if it lived up to its hype. Husband and I both got the #60. I had the brown rice salad which basically tasted like brown rice with salad dressing. Husband had the beans and corn salad which he only ate because he was starving while waiting for his sandwich.   Service was great even though we arrived around 45 minutes before closing. Sorry for that!"}
{"text":"No. 5 salad was the best one I've ever had! The service was so good! Also they make their own dressing which is so cool. It was a refreshing place to spend a hot day! The door is super amazing also. Thank you Zooks staff for treating our 30 person group kindly."}
{"text":"We were looking for a light breakfast this morning and this place had great reviews. The set up looks friendly and welcoming. We were greeted right away and we're told of a breakfast special of $10 for a sandwich and mimosa. The mimosa was a smaller portion but it had great fresh orange juice and the owner opened a fresh bottle of champagne. I ordered the No. 66 and Danny ordered the No. 22. All the sandwiches to be honest looked yummy! The sandwich itself was crunchy but not over cooked. The poached egg was great! I would recommend coming to this place, not crowded, great service, great food."}
{"text":"Sandwhiches are my favorite food because you could be so creative with it.  This was the firat time and I LOVED it!  The staff is so friendly and the environment very clean.   I ordered a No. 66 with avacado  and Chipotle sauce.  Sooo...delicious!  Lots of flavor and filling.  The poached eggs are more on the firm side ao if you dont like runny egg yolk, you will be good with a breakfast sandwhich.  All sandwhiches are available to order at anytime and you can substitute all you like.   I also ordered the chocolate & coconut sandwhich for something sweet.  This had too much coconut for me.  I suggested to the staff to have a bannana foster one or a blueberry & cream cheese  one (like a danish) for those that want a little bit of sweet with their meal.    They have awesome herbal unsweetened ice tea.  You have to try a cup."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great sandwich! I didn't expect it to be that good, simpliy because I didn't know exactly what is was. it's basically a super thin but mega crisp pita like pressed sandwich packed to the gills with great ingredients.  I went with the number 20: Turkey with avocado, bacon, cheddar, tomato and honey mustard. What can I say but VERY good! They had quite a few other \"sandwiches\" there that looked good as well. My sandwich came with this little corn, black bean salad that was dressed perfectly. I also got to sample this oatmeal cake, that was super good. All in all, great little place to pick up a unique sandwich for under $7. My only drawback would be the limited hours they're open, but I get it for the area. Luckily I was home sick today so I was able to get there for lunch."}
{"text":"Zookz offers panini-type sandwiches.  They're the shape of a circle and they're delicious!  I don't like the crust on my bread so this works out for me!  Being from Seattle, I grew up eating Tim's Cascade Chips and miss them so much -- to my delight, they offer them here!  Such a great surprise!  And they offer various kinds, too!  Even better!  They also have a killer kale side salad available!  It really is good - and this is coming from a kale-hater.  Anyway, they are also open for breakfast - not just lunch.  And during lunch they're pretty busy and parking is limited/tight but it's sooo worth it!"}
{"text":"I consider their sandwiches adult hot pockets, and they're awesome. I've only had breakfast here but #11 is really good and #22 is my favorite. The owner is always here either in the kitchen or out talking to guests. It's a quiet atmosphere with a very tasteful decor. I get down here about once a month because it's 30 miles out of the way but if it was closer I would come here daily they're that good! One of the few places I've been to that deserves a 6th star."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Absolutely hit the spot for a breakfast sandwich! I had #22 and hubby had #11. Both were awesome! Will definitely be going back to try the lunch sandwiches"}
{"text":"We had a couple different sandwiches here and they've never failed on their taste! Will always recommend to out-of-towners for breakfast!"}
{"text":"this place totally reminds me of when my mom bought me that lil sandwich press that made them into triangle pouch type of things in the early 90's. YES pls.... I live the pot pie looking shape.  staff super friendly and helpful and I watched him straight up perie back to the register which was tight after giving a sandwich to a customer. talent!  I got the special which was chorizo in a cream sauce, poached egg, avocado, jack cheese. sautéed onions. the chorizo sauce was super yummy but it had very lil (ie pix) and a big juevo.  the kale salad was a lil sweet for me but I really like the orange dressing thing going on there & it came free w/my special.   but it was alright and novelty but something the kiddos would like."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to come here for a long time.  Now that they are at their new location,  I finally made it in. It was delicious!!!! I had the number 40 lunch sandwich. Whoa, was it flavorful. My friend and I both had the garbanzo bean side salad, and I think it was the owner, brought us an extra kale to make sure we tasted it. She also made sure to come back by to ensure we enjoyed everything.  I will definitely be back and highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"It's such a simple but brilliant idea.  I am not a sandwich person, as I never really crave the whole bread, cheese, lettuce, meat thing, but I find myself craving Zookz quite often.  Their fresh off the grill, stuffed, crustless sandwiches are amazing, and I absolutely love it!  Lots of variety, quality, and all at a reasonable price.  Would come again and again and again."}
{"text":"Awesome place and atmosphere!!! Super friendly employees as well. Great food highly recommend."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix! The sandwiches are unique and really tasty. I typically get the zinger which has poached eggs, cheddar, green onion, bacon and zinger sauce. However, they recently added the 60 which has Apple pulled pork, Cole slaw and Monterrey jack cheese and it's a new favorite as well. I also like their kale salad and pomegranate green tea a lot. They keep the restaurant really clean and the manager is super friendly and cares about her customers. All around a great establishment."}
{"text":"Wow, excellent sandwich and a great kale salad. Meet the owner Carol, she was great. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great concept, round sandwich shop. It also has other healthy options like Kale salads.  Great little spot for a quick bite. The breakfast sandwiches are my favorite with simple fresh ingredients. Nice service and clean. Nothing fancy but quaint place to eat."}
{"text":"The service was amazing. I got a sandwich that wasn't up my alley. The owner came out and brought me a new one free of charge! Amazing food and I love the salad instead of chips! Awesome place"}
{"text":"Yum! One of a kind place.  Such nice people,  great vegetarian options. Somehow, the tomato and mozzarella with basil was Really juicy yet the outside was crisp. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Really cool place to eat. Friendly and fast service. Sandwich was bomb, but the price was a bit high for the size even though it's a neat concept for a sandwich. Just wish the sandwich was a little bigger."}
{"text":"Zookz is a great quick sandwich option for lunch. I have been in the restaurant and also have had their catering at work.   I've had the No. 33 Breakfast Sandwich (2 Poached Eggs, feta cheese, parmesan cheese, fresh spinach,tomatoes and fresh basil), and the No. 45 Lunch Sandwich (Fresh Mozzarella, sliced tomatoes, basil and arugula, Zookz Honey Balsamic Vinaigrette)  The bread I would describe as a croissant type texture, with a pita pocket shape. It's super yummy, and not as carb-loading as a normal sandwich bun would be. If you are really hungry, I would suggest getting a side salad along with your sandwich.   The price point is low, around $5 for the breakfast sandwich, and $7 for lunch.  Their catering is great, it came with labeled boxes, a sign that had the description of every sandwich, and 2 large side salads. Really organized, and a quick clean up.  If you go into their restaurant, you can get in and out quickly, the food comes out fast.  Overall, wonderful, affordable sandwich shop with a little twist! It's definitely a good break from your normal Potbellys, or Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"Wow, so I live in the west valley, and I sometimes have appointments or errands in this area. I was looking for a light lunch to have with my family, and found this near my location with high reviews. I checked it out and good god I was impressed. The owner had AMAZING customer service, she went over the menu, and all the best sellers with us, and even suggested what the kids would like and how they would like it. At first, I thought to myself \"I might have to get two sandwiches because they seem small and I'm really hungry\". Well, I'll admit I was wrong. I ordered a lunch sandwich that comes with a side salad (potato salad with black beans). It was all great.       I had to have a bite of everyone's sandwiches at the table, and every single one was great. I had a #10, with turkey, Parmesan, apples, walnuts, cranberries and their sweet heat sauce, and I might have to make that my usual. But I want to try the rest of their menu as well. DEFINITELY a lunch spot I'll be returning to over and over any time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This place right here.  I've been going to Zookz for probably close to three years--as long as I've been living nearby.  I'm a regular, going once every week and a half or so.  90% of the time I order a #22.  Most of them know me by name, and know I'm going to order a #22.  I'm convinced this is the best sandwich in Arizona.  I want them to name it after me.  I'd have the best sandwich in the state named after me.  It's perfect for breakfast, lunch, or brunch.  Filling, crispy, but not too heavy.  Cures a hangover too.  It's magic.  Every visitor I fly out to Phoenix, friends and family alike, I take to Zookz while they're here.  Every time they're back in town they beg me to go back.  Every single person I've brought here.  I've even flown a #22 2000 miles across the country, just so my friend could have another one.  It wasn't soggy either.  Like I said, those things are magic.  Conveniently located near the light rail too, on the Central corridor."}
{"text":"I think good things come best from simplicity and this is the most perfect simple place! It's cute and the food is so good!"}
{"text":"While in Phoenix during Christmas vacation, we are hear.  We shared the No.25 (ham,etc.) and the No.35 (roast beef, etc.).  They both were really tasty.  If either sounds good, I'd recommend trying them.  We also ate the sides of potato salad and kale salad.  The sides were quite good compliments to the sandwich.  The owner came by and said hi.  She seems nice and that was a plus.  If there was any downside, it's that sometimes I have a big appetite and the portion was just enough to satisfy me.  In fairness, when the food is really good, I tend to want more than I need."}
{"text":"It's like eating an adult uncrustable, but better and not soggy. The ambience is nice, and they have a washing station! Say what??! Order the #55, it's the best dessert sandwich. It's like eating a Peanut butter, banana, Nutella goodness. Their #15 with turkey and mild curry was a little sour for my taste which isn't a flavor I expect from curry."}
{"text":"Zookz is a fantastic untraditional sandwich and salad restaurant in uptown Phoenix.  I have had several of their breakfast & lunch sandwiches and salads from here before and I just keep on coming back for more. This place rocks! The inside is extremely well kept and visually appealing. The staff members are all friendly and are prompt to help you with any questions you may have about the menu. These guys work pretty quickly too in order to get you your food in a timely manner. The menu itself is pretty extensive too. Sometimes I would prefer shops like this to specialize in one type of product but their business model works (and taste) great! So much so that they close pretty early around 3 o'clock on the daily. I have loved all the menu items I have tried here.  If you find yourself in uptown for lunch you have to give Zookz a try!"}
{"text":"My husband's been wanting to try this place so we decided to check it out on one of our trips into Phoenix.  Very friendly staff, simple menu, very delicious food.  I can't really explain what the sandwiches are like.  You just have to try it out.  It's like a closed in sandwich but when you bite into it, there's just a burst of delicious goodness.  Although I wasn't \"full\" after our sandwich (they're not very big but I would say probably the size of a sandwich that we SHOULD be eating) I was very satisfied.  Next time we're in the area I'd definitely go back.  Their green iced tea was yummy too!"}
{"text":"I always order to go but I just have to say that their sandwiches are the best sandwiches EVER. I love them so much. I think about them every time I'm hungry. Who ever prepares my orders thank you so much, you guys are the best."}
{"text":"Good prices, great concept, no flavor. Maybe I should have asked for salt and pepper. The bread has very little flavor and very tough on the teeth. Thank God I have perfect teeth but many don't and this sandwich could be uncomfortable to eat. Mouth feel of a soft thin brick. Egg was cooked rare and without the salt and pepper had no flavor either. The pictures look amazing but the product has some shortfalls."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place with my boyfriend as we were driving up Central Avenue looking for a place for brunch. It's perfect if you're looking for a relaxing, tasty experience that won't be expensive. They serve sandwiches for breakfast and lunch with fantastic side dishes. My favorite sandwich is the one with ham, brie, apricot jam, and almonds! I have been back multiple times and I have never had something I did not like. The absolute best thing there is the kale salad, which seems crazy I know, but they dress it up so well that the kale is soft and sweet. I could eat multiple bowls of it in one sitting (this coming from someone who despises kale in most settings.) The owner always comes to check on how we liked everything and sometimes brings us the sandwiches when they're ready. They have a nice patio with outdoor seating and the front of the store opens up so everyone can enjoy the morning breeze. Overall this place consistently provides delicious food and awesome service!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast sandwiches! Zooks are amazing! I went off menu with a simple pouched egg, bacon and green onions with gluten-free bread.  Loved it.  My spouse had number 66 and she was very happy also.  Sure hope this becomes a franchise and will spread across the country!"}
{"text":"We got our salad and sandwiches to go for our hiking trip. We got the No9 kale salad and 4 other sandwiches. Even after hiking for 2 hours our food was still good after putting them in a food saver bag. The kale salad was one of the best kale salads I ever had! The kale along with the mandarin oranges and they dressing was so delicious! I would definitely come back here to just eat the salad. The sandwiches all came with either chips or small salad. My family chose to get the different small salads and they were all good! Such a cute concept with the circle sandwiches and everything was fresh tasting."}
{"text":"Super yummy Gluten Free sandwiches! I ordered the No. 10 (Turkey with cranberries, apples and cheese) I could eat the Kale Salad with citrus vinaigrette every day."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Have talked to the owner a few times and she is such a beautiful soul. The food is really good. They are really willing to help you find something you'll like. They also make the effort of you have allergies to ensure something great regardless of your limitations! A weekly meal!"}
{"text":"This is an outstanding lunch spot.  The sandwiches don't look too big, but they're actually pretty filling. I got the #20, and it was absolutely delicious.  I had a salad on the side, and that was very tasty and super nutritious, too!  More than anything else, the service was great.  Both people working the day I came in were incredibly kind and patient, offering solid menu suggestions, but without rushing anyone.  I really hope to return soon.    ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast today, and it was a great experience. Ordered a number 33 with a cake. Really good food. Came out fast, and the decor is really cute and modern. Excited to come back and try other sandwiches !   Only thing I would say is maybe have Tabasco as a condiment to accompany Siracha. I like adding a lot hot sauce lol"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of this sandwich. Maybe it's because I compared it with other stores and I like others more than this one. However, I like their kale salad."}
{"text":"1st time here.. interesting place. Food was good, on the small portion size. I will try it again."}
{"text":"They put chicken in our vegetarian sandwich order. Agreed to give refund and then called to tell us we were wrong that it was mozzarella. The turkey sandwich ordered had a fishy taste :( and the corners of the bread were very hard and inedible. Almost all of it went in the garbage.  Pictures looked so good on the menu. Was very disappointed and then angry the owner called to tell us we can't tell the difference between mozzarella and chicken. I am sure most anyone can tell the difference from cheese and chicken. just...no. Stay away."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go when I'm around my office near downtown Phoenix. My to go items are the breakfast No 33 and lunch No 20. The portion looks pretty small at first but it definitely fills you up. The food service is pretty quick so it's perfect for in between work. The parking is alright - can be hard to find space during lunch time."}
{"text":"Crisp light lunch in a perfect size, round, grilled sandwich. It's not your typical, greasy Phoenix food. When I eyed the kale and coconut salad (which is really good, by the way), I was transported back to LA. Food here is both healthy and delicious. It made me feel good about yourself instead of feeling weighed down and heavy."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Zookz and I was extremely pleased! I tried #20 which was a turkey, cheddar, bacon, tomato and avocado sandwich which was fantastic! Their sandwiches are round and toasted to perfection to where the cheese melts throughout the sandwich.  All lunch sandwiches include a side salad which was the perfect amount to compliment the sandwich. I choose to try the Garbanzo bean salad which was delicious.   The service and seating was superb! After you order you sit down and they bring you your meal. They have an open air concept with indoor and outdoor seating with misters. I had a great meal and experience and will be looking forward to my next sandwich here!"}
{"text":"Delicious looking menu, friendly service. I ordered the caprese sandwich, the roast beef sandwich, and one of the sweet sandwiches (I don't remember the numbers). Ordered to go which was probably a mistake because the bread was on the soggy side when I got home. My fault completely. The garbanzo bean side salad - best part of the meal.  I will be back but I will be eating in."}
{"text":"Very Tasty, but I left hungry...  Sandwiches are very well made and then pressed in a sandwich maker to seal the edges. $8 gets you a sandwich and a side salad. Only issue is I could have eaten 3 sandwiches, but if you have a smaller appetite you will enjoy, I will not be back."}
{"text":"I took the fam out for breakfast on Memorial Day...this is a major undertaking because NONE of us can agree on anything these days!  Option A was too expensive and Option B was too loud.  Option C was not open for the holiday...you get the drill.  I made the executive decision to go to Zookz...it's been on my bookmark list for a while now and I had ceased to care about anyone else's opinion ;)  We arrived at 10:30 and were all excited about getting caught up.  After ordering, we grabbed a table outside under the misters and noshed on a coconut/oatmeal cookie for our appetizer.  Breakfast was delivered quickly and was packaged picnic-style.  The outer layer of these sandwiches is intriguing,.....sealed all around and crisp.  The insides contained poached egg, cream cheese, and a host of delicious options.  Our menu selections had been recommended by the staff and we enjoyed them.  I took half home for the next day's lunch.  The sides were all interesting...Nephew got the potato salad and declared it delicious.  The cookie was really yummy as well.  Niece and I had coffee which was excellent too.  The price was reasonable...I fed 6 people for $55 and we all left satisfied.  All in all, it was a nice outing and a great get-together."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! The best brekky sandwich and lunch sandwiches. The only thing I don't like about this place is that it isn't open for dinner. Owner is awesome and people working there are super friendly."}
{"text":"I love and miss this place so much!!! They're sandwiches are not your normal sandwiches or panini for that matter. Stuff between 2 slices of bread? Yes. But it's the way they prep/cook it. They're round and toasted in custom jaffle molds. Sandwiches come out piping out and filled with deliciousness. My favorite are the breakfast sandwiches, particularly #22. But really, everything is delicious."}
{"text":"Mediocre sandwiches. Great service.  I like veggies, especially lettuce and tomato on mine and there is none of that.  Also no crusts, they are cut off in the process of sandwich making, so I guess all the best parts are missing.  No kids menu means a 16 dollar lunch for an adult and child.    Eh, won't be back."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in the vally. Very cool atmosphere (digging the orange patio furniture) and super friendly people who seem like they love their jobs. Top notch location!"}
{"text":"I am a freshman at Grand Canyon University and recently ran out of money in my meal plan so I have been adventuring off campus to get food since I'm not limited to spending money on campus anymore. Zookz is by far my new favorite place to go. The employees are very nice and helpful, the place is very modern and inviting. The food was not what I was expecting. I honestly don't know how to describe it but the sandwiches are similar to paninis but not similar at all.. take my word for it, this place is worth the extra cash! I will definitely be coming back and bringing my friends!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were checking out eating places we haven't been to for lunch and came upon this hidden, one of a kind sandwich restaurant.  We went in because of the mouthwatering pictures on the billboard just outside the front door. The outdoor seating looked like a fun place to catch some rays and enjoy our lunch.  Upon arrival the outside tables and tables inside restaurant were clutter free and the restaurant was very clean. We were greeted by the Owner, Carol, and she welcomed us with a big hello. She was very helpful in explaining all of the sandwiches and asked us what we liked and then guided us to specific flavors and toppings that we might like. I had the #50. It was awesome. The capers, olive, tomato and the artichoke tapenade really married with the mozzarella cheese and ham. The crispy crust on bread was flakey like a empenada. So different and one of a kind, than any sandwich on this continent. Carol designed and Patent the sandwich press to be just hers. It was designed after her grandmothers cooking vessel from South Africa, where she got the idea from grandma's breakfast she always was served. My wife had #44. I tried the sandwich and was in heaven. The eggs frittata were perfectly cooked, moist and super flavorful. The roasted peppers and cheeses blended together with the bacon, basil and ham. My wife didnt want the feta and substituted cheddar instead. Carol explained, we will make whatever you want. She was so awesome and friendly. The cashier was super too. Very helpful in describing what ingredients were in food. The potato salad is crazy good!!! Wasn't real sure by looking at it, corn and black beans in it, but it is my new favorite potato salad. This place is so different, you have to try it. Cant compare this type of sandwich to anyone. One of a kind. Very creative. Carol does it right. By the way, for dessert we got a treat. Carol made us #55. A great way to finish lunch. Warm Peanut butter, Nutella, bananas, and roasted almonds. Very sinful. Not being a big dessert type guy, all I could say was, oh my God. Chef John's Stamp of approval. Definitely will be back soon. If you go, tell Carol, John and Linda recommended trying Zookz."}
{"text":"Very different approach on sandwiches and I like it.   I love the ingredients and all the different options that they have. It is fresh and yummy for sure.   Portions are perfect but not everybody would agree with me on that one. For me it is just right amount of food.   Service is great and atmosphere is nice. Location is awesome and I cant wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I forget the number but I got the turkey, avocado, and bacon sandwich and the kale side salad. The sandwich was really good and I loved the salad! I asked for my sandwich w/o tomatoes and it was delivered to me with tomatoes so my husband took it back for me to get it fixed. It wasn't a big deal, I'm a picky eater and used to my food not coming out to me the way I ordered it, plus the food didn't take long to cook.   While we waited a woman came out, I think the owner, and apologized and offered dessert to us dessert on the house. She made us this delicious peanut butter, banana and  Nutella sandwich, so good!!  Overall, the food was really good but the 5 stars is for the service. I used to work for a well-known foodie deli in Ann Arbor, Mi (Zingerman's), where not only was I taught to appreciate food but also the value and importance of great service. If we made a mistake, we went the extra mile to fix it. Even though I wasn't upset about the mistake, I REALLY appreciate that they went above and beyond to make up for it. This is part of the reason eating at local, small businesses rock!"}
{"text":"Guys, these sandwishes (if you can call them that?) are amazing.  Hands down, they were some of the best sandwishes ive ever had. We tried 4 different ones and we loved all of them.  And my wife loved the kale salad also.   That being said, im giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because i felt like the price was a little high considering how large the sandwiches were.   Will i be coming here again next time im in the area? Yes!  Would i come here often if i lived in the area? No. Too expensive for my big appetite.  My wife on the other hand said she was filled between the kale salad and the sandwich. Me? I ate 2 sandwiches and most of my kids sandwich (2 and a half) and i could have eaten the other half..."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Their sandwiches are out of this world, especially the #22 of the breakfast, which is what I personally had. Hands down this is the best sandwich shop in the U.S. A trip to Phoenix would not be complete without this restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh my GOD!!! This concept is perfect. The food is absolutely nothing I've ever heard of, and yet somehow perfect, homey, and like comfort food. We go the  #35, roast beef, cheddar, horseradish and the #66 Breakfast sandwich with bacon, cheddar, cream cheese. Grrrrrrr! I wish I lived near here and could eat here EVERY DAY!!!! The fresh squeezed OJ!!! Amazing! Cute place. Really nice decor, sweet staff. They have a great back story, perfect food, and people who clearly like their job, who work here. I hope they expand to more locations (hint hint, nudge nudge!!)"}
{"text":"Got #20. Awesomeness made in a small pocket. In a world where now a \"toasted Sammie\" is not unique, Zookz deliverz!  Can't wait to make it back and try another one."}
{"text":"This is a special sandwich as good as I have ever had. We tried 4 different ones and each was better than the next. A great concept, well executed and very tasty. Btw, the sides were fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Convenient parking, fresh and delicious food, great menu, friendly and helpful staff. I especially enjoyed the outside seating. I understand the necessity of packaging the kale salad in a plastic container, but I am all about waste reduction. I cannot remember if they recycle, but if they do it would make for a better dining experience for me.   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our family loves Zookz. We've eaten here countless times. The sandwiches are good. The side items are good and the desserts are good. But the friendly, lovely owner makes this place so great to visit. She is ALWAYS so kind to my entire family. She has given us free sides when they've just been introduced to get our feedback, or a surprise treat for my children. Just a really special lady that cares about the people she serves and the food she puts out. Great combo. The people know your name and your order because they care and pay attention when you walk in."}
{"text":"Modern and trendy sandwich place.  I got the #25 and it was OK overall... It tasted basically just like a normal hot sandwich that just happened to have a unique shape to it. In other words, it was fine, just nothing memorable. Prices are high given the quality of ingredients (which IMO, seemed pretty run-of-the-mill) and portion size (small).  In short: More flash than substance..."}
{"text":"After driving by this place many times, I finally made it over for lunch...and I wish I had done it sooner. It was absolutely delicious. The staff was super friendly and the chef/owner herself walks around to make sure all customers are satisfied!"}
{"text":"Heaven. I love it when a place offers breakfast all day. Not that I got the breakfast, but just thought I'd mention that nice perk. First of all, the employees are all so helpful, kind and accommodating; and they were eager to please. These sandwiches are absolutely delicious. They are all pretty unique in one way or another, but my husband and I split two different sandwiches and were equally thrilled with both. Their crust is enough by itself to make any sandwich taste good.  For those of you with a picky palate, they are willing to make a sandwich however you please, so don't fret when you don't see anything on the menu that sounds good. Also tried the kale salad and potato salad. Both were absolutely delicious and unique!  All in all, my tummy was extremely happy when we left and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast sandwiches and love love love the you can substitute avocado for bacon!"}
{"text":"Love this little place!  Great food, great customer service, and reasonably priced.  Highly recommend trying out this little neighborhood shop!"}
{"text":"Stacy was great and had amazing customer service.  This #33 add turkey is bommmmb.com. beefy good portion size for the price"}
{"text":"I love Zookz and it has been an integral part of the central and camelback neighborhood for many years. Zookz offers a unique sandwich filled with delicious ingredients that have not been replicated elsewhere. I recommend the #35, with roast beef and horseradish and the kale salad. I will have to return to try the soup that will be coming to the menu soon! The owner is very warm and personable and the story on how Zookz came to be is very inspiring!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Unique little sandwiches with quality ingredients! The best service, not the kind where they pester you, but the kind where they ask if you're enjoying your food and if you've been there before. I like this spot when I'm in uptown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here a couple of weeks ago, after a hike, and their sandwiches were delicious. Both my friend and I loved them. And the prices like the service were fantastic. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"LUNCH OUTTING.   I've been driving past this place since I moved here April 3rd and finally stopped in....   I am now kicking myself for waiting a month before I was introduced to coolest places for sandwiches.   We first walked in around 1145am and it was too crowded but we had to wait in a small line. My friend and I l we discussing to each other what we were going to order. As we wakes up the lady at the counter was already on top of our order from hearing us and wrote down a 15 and a 20 on our bags. we then proceeded to talk to my friend about the 15 and how they tried it with a new ingredient recently which enhanced the sandwich. At that point I asked the lady if this was her shop. She told me it was hers and that they would love to hear our feed back with any suggestion on sandwiches and ingredients.she always gave us her recommendation on which side was her favorite and the most popular. (the sandwich comes with a side or a bag of chips).   I ordered the turkey with avocado and bacon and a spicy Dijon sauce. My side was the garbanzo bean salad. We sat down at the table and the owner delivered our food herself. The sandwich came out pressed, toasted, and eye popping. My mouth began to salivate immediately!!    The sandwich was as delicious as it looked. crispy from the toasted bread. smokey from the bacon. creamy from the avocado. spicy from the mustard.  would I go back?  Verdict: ABSOLUTELY!   let me mention it was impressive to get such personal service from the owner of the business. she was attentive, helpful, inclusive, and genuine. you don't get service like this very often from the proprietor very often. the price was appropriate and the service was above and beyond excellent."}
{"text":"So today was the 4th time eating here in about a week, (I live like 25 min away)  still shocked how amazing the food is! Good job ladies!!!!"}
{"text":"Easily one of our favorite sandwich places in town. Even the side salad that comes with the sandwich taste great."}
{"text":"We had the breakfast sandwiches. The chipotle one and the basil spinach one. I liked the basil spinach one the best. The eggs ended up being more hard boiled than I was expecting since the menu described them as poached eggs, overall they were really good! *Be sure to read the cute story on their wall about how they started!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to try Imagine round filled pastry/bread filled with tasty ingredients.  I had number 45 Turkey and Latte Nice people who offer to answer questions Yes they have almond milk and some high tables for outdoor seating"}
{"text":"Found this place using the \"nearby\" feature on the Yelp app and decided to give it a try. The menu is small but varied, the price is awesome ($4.50-$4.75), and the product is delicious. I got a vegetarian breakfast sandwich (#33: two poached eggs, feta cheese, parmesan cheese, fresh spinach) and my boyfriend got the Nutella, peanut butter, banana, almond sandwich. We both happily demolished them immeditately. Both Carol, the owner, and the young guy working the register were pleasant and conversational. Carol seemed to make fast friends with every customer who walked in, making sure to check on them and ask their names. One unusual thing about Zookz is the addition of a small sink at the beverage counter. This is so useful for dumping out leftover ice and liquids and rinsing plastic containers before you place them in the recycle bin next to it.   Oh, and they have punch cards! 10th sandwich is free! We will definitely be trying this place again."}
{"text":"Always tasty, always nice staff and always satisfying. The husband always craves to come here. It hits the spot when you are look for fast-casual, freshly made food."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are delicious! On the smaller side but they bake the bread so it's more like a hot pocket style. Was delicious. The salads are on the bigger side. Every sandwich comes with a side salad but they aren't very appetizing looking. The restaurant is open concept but I believe they close the windows during the summer. Overall good food, decent prices, and they have $5 mimosas. The teas are also really good. Would consider if you're in the area and want a sandwich."}
{"text":"I try to eat healthy but really can't. When you taste the salad and any sandwich your mouth will water like never before  Amazing Service"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast and left a happy camper.  I love toasted breads and the outer crust of this sandwich was cooked/paninied/whatever-they-do perfectly. I really enjoyed the 33 but wish the egg yolk was left a little runny...not sure if that's possible with these sandwiches. I also sampled the 44 but did not like it as much. The egg ratio was way too much and I was hoping to see more crispy bacon. Breakfast prices are reasonable but if lunch portions are the same, then I'd be a bit more hesitant."}
{"text":"My first time here, and I had to kick myself for not coming sooner!  Delicious sandwiches and salads. The kale salad was so good I could actually picture being a vegetarian. I will definitely be back for great food at a great price."}
{"text":"What a great find! Driving back to CA we yelped this amazing little sandwich shop and it did not disappoint. Circular, pressed sandwiches full of yummy happiness. We tried the turkey curry & turkey apple cranberry, delicious side salads, topped off with a gooey chocolate chip cookie.   The Zooks crew was also so accommodating to our picky 5 y.o.... Happy kid happy parents. :)  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at zooks with my family. We had a fantastic experience. The food was delicious and between the four of us we got 4 different sides that were all great. The owner was amazing and sweet. The ice tea selection was great and delicious! I will definitely be back anytime I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Luckily I saw ZookZ on check please Arizona, what an incredible place to go the sandwiches are absolutely perfect, I had the number 66 and it was incredible and for desert I had the 55 . The service was impeccable and the owner absolutely knows what she's doing, the perfect hostess, great job can't wait to go back, I recommend this place to everybody 10 out of 10 ."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the vibe here! It's so modern and the service are just amazing! I did some research before coming in so I already know what I wanted. But the girl at the counter as all ready and about to explain the menu to me cause I told it was my first time. She was so nice and helpful.   The food itself was very good! The crust was a little hard to chew on but the sandwich itself was a must have! It so good, the break is very soft and crispy, nothing fell out of my sandwich, and it also came with a side of your choice!   I would definitely come back here. Love it!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  When I opened the bag and pulled out my sandwich, I thought they accidentally slipped me a Kid's meal.  Although the food tasted good I expected an actual adult meal for what I paid.  Once was enough for me. Then I had to do the walk of shame passed my co-work that I convinced to try it as well.  She glared at me as I passed with my head down in shame !!"}
{"text":"Love Zooks!!     I actually crave the chickpea side they offer (you get one side with your sandwich) ... and I order two chickpea sides so I can have one for later.    I've had a few different sandwiches here  and loved them all.     The owner is also very nice and you can sense the passion she has for what she does  :)"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast sandwich I've tasted anywhere! I've come two days in a row. My favorite is the No. 22. It's flavorful, warm and very filling. I can't wait to try the lunch ones!"}
{"text":"This place is so over rated on yelp. Only went because of the ratings. Had a #20 with potato salad. Portions are small prices are high. Not a great value. The sandwiches are not like anything I've ever seen before very innovative, but doesn't change the taste... It's just very trendy and in an area with a bunch of trendy people. Worth a try, but not anything to ever recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Zookz is the best sandwich in the game, period! Most sandwiches in Phoenix are overpriced, traditional, & particular boring - whereas Zookz is cheap, unique, & healthy! Everyone from management to the cashiers are respectful & loving, & I am always excited to eat the best sandwich in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Breakfast prepared just right with a good blend of seasonings, not too greasy, bread had a nice bite to it. Recommend breakfast no. 44."}
{"text":"This place is great.   Zooks is just a stones throw away from where I live. My girlfriend recommended to me so I thought I'd check it out. Zooks is kinda like a Cornish Pasty co. on the go and less hearty. Although, I believe Zooks food is completely fresh. I will most likely be back and would recommend this place to others. For breakfast the number 11. sandwich is great.  Pros:  -great service -short wait times -awesome tasting food -great prices  Cons: -I feel like there are random close times on the weekends -not much parking"}
{"text":"My husband suggested going here for lunch today as he's a sandwich lover and we hadn't tried Zookz yet. I really wasn't expecting much as sandwiches are typically pretty straight forward.   We walked up to order and I saw they had breakfast sandwiches, I asked if they sold breakfast all day since an egg sandwich sounded really good. They said that they usually only serve breakfast in the morning, but will check to see if they would do it for me anyway, I said \"No prob, I'll just order from the lunch menu.\" as I didn't want to be a pain. They checked with the kitchen anyway and said it would be no problem to make a breakfast sandwich. I asked for mine with no parmesan as I can't eat cow's milk. The chef then came out and asked if I would like anything else in replacement, I told her I couldn't eat cow's milk dairy, so she then offered to give me goat cheese instead. How cool is that? I try not to be a pain with my dietary issues, but they went above and beyond with their service and to accommodate me.  As for the food; my sandwich was really tasty, eggs were cooked right with fresh spinach and tomatoes, and the bread was nice and crusty, and it had extra goodness due to the added goat cheese.   My husband had the turkey avocado, I tried a bite and it was equally as good as my sandwich. The sweet mustard dressing was a really good addition. His also came with a kale salad which was as good as the sandwiches.  I would highly recommend Zookz and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delish! A foodies grab and go dream! Looking for a perfect panini-style breakfast sandwich with perfect poached eggs for breakfast or something original for lunch with quality fresh ingredients!? Try this locally owned ladies sandwich shop who is twisting up something unique and creative. I want one at the airport and in Scottsdale. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and saw many great reviews of this place on yelp so I decided to try a breakfast sandwich..#66 its a popular one and I thought it was very delicious! I just think they're way too small, I saw a review that said it was big and filling and I personally thought it wasn't because its way too small. I felt good with what I ate but they're small for the price. The lunch sandwiches are like almost $9 and honestly not worth the price. If anything a breakfast sandwich is worth it because its cheaper."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get breakfast after reading Yelp reviews.  Sandwiches were yummy and really fresh.  My husband got a lunch sandwich and loved the kale salad that came with it.  Great coffee as well.  Owner was really friendly and helpful.  We live in Washington, DC and are sorry that this is not a place we can frequent!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for a while and finally stopped in earlier this morning. I got the number 20 and it was pretty good. The potato salad on the side was okay, nothing special. Overall it's a nice place, food is good, but I feel like the portions are small."}
{"text":"We live in Medlock district, within walking distant to Zookz.  Watched it come up and intended to give it a try early on but didn't.  One Sunday morn, on a walk with my older girl and with the baby in her mei tai, I realized they would be open by the time we finished.  When I arrived they had JUST opened for the day.  I was a sweaty mess and dragging my girls in.  The owner Carole was working and she was a VERY gracious host.  Explained the concept, asks us to make adjustments as desired and mentioned the kale & mandarin orange salad that is given with catering orders when I inquired for my office.  I got a few sandwiches to go so hubby and son could try them out as well.  She packed everything nicely for my walk home, poured the drink for me AND tossed in a sample of the salad.  BTW: Kale isn't high on my 'delish' meter.  However, this is now my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE SALAD hands down.  I actually drool at little whenever I think about it (darn it, there I go again...).  We have now gone a few more times and each sandwich has been warm, moist, toasty, crisp, flavorful and so wonderful it makes my husband smile to think about it.  One of our top 5 eateries and I personally LOVE her backstory (check out the About portion of their website).  Start-up businesses are rough.  We have a lot of great local-owned food establishments in the valley.   I truly wish her the best.  She's got a few more fans and regular customers from my house!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the kale side salad with a #60 sandwich (pulled pork and Coke slaw). Husband had the garbanzo bean side salad and a #15 (chicken with yellow curry, carrots, pineapple, and cranberries). Both fishers were great, but I would get the garbanzo bean salad with the chicken curry sandwich again. Waiting on the peanut butter, banana, and Nutella sandwich now!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches were very yummy! It's a quick little restaurant that's good for dine in or take out. I got the mozzarella tomato and basil sandwich. I also tried their iced teas which were fantastic! I was visiting Arizona with my dad and this place did not disappoint. If I were back in town I'd go again.   Tip: check in for a small percentage off your bill"}
{"text":"This place this unbelievable awesome. I am a vegetarian. I didn't know no.45 has cheese at first. After I noticed, they customized a no-cheese veggie sandwiches for me free! Great service!"}
{"text":"It's like a giant fancy uncrustable. If you like a toasted sandwich this is a must try. We might even come back tomorrow."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place after waiting way too long to be helped at Ellys and I'm glad Ellys didn't work out because this place was awesome. As soon as we walked in the owner greeted us and gave us some suggestions. I ordered the 44 and my boyfriend ordered the 35 and they were both great (he just wished there was slightly less horse radish, but no biggie). As we were eating she brought us out a complementary kale salad which was very good. I didn't realize they had coffee when I ordered so I asked for a coffee instead of my drink and she gave me my coffee for free! Awesome place, awesome service, awesome food."}
{"text":"Oh, this is just the best! Sandwiches, side dishes, everything. I was taken there by a friend who said it was a good restaurant. I say, GREAT. A refreshing alternative for the usual ho hum."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating lunch here....so much, I've come here 2 days in a row and I don't ever do that!    The portions are perfect...you'll be pleasantly full.  But more than that....your taste buds will thank you!  Everything I've had here was uniquely different and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"A very cool twist on the traditional sandwich.  Great menu choices.  Side salads were different and wonderful.  Don't miss the peanut butter/Nutella sandwich as a desert. Great staff.  Terrific food.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered using UberEATS and had placed a comment that my friend had an allergy and they happily accommodated a sandwich to her liking. Amazing place and great service !"}
{"text":"Zookz is one of those places where the cool concept works well. I had one of the breakfast pockets number 66 and all the fillings tied together perfectly. In that delicious pick was poached eggs, cheese, a chipotle sauce and some other filling that I forgot. Each bit was crunchy, savory and just damn good."}
{"text":"There is this cool, clamp sandwich applicance my family has used for years that was originally developed in India. Well, this brilliant Arizona female entrepreneur has taken that basic concept and adapted it to a larger, toasted sandwich filled with all sorts of incredible ingredients. I had a breakfast sandwich filled with poached eggs, feta, spinach and tomatoes that was delicious. I also appreciated how the owner came out and spoke with customers, many who were trying her sandwiches for the first time. I suggest that everyone give this creative endeavor a try--they're yummy! They have both breakfast and lunch items. Congrats, and best wishes to this winner of a new concept."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a lunch after reading good reviews. They were pretty spot on. The owner is a very nice lady who is very involved and is local, which is cool by me. Always good to support local small businesses.  The menu isn't too large but you can customize your sandwiches. I tried to have my sandwich with chipotle sauce instead of mustard, and it even said it on the bag, but i definitely still got mustard, or their chipotle sauce tastes exactly like mustard....   The sandwich was pretty good. A little small and the flavors are kind of all blended together which is a little different, but good. They have Tim's chips which are amazing (try the sour cream chips) and the price is reasonable, although if you are really hungry this is probably not going to be a place to order just one sandwich.  I appreciate the owner's dedication and effort in a tough area (near the light rail in north central phoenix), but I worry about the ability to run a successful business there. I think a place like this would do amazing in old town or PV or near ASU. Probably even in growing rural parts of Chandler and Gilbert. It's got a tough battle being located where it is, mainly because of the lack of foot or car traffic. I hope they do or that they move somewhere closer to me because I did like the place.  I will definitely stop by here again if I am in that area and I wish this place the best, thanks again."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch! The sandwiches are made fresh and the sides are delicious.  I ordered a #45 (Very similar to a caprese style sandwich), all the ingredients were put into a pita style bread, it didn't taste like pita, it tasted like bread if that makes sense.  Then the sandwich was pressed and heated. It was very tasty. My only complaint is that it was a little small. I easily finished it, and I rarely finish my food.  They have several sides to choose from, she gave me two so I could try them both. One was the kale salad the other was a chickpea salad... both were super flavorful. In fact, I next time I might see if they will put the chickpea salad in the bread and grill that up! Obviously, I plan on going back =)"}
{"text":"Delicious toasties and teas in a breezy open air cafe. I'd definitely go back if I'm ever in town again!"}
{"text":"There's definitely a lot to like about Zookz and their unique twist on a sandwich shop.  The prices are great, the service is friendly, the atmosphere is chill, and online ordering is a snap.  I wouldn't call my first visit here a home run, but I can see why so many CenPho folks make this place their lunch staple.  I actually decided to venture here after leaving early from work on a Tuesday.  I had read the stellar reviews on Yelp (as well as a glowing recommendation from my sister) and figured I'd give it a go.  Their website makes a point of advertising the online ordering process so I figured I'd play it safe this time and order in advance in case of a big lunch rush.  The online ordering process is quite easy as you just pick your sandwich, choose a pickup time, pay, and done (I understand some folks may have reservations about paying for food in advance but I digress).  I came by around 11:30am to pick up my food.  As many have accurately pointed out, parking here is a chore.  In fairness I knew that in advance as I've patronized numerous restaurants and businesses in the area but parking has always been scarce.  Here's a tip, park a block north of Zookz on Pierson Street.  There's usually a decent amount of street parking and I believe the parking lot on the northwest corner of Pierson and Central can be used (though don't quote me on that).  I parked in that parking lot today and had no issues, so there you go.  Or if you take the light rail, the Central & Camelback station is just a couple of blocks away.    The restaurant itself is fairly small, but actually has a great deal more seating than I expected (including a decent amount of outdoor patio seating).  The orange and green color scheme is rather, eh, interesting, though they do keep the restaurant pretty clean.  Maybe I came at the right time, but there was barely anyone there when I got there at 11:30am.  Perhaps the lunch crowd hadn't yet flowed in.  In any event I came up to the counter, my food was ready, they let me pick a salad (I went with potato), and off I went.  The sandwiches here are unique in that they're made using an old school stove-top method.  They describe the process on their website, but essentially you get a sandwich that almost looks more like a stuffed pancake.  I got the #20 lunch sandwich (turkey, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, cheddar, and Zookz' own housemate sweet mustard).  Super tasty sandwich and for the most part the unique bread was a good compliment.  My only complaint was that the outer crust of my sandwich was pretty rock hard.  Not sure if thats normal, but it was a slightly unpleasant part of an otherwise pleasant experience.  The potato salad side I got was also pretty tasty.  Total price for the sandwich and side salad was $7.  I actually got a $1 off my order as they had a holiday online promo code I could use.  And I believe a Yelp check-in can get you 10% off if you're just a walkup customer.  Good price for a good amount of food.  I didn't feel uncomfortably full, but satisfied.  I'd certainly come back here again for lunch or to try one of their breakfast sandwiches.  I'm not sure they allow it, but it'd be nice to customize my own sandwich with my own choice of ingredients.  I'll investigate that possibility the next time.  Overall, a good choice, Yelpers.  A few kinks to work out before I give it the 5 star treatment, but Carole Meyer's creation shows a lot of promise."}
{"text":"I had the #11 and #20. I didn't really like the breakfast sandwich (11), the poached egg was not what I expected.  The yolk was completely cook. I guess I thought it was gonna come a little runny. The lunch one (20) was fantastic! Threw a little hot sauce on it... YUM!"}
{"text":"Came to pick up an order. But when I got there I got an iced latte with caramel flavor. It wasn't the best drink but it wasn't the worst drink either. Definitely want to come back to try their food. The menu looked great. They have seats outside and a huge open window which is cool. Also their door is so big but definitely not heavy.  Check in on yelp & get 10% off"}
{"text":"What a darling little sandwich shop!   Do you remember those old fashioned round sandwich makers our grandmother had?   The owner,  Carol, took it to a whole new level.   Yummy stuffed sandwiches,  from breakfasts to lunch,  to sweet.   Give it a whirl.  Try #66.  A breakfast favorite."}
{"text":"So impressed! Will definitely be back again. The #20 was delicious and reminded me of a better hot pocket but with fresh ingredients! Fair priced and tastes good. Also have gluten free that is good!"}
{"text":"I would NEVER pass up an opportunity to stop by Zookz when I'm in the area. Heck, I'd even drive a few miles extra to be able to stop by and grab a sandwich pillow full of delicious goodness, made with fresh ingredients, toasted and sealed to perfection. Quite honestly, Zookz has the BEST sandwiches I've ever had -- they're a cross between an adult gourmet version of hot pockets and paninis... and if THAT'S not a great combo, I don't know what is!   Not only do I make it a point to stop by Zookz when I'm in the area, I bring someone with me every time. One bite of the deliciousness served up by Zookz and you get hooked, I'm telling you. I brought my mom with me and at first she was a bit skeptical, but it was love at first bite. She ordered the No. 35 (Thinly sliced roast beef, crisp bacon, fresh tomatoes, shredded cheddar cheese, and Zookz Horseradish Sauce), which came with a side kale salad. I ordered the No. 66 (Cheddar cheese, 2 poached eggs, bacon, tomatoes, green onions, and Zookz zinger cream cheese sauce). It was all extremely flavorful and delicious, so much so that it's almost a sad and disappointing moment when you finish your last bite and realize you don't have more left. On the plus side though, you can always order more (if you're still hungry), or come back for more another time. Yaaasssss!!!  Moral of the story: Don't judge a sandwich just 'cause it looks small and cute; not only will Zookz satisfy your tastebuds, but it will also satisfy your hunger."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place. We are from out of town and found zookz on yelp.... best decision we made all day! Food is a great price, the staff and owner were extremely helpful, and best of all the sandwiches were DELICIOUS!! We highly recommend #20, #25, and #55 as well as the kale salad.   Excellent place to stop for breakfast or lunch! The grilled circle sandwiches \"with an edge\" are original, unique, and refreshingly full of flavor. The specialty dressings that come are delicious as well. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone looking for a new place to grab a meal."}
{"text":"Yup... delicious! Bread was unique and superb while the sweat heat mustard was incredible on the Bacon, cheddar, turkey, avocado sandwich"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity this morning to stop by and try the new Zoosk on Camelback and Central   And I can say I was extremely impressed with the sandwich,  service and ease of ordering.   I ordered a great lunch sandwich instead a breakfast sandwich.  They have so many great sandwiches to choose from,  You should  make up your mind before you go to the counter.  I live in North Scottsdale but I'm definitely going back and trying some other sandwiches as this one was fabulous keep up the great food and service."}
{"text":"When you need a hug from the inside out, head to Zookz! Sandwiches + Salads + Service with a SMILE.  The entire staff is an incredible team that makes you feel right at home. Healthy, indulgent, and custom options available, including Gluten-free, meat-free, and dairy-free items. Their beverage offerings are tasty, too! Say hi to Carole or Bevy Jo if you get a chance!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The zinger is so good! I live right next door so i always stop by for a breakfast sandwich. The owner is really nice as well."}
{"text":"These are unique and fabulous sandwiches. The \"edge\" keeps the juices in the sandwich not running down your arms. I often order these for my office when we have a working lunch.  It doesn't feel much like work when we get to tuck into these. Just one try and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"This an awesome place to have breakfast customers service is great the food is wonderful the owner is very nice she was asking everyone for there opinion and introduced herself she's very nice. The food came out fast and very well cooked my husband and I had a wonderful experience here."}
{"text":"As a lover of any form of food wrapped in carbs, this place was wonderful. The sandwich fillings themselves aren't too special, but their unique method makes for a great balance of crispy and soft. The story behind the place is pretty cool too."}
{"text":"Friendly employees, fast service, amazing refreshing kale salad, and one of a kind sandwiches.  To top it all off, it's local.  Cannot wait to try all their sandwiches. I met the owner as well who was just amazing.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Seriously don't even remember the name of the sandwich but I am much better with numbers, it was a number 44 and fell from heaven into Zooks.  These sandwiches are tasty!  We stopped in on the way to the National Championship (Clemson v. Alabama).  Stacey waited on us and was super sweet.  After our meal, she surprised us with some sort of Nutella marries peanut butter concoction.  What!  Delicious.  The owner Carol also stopped by and shared some of the story of how she started, super sweet woman.  This business will turn into a franchise down the road, just wait.  Until then, I'll stop by when I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Decent sandwhiches. Ordered the number 22 with no cheese. They didn't put the sauce on it, that should have been. It a was a tad dry. The coffee was good, however it was almost as expensive as the sandwhich. 3 stars  To make it even worse, the owner came up trying to beg us to correct the issue. As we were walking out, the cooks and cashier starred us down. Wont be coming back here. As a professional yelper, zookz has failed."}
{"text":"All my family love this place. Usually we eat at home. But when I'm not in mood to cook, first place that coming to our mind is Zookz. Great people, great atmosphere, unique delicious sandwiches. I highly recommend this place. My favorites- for breakfast #66 and for lunch #60 (But others good too)."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Salads are on point!!!! However based on the portions I would not suggest going if your Starving. I gooooo Zookz for their Salads!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I recently came across this new place a few months ago. My dad was in town and we wanted to grab brunch. As I yelped up something to eat, we figured to give this place a try. My dad was in love with the sandwiches and even last weekend he brought up how good the breakfast sandwich was at \"that one place that starts with a Z\". I got the No. 33; poached eggs, feta and parmesan cheese, fresh spinach, tomatoes, and fresh basil mmmmm Can't go wrong with some fresh basil. My dad got the No. 44 and apparently it was to die for, obviously since he's still talking about it. We met the owner who was super nice and down to earth. Explained that they were in a different neighborhood and recently moved to this new location. It's in the \"new and up and coming\" neighborhood of the uptown plaza; Located next to Chipotle and Flower Child off of Camelback.   The atmosphere is small, quiet. I love that all the windows open so it's like you're sitting outside. I think they even have mimosas now which is new. I've never had their lunch sandwiches, but i'll definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"Interesting menu but great food and love the eco friendly type atmosphere. When I read breakfast sandwich I was intrigued but the way they make it is amazing. My eggs were poached I believe and everything else in the pocket sandwich was great! When I'm in this area would love to stop by this place."}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place so I had to check it out.  Everything about this sandwich place was five stars. Friendly staff, cleanest environment (saw one of the staff constantly cleaning everywhere), cute decor, wonderful owner, and the most delicious sandwich I have had. This place will be my must go restaurant when I visit Phoenix. My friends from Tokyo (gourmet eaters) also gave their big thumbs up and said Zookz would be a hit in Tokyo if they ever come to Japan."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 4.5 stars. It's just shy of 5 stars due to infrequent issues that have happened. Overall - this is a great little sandwich place. The owner (Carole) is friendly, down to earth, cares about her customers.    She has come up with a unique type of sandwich you just have to try. It has interesting toasty bread and different fillings that one would not expect.  You don't just get a boring old turkey sandwich here.  My favorites are 1) the Zinger.  A breakfast sandwich with fluffy eggs, cheese, bacon bits, green onions and a zesty sauce. 2) I think it is #55 - a dessert sandwich with Nutella, bananas, peanut butter, and nuts. I also love their turkey sandwich but can't remember the number. I just know it has green apple on it and a tasty mustard sauce.  The other big pro for this place is these sandwiches aren't pricey.  They are very reasonably priced and most come with a side (either a salad or chips). The sides are also very tasty and unique. Even the potato salad side is twice as good (and different) than other potato salads.  Right now this store sits on Central south of Camelback but will be moving to just north of  Camelback soon. That is good - since parking at the current store is very tight. The new location will alleviate the parking issue.  If you are in the area, do yourself a favor and try this place. I found it from other Yelp reviews and I'm glad I did. I live in the north part of town, but make a point to get here at least once on the weekends. It's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Wow...this place is delicious!  I tried the No. 10 with turkey, apples, parmesan and sweet mustard with a side of oranges and kale salad - amazing!  It was fresh, flavorful and healthy...a real hit!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous late lunch we had today at Zooks  ! They have a location now with plenty of parking , it lived up to  every review I've ever read.  We had # 10. It has the best combination of flavors . The staff and owner are our new best friends.  See you tomorrow. It was that good."}
{"text":"My hubby and two young kids happened upon Zookz on a Saturday (which they are now open on) & loved it! Hubby had a roast beef something with the kale salad, I had something with cheese & eggs, both kids had the bananas Nutella and PB sooo yummy. The kale salad is more fine and like a \"slaw\" than a regular salad. I really want to go back & taste something else on the menu. The major plus for this place is the family owned feel. The owner talked to us a little, and was eager to answer our questions about ingredients, how the sandwich was made, etc. For me - good Customer Service is never forgotten!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident, best gluten free breakfast sandwich in awhile. Sort of like hot pockets. I told them it was our first time here. They brought us a complimentary Kale salad, seriously good tasting. I usually don't like Kale. They had a special breakfast sandwich and Mimosa for $10. Such a deal! We sat outside, beautiful day, the owner stopped over and introduced herself. Trendy little place for a quick breakfast or lunch. Has a happy, open vibe! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Zookz makes some tasty sandwiches!  The sandwiches are in a tasty bread shell.  I had the no. 20 and the flavor combinations are excellent, and the ingredients tasted fresh.  I also had the black bean/corn salad as a side and it was very tasty and refreshing.  The service was also very good, and the sandwich came out quickly after I ordered.  I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time back at Zookz since they moved locations. It is beautiful! Zookz never disappoints and I seriously cannot express how much I love this place. Great food and the customer service you receive is unbeatable. This is a truly all around amazing place!"}
{"text":"It was about damn time when I finally went out and tried this sammich shop. Zookz takes a delicious new look at the classic panini, and I couldn't be happier to report that they're friggin' tasty!   I had a No 25 filled with ham, fresh tomatoes and avocados, seasoned black beans, shredded cheddar cheese, and housemade chipotle sauce. Already the sammich sounded delicious, but I was given the advice, which I kindly accepted, to add bacon. Everything is apparently better with bacon, and this sandwich was no exception to that rule. With my sandwich I had a side of Zookz's potato salad that was also tasty, and definitely fresh!  Friendly staff mixed with delicious and inventive cooking make Zookz a hit in my book, especially for lunch. The only negative I could possibly have is the serving size. If you're a hungry person, they're sandwiches may need to settle a bit before they'll fill you up. That said, don't let that stop you from dropping in! I personally can't wait to go for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and I was pretty impressed! I think it's a little bit pricey, but at least everything is freshly made and is very yummy! I got a #25."}
{"text":"I came here mid afternoon for lunch on Sunday. It's in a plaza with a few other very popular spots in an area with quite a few good dining options so it can be easily overlooked. If you have a hard time looking for it just turn into the big plaza on central and camelback.   The interior is set up for a small-mediumish occupancy. You order food at the counter and they bring it to you. The open windows and large glass panel door is a really nice touch as it lets the sun in and brigthens up the dark wood/industrial interior.   I ordered the #33 adding avocado and chicken. Be aware that the sandwiches are quite small, one would probably easily in the palm of an adult's hand. But they are packed to the brim with their fresh ingredients and are quite filling.   The one thing I was really looking forward to was their poached eggs they put in the sandwich and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. It was a soft deliciously poached egg smack inside of a toasted sandwich. I'm not sure how they actually put the poached egg in there to be honest. I wish the yolk inside would've been runny but I can imagine it'd make the sandwiches a lot messier.  Although the ingredients inside the sandwich were terrific I really disliked the bread they used. I'm not sure what it was but it felt like toasted plain white wonderbread brushed with olive oil. It tasted flimsy with little substance and I found myself wanting to skip the bread and just eat the insides. I wish they used bread that was a bit better and more substantial but overall this is a great spot to get a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I must be missing something  here.. I stopped in yesterday  and ordered the #35.. Very little ingredients  for the stiff price of $9 with tax.. I found it average at best and won't  be rushing back.. (Woman at the counter  wasn't  very friendly  either)"}
{"text":"New place and I must say... WOW  New start up businesses take notes, this is how you get happy customers. Staff is friendly and understands the products. Neat atmosphere, Great food with a Unique touch and very fair prices.   Has a very new age urban feel, yet still professional."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The second time I came here the owner told me her story and talked with my friend and me for a while. She also had us try a side that she was working on at the time. It was great to witness such genuine passion. The food: absolutely delicious. Their breakfast and lunch options are incredible. I've tried almost all of them, and have yet to be disappointed. In addition to this, it is always extremely clean. The employees are all pleasant. The prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food you get."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Places... The prices are now Fair and the Food is always on point,, The  Owner is Just So friendly.."}
{"text":"This doesn't even fall into the category of sandwich because it is so much more amazing than just a sandwich!   Nom nom nom!  If you like anything between bread you have to try it. That's all there is to this place. A must stop. Cute story, cute decor, kind staff and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic and fun sandwich shop on Central! The sandwiches are all interesting and delicious and pressed with perfectly crispy edges!   I had the #25, Chipotle sauce with avocado, black beans, ham, cheese, and some sort of Pico salsa. It wasn't spicy, but it was delicious. My husband and daughter both loved their sandwiches as well.   Aside from great food, the costumer service here is beyond exceptional. I'm hard pressed to think of any place I've been that's more accommodating, helpful, and sincerely good with kids. I love this place and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I have tried almost every Breakfast sandwich on their menu. It's all a homerun. So inventive and original. Quality product and great price."}
{"text":"Boy, are you in for a taste sensation! ! I ordered #25, ham and cheddar, etc and hubby got #35 roast beef. Wow oh WOW! ! Both are excellent,  can't decide which is favorite,  both are just pain yummy! ! And that potato salad is to die for,  a long with the kale,  which I could eat every day!! The place is just south of Camelback, on the west side of Central Ave. Very cute and clean interior,  with outside eating also. Staff is very friendly,  and eager to explain \"Zooks\". Carol, the owner is delightful, warm and friendly.  They also cater, which is good news, because you just want to share these sandwiches and salads with family and friends! !     They serve breakfast and lunch sandwiches,  all is available during store hours."}
{"text":"Awesome.  It's different, it's (can be) healthy, it's clean, it's delicious, it's, quick, and it's a great price.  Good spot for sure."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today and the sandwich #10 and kale salad were amazing. Next time we'll try one of the breakfast sandwiches. Owner is a sweetheart and the place has a great vibe. Highly recommended!!!  Teas are also amazing."}
{"text":"New fave little cafe! This place is so cute, very bright, and the ambience emanates! Staff was very friendly, I had difficulty finding it, called, and they were incredibly helpful. They gave me order suggestions, but I had an idea of what I wanted. I got a passion fruit mimosa that they fresh squeeze the juices, and was DELICIOUS! I also got a turkey, cranberry, pineapple, carrot, almond and curry sandwich, served almost on a panini type sandwich. DELISH! Will absolutely be back and can't wait to try the whole menu! They also have delicious looking breakfast items, and a plethora of coffee options."}
{"text":"Popped in on a Sat morning.  Cute place,  delicious food.  We had the number 44. Very tasty."}
{"text":"Zookz is awesome and the owners are so nice! My daughter cant eat eggs, so they accomodate her No. 44 request No Egg - Extra ham every time. They are wonderful and the ZOOKZ are so tasty and  priced affordably. We try to get to Zookz at least every few weeks. If you have not tried this place, you will not be dissapointed. Try it!"}
{"text":"Wow yes!!! I will absolutely come here again!!!! The owner greeted us and told us favorites we picked the No 20 sandwich! It's sooooooooo beyond good!!!!!!! Thank you for an amazing lunch!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow the food here is on point, I love the space ship looking toasted sandwich. Not to crispy and not to soft, perfect blend. Fast, simple and very enjoyable. M To bad I didn't check in on Yelp to get 10% off. I want to come back again. 5 Stars all the way!"}
{"text":"So good! The sandwiches are delicious! The portion size is normal sized for a an average person. I got full off of a lunch sandwich and side of potato salad. Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"Real pleasure stopping in for an awesome breakfast sandwich this mornng, meeting Carol and learning about her awesome shop.  She said she's poured her heart and soul into the shop the last three years and it shows.  So happy she's moving a few blocks north to the restored Uptown Plaza.  Sounds like a great indoor/outdoor seating area right on Camelback is coming.  Save me a spot please!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I were looking for a place to go to lunch the other day. She said that I had not steered her wrong yet on picking restaurants based on yelp reviews. Zookz Sandwiches helped me continue with my success. Their sandwiches are unique and delicious. I would describe them almost like a fresh hot pocket, but way better than a hot pocket.The owner is super nice and let my friend and I try the kale salad, cause she said it was a must. She was absolutely right! the kale salad was amazing and I will definitely be ordering it my next visit. We both thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and experience. My coworker even went back the next day with another coworker.  :)"}
{"text":"What a great find!! The food was exceptional and we loved the vibe of this place. The owner Carol welcomed us and walked us through he menu- feels like a family here! I'm visiting from San Francisco - please open one there!"}
{"text":"Even though we had were already kind of full, we had to hit up Zookz. Love all the food, great service, awesome place!! Thank you Carol, Bevy Jo, and the rest of the crew!!"}
{"text":"We went to Zook's from a friends reccomendation.  We walked in and it was the cutest clean and fun all mixed together.  The staff at the counter were smiling and happy.  Later found out one of them was the owner.  She was great and personable.  I tried the ham, brie and apricot preserves sandwich.  when it arrived, I was surprised by the cute pocket sandwich.   Hot and fresh.  The kale salad side dish was great too.  ( I am not a kale fan).   Definitely a place I will return to and try one of the morning poached egg sandwiches.  They looked delicious.  Hours are 7 am - 3pm.  Stop by for a great healthy breaskast to start your day."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here for a breakfast sandwich and on Sunday they have mimosas. The people are friendly atmosphere casual. I am a fan and will definitely continue to return."}
{"text":"WHOA - I did not expect that much deliciousness from a simple breakfast sandwich! the staff was patient & kind despite the place being packed for lunch. I couldn't decide between two, but the sweet cashier gave a recommendation that I was THRILLED with! The #66 has to be one of the best brekky sandwiches ever! skip the boring bagel, and try this unique little sandwich pocket!!!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place with large windows so you have lots of natural lighting. Portions are a filling size and it comes with a side salad!! I'm a health freak so I'm super into super foods and they had a mandarin kale salad that was delish! Employees were very sweet. I'd say y'all should go in and give it a try:)"}
{"text":"Ordered a number 11 breakfast sandwich via Uber eats with an espresso coffee. I was super hungry and in a rush to get to work, and needed a quick fix for breakfast. I decided to give them a try because of the reviews.   Not sure if I chose an underwhelming sandwich or if it declined in quality from the ride over...but I probably won't order that sandwich again. Hate to say it, but I would have preferred a breakfast sandwich from the mermaid queen of coffee aka SB. Might be awhile before I try this place again...To each their own. On the plus side the coffee was good and delivery was prompt."}
{"text":"Omg zooks is so delicious....the staff Stacy, Goergee were both awesome and delivered great customer service...I highly recommend this place my daughter , my grand daughter and myself...  Order#60 & #20 both were fantasic ...the sides are awesome too!!!"}
{"text":"A girlfriend of mine recommended this place so I decided to stop in and check it out for lunch.  The staff was very friendly the second I walked in the door and I was greeted by a number of their staff.  I had never been before so the employees were helpful and made recommendations based on their personal favorite sandwiches as well as popular orders from other customers.  I selected the #20 without tomatoes and the citrus kale salad as my side.  Both were excellent!  Overall it was a great experience, great food, pleasant staff, very reasonably priced and awesome outdoor patio.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I passed this place driving by and thought the storefront looked fun so we thought we'd give it a try.   Zookz is kind of an order-up sandwich place. Order at the counter, sit down and they serve you. Nice and casual.   One thing I really liked about this place is that the person at the counter was very helpful and was ready with suggestions for those of us newbies. The sandwiches here are interesting in that they are sealed/seared into circles so all the goodies are on the inside not leaking out the back end. The other great thing is that they are really open to substitutions and customization so that you can have the exact sandwich you want. I don't even think they charged me for adding an ingredient. We each got the #20, which is the bacon turkey avocado. He got his per the menu and I swapped the mustard for the chipotle sauce and added roasted red peppers.   On first impression I will be honest I thought I would still be hungry when I was finished, but watch out the size is deceiving! Halfway through I had started to get full, so portion size was actually perfect.  Oh, and try the kale salad. I was skeptical about this as well because I don't normally like kale but this was really good. Julienned with mandarin oranges and almonds. Really tasty.   All in all, a very yummy lunch for about $17 for two. I'd love to go back next time I'm close to downtown."}
{"text":"I wanted to give Zooks 5 stars but it falls a tiny bit short. The flavors are amazing and unique. There's definitely nothing like this anywhere! The Kale salad and it's house-made dressing are phenomenal!! :) BUT! Two-bites and it's gone. The portions are way too small. Not a good idea when your boyfriend refuses to go because he needs at least 3 sandwiches to feel satisfied. If you do the math, that's about $18-20, with no drink. Hopefully Zooks will add a \"Big Boy\" size one day soon."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Zookz sandwiches quite a bit.  Their breakfast sandwiches in particular, as I'd pick one up before work.  No more.  I learned a dirty little secret.  Their bread is delivered and stored outside their back door on the ground.  Yep.  On the ground.  They keep it outside for several hours while they are open and could possibly move it indoors.  Aside from the obvious, they're located in the same complex as a large condo building, one that's dog-friendly, and has lots of pets.  So, the next time you have a Zookz sandwich, check to see if there is perhaps a little extra flavor to the bread.  Shame on you Zookz.  Change your ways."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good, but the crust is a little tough.  We had the carrot cake and it was out of this world fabulous!"}
{"text":"Wonderful!  Fresh, fun sandwiches and more.  Tasty and unexpected combinations make the sandwiches delightfully unique.  Great new location in Uptown Plaza is a hit with lots of seating.  Service is great too.  I have been many times and never a bad experience."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places here in Phoenix! I love love love this place. My favorite is the #25 with Turkey replacing the ham. I recommend this to all of you!"}
{"text":"You've gotta try it! A great variety of delicious combinations, toasted into sandwich pockets. Worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Great little sandwich!!! Make sure to read the whole story on the wall about how zookz came to be! Just with that makes you want to order mother one for grandma!"}
{"text":"I can't recommend this sandwich joint high enough!   It makes paninis look old hat.  We tried the turkey and cranberry and the ham and Brie with apricot chutney.   Yumm!  The kale salad and pasta salad are fresh and delish.   The prices are very reasonable for such high quality ingredients.   To top it off, they are canine friendly in their patio and offer dog treats!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are very flavorful and a decent size (not too big) for lunch. Also comes with salad. I enjoyed the #35 Roast Beef & cheddar with tomato, bacon, & horseradish. Quite tasty! And the kale salad is light an refreshing with mandarin oranges.  Very healthy option when you're looking for fast-food alternative."}
{"text":"Quality good but portion small. Easy place for informal business meet. Staff super pleasant and helpful but may need 2 sandwiches next time to fill this belly!"}
{"text":"Both the sandwiches I shared were delicious.  They use uncommon ingredients that really give this quick sandwich place such upscale flavor. I love how crispy and warm the sandwiches are.  The sides were awesome especially the kale salad."}
{"text":"Omg let me just say best sandwich ever ! Not only is there sandwiches the bomb .com but the customer service is outstanding  the decor is amazing gives you a beach vibe very vibrant and they play good music !! Get the number 20 with the potato salad and must get a cookie lol very good will be back and I will recommend"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, a cool concept, and has awesome customer service. I love their breakfast sandwiches! GET THE KALE SALAD."}
{"text":"One of the best \"sandwich\" shops in all of Phoenix. Its circular design is very unique and traps in all of the goodness inside. They have a wide range of breakfast and lunch zupas to choose from, and their side salads such as the Kale are super good. The owner is super friendly . She truly enjoys what she does, and is often times behind the counter serving her guests. If you haven't tried it out, you should. BTW they also do catering!"}
{"text":"Cool concept in a very cute environment.  Cute trendy place serving grilled sandwiches in an uncrustable type fashion. Yummy sides to go along with your sandwich.  Great choice of iced teas  Will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious excellent flavor combinations not over powering friendly helpful caring staff will be back definitely!!!!!"}
{"text":"3/4/17 I ordered a #22 - 2 1/2 stars  I ordered a #3 - 4 Stars  FINALLY - a good salad, the vinaigrette was delicious.  I will definitely be back for this salad.  I do have a question about the pricing...it's my fault that I didn't ask for a receipt.  $19.88 seems a bit pricey especially when I had 10% off with my Yelp check in."}
{"text":"we order here several times every week because it's delicious healthy fresh food.  The pricing is fair even when you include Uber delivery and the customer service and the owner is amazing.  I wish everything were as amazing as Zookz"}
{"text":"My husband and I took a late morning ride to our fave bookstore and decided to use the gift card for Zookz that someone had given him, for an early lunch. Now is the time to experience this place...while it's still not too hot out. We sat close to the wide open doors and got a nice mist going while we ate our sandwiches.  Try the #20 on the menu, their most popular sandwich.  If you've been stuck out in the burbs of Phoenix, now is the time to support the small establishments that have cropped up in the central corridor area of downtown Phx.  A great place to try out some awesome sandwiches, either breakfast or lunch. They have outdoor seating, but the parking is on the short side, so do this...............get there early on a Sunday morning, bring your fave electronic gadget or NYTimes, and enjoy the kind of weather other parts of the country will only see in 2 months............"}
{"text":"In AZ on vacation and wanted to try something new. Was extremely  happy with the food and atmosphere! The portions are a good size,  enough to be full but not over stuff yourself. They have a couple of natural teas with no added sugar which are all really good too. I highly recommend the No.20"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches!  Perfectly toasty, melty and delicious. We had the breakfast sandwiches,  which were some of the best we've ever had! So good we took 2 \"to go\". If you've got a sweet tooth try the dessert sandwiches ... they too are something special!"}
{"text":"I live in San Franciso and was visiting mom in Phoenix, when two of my mother's friends turned us on to Zookz for sandwiches.    My mother and I have lived all over the world and we really appreciate a good meal and yes, and it takes a little to surprise us -but Zookz did in a very delicious way.     Zookz sandwiches are indeed unique/cutting edge and incredibly flavorful.  We had #30 and #45 - we split them so that we could each try two, additionally, the kale salad was tender and flavorful.  (Despite the amazing nutritional properties of kale, I am only a kale fan if it's tender,  doesn't have a real strong kale flavor and is tasty - this salad met all of those requirements :)) Last but far from least was Zookz chocolate dessert. It was truly an after thought as I really didn't think a \"sandwich nook\" would have an exceptional dessert in their \"to go\" refregerated case; however, my mother who has a real sweet tooth insisted on splitting a dessert :)   I am a true chocoholic - very selective - I went in for that first bite with an average expectation and wow!  My mother and I were competing for the finish :)  Carol, the owner, came up and introduced herself while we were trying to decide on what to order.  We peppered her with questions on sandwiches as well as Zookz origination, given we just read the history of Zookz on the wall which begged more questions... We found out that Carol too has had the fortunate history of living abroad along with a real passion for baking and cooking.  Prior to starting Zookz, Carol made and distributed a number of her own receipes, including homemade sauces which she incorporates into her sandwiches.  Carol is a true inspiration starting Zookz after the age of 50.  She is an energetic, very attractive businesswoman who has created a unique and delicious sandwich not just to Phoenix but the United States - I have never had anything like it!  I look forward to returning on my next visit,  tasting several more sandwiches along with another chocolate dessert :)!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place and the idea is genius! I love the sandwiches, they taste so good, perfectly seasoned and totally out the box idea! I met the owner and I loved hearing about her background and how she came to open the restaurant. I'm looking forward to going back for seconds soon!"}
{"text":"Ok small toasted sandwich for $8.50. Kind of like those Crustless PBJs you can buy frozen. Came with a side salad. I picked rice salad, the rice was not cooked, the salad was inedible. Wish I gone somewhere else since there are others restaurants in the shopping center."}
{"text":"One day, after scouring Yelp for a breakfast spot loved by all I stumbled upon Zookz Sandwiches, a central Phoenix, family owned shop specializing in crafting circular sandwiches. After visiting a few times and receiving consistent service I have been a regular, visiting once every two or three weeks, just enough for the small group of employees to remember my name and order. The menu is fairly simple with no more than two dozen sandwich choices for their breakfast and lunch menus, which is served all-day. Identified solely by numbers the ordering is a little unique. When placing an order the number gets written on a small brown bag, similar to a pastry bag, and handed off to the back. Remaining loyal to my 44, partially due to the cheaper price, I've never been disappointed. Frittata eggs, bacon, ham, basil, red peppers, and feta cheese are all toasted to perfection in a special apparatus used to craft the pockets. After placing your order at the till, you are given a number and choose a seat, where an employee will deliver your order to you. Their sandwiches are delivered on long rectangular trays, a little odd, and inside that brown bag from earlier is your sandwich on a round paper plate holding the halves together. As you wait for your meal or eat away, employees coming around to wipe free tables or tend to the floor strike up conversation and make sure you enjoy your visit. Their customer service is genuine, the conversation flows organically and never seems forced. When you walk in you are greeted by a smiling face and a genuine hello, typically from the owner.   The concept of a circular, panini like, sandwich was introduced to the owner by her grandmother while she lived back in Egypt. The modifications her grandmother made to recreate them for her grandchildren became entrenched in the owner's childhood and eventually the motivation to begin this shop here in Phoenix. They offer breakfast and lunch sandwiches, with breakfast sandwiches priced at $5.95 and lunch sandwiches are around $7.95 although they are the same small size. This is the only downfall, the relatively high price of a full meal with sides, as they cost just as much as the lunch sandwich options. It's only due to the excessively large drinks, either a choice herbal tea or soft drink my breakfast choice can get me full. They also offer a few alcoholic drinks like five-dollar mimosas and some local beers, a plus to them, but I've yet to try any to really share an opinion on whether this seemingly low price is a good deal or speaks to the quality of the drinks.   They do tend to get pretty packed in the mornings and lunch time, as they are located in a high-traffic area but there's plenty of outdoor and indoor seating. With small two-person free standing tables, a long cushioned bench along one wall, a larger table along another side, and individual seating neat the door they've got you covered. These wooden tables and the bright yellow and gray themed décor and intimate feel inside fits well into the somewhat posh area. A sweet touch is the large mural of the owner's grandmother that runs along one wall. I assume due to them being in central Phoenix their hours are more catered to accommodate a typical 9-to-5 worker's schedule, making it the perfect breakfast and lunch spot. However, their hours from 7am-4pm, have been another downside for me, as I can hardly find the time to make it in, during their slower times. All-in-all Zookz is definitely worth a try, their friendly service and unique product will leave you wanting more."}
{"text":"LOVE this place...not only for their food but their excellent customer service which seems to stem from the owner herself. Each time I've been here I've been greeted pleasantly by both the owner and staff. My first visit, the staff was in the middle of changing shifts and my food took a little longer than usual. The owner recognized this without me saying anything and brought a free dessert. She even stopped by up make sure I enjoyed everything. My second visit the store was actually closed, but both the staff and owner were more than willing to still take my order. The owner even wiped our table off before I ate because she noticed the recent storm had blown dust on the table just minutes beforehand. It's service like this that really makes this place shine and coupled with the delicious sandwiches will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Wanted something quick and easy and found this place thanks to Yelp. My husband and I shared #20: thinly sliced turkey, crisp bacon, fresh avocado and tomatoes, shredded cheddar cheese, Zookz sweet heat mustard sauce. The sandwich comes with a side of your choice (kale salad, potato salad or garbanzo bean salad) and a drink. We picked the garbanzo as a side and pomegranate iced tea. The sandwich came out hot and toasty and the first bite I had was pretty tasty! They bake their bread in a special cylindrical pan so every bite had a lot of flavor and it was so crispy! I love cheesy crispy bread! Reminds of me grilled cheese sandwiches but better! The garbanzo beans was also a good choice! I choose this side because it was different. I've had many kale & potato salads before so thought giving garbanzo salad a try and it was very good. I actually want to try making this at home. The pomegranate ice tea was a refreshing choice and just what we needed since it was so HOT today! While we were eating, the owner also came up to us and asked us how everything was and was really sweet.  We really enjoyed everything we ordered here and definitely want to go back to try some of their other sandwiches especially their breakfast ones!"}
{"text":"AWESOME!! If you are in PHX, you need to to go. Stacy was awesome and we loved hearing the amazing history of the sandwich (epic!) from Carol. Thank you"}
{"text":"The morning was still. A late night of golf, cigars, and Super Smash Bros has worn out our lowly bachelor-partying crew, and we were desperate to find a breakfast place to energize us on our long trip home to the promised land of Tucson.   But lo! We discovered Zookz. The owner herself greeted us as we wandered inside, took our order and hand-delivered our sandwiches. The sandwiches were absolutely delicious, no additional fluff needed. My only complaint is that there isn't a Zookz in every room of my house.   This young fellow will be heard home with a grin and full stomach. Many thanks to you, Zookz."}
{"text":"Popped in for a sandwich while in AZ for business. The owner Carol greeted me with the warmest welcome in the desert.  She's truly a sweetheart. The sandwiches are empanada-like and mine was DELICIOUS. I got the #10. Some turkey concoction that would order again and again.    Thanks for the yummmy lunch Carol"}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast on our way out of town.  The ladies were very friendly and didn't mind some special requests (for my kiddos).  The sandwiches were very tasty and just the right size. Will definitely come again to try their lunch sandwiches/salads."}
{"text":"This place was so cute! I loved the decorations as well as the vibe of the place!  It was pretty modern, yet rustic at the same time! I really enjoyed the uniqueness of it all! But, on to what I'm actually here for, I really liked the food! I got number 35 and my bro got 20. Next time, I'd probably get number 20 because the horseradish sauce on number 35 was a little too strong, and overpowered the rest of the flavor that I otherwise could've enjoyed. I don't count that against them because it was my choice on the sandwich. I tried some of number 20 and my mind was blown! It was so good! My mom also got number 20 with ham instead of turkey. From the circle-sandwiches to the sunflowers, this place was awesome!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, and a good sandwich, with fun side salads to try. They checked on me during my meal and grabbed a napkin for me without my having to ask. Would recommend to anyone in uptown for lunch."}
{"text":"First time here at Zookz and so excited to be here after reading the reviews on Yelp. Met the owner Carol.. She was so nice and gave us good recommendations. Picked the #66 without the onions and added avocados. Loved it! Choose the Kale Salad as your side, it's the best  If you're in the Phoenix area, make sure to check this place out for breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches.  Unique, tasty, flavorful...  #20 & 35 are my favorites.  How do they make those sandwiches so crispy and perfect?   If you are downtown, do not pass this place up!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches! I have had the #11 and the #20. They were fresh and delicious. The kale salad is also delightful! If you haven't tried this restaurant, you have to go!"}
{"text":"I know Zookz may not be everyone's favorite sandwich joint, but I think it's all about ordering the right sandwich for you.  I love #20 and my husband always loves #66, and I appreciate that their sandwiches are always warm and toasty without the greasiness of a grilled cheese.  Their teas are delicious and I love not having to wait for them to bring me my side so I can whet my appetite as I wait.  Service is always exceptional, regardless of how busy they may be!"}
{"text":"Just came in for breakfast. Checked online for their nutritional information and couldn't find any information so I asked the employees about the nutritional information taking them I didn't see anything on their website. They all seemed lost and asked each other and went to the back then came back out and said there is nothing on our website. I said, \" I know I checked the website that's why I am asking if there's any where else I can find any nutritional information\". They said, \" no sorry I guess not\". Ok. Poor customer service as well as not good to not provide any nutritional information for those of us who have to log and keep track of sugar levels for diabetic reasons."}
{"text":"This was our first time here because we're from LA. The owner greeted us and helped us pick our breakfast. We got No 11 and No 66 and substituted for egg whites. Both so good! Definitely recommend. Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"A splendid little uptown spot with arguably the most unique sandwiches in the city -perfect portions and great texture - upbeat and friendly staff completed the experience. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"We've loved this place since it first opened.  But about 1.5 years ago my s.o. had to go gluten free, among other dietary changes...so we didn't come as often.  But now they have gluten free bread! And it's amazing! In some ways it's even better than the regular bread.    Zookz has the most wonderful sandwiches & it was a happy day for us when they were able to make a gluten free one :)"}
{"text":"Zookz is a fun little stop to grab breakfast. It has seating both inside and out (the outer seating is very limited). Everything is made into these wonderful little sandwiches and it follows the recent trend of counter service with a flair. Although I cant recall the name of the exact breakfast sandwich I had consumed, I can tell you that it was delicious! The restaurant itself is both cute and quaint being tucked into the easternmost portion of Uptown Mall.   Twyla and I opted for the Mimosas which were a little top heavy in O.J. My first comment was that if they were going use a disposable glass for the drink, at least get something that Champagne would be served in. A 5oz squat plastic cup was not the ticket for me and really retracted from the experience of drinking a Mimosa. Additionally, If your operation does not have a dishwasher, there are ways to give your customers a more upscale feel without tapping into your profitability too heavily. I'm sure that they do not pour hundreds of these per day. Is the \"Dollar Store\" ringing a bell.   Our patio location was very enjoyable and ambiance was great for our breakfast. All of the staff that we had encountered were super nice and very helpful. Don't worry Zookz, We'll be back to see you but I'm going to ask what glass my Mimosa is coming in or I'll bring my own disposable...  #Irishcatv2 #vino2 #Vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"Decent roast beef, bacon, cheddar, and horseradish sandwich.  No. 35.  Taste is decent nothing extraordinary.  3-stars.  The roast beef is standard low end roast beef you can get at the grocery store.  Bacon, not even good quality bacon.  The cheddar cheese was on the mediocre level.  All lower end ingredients.  The kale salad is very good.  It has a nice fun taste to it.  4-stars.  They are fun to eat and the place has a nice selection of caffeinated and non-caffeinated teas.  Nice atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"Wait Time: 10 minutes for food.   Unique Factor: 5/5 - Elevated Smuckers! - That might be an understatement. Unique flavor combos served between toasted crustless bread is something so simple, yet satisfying. Great place for a light lunch, or nice breakfast. The eggs in their breakfast sandwich are cooked perfectly. We need one in the Bay Area!  Service: Friendly Staff and Owner. We were offered a dessert sandwich on the house!"}
{"text":"What a great unique little find. These sandwiches are not only fun but delicious. The owner came over to personally check on us and was very nice. Make sure you finish with the Nutella, peanut butter, & banana for dessert... DELICIOUS. They lose one star for parking but I hear new locations are on the docket and I look forward to them as well.  Overall the food is worth finding a space. Delicious, quick and fun for all ages."}
{"text":"Unique sandwiches & perfect portion for a light lunch. I had the pomegranate green tea & the kale salad to pair with my sandwich (#20 is the most popular). Kenny was very helpful in suggesting what sandwiches were best to try. I ordered The Zinger (one of their most popular sandwiches posted on the wall) for breakfast tmrw & he made sure it was in a to go bag & not cut in half, that way you could heat it up with no issues for the next day. If you get a lunch sandwich you can combine it with a salad of your choice or a bag of chips. They have iced tea or you can choose a beverage from their fountain drinks. If you choose a breakfast sandwich, it's a la carte, so i suggest a lunch sandwich to experience the whole shebang! You don't want to cut yourself short on a foodie adventure. No one likes a person who half-asses anything. Go all out! Or be bold an order 2 sandwiches! They also have something sweet for those of you who are sweettooths."}
{"text":"Fabulous! New favorite place to eat! Cool atmosphere and excellent food, as well as quick service! I ordered the #22 breakfast sandwich and would definitely order it again. They do breakfast all day, and also have lunch sandwiches available too. My only complaint, is that there's only one location! Crossing my fingers for more locations!"}
{"text":"Love this little, unusual sandwich place with the nicest owner, Carol. Fantastic tasting sandwiches that she happily custom orders. Really yummy, I can't wait to try more of those tasty little pouches. I will say though they are a little on the small side; and, their juice/sparkling water could use a lot better selections, but Carol and her genuine friendliness make up for it for this rating."}
{"text":"I love how genuinely happy and helpful the staff are. Of the two times I've been to Zookz, the owner has approached me and asked if everything was up to par and how I heard about them.   I had the Turkey Avocado sandwich (I believe it's No. 20) and it's delicious! I also had the kale salad which was really good :) I'll be back!"}
{"text":"So after reading all of the reviews and seeing the delectable pictures of the sandwiches here, I just had to try this place out. I happened to be in the area, so lucky me.  I was impressed by the store front. Very modern, with large open windows and this really cool, big glass door. I can see this place great as a spot to work at.  I got 2  breakfast sandwiches. I don't remember the numbers though. One was their classic one made of poached egg, bacon, basil, and cream cheese. The other was made as a frittata with red peppers, bacon, ham, and Chipotle cream.  They were definitely stuffed and I loved the crispy bread. But with the rave reviews, I was expecting more. I feel like flavor was lacking and I find myself sad after eating it. I make breakfast sandwiches that are so tasty and I wasted my appetite on something less than expected.  While the sandwiches weren't bad, I will just find myself somewhere else for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME! Think of those uncrustable pb & j sandwiches but AMAZING and filled with all sorts of things-like turkey, avocado, etc. all in warm bread! This place is a huge hit and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I wouldn't really recommend this place to anyone. Food is meh. Nothing special. Wouldn't eat here a second time. Save your money. You're just buying gentrified uncrustables."}
{"text":"I travel to this area periodically on business. I always include a stop at Zookz for a sandwich. I have ordered several of the lunch sandwiches and all of them have been very good. Additionally, the staff are very friendly and the service is super fast. Although one sandwich is plenty for me, a larger eater would not be filled up with just one. My teenage son who plays football would need about four of them :-)"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to eat breakfast or lunch and thanks to Yelp I decided to try this place out.   Zookz has a really relaxing atmosphere, owner is very friendly and helpful. I got the #25 which consisted of ham, tomatoes, avocados, black beans, shredded cheddar cheese and chipotle sauce. Portion size was good for the price too ($7 and some change for the sandwich).  All menu items sounded delicious, and the sandwiches come with either chips or kale salad (for all you kale lovers). I'd definitely come back here again and hope to try out the breakfast items next time.  Bonus tip: Check in on foursquare and you'll receive 15% discount. It's a May deal only so I highly suggest you check this place out and get the discount!"}
{"text":"Delicious, Fresh, Great Price, Fast Service!  Ordered a #3 mixed green salad online for a quick lunch one afternoon and I was pleasantly surprised at how fresh and delicious it tasted.  I was early picking up my order but they had it ready for me.  Was greeted by both the owner (I think she's the owner) and the cashier - great customer service.  My expectations for a healthy salad at lunch were not very high, but this was absolutely delicious, had chx breast, black beans, sunflower seeds, corn, and this awesome honey balsamic vinaigrette.  Even though it was simple ingredients, the fact that they were fresh and high-quality made all the difference.  Normally I don't get salads this good without paying over $10 OR making them myself.  Highly recommend this place for a delicious lunch and it's super affordable.  The sandwiches look amazing....brie and ham for less than $7??!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service! My friend had been dying to try this place. When we came in we were greeted and while looking at the menu, the owner came out and greeted us and struck a conversation with us and helped us with the menu since it was our first time. I believe I got a No. 40. The sandwich was unique and delicious . It was surprisingly filling too. I couldn't even finish it. This place is definitely worth a try as it will not be like any sandwich you have ever had."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of sandwiches, but when I read about Zookz and saw how unique their style of sandwiches are, I had to stop by during my trip to Phoenix.  They have this cool contraption that makes the sandwiches and they end up a circular shape.  I got the no. 11 sandwich.  It was one of the breakfast sandwiches with 2 poached eggs, bacon, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, basil, and cream cheese for $5.75, very delicious.   I love how all the flavors just mesh well together and the touch of basil really gives it a good kick.  The amount of cheese was just right.  The service was great and it is in a big plaza, so parking will not be an issue! Great sandwich place!"}
{"text":"Ahhh the memories of camp pies. Sitting around the campfire with a cast iron press, grab two slices of bread and some filling and you're on you're way. Egg, roast beef, spaghetti, berries, apple pie, or what have you. Zookz have capitalized on the idea and have turned it into a thriving business, and their sandwiches are top notch.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  The service is fast and friendly at Zookz, and they're simplified the process so that you'll have a sammie in hand shortly after ordering at the counter. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  The sandwiches at Zookz aren't huge, but they're priced affordably, and my #22 breakfast sandwich with egg, ham, black beans, and chipotle sauce came to only $6.50, which was a great price point. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  As others have stated, the bread is what really makes the difference here. I don't know whether they add some spices to the mix or what, but I could have eaten the bread plain. From there, the fillings in my breakfast sandwich came together nicely into what was a good sandwich, although I'll note that my sandwich was seriously lacking in the ham department. Single Star Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  I've known of camp pies for decades now, but I'm thrilled that someone has made a great business out of it. I'd gladly come here daily. Star Granted."}
{"text":"\"Meh, I've experienced better\" perfectly describes this place.  In fact, I ditched my plug in grilled cheese maker years ago, maybe they are coming back into fashion, I don't know. Either way, all the sandwiches here are pressed and grilled in a circular fashion.  Not many options for a herbivore either, I think one sandwich, and maybe a sweet nutella version.  Again, totally underwhelming experience.  Won't be coming back....well, ever.  Make the trip a few blocks south to Pane Bianco, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time for lunch, and it was really good! It's a really cute spot and in a great location, next door to a lot of other fun places like Huss or Flower Child.   They have really good prices, and you get a lot for your money. The sandwiches all come with your choice of three side salads, but the sandwiches themselves are definitely filling enough. I also noticed you can get craft beer for only $3.75!  We each got the No. 44, which is basically a caprese sandwich. It definitely wasn't the best one I've ever had, but it was still really good! I think what I didn't like was that the cheese wasn't melty and the sandwich wasn't that hot, which is more of a personal opinion :) And their bread is amazing!  The staff were all really nice and helpful, and the owner even came out and asked us if we enjoyed our food. It was really nice! I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm hooked on Zookz!  A friend raved about their sandwiches to me on a Saturday, and since they're only open M-F now, I was craving them even before my first bite! And my friend was right about it all... Delicious ingredients- hot, flavorful, fresh, wholesome- in an easy-to-eat pocket sandwich with crispy sealed edge. The serving size was perfect- just the right amount without leaving me hungry or too full. And the price was great- I think I spent around $6 for the #44 (2 egg frittata w bacon, ham, feta, parmesan, roasted red peppers & basil) and a large green iced tea. And I also had to buy the #55 to-go, because how could I walk away without dessert for later... peanut butter, nutella, bananas, and  roasted almonds! A great big YUM! The staff was super friendly and helpful. Carole, the owner, made it a point to say hi and ask how I enjoyed my food. I loved the garage door front that allowed in the beautiful fall morning air and sunshine. And even the bright natural colors and fruit/veggie mural on the wall gave it a feel-good vibe. I will definitely be back to try even more of their sandwich creations... as well as their salads. I hear Carole's homemade dressings are amazing!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches taste good but not blown away and they are pretty pricey for what u get. I have to order two to get a meal big enough to fill me up."}
{"text":"I think this place is awesome! The restaurant alone is adorable and the owner who I got the pleasure of meeting is really nice! It had great customer service and it's easy to order a delicious sandwich. I ordered the #20 with the garbanzo salad which was super tasty! My favorite part of this place is not only was there a beautiful portrait of the owners grandmother on the wall but also there was a collage of her story on how she started  Zookz! I highly recommend this place to anyone that wants a warm fast sandwich!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and amazing sandwiches. Definitely a must try. It was our first time here and it definitely won't be our last. Had the #66 breakfast sandwich. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was great! The place is cute! I somehow came across this place on Instagram and couldn't wait to try it. The price for a lunch sandwhich is a bit overpriced however. I understand that it comes with a side but it is still very very pricey. Please re-consider the Lunch Sandwhich prices."}
{"text":"Number 22 is my favorite, I've been going here since it first opened up years ago and I go at least 3-5 times a month. They always have great customer service and delicious sandwiches. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Quick easy place with delicious food! Stopped here this afternoon and I had bookmarked it a couple of years ago. Was happy to see a few delicious looking vegetarian options! I got 45 which had mozzarella, spinach, tomatoes, and some kinda delicious sauce on it. The sandwich being pressed that way made it a little easier to eat while driving haha. Plus the crisp bread was fantastic. I got a kale and carrot salad as my side and it was delicious. While I was waiting the owner was walking around and talking to people, she seemed very friendly! Food isn't priced too bad either for such wonderful stuff. I'd be happy to come back here!"}
{"text":"5 stars just cause i got a free sandwich for waiting too long. lol i'm a lazy writer but i had a good time so five stars."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom!!!! So I dont remember whats my sandwich was called but it had apple and turkey along with something else.. it was suggested to me by the owner..and it was a good call..ps she was super sweet.. but the bread part was delicious!!! You should def give them a try!"}
{"text":"You have to read the story on the wall.  I read the story while I waited for my zook and it made me enjoy my meal so much more.  I dunno, it really touched me, like I still think about the story weeks later.    Zookz are unique and unlike anything I've ever tasted, they're delicious though.  The strip mall is currently under construction so it wasn't easy to find but it was well worth the search!"}
{"text":"Food: Sandwiches comes with a salad or bag of chips. I had the Kale salad which was good.  - #10: Thinly sliced turkey, slices of green apples, Parmesan cheese, and sweet mustard sauce. Ohhhh, this was so good! My husband and I went halvsies so we can try both sandwiches and I wanted to steal his half! lol. The sandwich is, indeed, unique. It's kind of like a pan fried crispy-soft pita bread. This was my favorite out of the two. 5/5  - #20: Thinly sliced turkey, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, shredded cheddar cheese, and sweet mustard sauce. This was good as well. It was a little messier to eat because it was stuffed with fillings. It, too, had good flavor. 4.5/5  Service: The cashier was really friendly and talkative. I did mention that I found Zookz through Yelp but the waitress failed to mention that if I checked in I would get 10% off. I have a habit of checking in while I'm waiting for my food, in other words, too late. It would have been nice if she said something. The owner stopped by to ask us how we liked our sandwiches. She was really nice and approachable. 5/5  Final thoughts: My husband doesn't ever compliment food. Everything is okay to him. But he loved Zookz! He said it was one of the best sandwiches he's ever had. If he likes it, it's gotta be good! I can't wait to come back here when I'm in Arizona!"}
{"text":"The location was adorable, so cute and fun to sit and people watch.  We ordered a 25,30, 20 and the dessert sandwich with Nutella, PB and Bananas.  My daughter thought the horseradish on the 30 was too strong but she still ate the whole sandwich so that tells you how good it was.  The 20 and 25 were both incredible.  The toasted bread is the perfect texture and thickness and the ratio of filling was perfect.  The kale salad wasn't my favorite.  But we were all big fans of the Tims chips.  The sweet sandwich was kind of mushy and just had a strange texture.  It was hard to swallow with the thick Nutella, PB and mushy bananas.  The lady who took our order was so friendly and informative.  I was super impressed with the service.  The sandwiches arrived promptly to our table."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Zooks! I am surprised it is not all over the valley. The staff are amazing, very friendly and seem like they enjoy what they do. The owner is very down to earth too. I had the kale and potato salads-amazing. I also liked the turkey sandwich I had. The meals are light, does not feel fattening! You must check them out"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch this past Tuesday for lunch. Food was deeeelish and super fast. Quality ingredients and modern warm atmosphere. I got the #20 -  turkey, bacon avocado tomato and cheese topped with the most awesome mustard sauce, it was scrumptious. Loved everything about this place except for service. For such a cute inviting place one of the woman behind the register left me a bit irked. She was extremely curt with her answers to my questions about the menu. She seemed very frustrated and acted like I was bothering her. Not very welcoming."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch today at Zookz Sandwiches. My 10 yr. old daughter hesitated given the sandwiches looked different but she really changed her tune after taking a bite. She had the pork and slaw and loved it. Dad snuck in a nibble as well. The family also enjoyed one of the breakfast sandwiches and the roast beef as well. The establishment was very clean and staff were very friendly. A great place for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch today and it was great! I ordered delivery and it came so fast I didn't even have time to wonder where it was. I got Tim's Cascade with Honey BBQ chips and an Oatmeal Coconut Chocolate Chip cookie. The sandwhich was delicious, crunchy on the edges and soft but not soggy in the middle. Great taste and fresh veggies. I will definitely be ordering deliver again! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely addicted to this place. My boyfriend and I stopped by here on a whim while googling places nearby to eat. The sandwiches are always delicious and you can't beat the customer service. I've tried a variety of the menu and it's all good, I haven't been disappointed yet. It's definitely a place to try if you're into sandwiches, comfort food, and a great environment. Now is the time of year to be in Arizona and it's great to dine in a restaurant with the option of sitting outside. I wish there were a way to give this place more than five stars. Try the Zinger and the #25"}
{"text":"Perfect for eat in our car on the way to Sedona lunch. Sandwiches were so yummy. Breakfast sandwich with poached eggs probably wasn't the best for our situation. While good the other two we got were better. We got the 22 with roast beef with horseradish was by far our favorite. The turkey with Parmesan apples and cranberries was also great and a hit with the kids. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I travel across the country nine months per year.  We always look for local favorite breakfast spots on Yelp. This is the most unique experience we have had. The breakfast sandwiches are beyond good.  In fact, we have been there six times over the past two weeks! The restaurant is exceptionally clean and the staff is very friendly. They even remembered our names after the first visit.  The breakfast sandwich is plenty enough for a satisfying meal.  Our favorites are the #22 and the #55 (Nutella, peanut butter, banana, almonds).  Try it once and you will go back. Little wonder it was named \"Best Sandwich Spot\" in the valley by a local magazine."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good, no doubt about it. Definitely get the sides, not the chips with your meal. The sides are where it's at. Never tried the kale salad but I've heard it's very good. You can't really go wrong with any of the sandwiches, but my personal favorite is the No. 20. I've been eating here since they were at the old location right on central, and the new location across the intersection is great! I was worried that with the move the place wouldn't be the same and that the expansion would negatively affect the quality and taste of the food, but it's still great! My only gripe with them is the size of their meals, it's just not enough for me. I am 6'5 with a big appetite so I rarely go when I'm really hungry. With that being said my girlfriend thinks the portions are perfect so don't let that stop you from going! Plus the owner is super nice! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a MUST, if you're in the mood for something new and delicious. The breakfast combos with mimosas are a great weekend meal, and the #55 desert sandwich will blow you away. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Staff is super nice, and the pocket sandwiches are really good -a bit small tho- I LOVE their kale salad: the best in town!"}
{"text":"Freakin' TASTY stuff here, fresh, hot, made-to-order, sweet owner and staff, clean as can be, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"Awesome owner, awesome food, great atmosphere, amazing aura, just a very cool place to grab a quick bite to eat or sit and relax in the funky orange chairs.  The \"pocket\" sandwiches as I like to call it are amazing. I've been here a couple times before and they have these sandwiches dialed in! Brownies/treats are made at home (by the owner) and are very tasty, must try!!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Well they hit it out of the park again. I'm from CA where I own my own Award Winning Sandwich Shop called Noonerz, so when I tell you ZOOKS is one of the Best, Freshest, Coolest, Hottest, Must Do Spots in Phoenix I totally mean it !  And now every single issues Zooks may ever have had are gone as they moved around the corner to Uptown Plaza and everything is a zillion times better.  Check out their extended hours ( don't forget one of the best Breakfast in town) but now they cater ! Zooks is owned by locals and I feel very strongly that we all should shop and eat in our neighborhood, not in some distant chain owned restaurant.  Do yourself a favor, eat there once, you'll be back many times over."}
{"text":"Awesome concept and great taste. Suit to order option and breakfast selections are superb."}
{"text":"Zookz is one of the most creative concepts I've experienced in Phoenix lately. I really love the founder's story of how she began to make these sandwiches and where her inspiration comes from.   If you haven't been to Zookz, let me explain why it's so special.   The founder created a special sandwich press that perfectly toasts a round, crustless sandwich filled with delicious items of your choosing. They have a number of amazing combinations - both sweet and savory, breakfast or lunch options.   I love the menu items with eggs in them, and I LOVE the nutella one, too. Favorites are No. 22,  No. 10, No. 7, and No. 55.   No. 22 2 Poached Eggs, bacon, ham, cheddar cheese, black beans, avocado, zookz Chipotle Sauce  No. 10 Thinly sliced Turkey, crunchy apples, tangy parmesan cheese, cranberries, almonds, zookz Sweet Heat Mustard Sauce  No. 7 (Salad) Kale, shredded carrots, crushed pineapple, coconut, roasted almonds, and zookz voodoo dressing.  No. 55 Peanut butter, nutella, bananas, roasted almonds, and powder sugar  Don't stop at the sandwiches - the side salads are wonderful, too (like No. 7, above)!"}
{"text":"Wow! So amazing. Fresh and flavorful sandwiches. Whatever this bread they use, it's out of this world.   My wife had number 11 and I had the number 35. We also got the garbanzo bean salad...now garbanzo beans are not something I would buy on a trip to sprouts....but this was SOOO good.   The owner (manager? Not sure) came by and made sure we enjoyed our food. She asked if we tried the kale salad and, of course we didn't. My wife knows I hate kale and kale fads...lol...well she made is try it, and I finally found kale I enjoy! It was flavorful and sweet. Very fresh.   We will be back as our church is right up the street."}
{"text":"After seeing amazing #foodporn pics of sandwiches from Zookz via direct mail and on local billboards on numerous occasions, I decided to head over one morning to bite into one!  Zookz offers a central location, plenty of parking, a fast-casual atmosphere, friendly service, free wifi, and indoor/outdoor seating.  The menu consists of a variety of moderately priced breakfast and lunch sandwiches and a couple of salads.  I went for a breakfast sandwich (#11).  Sadly, I wasn't overly impressed... I felt my sandwich lacked a ton of flavor despite having eggs, cheese, bacon, tomato, etc... I added sriracha sauce and gobbled it up regardless, but I don't know that I will rush back.  That being said, if sandwiches are your thing, this place is worth checking out.  I hope that you'll be more impressed than I was!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, good food and they were all very friendly. If we are ever in Scottsdale again we will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"I have seen the reviews and i bookmarked this place right away. Walking in we were greeted by none other than the owner. She approached us and knew from our faces this was our first time. She was super friendly and super informative on the concept of the place. She gave us suggestions on what to get. I ordered #35 which was a roast beed sandwich with the potato salad that was included. My mother got #25 which was a turkey sandwich with the garbanzo beans side salad.  Honestly they were both amazing. The pricing is reasonable.  I wish i lived in Arizona to get the chance to try this place again before heading back to California.  Im gonna try to visit this place agin before i leave.  I can truly say we don't have something like this in socal. Love the food and flavor and love the service as well."}
{"text":"No 20 with kale salad $7. Refreshing, yummy and fast. Happy friendly staff. Clean modern atmosphere. I thought it was a pita from the pics but actually actual French bread pressed into a circular panini like press"}
{"text":"Yesterday we decided to have some tasty sandwiches.. the only place we go lately is Zooks. They are very good. Every single one we've tried. I highly recommend giving them a try.  5stars for the food"}
{"text":"Saw Zookz while driving around. Stop in for a sandwich, had no idea what to expect. Each sandwich comes with a side: chickpea salad, potato salad or kale salad. Got the Kale and the Chickpea, both were pretty good. Would recommend the chickpea. Got the number 10 and 20. $18   My take on it was just a different version of a grilled cheese. The contraption they use is pretty cool. I'm glad they didn't use the basic white bread I remember having when I was young. It's a bit of an upgrade I'd say.  Would I come back? Probably not, when I think of a good sandwich, the bread is my deal breaker. Cool concept if you love grilled cheeses. Just didn't tickle my fancy."}
{"text":"The hubby and I were in the area the other mornin and wanted breakfast.  We love breakfast sandwiches so we came here.  They were very nice and our sandwiches were great.  They did still add sauce to my husbands sandwich when he asked them to hold it, but he liked the sauce luckily.  I had the first sandwich on the menu with bacon, tomatoes, basil and cheese, it was very good.  The hubby had the second, it was southwestern with chipotle sauce.  He liked it.  We will be back for sure, the other sandwiches on the menu sound awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great tasting sandwich! First time here and had the No. 20. Only 4, not 5, stars because of the lack of parking and the small size of the sandwiches. However, this is definitely worth it and I'll be recommending this place to friends."}
{"text":"Original concept....sandwich (hot pocket) was decent, potato salad was good, and place was clean and nicely decorated.  But if you're hungry or in the mood for a great sandwich, skip this place and try your neighborhood deli instead"}
{"text":"Best #33 in Phoenix Poached egg, feta, Parmesan cheeses  with spinach, tomato  & basil .... Yummy"}
{"text":"Extraordinarily mediocre and overpriced. The kale salad was essentially inedible. Tasted as though they had dipped each kale leaf individually in a bowl of sugar.   It's worth mentioning that it's not really a sandwich place it's more of a hot pocket restaurant. If you're really into people who think they can reinvent the wheel this might be the spot for you."}
{"text":"The owner is such a delight! Every time we are in there she stops by to say hi and make sure we are enjoying our food. The sandwiches are unique and delicious! Try the kale salad side and one of their yummy fresh brewed iced teas to complete your meal! Best of luck as they continue to grow into their new shop!"}
{"text":"If you are a sandwich lover, you will enjoy this place!  They also have really yummy salads including a kale salad that is to die for!  Fresh spin on the typical sandwich, fresh ingredients, and a great atmosphere!  And the owner is super sweet and nice! What more can you ask for.  Oh yeah, the price is just right too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast sandwich. Had the one with black beans, guacamole and bacon. It was unreal. Very friendly staff there too."}
{"text":"The sandwiches have great flavor and there are a number of different side choices.  The staff is very friendly and there is plenty of seating.  It's also very clean and it's a great location.  There are also both breakfast and lunch sandwiches.  Only tip I have is that if you are very hungry you'll probably lean hungry after as the sandwich size is relatively small.  Great place for a light lunch if you anticipate a larger meal after."}
{"text":"Traveling with a coworker who lives more locally, I am super glad I fessed up to being a snob about eating at chain restaurants.  I turned down Subway and broke out my Yelp app!  Zookz was nearby and had good ratings so we checked it out.  What a different idea.  It reminds me of Uncrustables in the freezer section of the grocery store but with much more adult and better fillings.    I walked in and saw a picture of the #13 which is poached egg, feta, spinach, tomato.  I didn't even look any further..this looked amazing.  And it was!  I wish I could have tried more!  I do think my coworker could have eaten more but they did have some side options available.  The sandwich was less than $5, I believe.  All options appeared $7 and less.  They also have Coke products...I'm a sucker for a fountain diet Coke.  The service was really friendly with someone greeting us immediately, taking our order promptly, and even asking how our meal was and how we heard of Zookz!  My only desire is that they open one in Dallas or Plano, Texas!  (:"}
{"text":"A poached egg. That is what was at the center of this lunch, literally and figuratively. I went into Zookz for two reasons. 1. It's near my work and 2. every morning I pass it and it has this huge banner outside that reads \"Best Sandwich in Phoenix\". I'm not sure which of their sandwich's are the best. Unfortunately their lead sandwich, the #11 is not the best sandwich in Phoenix.   The sandwich is a panni-esk meal with two \"poached\" eggs, bacon, tomato, cheddar cheese, cream cheese, and basil. When my sandwich arrived it looked like it was cooked in one of those sandwich makers someone gives you as a wedding gift. I opened it up to hoping to find two perfectly poached eggs bursting with yoke over some thick applewood smoked bacon and fresh tomatoes and basil. What I got were two incredibly hard boiled eggs, some bacon shavings, a very tart tomato along and some wilted basil.   The sandwich doesn't work. The problem is you can't poach an egg and then press it in a sandwichmaker and expect it to not come out overcooked.   Zookz gets two stars (Meh. I've experienced better) because the owner was terrific. She came out immediately and tried to explain to me that their egg cooker is set at five minutes (so its not really a poached egg) and that the eggs come that cooked. She said they would try to undercook the egg and hope that it worked with the press.   To their credit the second sandwich, though still over \"poached\" was better than the first. The owner was very kind and went as far as to reimburse me for my meal because it took about 20 minutes for me to finally eat. It was an underwhelming sandwich, great staff, but wrong concept. Overall it's kind of a hot mess, literally and figuratively."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick breakfast place while waiting to start on a job. Smelt the toasting of the breads and followed the aroma.   Didn't get in the door a half a second and was met by a bubbly counter lady, Stacie,  who was generous with her happiness. It was nice to see a pleasant face first thing in the morning. She educated me on all their  sandwiches and explained which was best for breakfast and what her favorite was. She even got the cooks in the back the smile while they are making my sandwich.  I had the Zinger, which is a breakfast sandwich and I was trying to figure out how to come back for lunch. They have a large door open between the outdoor and indoor area where you can sit outside or inside, I sat in between and enjoyed the train and the outside air while I ate he delicious pocket like sandwich. This place is a little jewel right off of Central Avenue and Camelback and should really be much busier then it was.  I will definitely start recommending this place and bring friends by, maybe even for lunch today."}
{"text":"Quick place to get a pressed-sandwich. Prices are reasonable and they have convenient online ordering so you can order your sandwich ahead of time and have it ready to pick up. The #55 with peanut butter, nutella, banana, and almonds is my favorite - highly recommended! I tried the #77 with chocolate, coconut, and almonds once and wasn't overly impressed - there was way too much coconut and not enough chocolate, made it pretty dry."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches ever. The ambience, the story and the love are personified through every item on the menu. Thank you Carol and Berdjoui!"}
{"text":"I can eat this everyday.   The owner Carol is super sweet and you can tell shes following her passion of making people full and happy.  The turkey cranberry is amazing even though it may sound bad. The eggs in the breakfast sandwhich are cooked to perfection.  You actually cant go wrong here."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a snack. Breakfast sandwich was amazing. Flavorful and delicious. Sad I haven't tried this place earlier.  Can't wait to try more menu items in the future."}
{"text":"These are bizarre little sandwiches - and hippy dippy salads - but, they are SO YUMMY! Anytime I'm in Phoenix, I hope there's time to have at least one lunch here. They are just perfection."}
{"text":"Definitely a great new sandwich place! We had the #20 and #32 with side kale salads. They were hot and full of flavor! The kale salad was great as well! Looking forward to trying a different sandwich next time."}
{"text":"Love it!  Place- clean, casual, and modern. Inside outside eating areas. Service-friendly and curtious. You order get your drink and they bring your food to your table.  Food- fresh, non greasy, filling, and delish! I've had the no. 20 &22. Yum!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came in here for lunch today. We got in at about noon... It was busy but not overly crowded for it being prime lunch hour.  I ordered the Number 45 (caprese sandwich) and they both had the turkey, bacon, avocado. All sandwiches come with a side of either potato salad, chickpea salad, kale salad or chips. I also ordered a large iced tea. They have an awesome selection of freshly brewed tea. I did think it was unusual that iced tea was about a dollar more expensive than the fountain drinks (in the same size.) Not a fan of that.. but it is unlimited refills on all drinks so I will let it slide. All in all my sandwich, side, and iced tea rang up to about $13.  The sandwiches are the perfect size for lunch. The panini press makes them into cute little pockets that don't leave you feeling too full. Overall I enjoyed my sandwich, but it was just your typical caprese panini. Nothing to make it out of the ordinary. I didn't really enjoy their take on potato salad. It is more like mashed potatoes with black beans and corn. It was pretty bland even with the chipotle and my coworkers and I had to season with salt and pepper. I think I would go with the kale salad or chips next time! We enjoyed our lunch! I am not sure Zookz will be at the top of my list, but it was still a nice lunch spot."}
{"text":"First off, I'm a huge sandwich fan so this is right up my alley. I had just landed in Phoenix and wanted something quick. Dutch bros coffee recommended i go here as I grabbed a coffee and it's down the road. So good! I got mine to go but staff was very nice when I was there and it was clean. She knew I was taking mine on the road and cut my sandwich up more for me, #20. It was delicious! Bread toasted crisp, fresh veggies, just enough sauce. The garbanzo salad was also good and everything was very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The store is trendy looking. It has outside seating and walls that open up to let the air in. In March, it was quite comfortable. I'm not sure how that works in July.  When I grew up, we had a sandwich press which was fun to use. Put in a slice of bread, meat, cheese, and another slice of bread. Put the top down and cook for a couple minutes. Well this place has made a business with these machines.  The edges are a little hard, but that's a result of the sandwich press. The insides are hot and melty.  This is a great place for a sandwich!"}
{"text":"Hands down the most delicious and unique sandwiches I've ever eaten. 20, 25 and 35 are my favorites so far. Clean, friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Wow ... Stopped by for a late lunch and to my surprise, I was extremely impressed.  They take pride in their work and each sandwich is meticulously put together !!  With an explosion of flavors and awesome presentation, I'd say this was the best sandwich I've had in a Long time !!  Well done !!"}
{"text":"Great concept, Great potato salad.  The only drag is the lack of available parking."}
{"text":"I was excited to finally try Zooks. It was everything I had hoped for and more. Great service, food and environment. They even gave me a free kale salad to try since it was my first time in. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great! They have fun and creative sandwiches in a way that I've never had. I've tried a breakfast sandwich and a lunch sandwich and both are delicious. With the breakfast sandwich, it's nice that they ask if you'd like poached eggs or scrambled, and the poached eggs are great. The lunch sandwich I got was a turkey bacon avocado and was out of this world. The side salads are also something different, and so far I've liked the kale over the others. Also, try the teas that they have, they are fantastic. Great place for lunch and super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix! Delicious sandwiches, great ambience, and super friendly people, what's there not to like? My personal favorite is the #20 and the kale salad."}
{"text":"What a great idea!  Making a sandwich like this took me back to my childhood.  Went with my daughter who is vegan and Carole the owner went out of her way to make sure she was taken care of.  Strongly recommend.  Quick friendly service.  Sandwiches were so flavorful. We will be back"}
{"text":"I loved the bread, especially.  The side of potato salad was tasty, too.  I made a special trip here, and I enjoyed it.  I'd go again!"}
{"text":"First time here last weekend and I really enjoyed it. The cashier guy was super friendly and helped us pick a sandwich based on what we like. The owner stepped out, greeted us, and checked in on us as we were enjoying our food. I really liked the fact that the seatings extended indoor to outdoor, really opened up the restaurant and made it a very welcoming atmosphere. I also like the fact that they have a small sink near the soda dispenser so you can conveniently wash your hands without going all the way to the bathroom.   On to the food: I got 2 egg frittata sandwich. It was very good. Delicious flaky bread, yummy fresh ingredients. Apparently they get their bread specially made by wildflower bread company.   I am totally coming back! And you should definitely try it out.   --keep eatin'"}
{"text":"So I need to get better about writing reviews because I only do them for the very best or very worst. Zookz is one of the very best. Such a cool and yummy concept! It's like uncrustables filled with the best stuff, and the back story is really cool (you can read it on the wall if you're so inclined) I'm not going to say I had a mimosa at 8 am on a Tuesday, but if I did, I would bet the passionfruit one was soooooo good. I don't eat meat, and the owner was super accommodating and made great suggestions. We did breakfast, mine was egg and cheese and avocado and a crazy good sauce, my friend got the frittata one because he doesn't like runny middle eggs but after, the owner told us we can get any Sammie  with harder cooked eggs. He loved his too. This is my new regular breakfast stop for sure"}
{"text":"My friend and I were in the mood for a sandwich for lunch so we decided to look up what was nearby when we found Zookz and decided to give it a try since the reviews were so positive.  The staff was friendly and the interior was clean bright and breezy from the open doors letting in the fresh air and light. It felt almost like being on a patio instead of indoors. He ordered the #25 and I ordered the #35. Both were delicious, if somewhat smaller than expected. For a light lunch the size is perfect,  especially if you have the kale salad alongside it. I actually liked the kale salad so much I decided to ask if I could get a larger order to go to have as a healthy snack while at work.  The owner came by our table to personally ask how we enjoyed our food. I told her how much I enjoyed the salad and asked her if they sold a larger portion to go. She informed me they didn't, but would happily pack one for me. That's what I call great service! I found her very friendly and accommodating. I was pleasantly surprised...There aren't that many owners who take the time or care to go around personally asking customers how their experience was...that's a great way to keep people coming back.  Overall my friend and I enjoyed Zookz and will be back.   By the way: If you check in on foursquare you can get 15% off your meal...also on yelp if you check in, they give you 10% off."}
{"text":"Full five stars. Every visit is consist. It exceeds our expectations time and time over again."}
{"text":"I'm digging the new location because the original location had limited parking. I woke up one morning and was starving so I had my hubby stop at zookz for breakfast. We split #11- poached eggs, bacon, cream cheese, tomato and basil and a sweet one #55: peanut butter, Nutella, almonds, and bananas. #11 was good for the savory part of my meal, but #55 was freaken awesome for the sweet part!!  I definitely recommend trying one of the sweet ones because for as long as I've known zookz (a few years now), I've never had the sweet sandwich till recently and I feel like I've been missing out!!"}
{"text":"Been in Arizona 5 days and this is the first enjoyable meal we have had.   Basically a gourmet uncrustable. Delicious, fresh and worth a visit.   Staff was friendly and helpful. Trendy atmosphere and very clean.  The dessert was amazing too. We will certainly return."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Zookz and I must say that I'm impressed, this is the type of place that you want to try everything on the menu.  The service was excellent and I recommend checking this place out.  A great spin on the traditional sandwich a+"}
{"text":"Not your average sandwich! I have been coming to this place since before they moved to Central and Camelback and I love it so so much! Sandwiches are these warm, toasty, flavorful rounds of goodness! They have the best potato salad in the world, the chickpea salad is to die for and I have yet to try a sandwich I don't love. The owner is also super sweet she comes around the tables to make sure everyone is doing okay.   Zooks is a must try!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim and so glad we did! Friendly and attentive staff. Reasonably priced items on menu. I ordered a cheddar cheese and sliced ham sandwich that came with a choice of sides. I chose potato salad and it was delish! The sandwich was super delish! I indulged in their Strawberry iced tea. Amazing flavor! I will highly recommend this gem of an eatery to my friends and family!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to coming here but I have to say I was disappointed. The portions are way way too small. It's also fairly overpriced for what you get. These sandwiches are maybe as big as a Cd/dvd disc....but probably smaller. We got two sandwiches and 1 water =$21. For me it just felt like a light appetizer, I was still hungry afterwards. It just felt like a waste of money. I like the location and the decor but I don't think I will come back for food that's for sure."}
{"text":"Um...I might have an addiction! Every thing I have ever ordered there has been great! The owner is very cool and checks to make sure everything is perfect! She even brings us samples of new things to try and asks for our feedback! Love that! Can I just say...the #55 with peanut butter, Nutella, bananas and almonds...I die!"}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect when I came into ZOOKS and I have to say I was totally impressed!it was really laid back and  such a comfortable place to eat! Plus you get the food quickly and it's so good! My boyfriend isn't much of a breakfast person and he loved it as much as I did! The service was great and the atmosphere was awesome I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"In from out of town, had no idea where to go. Found it on Yelp, but always skeptical with the ratings. This is one of the best places I have ever eaten. I will be sure to come here next time I'm in town. I had the #10 with a garbanzo bean salad and carrot cake for dessert."}
{"text":"A MUST stop. Incredibly lovely shop with the most delightful owner and staff. They had me at their story, but the food was creative and delicious. They don't skimp on quality, or quantity. I loved their large assortment of non-carbonated beverages and the cup size was extremely generous. Attention to the detail in the decor. Overall 5 star experience.  And did I mention the owner is enchanting. This is a must support place."}
{"text":"Seen this place on a billboard ad and saw some friends try this place out so a friend and I decided to check it out and we were impressed! The atmosphere was relaxing and the staff was extra friendly. We tried the number 22 and number 11 breakfast sandwiches and they were both great! We will definitely be coming more often!"}
{"text":"This place is heaven on earth. Every sandwich I get changes my life. I love this place for lunch. The owner Carole is a doll and everyone who works there is so NICE. Nothing beats this place. I'd come here over a chain any day. I have not tried breakfast yet, but am looking forward to when I do. My favorite so far is the #25! AMAZING! You have to try it out.. But I warn you that it will be your new addiction!"}
{"text":"Really good and unique sandwiches. They use a press that I've only seen sold in India to make their sandwiches.  Wash sandwich comes wit a side. The side kale salad was very good too.   Everyone who works here is very friendly. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was on my way to another restaurant, saw the picture of #66 sandwich on the, well, sandwich board, and had to have it. Yes, boiled eggs are usually an indication of dry things to come, but it seemed worth the risk. The balance of sauce and other ingredients produce an independent item with near perfect new flavors.    About the only thing better than the food is the service. The staff is friendly, patient, and helpful - in a natural unforced manner.   On a side note: food, especially sandwiches and/or eggs, are generally either not photogenic (see: any place with pictures on the menu) or look over produced (Barbara Walters lens filter with a side of vibrant greens for a youthful effect). Zookz somehow cracked the code - the pictures are great.  Great job!"}
{"text":"Unique sandwich place with good food and great vibe. Friendly atmosphere and great location, right off the metro."}
{"text":"First time to Zookz today and i had a great sandwich at a decent price! The cashier immediately noticed I looked a little perplexed and asked me if I had ever been there before. I told her I had not and she quickly and cheerfully explained the menu to me. My sandwich came with a salad or chips. My food was brought to my table more quickly than I anticipated. The sandwich was great and the atmosphere was trendy but comfortable. I'm impressed! I'll absolutely be back for more unique, delicious sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Tried it, lunch sandwich was tasty however small.  Potato salad has beans and corn in it way too much going on.  Would have been helpful to tell me the tea was unsweetened and the cookie wasn't a real one it was oatmeal or something.  Oh well im sure plenty of people enjoy this kinda stuff.  Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Recommended by a woman I met, we went the same day for lunch. It was pricey but the sandwiches are freshly made and there isn't anything like it. I did #35 roast beef and enjoyed it immensely. The potato salad on the side was different but good as well. This is not your average sandwich place, and definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"First time going to Zookz and it was a great first time experience. Their menu is different and so unique, and since it was my very first time going the cashier was so nice and patient giving us time to take a good look at the menu. I got a Sandwich #42 and a potato salad. It was delicious! & to top it off, the owner Carole went to our table and greet us, and gave us a little chat about the background of how it all started. Definitely had a great experience going, and I surely go back again."}
{"text":"While over on Central decided to check out this sandwich shop, it has been on my radar. I chose the roast beef with the horseradish sauce. It was absolutely delicious. Kale salad was fresh with a nice mix of ingredients. Coffee was great too. Will be back to try something else. Oh and the ladies behind the counter were great too."}
{"text":"Great place great sandwiches. Love the story behind the sandwich press. Owner was awesome came over and chatted with us, and made us a breakfast sandwich for us to try! Definitely will be back and can't wait to try more breakfast sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!  This was a great place to eat a good sandwich. I had a craving for a different type of sandwich. Not ur firehouse typical. And this place blow my mind with the coleslaw and roast beef. I loved it."}
{"text":"Zookz sandwiches is hands down the best sandwiches in all of Arizona, it's my little hide away spot and trust me you can't go wrong with any of the choices. The service is immensely wonderful and the owner? She's just a sweet heart, you can tell she loves what she does and what she puts on the plate, I only hope she has the ability to open a zookz near ASU because it'll be hit. I never write reviews but this place is amazing."}
{"text":"100% absolutely wonderful. The experience here, from right at the beginning, was incredible. Very, very friendly and welcoming. And those sandwiches! Damn, they're good! Next time we are in town we are coming back!   Thank you, Zookz!"}
{"text":"This is a great little find! I will definitely be going back. It's not real close to where I live but whenever I'm down in that area I will not pass it by. Highly recommended! Very delicious, not overpriced, very friendly."}
{"text":"I had this for the first time today with a girlfriend and it was awesome!! The sandwich shop is very clean and well designed. The chef is a phenomenal lady and has done a wonderful job with the place. She also allowed us to try something new that she is considering! Job well done Zookz Sandwiches! :)"}
{"text":"I've drove by zooks several times and always wanted to go in. Today I finally did and I'm glad I did I had to very picky teenagers with me so not trying zooks before I was a little worried. As we walked in we were greeted by a nice guy behind the counter who explained the zook menu I ordered the #20 and my kids customized their sandwiches they got chips and I got kale salad. We got our drinks and sat down shortly our sandwiches were delivered and they were great pot pie like sandwiches, my picky kids loved them everything at zooks was great we're going back soon!"}
{"text":"Flew in from Michigan and yelped for a good breakfast sandwich, this one had the most reviews and now I know why! Absolutely delicious and fresh! Cheese was melted and combination of tomatoes basil and  cream cheese paired really well with the poached egg! Then the bread with an edge, literally. Pockets everything so well. What made this experience even better was that the owner was greeting each table, bussing things that needed to be picked up and delivering food. She came by and talked to us for a couple minutes. Great Experience! When I come back into town I am for sure going back!"}
{"text":"Quality, consistent and so tasty! Been there many times and have been going down the breakfast lunch dessert and salads - before writing this review. Yes great food across the board and plesant caring staff appears to filter down from an on site working owner/creator chef. If you have not tried this reasonably priced eatery you most definitely are missing out."}
{"text":"Use to make these sandwiches with a press back in the day. Generous with the filling, side salads are good, nice chill spot to eat at. Been here many times."}
{"text":"Such a fun lunch! We went with a traditional turkey/avocado/tomato type (#20) and something a little different, a turkey/almond/cranberry/apple choice (#10). Both had an awesome tangy mustard sauce and we super satisfying. The hubs and I usually share but opted not to from other Yelp reviews. It was a good call; he devoured his and I ate almost all of mine.   The price was about $8.50 a sandwich, not bad at all but I would have rather not had the price of the side dish built in, as I didn't like any of the choices- kale salad/potato & black bean salad/garbanzo bean& corn salad. We went with the potato but it wasn't good.   We will definitely be back to try the breakfast options (served all day!) and one of the dessert sandwiches also."}
{"text":"We love Zookz! My boyfriend and I tried Zookz for the first time this morning, and the owner introduced herself and made some suggestions for us to try- she was awesome!  We ordered two breakfast sandwiches and they were both AMAZING and just the right size to fill you up! We took some to-go menus with us, because we have a feeling this will be our new favorite spot! The service was exceptional, and the food was mouth watering, finger-lickin' good!"}
{"text":"5 stars, as usual Zookz. This place has seriously become one my favorite places to get a quick, affordable breakfast/brunch.  Ventured off the breakfast menu today, ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was incredible. Would absolutely recommend this place to anyone.  The care that the owner puts into the restaurant shows through almost all aspects of the place. Really a great place."}
{"text":"Had the #20 with a side of black bean and potato salad, and a passion fruit mimosa. Everything was delicious, service was fast and friendly. Plenty of seating inside and out. The staff was very nice and I even met the owner who was super friendly! I look forward to visiting again in the near future!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots!  Great food and the owner is always there to make sure we have the best experience.  Portions are perfect."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food with friendly service.  Had the No. 10 with kale salad and pomegranate green tea.  Best lunch in town!"}
{"text":"On our way up to Sedona for the holiday weekend, my wife and I did a quick pit stop at Zookz as we were driving out of town. We got there pretty early - around 10 AM - so the restaurant was pretty empty, and Carole (the owner) was working the register herself. She's very friendly, and she brought out our sandwiches once they were done. The interior itself is pretty much what you would expect for a fast-casual spot, but you can also read the story of how Zookz came to be on the wall next to the television - a very interesting and cool background!  As for the sandwiches - it's really well-done, particularly the crisp on the outside of the bread, and it definitely fills you up...you can fit a lot of stuff into those pockets! I ended up going with one of their breakfast sandwiches that had typical breakfast foods (egg, bacon, avocado) and topped off with some sriracha-infused sour cream (I think) that made it a properly fusion breakfast sandwich. My wife went with No. 25 - more of a lunch offering perhaps, but it also has black beans, avocado, and definitely more of a Mexican bent. The ham in particularly was quite juicy, providing a nice contrast to the crunch and crisp of the bread. We got a small side salad (corns and black beans being the base), which was pretty much in-line with the Mexican-inspired theme that the breakfast sandwiches take.  Overall - a really delicious meal at great prices. You'll definitely come away from here filled, and I really do wish there were more stores selling jaffles (which seems to be the name used in most other ex-British colonies, according to trusty Internet research). Although the sandwich may be unique, the fillings fit right in, and it's hard to go wrong with any of the choices offered. If I'm back in Phoenix anytime soon, I'll definitely be swinging by here for a meal!"}
{"text":"Simple, tasty, fast - it was exactly what we were looking for. The prices are great too!   Their \"sandwiches\" are close to an empanada or calzone with all of the ingredients sealed into a sourdough crust.  It's crispy on the outside, but still soft and moist inside. My son keeps dreaming about his meal so we are on our way back there today!"}
{"text":"The two owners are very nice-the sandwiches are fantastic.  Two types of potato salad.  The bread tastes great and it's kind of like a thin hot pocket kind of sandwich - with fresher ingredients inside!  Patio seating and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was shocked of how delicious the sandwiches are here. Very unique combination I tried 2 different sandwiches and they were both awesome  The iced tea is fresh and brewed 4 different flavors unsweetened and again lots of flavor kept going back for more  Only knock is they are round sandwiches size of a bagel and run about $8.50 each  Plenty of parking"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the mood for a good sandwich so we decided to try Zookz after seeing all the positive reviews on Yelp.  We are very happy that we did - actually, we were so happy that we went back 3 times in 1 week! The sandwiches are very unique and there are a good number of variations to try. The Kale salad is also very good and is a nice and healthy accompaniment.  I also recommend trying the \"carrot\" cake which the owner told us is not made with carrots at all, but actually beets. It is really delicious.  Not too sweet and just the right amount of frosting!  The owner is quite friendly as well and you can tell that she really cares about the quality of her food and providing a positive experience for her customers.  Overall, I'd say that Zookz is a fantastic new addition to the Central Phoenix area when you are in the mood for a tasty sandwich for breakfast or lunch at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"So glad I tried this place. Note to the owners: That big yellow \"best sandwiches\" banner you have really works, otherwise I would never have even noticed Zookz! We went for breakfast. I had the #33- 2 poached eggs, feta cheese, parmesan cheese, fresh spinach, tomatoes and fresh basil. It was awesome. I do wish there were more meatless, savory breakfast choices. I can't wait to try some of the lunch sandwiches."}
{"text":"What a great find!  I am having  the #66 breakfast sandwich and the poached eggs are perfect.  The menu is small but I like that.  I would rather have a few well prepared, delicious items rather than a vast menu that hasn't been perfected.  The staff is fantastic, the place is clean, and the prices are unbelievably cheap.   Cute and quiet indoor/ outdoor seating  makes it a peaceful place to hang out, eat, and read a book.  Which is exactly what i am doing with my yummy loose leaf iced tea."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try something new. We were treated so so nice and I LOVED the food. You have to try it! I had the 15 but with chipotle. I have definitely put Zookz on my FAVE LIST!!! Keep up the good work Zookz. Glad you are in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Just can't hardly decide which to eat.  They are all delish. Wish they stayed open a little longer."}
{"text":"Love Zookz!  I work downtown so time was limited. I ordered online from their website, zookzsandwiches.com. It was so simple to do. I got to choose my pickup time. I got there at noon and was able to go directly to the counter.  The cashier was friendly and had a big smile on her face.  My food was out within 60 seconds and my sandwich (the #45) was nice and warm- and 10 minutes later when I got to my office it was still warm and fresh.  I had kale salad on the side. The flavors were excellent and ingredients were fresh and crisp!  With placing my order to go, I did not get a good look at inside, however I did notice it was clean and open to the outside eating space in the front.  With the quick & easy online ordering, the quick & friendly staff, and the fresh & delicious food, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really want to give it a 5 star review but I can't..... Yet.    Stopped in here to try somewhere new and after reading all the reviews I knew it wouldn't disappoint.  I ordered the 45, which had spinach, basil, tomatoes, mozzarella, red peppers and probably something else I forgot.  I also had to try the kale salad.    My first bite was delicious!  Yummy bread, good flavors... A real winner.  Then I took a second bite and realized the inside was still ice cold.  :-(. The big chunk of spinach was super cold and the cheese wasn't melted.  It was sooo disappointing but I still ate it because I was hungry and it didn't taste bad cold.  The kale salad was out of this world!  Sooo yummy!  I will definitely be back to try it again and hopefully it will be fully cooked.  Even with the sandwich being cold inside, I still liked it enough that it warrants 4 stars.  The fact the ingredients were fresh and it wasn't frozen spinach helped with the good rating too.  I will try it again soon and update my review to what I'm hoping will be 5 stars!    Seriously... the kale salad is yummy... go try it now!"}
{"text":"Zooks is delicious. They are soo friendly here and love to help you out with suggestions. I definitely recommend trying any of their top sellers (#25 is what i got).   The sandwiches are not huge, so if you are big eater...get a salad or another sandwich.   One wish I have for for Zooks is that the egg yoke would be runny instead.. That would be AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I've seen the ads. I've read the reviews. And the fact is, people are selling this place - and selling it hard! Maybe too hard, in fact.    If you're automatically wowed by something that you've never had before, then I guess I can understand the appeal. Additionally, if you're the type that enjoys your sandwiches jam-packed with a hodgepodge of ingredients, then fully expect great things.    I ordered the No. 22, which seems to be one of the more popular choices. Honestly, it's really just a boatload of stuff all jam packed into toasted bread, that looks somewhat like a cross between an empanada and a pot pie. I expected the bread to pop in flavor based on appearance. The reality is that it's not really anything special beyond a mere crispy shell. The edges were hard and chewy. The ingredients were all okay, but as previously stated, it's a boatload of stuff that is all muddled together to the point where nothing really stands out except maybe the eggs.    For six bucks, I guess it works for what it is. But let's face it, a five star Pane Bianco sandwich this most definitely is not.    Their dessert options look like they'd be interesting to try and I'm sure I'll return at some point to sample another sandwich.    Maybe I just don't throw out five star reviews as liberally as other people. It's not bad, but there are far better places to go if you're looking for a good sandwich. But if you're seeking something quick, cheap, and edible, then Zookz is definitely worth trying.    Just keep your expectations realistic."}
{"text":"Average at best. Not sure why the rating is so hi. It's a hot pocket and the portion size Is small. Not satisfying"}
{"text":"This place is adorable and super yummy!!! Everything on the menu looked delicious. I order 66 and it was so amazing!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Owner warmly greeted us and walked us through her favorites on the menu. Salad was delicious an my colleagues enjoyed the sandwiches. Highly recommend Zookz!"}
{"text":"My friend Nancy, read a story about Zookz, and thought we should try it out. Even thought it was quite a ways from Fountain Hills, it was definitely worth the drive. My husband and I shared the #66 and the #20 (one breakfast and one lunch)....delicious. Nancy also had the #66.We loved both of them though I was partial to the #66. The potato salad was so good, also. We met the owner, Carol, who was delightful and made us feel like we were friends as soon as we met. The service was fast and friendly. We will definitely be back, as it's the kind of tasty food that keeps calling our name :-)"}
{"text":"Discovered this place just looking for someplace to eat that was pet friendly.  Well, they're not only pet friendly, but, people friendly.  The owner greeted us and made us feel welcome.  I had seen some of their unique sandwiches on this site and had one thing on my mind....good poached eggs.  I was not disappointed.  I had the No. 11 breakfast sandwich and I can say without a doubt that it was the best thing I have eaten out in recent memory.  My wife had the No. 25 and she loved it as well.  Our pet Dolly got a nice bowl of cool water and a dog biscuit (she was much more interested in what we were having, though)  When I ordered, the owner informed me that they cook their eggs through and if I wanted them any different, just to ask.  I custom ordered it with my eggs just before fully cooked.  I got my sandwich and they were done to perfection, not to mention the sandwich itself was perfection.  Crispy on the edges, good \"tooth\", in the middle and the inside was pure deliciousness.  Their unique method off cooking a sandwich makes any of their sandwiches simply delicious.    Hey, and don't forget one of their hand prepared sides.  Like potato salad?  You'll love their version.  Like kale? Their kale salad is like no other.  If you think you don't like kale or have never tried kale.......try it!  You'll be glad you did.  I'll definitely be going back to try all their other sandwiches and try to pick a favorite."}
{"text":"Had my first taste of Zookz at breakfast this morning with long time pal.  I had number 66 he had number 11.  Our collective conclusion is we WILL return.  Very good value, very good food, light flour/bread, terrific choice of ingredients.  The pie tope crust is reminiscence of the sandwiches we made on camping boy scout outings.  Crust on both sides thin not thick. Owner Carol recently relocated to Uptown Plaza from original location just south of Camelback on Central where there was limited parking and trolley track problems. Plenty of parking at Uptown Plaza. Seating for 50 inside, another 30 outside-covered-windows open for more ambiance with misters when needed.  outside is covered. The one weakness in our opinion is the coffee, it is bitter.  Breakfast sandwiches are $5.95 plus tax.  Each is a little different. Homemade salads as well as homemade sandwiches.   Weekday hours begin at 7 AM and 8 AM Sat/Sunday"}
{"text":"The food was great and the service outstanding. The owner is hands on and takes tremendous pride in everything served. I would recommend and will be back for more."}
{"text":"Amazing. Another local Phoenix gem.  I'll try my best to use words to describe why these sandwiches are brilliant. They are pocket sandwiches cooked up superbly. The fillings are sliced delicately thin and diced just right. The fillings are tenderly nestled between two circular pieces of bread, and the whole thing is cooked so that the bread is toasty brown and the fillings are warm and juicy. The whole thing adds up to a party in your mouth. It's almost like a gourmet grilled cheese, but way more amaze-balls.  I had the #20, turkey, bacon, avocado with some amazing magical sauce in it. You get a small salad with any sandwich. I had the kale, nut, mandarin orange salad. As if the sandwich wasn't amazing enough, the salad put me over the edge.  On my second visit, I had the roast beef cheddar bacon (#35). Yum yum yum yum yum.  The service is great and the place is very cute.  I highly recommend Zookz for lunch."}
{"text":"Got the no. 33 sandwich and even after reading the positive reviews and viewing the photos, the sandwich managed to surpass my expectations! Service was excellent as well. Keep doing what you're doing."}
{"text":"Went there today to check the place out. Was highly rated on the Yelp site...THE FOOD IS AWESOME and the price is VERY REASONABLE. The owner takes pride in her menu and came over to talk to us for about 5-10 minutes. We both started our with their patented pressed turkey sandwiches, which come with a small side salad. Both the sandwiches and side salads were FANTASTIC. How good?  I picked up two full side salads \"To Go\". Yes, we were impressed and Yes, we will be returning soon. By the way, the Prickly Pear Tea was delicious..."}
{"text":"Awesome twist on the sandwiches. They have around 8-10 options,but you can always customize and add/remove ingredients.  The size portions may be on the smaller side if you have a big appetite,but the side salad(i love the chickpea one) helps.  They cater to your sweet tooth with the Peanut butter jelly sandwich as well. The owner(I think its the owner) is really involved and will make sure you have the best experience."}
{"text":"Interesting concept for a sandwich. I enjoyed the taste but still find myself to be a sandwich traditionalist so I'm not sure that this is a place that I will frequent. The staff was very nice and the service was quick.  The bread tasted a little sweet, almost like a griddle type of bread.  With everything baked in, I almost feel like I lost the the taste of the individual ingredients."}
{"text":"It is so refreshing to go into a restaurant and have the owner ask if she can help you. The owner, Carole, is amazing! Zookz has become my go to place for a quick, light, terrific meal. Number's 11 and 33 are my pockets of choice. The ambiance is fantastic and the food even better. Five stars all the way for me!"}
{"text":"We saw this place on tv show \"Check Please Arizona\" so decided to stop in for lunch. They didn't seem to have as many sandwiches as what we thought from seeing on tv. I had the #11 and my wife the #10. We both enjoyed them but afterwards both questioned why they didn't have a grilled cheese with tomato soup. How good that would be with their pressed circle bread. There teas are awesome, similar to Flower Child. Even now Im looking at there menu and see sandwiches as high as #77, but there menu board only seems to have 2 or 3 columns. Definitely unique and tasty and can be healthy too. Must try!"}
{"text":"I had my first Zooks experience yesterday for lunch.  Carole the owner of Zooks created great place to go in District 4. I got the #30, a creative combination of ham, brie, apricot and roasted almonds, my mouth is still watering from it.  Not only was the sandwich amazing but Carole suggested that my team and I try the kale salad and the oatmeal cake, what a good suggestion that was. It was an amazing lunch and can't wait to come back with my team."}
{"text":"These are the best sandwiches in Phoenix. The owner is so friendly and will make sure that you enjoy what you get. It creates a wonderful environment of great guest service.   The only problem is that since the sammiches are so good, you never get enough! I've ordered two before because I couldn't stop eating them.    The kale salad they use as a starter is so good that it could be its own meal.   It's seriously a treat to eat at Zookz."}
{"text":"When I was a child. Yes 50+ years ago we had a device to make grilled cheese sandwiches in the design as this establishment so I experienced a time warp when I got my sandwich These folks have innovated the sandwich. I've only been for breakfast but by far the extra attention they use must be experienced. Whether it is adding cream cheese or basil to a breakfast sandwich which makes you pay attention. Hey if you want ordinary go get an egg Mcmuffin. Excellent. Excellent excellent. My only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that I'm a morning eater and to me coffee is king. I would step up the coffee service so people stay and eat there. That's all. These sandwiches are taaaaaasty!!!!!!! Good job. Please it's been a while since I moved to Chandler so you may have improved the coffee service. If not take this as kindly input. And you don't have to go the barista route ($) just get a premium brew and containers to hold them hot without further heating like a hot plate which sours the coffee in 15 minutes. I want you to thrive because I looooove these sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and it's delicious! I can't wait to come back and try everything else. Everyone is so friendly and the patio is wonderful.   I'll be back, Zookz!"}
{"text":"Had to convince my mother to come here. We always struggle when it comes to dining places because she craves very unhealthy foods that do not appeal to me at all.   I think she enjoyed it!! I know my #33 was fabulous ... Every bite was heaven!   Great patio out front dog friendly with misters which keeps it nice & cool! Thank you for being so thoughtful   Will repeat. Mom said it wasn't as she imagined & the food had flavor which means we don't have to fight about my selection!"}
{"text":"We were a few hours early for our flight out of Arizona and decided to grab some lunch before heading in to the airport. I searched around and saw that Zooks was pretty highly rated and affordable, so we decided to try it out.  I'm glad we picked Zooks for our last meal in Arizona, because it was awesome. The location is small, but incredibly clean and bright. The menu is easy to understand, and every employee was incredibly pleasant and helpful. I got the number 35, which was excellent, and my mom got the...Turkey club one. Not sure about the number., but she liked it. We also tried the potato salad, which while different than the egg or mustard potato salad I'm used to, was good. Creamy with a bit of spice, but not overseasoned. My mom got the garbanzo beans, which she loved, and then an employee who may or may not have been the manager also gave us a kale salad to try for free, which was, like everything else, fantastic.  This ran us about $20 with fountain drinks, which isn't bad for lunch. If I'm ever in town again, I will definitely be coming back to Zooks (or maybe they could open a location in Dallas? :D)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Fun and funky twist to what easily can be a regular old boring sandwich. The secret is their bread. It is an old family tradition but similar to a pita. The sandwiches are similar to a panini but with much more pizzazzzzz(snap). Very friendly staff and very affordable. This is a Phoenix must try."}
{"text":"In my opinion Zookz is over priced for \"specialty sandwichs\", but they so use good quality ingreide  Zookz is always very clean, and that's a big thing for me, I don't enjoy eating in a dirty establishment. No matter how busy it's been when I've been in there it's always clean.   The best thing about Zookz is the amazing woman, Bevy Jo, who manages the place. She's always so pleasant and the customers seem to really like her. The owner should be proud and happy to have such a great manager on staff! Even on a busy day, and busy lunch rush the wait is never very long and the manager always makes sure to ask if everything is enjoyable. I've never been to a busy lunchtime restaurant and had such an attentive member of management take the time to check on her customers. I would simply comeback to this establishment because of the way each customer is treated."}
{"text":"El Hubbo (aka the Hubs or Hubby) and I stopped in on our way from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport to Sedona AZ, as I had bookmarked this place as our lunch destination after reading the great reviews of it!  First and foremost, I don't know anything about the Phoenix area, but the location of this place looks a little sketchy and in fact, I took a business call outside, prior to going into Zookz (because I didn't want to be obnoxious and talk on the phone while trying to order), and some random dude that was walking by starts mocking me.  LOL.  Weird.  Anyway, enough of that nonsense!  Zookz is a small place and when we did go in, we were the only ones in there because it was like 2 p.m., so clearly after lunch time for most normal people (including me, but I'm not normal).  I ordered the No. 20, which has turkey, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, cheddar cheese, and Zookz mustard sauce, and a small kale salad.  I was so hungry that I ate the kale salad immediately and it was OMG scrumdeliumtious!!  I really wanted more of it but knew I had a sandwich coming.   When my sandwich arrived, it was cute & round!  It reminded me of the sandwiches I use to make at home way back when with my little Presto Sandwich Maker, and that's how it tasted, too!  It was really yummy!  I liked that it wasn't too filling, it was just right.  I kind of felt like I could eat 2 of them, but then I knew I would be in a carb coma on the way to Sedona.  The employees here are super friendly and I also liked that they have a Hot Dog Cart Showroom across the street.  Are hot dog carts big in Phoenix that they need a showroom?!  BAHAHAHA!  We would definitely return again if in the area!!"}
{"text":"Unique and addicting sandwiches! These sandwiches are one of a kind and a must try!! If you like trying new foods, try this place! Their sandwiches are all great, fresh and bread/crust is amazing. Always made to order. Like Cornish Pasty but better in my opinion! Service is top notch! The staff is always friendly and caring. Yes, they seem to care about your lunch! The owner is very genuine and you can tell she loves her restaurant and staff. Highly recommend this place and bring friends here whenever I can.  Love the Kale salad but I wish it were a little larger in size in my opinion. I just get two salads because one just isn't enough.  Don't forget to get a punch card! You will be back. :-)  Thanks Zookz!"}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say about my Breakfast Sandwich !!!  Plenty of parking, a very friendly staff, who will walk you through your order especially if it's your First Visit.  The Breakfast Sandwich was Delicious w/scrambled eggs, bacon & cheese. A tasty sandwich w/apple juice all for a Great Low Price !!  My only complaint about the Restaurant, is it's in Phoenix and I was only visiting for Five Days.   I'll be back next year and it will not be just One Time."}
{"text":"Great price point for the area! Decor is wonderful and the staff is warm and inviting! The menu is diverse and the side salads are delicious! Definitely recommend the potato salad"}
{"text":"Zookz is a cute little joint just south of Mazie's, offering, in their words \"sandwiches with an edge.\"  Intrigued by their catchphrase and not too far from the office, I stopped in for a to-go order.  The design is simple, functional, modern, and inviting.  Very friendly staff.  I ordered the No. 50: spinach, corn, tomatoes, avocado, cheddar cheese, and chipotle sauce.  The edgy sandwich has no edges in fact; it is a buttery toasted circular-filled disk.  It was pretty good, and I do appreciate the unique attempt, but to me it simply tasted like a grilled cheese sandwich.  The bread is pretty straightforward, and there was just too much butter and cheese to taste any of the veggies inside.  Also, the way the sandwich is toasted together so firmly makes the spinach and corn heat and wilt nicely, but makes for soggy tomatoes and avocados.  Served with a nice little side of corn, feta, and black bean salad the whole thing filled me up but for anyone with a slightly larger appetite you may need two to make a meal.  They are open weekdays only from 11-3, the price is right, and based on the grilled cheese-like creation and very limited parking this place will probably do well catering to the Brophy & Xavier kids across the street."}
{"text":"Excellent fast casual sandwich spot. Perfect for a quick, savory breakfast sandwich that's grilled in a pocket-like pasty. I'll definitely be back. Very reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"A friend and I are new to the area and found this place on Yelp! And  WOW! so impressed!  We went for lunch time. Pulling into the parking lot, it already had a good vibe. Clean and friendly. There are sliding glass doors that can be open to allow fresh air into the building and a patio to sit at.   We didn't know what we wanted to eat because of the different style sandwiches and the owner helped us. She was awesome. Even suggested what to add to my sandwich. While allowing my friend to sample the sauce she was unsure about.  A side comes along with the sandwich, and my friend picked chips and I picked the potato salad. The owner insisted we try the salad... and just gave it to us! So Impressed again!!  We decided to sit outside on the patio and enjoy the weather. The cashier came out to make sure we were okay as well as the owner. I will definitely come back here again for the great customer service and the amazing food. Thank you so much for the great experience!"}
{"text":"I do enjoy and have enjoyed zookz from their original storefront. Though I've never gone in, I've always enjoyed their food when delivered for our large corporate lunches. Today I made my first visit in and was impressed by the variety as well as the layout and locations of the menus. Makes it very easy for someone to decide what they want. I mainly chose to come in based on knowing a side salad is included with the lunch portion. However it's very easy to get confused when the signage reads \"your choice of one of our homemade side salads\".  When ordering I chose a salad from the board, which is apparently not protocol. \"It sounds like you haven't been here before. You choose one from the cooler and give it to me and I put it in the bag\" I was told. In a slight sense of confusion and shock I had to leave the counter from ordering to select a salad, none of which were labeled at the chiller aside from \"contains nuts\" on the lid. It was unclear to tell what was what so I grabbed something that was green. While I do enjoy the food just a few words have put a \"bad taste in my mouth\"."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were sooo delicious! My boyfriend and I came from Michigan to visit. We wanted a quick breakfast bite to eat after the gym and Zookz hit the spot! We had the #44 & #66, a mimosa and iced latte and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! The baked goods are AMAZING FRESH delicious. NEVER had Caribbean Cake until now. WOW. Now I have another ZOOKZ addiction."}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwich. Not huge. Just the right size. I had the #30 and my BFF got the #20. Both good. If you have a sandwich maker at home you could probably replicate any of their sandwiches. But if you're out and about and need an inexpensive lunch stop in!"}
{"text":"Wow, I could not be a bigger fan of this place.  The first time we went to this place, the ladies (owners) were so sweet.  They chatted a moment with us about their options and top sellers.  They managed our order fabulously.  I got the #35, a fabulous SW potato salad, and a dessert sandwich with nutella and powdered sugar.  ALL, and I mean ALL, of it was fabulous.  #35 is like eating a burger, but not so awful for you, the SW potato salad is not spicy but has a SW flavor that is addictive, and the nutella sandwich was SO decadent. The biggest problem is due to all of the carbs/starches, I was SUPER full, so plan on taking some home if you are a light eater. BUT, it refrigerates and microwaves well at home. (At least the #35 did). :)  The restaurant is spotless, the hand washing station is magic, and I love the recycling section of the trash cans.   This place is officially in our lunchtime rotation and I am obsessed with how sweet the ladies are that work here, they are what make the place magical.  I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Came here last week to try this new craze, I ordered the turkey since that's what they recommended and it was very delicious. The crust was a little hard to eat but the sandwich overall was very good. Parking is tough in this location but I hear they're moving nearby to resolve that. I can see this type of place blowing up because it's got a very trendy & casual atmosphere. Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"The ingredients and recipes are good, but the delivery needs improvement.  I couldn't eat the edges or crust, because it was too hard and hurt my teeth.  Also, the sandwiches are fairly small.  I ate two of them and was still hungry.  For roughly $7.00 per sandwich, I would rather go somewhere else.  They are overpriced by $1.00 - 2.00.  The people are nice, the place is clean, and the service is fast.  Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed with their product.  Oh, yeah, their potato salad was good..."}
{"text":"Just tried this place out for the first time and will definitely be going back.  Cute place inside with nice interior.  Very open feel to it and you can sit on bar stools, look out at Camelback Road while you eat. We ordered the #11 and #66 which were both delicious.  Coffee was strong and hot!  Nice little breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"We visited today for the first time. We had two breakfast sandwiches - #22 & #66. We asked for our poached eggs to be soft. The owner explained why it might be difficult (because of the grill machine) but then accomplished it. I was expecting the #22 to have a nice smoky chipotle flavor but it was overpowered by the mustard (which wasn't mentioned in the description). When the owner came by to see how we liked our sandwiches, I mentioned this. She promptly made me another without the mustard and at no additional charge. That's the way service should be! Thin, crispy bread is exactly what I want in a sandwich and they do it perfectly. We will definately be back. And this will be my new take out spot for workday lunch."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. My favorite sandwich is #22. Customer service is great! Also dont forget to try their Iced Mocha Coffee its's amazing too."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Clean and modern, very hip, but absolutely not missing the warmth and love of a locally-owned business!  Carol, the owner, was walking around making sure everyone was happy, offering tastes to a party that was having a hard time choosing.  The sandwich was great, but I particularly liked the side salad selection (I had the potato salad, VERY yummy).  I love sandwiches, but get tired of chips...Zooks has four side salads to choose from, each looked better than the next, which comes with your sandwich instead of chips.  The windows were open, the weather was gorgeous, and this was a great intro to Phoenix for me."}
{"text":"Hands down best sandwich shop in the valley. The sandwiches are BOMB and the lady who owns the shop has nothing but sweet vibes for customers."}
{"text":"What a great idea! Toasted sandwiches seared around the edges and filled with lovely, inventive, tasty fillings! Some may call them called Toastites or Toasties. Delightfully paired ingredients for breakfast or lunch. Quick, fresh, hot, delicious...what more could you ask for. Oh yes, breakfast around $4 -$5 and lunch around $6.50. Tasteful modern clean interior. Now open every day this will become a fast favorite. Try the Kale side salad (included in price) with chef/owner Carole's secret dressing. Wow!"}
{"text":"We ended up here by accident when something else was unexpectedly closed. I would probably go out of my way to go back. The sandwiches were delicious and so filling. I had a breakfast special sandwich with sausage, poached egg, sausage, and cheese. I also had the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie and it was one of the best cookies I've had in a while. The owner was there and she was so friendly. I hope they open one in Tucson soon, but I will be back next time I'm in Phoenix for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch place!!  The owner greeted us at the door and explained the sandwiches.  I had the kale salad after reading the yelp reviews about it.  I was not disappointed.  Great find in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"One bite and  I'm hooked. #30-ham, a layer of Brie, a spoonful of apricot preserves and a sprinkle of roasted almonds all gooey and melted is definitely the way to go. I also really loved the kale salad side dish. It had a sweet vinaigrette and had pecans (and maybe bits of apple?) in it. I only wish it were larger. :)  My friend had the turkey with the curry mayo and cranberries and it was awesome too. I really can't wait to go back and chow down on these little frisbees of awesomeness. Do check in while you're there and you may get a 10% off coupon. I didn't discover that till we were leaving but it said I could use it next time!"}
{"text":"My husband I are visiting from San Antonio to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary.  But because our hotel didn't offer a typical free breakfast that most hotels provide these days, we checked Yelp for a local affordable establishment.  That's how we found Zookz.  It was affordable ($) but held 4.5 stars.  So, off we went.  Lorrenna took care of us and made great recommendations. OMG, round toasted breakfast sandwich were so delicious that both my husband and I found ourselves making all kinds of noises while we were eating because it was so yummy.  The bread was perfectly toasty on the outside.  The eggs and other ingredients on the inside was perfect. The staff said we need to come back because their lunch sandwiches are even better.    And, because we mentioned we found Zookz on Yelps we received a 10 percent off their already inexpensive price (Breakfast sandwich was less than $6).  Good thing we don't live locally or we will be here every day!!  While you're hear, be sure to read the origin of Zookz! We'll definitely be back before departing Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's fresh and delicious. It's my favorite place to stop while Im out running errands because I know I won't spend more than $8, it's healthy and fast. The owner is so nice and I love the story behind the sandwiches.  It's definitely a local business worth supporting."}
{"text":"Try number 35 if you're a horse radish fan! Extremely good value, terrific concept! Would recommend in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable.  There are so many things to like, but the reason they only get 4 stars is they have a pretty limited menu, so you may not be able to find something for everyone to enjoy.  I walked in expecting a sandwich slapped together on two pieces of bread. The sandwich I received was far beyond this. I ordered a sandwich with poached eggs, avocado, and cheese. The sandwich reminded me of a toasted uncrustable, except with eggs and cheese instead of PB&J (but they have that if thats your kinda thing). Although, the bread is definitely not white bread -- it is more of a pot pie, uncrustable, sandwich, with breakfast on it. The poached egg was fantastic -- perfectly cooked! I 100% ordering a breakfast sandwich. They know how to cook an egg.  The atmosphere -- Its in a great location. They have a dog friendly patio and the inside is trendy. Service was quick and they were friendly. Nothing to brag or rag on.  I definitely suggest a visit to Zookz -- It is an out-of-the-box sandwich shop that's a perfect spot for brunch."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since I first saw a photo of one of their sandwiches. It was everything I had imagined and hoped for. I met the owner Carol who was kind enough to buy me a cup of coffee while I waited for the cooking contraption to get hot enough to make the sandwich. It was a delight speaking with her and hearing the story of how this place came to be. I highly recommend this place  and fully intend to be a regular."}
{"text":"I come here probably once a week for the #22 and a big iced tea. This spot is perfect for a hot summer day or an early morning breafkast on the go. Takes probably 5 minutes from the time you order.   #22 is cheddar cheese - two poaches eggs - avocado - bacon - ham - black beans - and zookz chipotle sauce  This is a must have if youre in central phoenix or off camelback!"}
{"text":"I was in the Pheonix area visiting one of my best friends and decided to check this place out one morning.  The exterior is very inviting with a large bouquet of fresh sunflowers that match the bright yellow covered outdoor seating area. The interior is an open space with some bench style seating and private tables offering warm and fluffy pillows to make you feel at home. The menu is great, offering a plethora of rounded toasted breakfast and lunch sandwiches, in addition to healthy salads and juices.  I opted for the \"Zinger\" #66 which is crusted toasted bread pocket filled with poached eggs, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, bacon, and green onions, topped with a Zinger cream cheese sauce. So YUMMY! The lovely woman at the register was a ray of sunshine!! She was very welcoming when I walked in, offered to go through the menu of the most popular items and then gave me a free kale salad on the side -also delicious! I will be stopping back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday, we wanted to try something new for lunch..  We were in the mood for a good salad and my friend did a search and Zooks was on the list.  We headed over and in my mind knowing where this was located, I dreaded the parking situation I was going to find.  Luckily, the parking wasn't bad because we went at 1pm, but we did get the last spot that we had to squeeze into.  A truck would never fit.  Anyway, we walked in and the atmosphere is pretty fresh and clean with bright colors and images of fresh veggies adorning the walls.  Pretty nice.   When you walk up to the counter, a pretty nice guy greeted us and asked if we had been there before and when we said no, he explained the menu to us.  We went right for the salads, even though some of the sandwich options looked pretty good. I got the #5 and an iced tea.    We took our seats and one thing that stuck us as a little odd was that the AC system was over the windows but the air was so forceful it didn't matter where you sat in the dinning area, you were going to be blasted.  Not a huge deal, but it was noticeable.  It's Arizona and it's hot, so I guess we should be thankful.    Once we got our meal, it came in a plastic to-go container.  One thing I might recommend to them is using something less environmentally unfriendly and costly for people who are dinning in.  I mean it seems very \"pre-packaged\" and not to mention it's totally crappy for the environment, but I digress.... The salad was full of wonderful ingredients, crumbled bacon, roasted almonds, dried cranberries, apples, carrots, and Zookz Creamy Apple Mustard Dressing.  It was so good, it left me wanting more.  (Meaning it was great, but it have had more to it or at leas greens at least.  They should bottle that dressing for sure, though because it was awesome!   This is a great place to grab lunch so check them out.  I think I definitely want to try a sandwich next time.  Maybe split it with my friend and have the salad again too.  I hope to see them fix the way they package their salads so when you dine-in you aren't getting it in a to-go container. Heck, it's going to save them money in the long run anyway."}
{"text":"Very good and unique.  You should try this place, I've never had anything quite like it. It is not so unique or foreign that you should be scared, it is a sandwich after all.  It is a little expensive for what you get, but yummy.   If you like Roast Beef and Horseradish.. there is a killer sandwich here for you! :D"}
{"text":"At first you wonder what the hell these little things are... you then bite into them and realize who cares... because they're delicious! I order them from DoorDash and it's here under 30 min, you can't go wrong. Soooooo yummy. The #11 is prolly my favorite. So easy and basic yet amazing. I've only had the breakfast ones tho, I need to go for lunch soon!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, cute building, awesome sandwiches, and large/delicious sides! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We love this casual sandwich shop that specializes in disc-shaped toasted sandwiches. The owner is always around greeting her patrons and making sure that the quality is consistent. The sandwiches themselves are awesome. Perfect crunchiness every bite but never burnt.  My wife had her favourite, curry turkey (no 15), and it was just as good the first time we came by. I had the poached egg and bacon (no 22), which was good, but I probably should have gone with a lunch sandwich given the time of day. Every item on the menu has been an explosion of savoury delight. This is our favourite sandwich place in the valley."}
{"text":"Five stars for this place. The best sandwich I ever ate! Not kidding. Not over loaded on bread.  The perfectly crispy, toasted, melty thing I've ever ate!  Met the owner who gave talked with us and gave us the history on Zooks! Yum.  We will be back!! If you are in the area this is a must try!"}
{"text":"Services was super friendly and helpful! And the food was great. Usually u see pictures of the food and the actual food looks nothing like the picture but  this place made the food match thier pictures! And it tastes just as good as it looks! I love the choice of making it the way you want but i didn't even need to cause it was already perfect! Wish they had one in Yuma cause i would be there everyday!"}
{"text":"The employees were incredibly friendly and helpful, even offering a suggestion to my 12 year old daughter who is a bit picky with foods. We had the #35 and #20 and both were delicious! I thought the portion size was right on, especially since it also comes with a side. Sure you could spend a dollar or two less at a fast food drive through but this is is quick, casual dining with high end taste and ingredients. Also, we always love finding a local spot that is family friendly and satisfies our foodie palettes!  Definitely will be coming back to Zookz and recommending to others for both the food quality and excellent service."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food and service. I came and tried the sandwiches with the garbanzo bean salad. The sandwich was amazing and flavorful with just the right amount of ingredients. I personally did not like the garbanzo beans as much but there are plenty of other choices to choose from.  Not only that, but the service was excellent. The staff was very friendly in helping me to decide what to order and struck up a conversation with me while waiting for the food. Even the manager came out to ask how the food was. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"such a cute place and great sandwiches!! I got the #15.... if you like curry or flavor you will love this. the cafe is perfectly decorated and makes you feel welcome. great for a quick lunch date or work lunch hour. prices are not bad either especially because you get your choice of a salad with it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are new to the area and are constantly having to rely on yelp for recommendations and I have to say this was a great recommendation! We got numbers 20 and 25 with sides of potato salad and a free side of the kale salad! The staff was very welcoming and helpful with these recommendations and we will definitely be back sooner than later!!"}
{"text":"I think this place is great! The staff were really friendly and the environment has a relaxed vibe. I got the kale salad, which was astoundingly delicious for being healthy; the kale wasn't bitter at all. The #35 was savory and flavorful. The sauce and juiciness of the tomatoes went well with the dryer, flatter bread, which in itself is an innovative twist- it's more like a smushed toast or cracker than a fluffy bread."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are small but filling! They are so incredibly good, a panini mixed with an uncrustable from Smuckers."}
{"text":"You must give this little sandwich shop a try!! It blew my socks off. Plus the owner is a ray of sunshine. Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"First timer here. Ordered a No. 10 with a No. 9 side salad. Newcomer to this pocket sandwich idea and IT WAS AMAZING!!  Ordered through UberEats and was deliver freaky lightening fast. The sandwich was still warm. The parm sauce inside was the perfect tang to the sweet apples & cranberry in my turkey sandwich.  The crunchy crust!  I need this in the morning. Will have to try the AM sandwiches.  Absolutely loved this meal. I am one happy camper right now. It was a little expensive but I'm ok with that - I have a big smile on my face.  THANKS!"}
{"text":"It was okay. Kind of reminded me of a hot pocket. A large, delicious, expensive hot pocket. Probably won't be back but had a good experience."}
{"text":"I thought Zooks was alright, but obviously I didn't enjoy it as much as others. The sandwiches were small and the ingredients (while fresh) were so mashed together they were hard to decipher. I couldn't tell if I was tasting a tomato or an avocado, there was just too much going on inside that little round pouch. The kale salad tasted like watery sweet coleslaw and I wouldn't order it again.   Overall it was just ok, I made similar sammys in my college dorm with a plug in press I had for years... Service was great and the place was extremely clean."}
{"text":"I should start by mentioning, I love sandwiches. They're my favorite. So when I Yelped restaurants near me and Zookz Sandwiches came up, I knew it was meant to be.   The staff was very friendly and helpful. We made small talk while I ordered and she helped me choose a delicious sandwich (the No. 10, more on that in a second). The other patrons were also friendly. I live in Southern California now, this is rare and special. There was also plenty of seating, with options to sit inside or outside, on stools, chairs, or a cute cushioned bench with throw pillows.   The coffee is out on the counter where I could get my fill and mentally prepare/caffeinate myself for the day. My sandwich was a perfect, toasted, sweet and savory hug from the inside. There was turkey, almonds, cranberries, and apples on it.   Thanks, Zookz! See ya next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Was in the area. Didn't have breakfast and was hungry. Searched on yelp and just chose a place. Found Zookz and it looked delicious. Went inside and was greeted by some chill dudes. I ordered the No. 33 which had: 2 poached eggs, feta ans parmesan cheese, fresh spinach, tomatoes and basil in the sandwich. Very very delicious. The outside was crunchy and the inside was soft and savory. It was pretty cheap too. I will come back if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this casual and inviting lunch spot! I ordered the mozzarella and spinach salad and it was yummy! Klutz that I can be, I dropped half my kale salad on the floor just as I was telling my friends how yummy it was. When I mentioned it to the owner as an aside, she brought me another one without me even asking!  Talk about customer service!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this for a while now. Went in today with my bestie. The design and vibe is gorgeous. The owner overheard that it was our first time in, she came and introduced herself and suggested her personal favorites and chatted for a few minutes. Very sweet. Once we ordered she came to check on us and started to explain how Zookz came to be, great family story. The sandwiches were heavenly, the side salad was perfect, the best fresh tea I've had in a while... I loved the entire experience. Most of all, I appreciated how kind she was... Would give ten stars if I could. Thanks for making our lunch perfect :-)"}
{"text":"Never thought I'd say this but I love round sandwiches. This place offers a unique twist on you every day sandwhiches. I had to order 2 lunch sandwhiches and a dessert to try. Everything was delicious and fresh. I wished we had one in albuquerque. The food tasted great and the staffs were super friendly. We came in on new years eve and although they had abbreviated hours, they did not hesitate to stay open until all their customers got their food.  Can't beat business practices like that."}
{"text":"Best sandwich place I've visited in a while! Friendly staff, excellent sandwiches (I had to get 2 on the first order),  and the owner even came out to talk to us. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast or lunch! Fun take on a different kind of sandwich, similar to a panini. I had the #20 turkey, bacon, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, avocado, with sweet heat mustard. My sandwich was so yummy and I would definitely order it again. I also had a side of potato salad which was okay but nothing impressive. I kinda wished I had a pickle on the side. Their assortment of iced teas are awesome as well. I Mixed the prickly pear with the green tea  The atmosphere is my favorite part, great patio seating! Can't wait to try their breakfast and fresh squeezed orange juice/ mimosas, next time for sure."}
{"text":"It physically pains me to write this review. I've been wanting to try Zookz for years but didn't see many vegetarian sandwiches and when I discovered I'm gluten intolerant I put Zookz out of my mind. Luckily I saw on Facebook a couple of months ago that Zookz now has gluten free bread AND from my favorite bakery, Gluten Free Creations.  My husband picked up Zookz yesterday so we could have for dinner. I got the No. 40 which I've had twice before on gluten free bread, they even write \"gf\" on it. I don't know what went wrong yesterday, but OH BOY!!!! I ate half the sandwich last night around 7:00 and by 1:00 am I was writhing in pain. Anyone who has gluten sensitivities know exactly what I mean. I am positive the bread was gluten free, but Zookz does not have a gluten free kitchen nor do they claim to have one. I believe cross contamination occurred at some point.  I enjoy Zookz. The owner is super nice and actually cares about her business and customers which is why I'm saddened that I can no longer eat there. My husband has no gluten issues so he'll be back."}
{"text":"I really like this place! For someone who doesnt really like sandwhiches i love it! Its very cute and i love the decor and seating area. I got the #11 which has bacon, cheese, tomato, cream cheese, and egg. I knew the sandwhich was going to be rich tasting right off the bat because of the cream cheese. To be honest i wasnt expecting a lot of bacon, because lets be real here, what place actually puts a lot of bacon in anything? To my surprise it was filled with chopped bacon. 4/5! Also to add the ladies at the front were extremely nice!  And of course the REAL reason i came here was because of the #55. Nutella, banana, peanut butter and roasted almond goodness! Ugh. Im a sucker for anything chocolate and peanut butter. Oh my gosh this sounded like heaven and it was!!! 5/5 This is the only reason for my 5 star review. I didnt know such thing even exsisted on earth. This will def be bad for my wallet and ill pay for it at the gym.. damn"}
{"text":"Came in her for a quick bite to eat one day as I read good things about this place, plus I remember when it was a Sweet Tomatoes so I wanted to see how the place has changed. I ordered the #35 and my wife got the #20. The sandwiches are small, but are delicious. The flavors complimented each other in a great way. To top off our experience, we splurged for the prickly pear tea and pomegranate green tea which were both delicious as well. I would have given it 5 stars, but the service wasn't that great as I think they were trying to close up for the day, but it wasn't bad enough to make us not come back again.   Definitely recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to go here today after being teased by that freakin' billboard on central and camelback.   Here I go: I walked in and the young man behind the counter was very pleasant and took the time (the time I didn't have) to explain what they're all about. The owner was there too and she was super nice. They kept addressing me by my first name which I thought was really friendly. It made me feel like I was at a friends place. I ended up getting the mozzarella and tomato sandwich that came with a TINY salad. There are a few different salads, I went with the kale one. So when I went back to work, the moment of truth was bestowed upon me and I took my first bite and it was...OKAY! Nothing to rave about honestly which sucked because I wanted to love it. It lacked flavor was just plain bland. The kale salad was too oniony.  The prices were decent also.  I am all about local support, so I probably will give it another shot. 2nd times the best time, right? (I don't know where that even came from)"}
{"text":"The hype is 100% warranted. This place is great. If you're boring and basic and want a plain sandwich, go to Subway. If you want your mind blown by an incredible sandwich like no other, go to Zookz."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I recommend this place. It's clean, every employee is smiling and the sandwiches are DELISH!!! Come check it out!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. The decor is clean, adorable, and trendy. I went with four people, we all got different sandwiches, sides, and drinks and everyone of us raved about our meals. Seriously the most delicious sandwich ever. My garbanzo side was so good too! The choices of flavored tea was impressive. The food was well worth telling friends about and a return visits. But we also had to good fortune of meeting the owner. Probably one of the friendliest kindest businesses owners I've ever met. You can tell this place is a work of passion. She has a way about her that makes you think you're sweet and fun aunt is cooking for you. She's the type of person you want to invite to family affairs. She was so helpful in explaining her menu and being hospitable. She even brought our table a free dessert which was amazing and I now unfortunately will not be able to go back without getting one in the future! Go here! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was great. I would def come back if I lived in the neighborhood! I got #66 and it was quick and fresh and decently priced!"}
{"text":"I'm in my first trimester of my pregnancy and woke up craving a breakfast sandwich. I found this place online and after seeing the pictures of the sandwiches I had to go. Ive been extremely nauseous this pregnancy and I hardly enjoy my food as much as I normally do, but I remained optimistic... It was raining today so, my fiance and I dressed our two toddlers in some warm clothes and headed out. When we got there the parking was sparse, but luckily we found a spot right in front of the restaurant. When we got out of the car I noticed the place was a bit smaller than I anticipated, but I liked that there was a nice, large sliding glass door which was opened. I liked that there was a good amount of seating outside as well. When we walked towards the register we were greeted by a very kind and friendly lady. I let her know it was a first time there and she seemed very happy to help us. She told us about their most popular sandwiches and kindly recommended the sandwich with nutella, banana and almonds for our children. My fiance ordered The Zinger which was amazing according to him and that's a huge compliment because with his father being an impeccable cook, he is all about quality and taste when it comes to his food. I'm not sure if my sandwich had a name, but it had turkey ,bacon, avocado and honey mustard I believe. I asked for the mustard on the side, because I wasn't sure if my unborn baby would take to it. The woman who took our order told me a side was included with my order and showed me to their refrigerator which had a few health conscious options. I decided on the garbanzo bean salad and she kindly handed me her kale and tangerine salad as well. I enjoyed both sides. My family and I sat outside since the rain had died down and enjoyed the fresh air. The woman who took our order also took our food to us outside while we were all taste testing the sides. My sandwich was amazing, my children's sandwich was amazing and the pomegranate green tea I ordered with my sandwich was VERY good. The woman came outside to check on us and to also let us know they will be moving down the street to the plaza with AJ's Fine Foods by the end of December because they are aware of the parking issue. I think with the food being so good they've outgrown their space. I had a very good overall experience  and will be visiting them at their new location in the near future!! I have not had many GREAT experiences with food in the last 3 months, but this was definitely one of them!"}
{"text":"I had the #20.  Deeeelish, kale salad was yummy too.  I had never been there before and the guy behind the counter was so nice and helpful in making my sandwich choice."}
{"text":"You are now aware that Zookz makes uncrustables for grown-ups. And while you can't get a PB&J, they are delicious.   I must have stumbled upon a meeting of sorts during my first visit to Zookz. About six workers stopped, looked my way, and greeted me with huge smiles. I can tell when someone is faking it, and these grins sure were genuine!  I wanted the very best they had to offer, so without hesitation I went for their most popular lunch--turkey, bacon, avocado, and sweet mustard. It came with a tiny, but scrumptious side salad of kale, craisins, and walnuts. Delightful! Some say these are small, but this is a right-size lunch at a good price. Totally snagged a little jug of apple juice with my sandwich and dropped less than $9 for a satisfying meal.   A fair criticism to ding a star for is that it's not as flavorful as the ingredients would suggest. Rather than an eclectic sandwich, it almost tastes like the best grilled cheese you've had in your life. I would use less cheese and probably go for something sharper, just to let everything else shine.   Whoever writes the menu has some creativity and a keen palate for mixing flavors. If you're around CenPho and seeking a tasty, casual lunch, don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here for the first time and OMG it was so delicious! I had the No 20 and it was so good and a kale side salad! OMG YES, I ordered and paid online and as soon as I got there my food was ready I was in and out in 3 minutes. Love it, definitely going back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place more times than I can count. I usually try to come here on the weekends for a quick brunch after Zumba or before doing errands. If you haven't been here, you are missing out.  Where do I even begin?! This place is a quick, to-go breakfast & lunch sandwich place. Personally, I love breakfast sandwiches, especially if they are quick, cheap, and amazing! You get all of that plus more at Zookz. My personal faves for the breakfast are the No.11 and No.66. Both are oozing with flavor. For lunch, my go-to is the No.10. I didn't think I'd like the sweet mustard with the apples + cranberries combination, but to my surprise, this one hit the spot. Other times, I just stick to the 11 and 66 because who doesn't like breakfast at any other time of the day? Aside from the sandwiches, this place has killer potato salad.  Inside, there's corn, black beans, green onions, and more. You'll have to try it yourself.   The service here is superb (hi, Adrianna!). Because of coming here so many times, I see how consistent the service AND the food are, which both keep me coming back. The ambiance of the place is SO cute and charming. The yellow color scheme makes the place feel vibrant and fresh. The owner is awesome too! Even when it's busy, she tries to walk around and address customers inside.  The parking is shared with many other places in this area, right in front of the entrance and on the sides. I haven't had much of an issue with this. They're usually open 7am-4pm... although I do wish they were open later (breakfast for dinner is one of my faves).   Overall, if you're looking for a quick breakfast, whether you want to sit inside with a date, group, or by yourself, or just a quick pick-me-up, Zookz is definitely worth the try."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are very unique comparing to others.  I definitely come back again with my little one."}
{"text":"My husband found this place while golfing with a buddy. He raved about it all week long and then insisted we go back the following Saturday morning. I tried the No. 11 with avocado and it was so good, my son even likes this place and he's a finicky eater. The owner Carol came out introduced herself and asked if we needed anything. Overall I would definitely venture Back to central Phoenix for another Zooks No. 11.. The service was quick and great, the staff is friendly, the food is really good!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and while not bad, I find nothing really satisfying about the place. First visit, my breakfast sandwich fillings were distributed mostly to one side, so one half was relatively tasty but the other side was bland. 2nd visit, my lunch sandwich fillings were good, but nothing really stood out that would make want the sandwich again, or even to return to Zookz at all. My biggest complaint about Zookz is the bread. Their 'uncrustable' style of sandwich pocket pressing results in a very dry, very hard, unappealing, nearly inedible 1\" surround on the sealed edge of the bread. If they buttered the bread before closing it up in their clamshell press, it might improve the product.   Zookz isn't bad; it just fell far short of my expectations based on reviews. Two visits & I'll opt for the many other better sandwich places around town from now on."}
{"text":"So I used to cater from this place before she moved into this new location across the street. My guys used to complain that the sandwiches weren't big enough so I usually ordered 1 1/2 - 2 sandwiches per person, problem solved, the sandwiches were $5.75/$5.95 each so it wasn't a huge price to incur when you're simply feeding a lunch meeting.  Now I decided to take my son in for 2 sandwiches (because I KNOW one isn't going to fill him up, he's a teen and they're always ready to inhale everything after school). Imagine my surprise when I see she's increased her prices to $8.50 a sandwich, same flavors, same size just MORE money. So for 3 almost hot pocket sized sandwiches, a bag of chips and 2 small..and I mean small side salads the total was $27 and that's with NO DRINKS.  I'm sorry but it appears that she moved into other new snazzy location in the AJ's lot and is passing the cost on to her customers. Good sandwich, and I mean just good..nothing spectacular or extraordinary but for $27 I can walk around the the walkway to AJ's and buy a pound of their finest ham, a loaf of their gourmet, fresh baked bread and some imported cheese and go home and make 8 toasted sandwiches and still have money left over for a couple cookies to eat afterwards.  Shame because there were already complaints of the sizes of her sandwiches for the price when they were cheaper but now at this rate, she won't be in that corner long."}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying this place out , the food was very delicious and atmosphere was very peaceful and unique.  I got the No. 33 Breakfast sandwich which included 2 poached eggs , fresh spinach ,feta cheese, fresh basil and tomatoes . The most unique thing about there sandwiches are that they are in mountain pies( campfire sandwiches) and so delicious , it reminded me of going camping during summer camp and making mountain pies around the campfire.  Thanks for helping reminisce on old times.   Beware during lunch you may have a hard time finding a parking spot in front , but there is always parking on the other side of flower child ,Or by see' s candies.  The staff was super friendly,  they have Wi-Fi here but unfortunately my computer wasn't letting me use it for some reason (famous: connected but no internet error).  Only thing I would have liked was to have outlets outside or inside (then again i didn't see any where I was seated) so that people could sit out side and work ."}
{"text":"If your wanting a quick breakfast or even lunch this is your place!   The food is absolutely amazing and great prices no more than $10   The owners are awesome right when you walk inside. They always ask if you have been to zoosk and can probably tell/if you need a little help understanding the menu or what it is exactly.  The eggs are always cooked to perfection, the place is clean and bright and fast service !   I highly recommend but you have to go early because they close at 3pm !"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are toasted round filled with different delightful ingredients. You can order more traditional breakfast fillings with eggs and maybe cheese and sauce and tomatoes or a number of different things. Then there are the rest of the sandwiches with turkey or beef ir ham and ... too many  lovely things to tell in this venue. With the \"lunch\" sandwiches there are several salads that accompany the sandwich and they are wonderful too. The people who serve you are also very friendly. It's a pleasure to go there and I would recommend it highly."}
{"text":"The kale salad is off the chart! The whole experience was fantastic. I had a question about ingredients and the chef was right there to happily answer my question. The atmosphere was cool and clean. Zooks is an instant fav"}
{"text":"This is such a quaint sandwich shop with delicious food and great service. The owner Carol was great...very friendly, informative and welcoming! I highly recommend checking this place out...we will be back!"}
{"text":"Got the 20 to go but absolutely amazing. I've never had a sandwich like this and I'm a big fan. The chocolate coconut dessert is great too. Im not a big eater and finished it with half of dessert so some of you should order 2. Ill be back for a breakfast sandwhich and a beer for sure."}
{"text":"Took my daughters here for a quick, light meal.  I was unfamiliar with the business, and didn't know all their sandwiches were pressed.  I had a turkey sandwich, with bacon, and feta. It was AMAZING!  My daughters had turkey, and roast beef sandwiches, which were equally delicious.  I met the owner, who was very pleasant, and gracious.  I will likely return."}
{"text":"This place rocks,  a must try I'm only disappointed that I haven't tried it sooner. The roast beef with horseradish is excellent."}
{"text":"SoooooGoooood!! :) I had never heard of this place.  I asked my phone for a sandwich shop nearby my new office/Central and Camelback.  The service was outstanding, and when I got back to my office to eat at my desk...I had to stop eating to pick up the phone, and call them to compliment them on how amazingly delicious my sandwich AND potato salad was. (I had the #20)  No lie...this was ridiculously delish!! I am headed back there at least once a week. Congratulations to Zooks!! Glad your here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it. We came and had a #20 and a salad, so we could try them both. When the salad first came out, it looked small, once I started mixing it, it was quite filling. The bread that the sandwich is made with is so yummy and creative. Love the crust."}
{"text":"I love Zookz! I always have! I don't know how some of these yelpers can write 1 star when they're angry they caught you outside business hours. It forever changes your rating and she HASN'T EVEN TRIED THE PRODUCT!?! Look at the hours, people! and don't get all hurt because you can't do your homework by looking at the hours!"}
{"text":"Wow! Loved my sandwich, tea, and side kale salad. Everything's seems fresh, and what a unique and creative idea for sandwiches. I loved it. Recommend trying it if in the area. Definitely left me with an itch to come back and try different sandwiches! I had the 35, basically roast beef with horseradish sauce, it was very tasty!"}
{"text":"I was craving a good salad and was also feeling lazy. After some searching, I discovered you can order Zookz online and walk right in and pick it up. Score! I ordered the No. 5 Salad which is fresh Mixed Greens, chicken, crumbled bacon, roasted almonds, cranberries, diced apples, shredded carrots, and Zookz Creamy Apple Mustard Dressing. It was everything that a salad should be! Light, refreshing, yet extremely satisfying. I ordered the dressing on the side to be a little healthier, but it was so good that I ended up eating it all anyways.  A week or so later, I decided to try breakfast. I went with the online ordering again and got a Nutella, peanut butter and banana sandwich for my boyfriend and an egg sandwich for myself. The sandwiches look a  little on the small side, but are surprisingly filling. They are also more like an uncrustable than a regular sandwich, but that's part of the charm.  The Nutella sandwich was pretty good, and not overly sweet considering its contents. I liked my egg sandwich that included bacon, ham, cheddar, black beans, avocado, and zookz chipotle sauce. My only dislike was I wish they let you do a little more customizing when ordering online.  I hope they consider some later hours in the future. They only open through lunch right now, and it would definitely be convenient to order online and pick up dinner on the way home... if I still lived in Phoenix."}
{"text":"First stop after we landed at airport. Delicious sandwiches. Very nice staff. Enjoyed the setting."}
{"text":"It's a glorified hot pocket. It tasted good but the portion size was disappointing. It's a perfect snack not a meal."}
{"text":"One of the more unique sandwiches I've had. I feel like I'm eating a sandwich with a pot pie crust instead of buns/bread. Breakfast sandwiches are great hangover food."}
{"text":"I know this isn't the popular opinion here, but I really didn't care for this sandwich place.   Customer service is stellar. Owner was there and friendly and helpful.   The food? Kind of boring and bland. My son called it a glorified hot pocket. I do think it has a lot of potential, but it's just not there yet."}
{"text":"They moved to a new cute location!!!! Love the new spot and the new sandwiches! The pulled pork is craymazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time this past weekend and will certainly return.  Great service, unique sandwiches from a a bread standpoint and my roast beef and cheddar was very tasty and had just enough horseradish sauce!"}
{"text":"I got the No. 20 and it was alright but the crusts of the circled sandwiches were way too over cooked and the sandwich kept falling apart. I don't feel like they have perfected they're unique sandwich yet. Not sure I would come back"}
{"text":"First time here today and I met the owner. She was lovely! Very personable. I appreciate the welcome right when I walked in. It's a cute little place very modern industrial. Definitely a place to stop by for a bite. They serve breakfast all day long!! That wins my vote!!! I recommend this place to anyone who likes fresh local food!"}
{"text":"Great prices, great food. Zooks is my go-to spot when I'm hungry and in a hurry in Phoenix around lunchtime. The #20 (for turkey lovers) & #35 (for roast beef type people) are my favorites! I always get the kale salad on the side. Service is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Went there in the early morning on a weekend just after they opened.  The owner was there and the lady working the counter.  They were both so friendly and sweet.  I wasn't familiar with the menu or what exactly the sandwiches were all about.  I ordered the most popular breakfast sandwich, and it was very yummy.  I ordered a coffee which was also very tasty.  I liked the whole backstory that's on a big sign on the wall.  I love that it's all inspired by her grandmother and the amazing travels she would go on.  The decor is very cute and cozy and I wish I had the time to sit in there.  I'm almost never early enough to work to have the time to stop in, but I hope this place does a lot of business."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best. The name is ridiculous. They should have named if after the sandwich her grandmother made. These are basicly hobo pies. The portions are really small. For $12 I left hungry. Plus the layout is all wrong. You have to double back to get your drinks and fight the crowd to sit down. I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Ok, so I want to love this place, I've been waiting to try it for months, but in my opinion it's really just ok. I can only speak for my experience and for the two items that I ordered. I came in at noon on a Tuesday and ordered the mozz/spinach sandwich with a side of kale salad and a drink. While I waited for my sandwich, I stood by the fountain drinks waiting for the repair man to get down from his ladder blocking the faucets...he didn't. I stood there for 10 mins waiting for him to move until I finally asked the cashier if I would be able to get a drink. Ok, forgiven. The extremely hard crust on what is deemed to be a crustless sandwich was inexcusable. The contents of the sandwich were good, but only after peeling off the edges was I able to enjoy it. The kale salad was sub-par. Maybe I came on an off day, or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.  Overall, worth a shot but don't build it up before you go. It's nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Zooks just popped up on my UberEATS and I had to check it out. I'm indecisive and starving so ordered a breakfast, lunch and dessert sandwich. Oh. My. God. Every single one was incredible. I can't wait to go in person."}
{"text":"First visit here I was not disappointed. The owner greeted us told us about the sandwiches said if we didn't like them she would make us different ones, needless to say she did not have to make us new ones. We had the zinger and the turkey one #20.We also had the kale and a garbanzo salad. Sandwiches were toasty good We will be back They will be moving soon to the AJ's shopping center off Central so make sure you don't miss this unique place. Also very fast service."}
{"text":"Love the food and the concept. Original sandwiches, healthy, clean, and fresh flavors. Ate there for the first time today and the owner was a beautiful and kind lady. I highly recommend everyone check this place out and make it a routine!"}
{"text":"I have a friend who comes here almost every day, and her pictures and posts of Zookz made me HAVE to make the trip to Phoenix to eat there. The location is really cute and I loved the decor. Service incredibly friendly and attentive. They asked how I heard of them and I told them how I heard through my friend (they immediately knew who I was talking about). I really enjoyed the feel in Zookz. You can tell it is a small, locally-owned business that treats their employees right.  The food: I got #20 with the potato salad (and a soda, because their cups were cute. I'm weird). My friend got #25 with the kale salad. I'm forgetting what exactly was in mine... I think turkey, avocado, cheese, and tomatoes... but it was delicious! I was really impressed with the bread, which was crispy and light but with great flavor. My sandwich + soda was ~$9. Pretty good price for a locally owned small business.  I highly recommend Zookz to anyone who is in Phoenix (or even by making a trip out there for those of us who live in N. Scottsdale). I've already told all of my friends about Zookz, and I can't wait until I can go back!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get sandwiches! Everyone is friendly and the food is ALWAYS delicious. Thank you Carole!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome and customer service is even better. Great place to swing by for a break from work or school. GCU student approved"}
{"text":"Great little place. The guy at the counter was very helpful explaining this new sandwich concept and pointing out popular items.   They take two slices of bread sort of a french bread, put the ingredient in the middle and press it in some sort of machine to melt and seal it all together. Very tasty.  I had a breakfast sandwich with poached eggs and my partner had a turkey sandwich that came with a side salad. Both sandwiches were fantastic with all the ingredients fused together  and the side kale salad with orange dressing was amazing. Please make this into a regular size salad with chicken or something, its delicious."}
{"text":"Nice Sunday casual food. I had the ham, avocado, black bean chipotle.  It was great! I'm not a fan of hot sandwiches but this might change my mind. The potato salad had corn and black beans and it was a fabulous twist! Atmosphere was very laid back and cozy. I would have liked a wheat alternative to the bread as I don't care for white bread. Worth seeking out! Oh-- I think the owner said hi and that was nice!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is consistently good. #22 is my fav.  Love the variety of flavored teas they serve. The vibe is low key and family friendly. The owner almost always comes out and says hi to us and other guests. My folks have been going here for years and my only regret is I didn't start coming her until recently!"}
{"text":"Wow... From the first moment I walked in!! Such friendly staff who greet you! I got the #33 without tomatoes and it was very delicious!! I would say the best breakfast sandwich I've had in a very long time. I'm not a fan of spinach but I kept it on the sandwich and it tasted great with the egg and cheese. All fresh ingredients and the taste definitely shines through. Easily a 5star place based on atmosphere, friendliness and taste. Thank you Zookz, a true Diamond in the rough!!! If I'm ever passing through Phoenix again, no doubt I will stop in and eat me some deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Walked right in on Tuesday after Christmas.   No sign on the door, nothing indicating place was closed.  Door was open, employee sitting inside said, \"sorry were closed.\"  Closed forever?  Closed for today?  Closed until when?  Why was door open and no sign saying clised?"}
{"text":"After I finished facilitating my meeting for work, my co-worker and I decided to get a bite to eat.  We were starving, we were hungry, we were cranky.  Unfortunately for us it was still early so everywhere we wanted to go was still not opened.. That's when we decided to give this place a try.    The restaurant was clean, service was good, staff was helpful and nice, the food was unique and good, plenty of lighting and unfortunately the price is kinda high, but no big deal.   Overall a good little place, we had a nice time, and I would probably only comeback...."}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches fed my craving. The owner came over and was very helpful. I'm glad I live near this place. We will be back."}
{"text":"Ate here this morning with my wife. Ordered number 66 and a 22. We really enjoyed it and has a unique style to delivering breakfast. It's simple but good. I've been told by a couple friends to check it out that are in love with it. And I think it's worth the money."}
{"text":"His is by far the best sandwich I have eaten at by far, if you want a light, flavorful, crisp sandwich that is full of favor I suggest this place, everything is modern, cute decor, and a perfect first date spot. The menu is cheap; and the food is great!!"}
{"text":"I am a regular lyft driver and today i picked up a woman with limited mobility and very limited eyesight. I have to admit i would have never have gone here, if she hadnt asked. Nonetheless, i was skeptical about how this encounter would go and asked if she had gone before and what the deal was. She said it was The best but another nameless rideshare company wouldn't help her out with the whole journey. We ordered pickup from her house and then cruised, 10 minutes tops on a Friday during lunch. The counter person was extremely friendly, helpful, and compassionate. The owner greeted the woman and they discussed her love of the restaurant at length. The space itself is quaint and has the coolest door in the world. I loved the selection, menu, and overall atmosphere. The sandwich itself is like a empanada made out of bread. The bread is pressed in a panini manner. Served hot. After the transaction was completed, she asked if i could take her home. At a stop light she begged me to take a bite of her sandwich and we ended up sharing our #24 and #25 in the car. It was a truly beautiful sandwich. I wouldn't have found it wasn't for this nice ole lady.  I guess i need to bring someone here and repay the favor to appease the sandwich gods."}
{"text":"I came here with my mother who was visiting from another state and we both absolutely loved our sandwiches. The salads we got with them were just as amazing. The portions were just right too. Not so much food that we wasted anything but enough that we definitely left feeling full. We'll definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"My fist time here I was doubtful of what to order but I went with the pineapple coconut sandwich I think is 44 or 40 really good and make feel so happy and light"}
{"text":"Loved the breakfast sandwiches, crispy on the outside and full of flavor on the inside. The atmosphere was great and laid back on the Inside, and they had a great selection of iced teas!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite spot to get breakfast during my morning bike rides. The No. 44 is my favorite egg frittata. Bacon. Ham. Yummy!!!  I usually get a couple sides to go with it. The kale salad is to die for!!!  Great job ladies!!!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and watched a live feed from this establishment on the morning news. Wife and I decided to try it. Did not disappoint. I had #25 the ham & cheese and the wife had the #33 poached eggs. Great choices! The bread was toasted to perfection. With the lunch sandwich you get a choice of a salad or a bag of chips. Great seating area with water misters on the patio. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Yum you have to try this place! They are the nicest people. Be sure to mention Yelp for a 10% discount."}
{"text":"Was in the area and thought I'd stop in for a quick bite to eat.  Located off Camelback Road but can be a little difficult to miss unless you're in the actual compound, then the sign becomes visible. Lots of parking.  The place is on the small side (-1).  There is outside seating, tough in my opinion, not enough.  High chairs and tables are available indoors, but still I couldn't help but feeling quite choked whilst in there. Staff were great and friendly.  Answered any questions we had and even made recommendations.  Menu was easy to comprehend.  Restaurant has an open concept so I'm not sure how customers would be cooled during the hot summer months.  Restaurant was clean.  Food was delicious.  The rounded toasted sandwich concept is interesting and innovative.  Everything is made fresh.  I had the pulled pork (I believe #60) and that comes with a side. I chose their potato salad.  The latter was fresh, tasty, and a small kick to it.  The sandwich tasted fresh and flavorful. If I'm in the area again, I'd definitely like to try some of the other choices on the menu, but will probably take it away or eat in my car."}
{"text":"This sandwich shop is amazing. The staff was very nice and the food was extremely good! I recommend getting the Num 35, roast beef, and getting the kale salad for the side.  The owner, who I believe was on the line cooking, made it around to ask how our sandwiches were which I felt made her very open to hear what her customers thought.  Their dessert is also amazing! My wife and I shared a Banana, Nutella and Peanut Butter sandwich. This was a great way to finish the meal."}
{"text":"I went here with coworkers for a quick lunch and was not disappointed. The staff was friendly and helpful. The manager also came out to see how we were enjoying our meal.  I am not sure how to describe the sandwiches that they make. They look like two pancakes, but they are not, that are fused together with the delicious meat, cheese, and vegetable combinations stuffed inside. I had the turkey bacon and avocado and it was scrumptious.  The sandwich came with an orange citrus kale salad that was unexpectantly delicious and I don't normally like kale.  As a surprise from my coworkers the staff brought me a piece of their oatmeal coconut cake. I wasn't sure what to expect but it did not fail. The cake was light and moist and the coconut was not overpowering.  I would highly recommend that if you are ever near camelback and central for lunch to check out this place."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, I had the #45 and it was delicious!! These sandwiches are like toasted pockets that keep everything in. Oh and definitely try the kale salad! Average price is 10 bucks. I'll definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Since zookz moved to Camelback and Central they've really surprised my taste buds! One morning a friend and I decided to grab breakfast and was pleasantly surprised by the amazing customer service provided by the associates and the owner! She was welcoming, warm and excited to see us back again! So excited to try more toasted sandwiches! Cheers!"}
{"text":"First time there and it was a good impression. Not great but good. Ordered the Chicken curry sandwich and the side Kale salad. Sandwich was warm and the portion was good. However, I'm use to Kale salads being sour. This one was sweet. I know it said a Citrus dressing but I wasn't expecting sweet citrus. I was impressed with the tea selection. Very good unique selections. Overall, a good and expedient experience."}
{"text":"Unique sandwiches! Loved our lunch! Really impressed with service and how quick our food came out even though the place was packed! Strongly recommend"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have tried half the menu so far and every sandwich tastes so good! The food tastes healthy and has so much flavor. I also always get the potato salad with my lunch sandwich and it is so good! The service and food quality is never disappointing! So glad I found this place.  Oh and the people that work here are so friendly. Almost every time I come in the owner is working. She is so kind and ensures her customers are happy and satisfied with their food."}
{"text":"Great concept!  Great Environment!  Prompt with the food!  And frankly cheap!!  Not to mention my sandwich was excellent!!  I had the #66"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick fix, a yummy breakfast, and a semi-non-messy meal, go to Zookz. These tiny little sandwiches are like little pies ready to be devoured. Is it a calzone? Is it a pie? Is it an empanada? I have no idea which exact family Zookz sandwiches fall under, but just know that there is a delicious filling tucked into a circular blanket of dough. I've ordered the popular No. 11 a few times now, which has cream cheese, egg, and bacon in the filling. Biting into it, the cream cheese gushes out in ample glory and egg yolk drips in suit with each bite. I adore breakfast food and can't help but be a fan."}
{"text":"First time, delivered through Uber Eats, order was accurate, interesting take on a sandwich. Very good. Didn't love the outside crust but the sandwich itself was fantastic."}
{"text":"The new location is great! Love the owner she is so nice and the food is always fresh and amazing. The #20 is my favorite with added egg."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are delicious and unique. Fun experience, staff was very friendly and helpful. Really enjoyed corn salad and kale salad. Food tastes fresh and the hot sandwiches arrived to our table quickly! We had lunch but would love to return for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Delish sandwich and amazing little salad.  If the items were cheaper or the portions bigger I would give them 5 stars.  Come if you're feeling peckish, not famished!"}
{"text":"A cool idea for sandwiches. Toasted, circular, and sealed. Fantastic service. Very friendly. Had an egg frittata sandwich with feta, bacon, ham, Parmesan cheese, roasted red peppers, and basil. It was really tasty, can't wait to try the lunch sandwiches."}
{"text":"Heard about this amazing place from a friend. It was like a grilled cheese for breakfast! Nice quality ingredients, and very reasonable prices. The owner was incredibly accommodating and friendly. Very passionate about her business. I will most definitely be back!  I would also like to add that I went here for breakfast and had to take half the sandwich home. They're very filling!"}
{"text":"GAD-ZOOKS I can't say enough about Zooks! We make the drive from Gilbert just to eat here. The staff is very nice and helpful.  The atmosphere is super welcoming and comfortable.  The food? Well the food is fresh and super delicious. The sandwiches are on a fantastic bread panini style. SOOOO GOOD! You also get a side salad or chips (I've never gotten the chips). It's a choice of a freaking delicious garbanzo bean salad, mouth watering Kale salad, or Potato salad that will knock your socks off!  If you are looking for a new place to eat I highly recommend ZOOKS!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here since they've been open.  Literally 2.3 seconds away from ny house    Amazing delicious little spot.   #45 #20 #33 a mustttttttttttt  the Potatoe and kale salad was to die for. I killed it. Hehe :D  Carol the owner was wonderful. So kind and very friendly. The people here were so friendly especially being first timers here and was a pain. Lolz.  I AM COMING BACK!!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just ate here for the first time today. The customer service of the staff gets a 5/5, they were friendly and helpful. The food gets a 3.5/5 (I gave it a 3, my gf gave it a 4). We both got the turkey bacon avocado lunch sandwich with no mustard. It was a bit dry, would have been better with a little ranch. I'm excited to try the breakfast sandwich next time. The interior was awesome, all open to the patio (its November so the weather was beautiful). Very cute. Overall, 4/5. I would suggest this place."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, but....service was slow (I was the only person in the place), the portion size was small (for the price) and my drink was watered down and ice machine was either empty or broken (which meant a metal container was left on the side with a paper cup in it - how many hands touched the cup and toss it back in?!) No Thanks!  I will say that the taste of the food was good, but it's pricey."}
{"text":"After a stressful morning I came here with my best friend for the very first time. It was lunch time but I ordered breakfast  Ordered number #33 and it was bomb dot com!!! It was like a food gasm in my mouth. Oh and the prizes for the sandwiches was super reasonable. It's like $5-6 per sandwich.   Oh and I also walked in on a girl using the restroom so I think you guys need to fix the bathroom lock. Haha."}
{"text":"service was sub par, ordered the number 22 for breakfast and it had very little avocado on it bacon and ham and was overloaded with black beans, I was very unimpressed"}
{"text":"Only downside is parking.  Unique and delicious sandwich.  My favorite is the PB&J... Nice little treat!"}
{"text":"Very unique sandwiches, healthy, delicious, fresh and warm.  The staff is very friendly and there's a great story behind the place.  The owner is there and pours her soul into the sandwiches and the customers, delightful lady.  The place is neat, clean and inviting.   Get a sandwich with an EDGE and support a fledgling new business."}
{"text":"I like the concept and that the sandwich I had was not greasy.  I could see where this type of sandwich could get really greasy, but I did not think that it was as amazing as the reviews led me to believe.  It was good, but I've had better kale salads and potato salads.  The customer service was excellent.  Perhaps I will go back and try a different sandwich, but it did not wow me."}
{"text":"I ate there 2 weeks ago when I was in town for a diamondbacks game and I have been dreaming of these sandwiches. Come on, its just a panini on round bread, ahh, no, its so much more, that sauce, there has to be something in it. Sweet mustard. Idk but I seriously cant stop craving it. Worth the 2 hour drive, but not quite worth the drive back to Tucson. So so good, hope they expand."}
{"text":"In love with Zookz! One of my to go lunch spots. The 35 is my favorite on the menu, make sure you add avocado. The pomegranate-green iced tea is addicting, I could drink this all day. Make sure to say hi to Carole the owner, she'll make sure everything is great. The level of service is how it should be nice, receptive, and willing to help you out as soon as possible. Can't say enough about Zooks. If you haven't tried it give it a try."}
{"text":"So I've been a roll on trying new great lunch spots and Zookz is just that. I was craving a salad (even though their known for their sandwiches) and I saw one on their menu that made my stomach jump up and down with excitement.   I got the #3 salad that has mixed greens, black beans, corn, sunflower seeds, feta cheese, chicken, and a honey balsamic dressing. And yes, it was as delicious as it sounds! My stomach and I were completely satisfied. I ordered to go and they made sure to put two dressing in there with the salad which made me happy. Nothing worse than an underdressed salad!! Situation averted.   As I was standing in line I was able to briefly skim the rest of their menu and see some pictures of their popular breakfast and lunch sandwiches. They looked amazing and I was surprised to find out that they are unique sandwiches as they're pressed/made/heated into a pocket like form so all the goodies of the sandwich are invisible to the naked eye until bit into (or cut in half). Basically, they look yummy and fascinating. I can't wait to go back and try one out. They also have dessert sandwiches too!  The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. I wish I lived a little closer so I could frequent this spot more often. ALSO, check in on Yelp and received 10% off your bill!! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches here!!! Ordered several to try them all and first of all they're hella cute. Little sealed in grilled toasted cute things!! Secondly they are super yummy! No complaints at all. I would say maybe add a smiiiiiiidge more salt but not really necessary I suppose. I also got the mocha something or other drink which was really sweet but interesting and delicious. I like the food and overall vibe of this place (: would recommend to a friend!!"}
{"text":"So delicious! The four of us got different sandwiches so we could try several then we split 2 dessert sandwiches. Everything we tried was delicious! Their sandwiches are big enough to fill you up but not too big that you can't finish them. If you are really hungry I would grab a dessert sandwich to go with it. The sandwiches are small enough you won't walk out feeling like it was too much.  Fair pricing! A sandwich and drink come out to about $7 and dessert ones are less than $5. A must try if you're nearby!"}
{"text":"Zookz is serving up some really yummy sandwiches!  Their sandwich is definitely unique. The way the bread is toasted/pressed together makes it even more enjoyable.  I'm pretty sure the press used to make the sandwiches is proprietary so this was the first time I've had a sandwich pressed in this style.  I went with the #20 ($8.25): Turkey, bacon, avocado and tomatoes, with shredded cheddar cheese, and honey mustard.  It was really tasty, perfect amount of everything so each bite was delicious.  It had the perfect amount of honey mustard, I ate it all up and was hungry for more. It is a modest portion, but was so enjoyable.  The wife went with the #45 ($7.25): fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, spinach, roasted red peppers, fresh basil and honey balsamic vinaigrette.  She absolutely loved it. Very good vegetarian sandwich.  Again, just the perfect amount of ingredients including the very tasty honey balsamic vinaigrette.  The potato salad was pretty good and had a southwest take, including black beans and corn.  I'd be back for the sandwiches. Very tasty and a great to go option when on the run."}
{"text":"Love their sandwiches! I highly recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Super interesting and delicious spin on a traditional sandwich. They have a lot of unique options, and are always willing to substitute anything. It's made it order so very customizable. Very friendly staff and owner as well. Lots of seating. Free WiFi. Giant window which slides open for great weather days. I've introduced a lot of friends here and got them hooked! The desserts and sides are also really good. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Really yummy fresh ingredients. Try the potato or kale salad and you'll be delighted by the taste and textures. On our first visit, the owner came right out and talked to us about the menu and checked back in to make sure we were enjoying. It's such a cute little spot. We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are just alright.  I don't understand the hype.  They're on the small side and I found the turkey sandwich to be rather boring.  I won't be back.  If you're into uncrustables this spot may be for you."}
{"text":"First of all, parking is awful. It was a Saturday at noon and no one was in the place, but there wasn't a space available!  Park on a sidestreet behind the little shopping center and you'll be fine.  Be sure to get the kale salad. Who likes kale? :-P You will after this salad!  It's tiny, but get it instead of chips. We split #35 and 20, roast beef and turkey. Both very unique!  Skip subway or McDonalds for lunch. Try Zookz. Sandwiches are a cross between a grilled cheese, pita pocket and calzone.  Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Number 66 is great. Both dessert ones are great. The owner is great. The location is great. Even the oatmeal coconut chocolate chip cookie is great. The prickly pear tea is... That's right... Great. This place should be everywhere."}
{"text":"Zookz has been open for about 18 months now... and I am truly upset with myself for not trying it sooner.  On the flip side of that, at least now I have a new regular lunch spot!  The owner Carol was extremely outgoing, friendly, and cordial!    These sandwiches could be described as fancy \"hot pockets\" on a phyllo-style dough... BUT I don't think that description actually does these sandwiches justice.  I'll just default to Zookz' description as \"sandwiches with an edge\"...  a very good edge!  And lunch and breakfast sandwiches are served all day long.    The #25 is a glorious combination of ham, turkey, black beans, melted cheese, tomatoes, avocado, and some sort of sauce that I can't recall because I scarfed down the sandwich so quickly!  Sooooo good!  Yay!"}
{"text":"Awesome tasting \"flying saucer\" sandwiches! Her desserts are diet killer! So good. The kale salad with the light dressing is full of flavor."}
{"text":"I can honestly say this was a great place to eat! I was here in Arizona for business and wanted to eat at a quick but good place and stumbled upon Zooks! Such a great staff and good food! The owner was very courteous and friendly. I would definitely recommend! Will be back next time I'm here for business again!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!! Amazing Sandwiches and sides!! The people here are also so nice. I had an amazing first time experience  all around!"}
{"text":"This is a really cute little eatery. The good is good. Portions are not that big so it can seem a little pricey. The customer service was excellent. The owner came over to make sure everything was okay and even said she would remake a sandwich for us if we didn't like it. One of the sandwiches had horseradish on it and I didn't like it and the owner kept her promise and made me a full new sandwich! The kale salad was also delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"My hunger quest brought me to Zookz. The sandwich that I ordered was the number 10 consisting of turkey and apple. I loved the sandwich. The place looks nice and brightly colored. Service was good and I will definitely will be wanting to comeback."}
{"text":"I've passed by zookz many many times, but, for whatever reason, I never went in. After the shop moved to its new location, I finally decided to give it a shot. The new location is super cute...I love the color scheme. I went for breakfast and had their sandwich with eggs, spicy cream cheese, bacon, and green onion add basil. I really enjoyed the sandwich except the fact that they can't control the cook on the eggs resulting in overcooked egg yolks. Who wants that? Anyway, the crust and the rest of the ingredients were delish and the prices were inexpensive. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I had my first visit today with my co-worker and friend who suggested it after coming a while back with her husband and I am HOOKED! The ladies working behind the counter were super nice, helpful, and very welcoming. We met the owner who was the sweetest lady and I even suggested an idea for a sandwich. The ambiance of the place is relaxing and open, not stuffy at all or has that heavy food smell. The meal deal is a great price because it includes a side that is a decent portion with the main dish you order. I had the popular #20 with the kale salad as my side and the pomegranate green tea.....YASSSSS AMAZING! The style of the sandwich is so unique and it's just enough to fill you up! The bread is similar to a sourdough in the way that it is soft in the middle but has a great crunch on the outside but it doesn't cut the roof of your mouth like some breads do when they are toasted. Everything was fresh that was in the sandwich and in the salad. I will definitely be back and this place is PHENOMENAL!"}
{"text":"Visited today for the first time with my family for lunch. Atmosphere was very friendly and quite busy. We had the opportunity to meet the owner. She was an absolute delight when she came by our table. We had read about this place in a local newspaper article. The sandwiches were amazing and a real treat. We even got sandwiches to-go for dinner. I would highly recommend this place to someone who wants something different than a run-of-the-mill sub."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. Awesomeness in the form of warm breakfast and lunch sandwiches. My husband and I tried the \"Zinger\" which apparently wasn't on the menu originally but the owner said everyone loved it so much it is one of the most popular sandwiches. They also have sweet sandwiches as well if you've got a sweet tooth. We are only in town for a couple days and loved this place so much we are coming back again tomorrow. If we lived in the area this would definitely be one of my regular spots. Also to note the owner is super sweet and her staff is very friendly. They are pretty quick in the kitchen as well so if you don't have a lot of time this is a great place to grab a quick bite. Enjoy! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and again they have good sandwiches.  Also if you're a tea person they have fresh brewed (unsweetened- my personal favorite).  It's a cute place set in downtown right off Central.  There are lots of other things to do around here as well and I suggest making the time of your hungry for breakfast."}
{"text":"Good not great. Wasn't super filling but it was a fun atmosphere and unique sandwich experience."}
{"text":"We really loved this place. The owner stopped by to talk to us on our first visit. She explained how they worked hard to build their signature sandwich makers and that they work with wildflower bakery for their bread to be made in the shape they need for their sandwiches. I would try any of the sandwiches on the menu - excellent breakfast selections. I had the #25 which was the ham, avocado, black bean, cheese and signature chipotle sauce. DELICIOUS. Plus if you check in with Yelp you get 10% off your order. I can't wait to go back. I highly recommend this place. They have been open for 19 months. Right on the light rail in central phoenix."}
{"text":"Went here to pick up a sandwich to go.  Counter lady was friendly.  Chose the Mozzerella/basil/tomato.  When I opened the bag, I thought- Oh, man- it's so small. (the size of a appetizer paper plate)  But it was REALLY, REALLY good and filling!  There are no bread choices- it's sorta the 'Hot Pocket' concept, but fresh and round.   I wasn't offered any side choices other than the kale salad which was really good.  It was a bit soggy n the middle when I got back to work.  Had I eaten in, rather than to go, it would have been perfect.  This is not a buy the sandwhich and put it in the fridge until lunch kinda place.  I will definitely go back and eat in or within a few minutes.   I hope they make it!!!!"}
{"text":"They have good breakfast sandwiches and the staff is always really friendly. They could do a few things better taste wise on some stuff but they are definitely creative with their food."}
{"text":"Great little spot for a quick bite, but furniture is not comfortable enough to hang out.  Cool twist on a sandwich with the perfect ratio of bread to yummy fillings.  Loss of a star because parking sucks."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a late lunch. Outstanding. Friendly service. Excellent sandwich and the kale salad was amazing as recommended.    I got the ham and brie with apricot spread and almonds. Very tasty. The machine presses the sandwiches, reminds me of what we called hobo sandwiches around the campfire. I do taste the smokiness. Haha.  Be warned though, the sandwiches are small. Thats okay though, go with a friend and split a third sandwich. Perfect.     :-)"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful sandwich spot. Sandwiches are uniquely made and prepared to satisfaction.  This owner operated independent freshly clean new Phoenix restaurant offers a reasonable variety of hot sandwiches. Don't miss out on the kale salad.....it is heavenly.  We ended up having a bog bowl reorder after we were done with lunch.......it was soooo good.  The owner is very friendly, makes sure all customers are catered to satisfaction and custom makes sandwiches to your liking. It is definitely one of our new lunch/breakfast spots in town. :)"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, simple and fresh. The owner and staff are friendly and thoughtful. The store is lively and bright. Excellent neighborhood sandwich shop!!"}
{"text":"My coworker sent me over there for lunch. And may I say those sandwiches are delicious, just a bit small for my taste though. You might need two or more make you full. The interior of the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous and I love the seating. They even have misters outside! Great for this AZ heat. And there is outside seating for people with dogs."}
{"text":"What a fantastic breakfast and lunch place.  Unique, tasty and affordable.  Grilled sandwiches filled with fresh ingredients.  We had the turkey, dried cranberries with mild curry sauce. Incredible.  My husband had the ham with brie and apricot preserves.  Equally fabulous!  And the kale salad is to die for. Freshly prepared food in a clean and modern environment at these prices just can't be beat!  Breakfast sandwiches are only $4.50 and the lunch sandwiches are only $6.50.  A great experience.   Service is quick.   Owner came out to meet us and is lovely. New location is corner of Central and Camelback next to FlowerChild."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely adorable. I love the bright colors. They have a nice little patio with misters. The owner is so passionate and so nice. All the staff were actually very friendly. We ordered a cocoloco, zinger, and number 25. We chose the kale salad for a side, which was super fresh and had just enough citrus. The eggs were perfectly poached. The zinger sauce is amazing. And the sandwiches are super affordable! We so wish we had one in our neck of the woods. We will definitely be coming back next year!"}
{"text":"I always see this place when I go to Maizie's and have wanted to stop by. They are strictly breakfast and lunch, close by 3:30. After driving around the other day in circles in the dreaded \"Where should we gooooo\", I finally took a sharp turn and ended up here.   They serve breakfast all day and lunch comes with a side salad. I tried a number 30 (ham with brie, apricot spread, and almond) while the sis had a breakfast hot pocket, I mean sandwich. I opted for the garbanzo bean salad with feta. It was tasty, but I asked for an extra lemon to kick it up a notch. The kale salad also looked pretty tasty. While we were eating, I leaned over and said, \"It's like eating an adult Hot Pocket!\" She totally agreed. I mean really, you have crispy, hot french bread (almost croissant like), filled with various forms of meat and cheeses, served hot.   For both Zookz', a medium drink, my included side salad, plus an extra 10% for checking in, it was less than $14. Not too shabby for lunch in Cen Pho. I definitely want to come back and explore the menu more, especially their frittata breakfast sandwich and whatever one mentioned Nutella."}
{"text":"Delish! Had a breakfast sandwich to go and it was rich, filling, and perfectly sized. I really want to try their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I was starving and wanted a fun and unusual place to eat for breakfast. I found Zooks on Yelp and I'm so happy I listened to the reviews. The owner is so friendly and inviting. She helped me pick out my breakfast sandwich. She convinced me to try the \"Zinger\" oh boy was that thing delicious. She also mentioned that if I didn't like it that she would make me another sandwich no problem. The sauce on the sandwich with was a cream cheese siracha sauce and it was so yummy! But the real show stopper for me was the side kale salad. It was sweet and savory. I've never had a better tasting salad in my life. I can't wait to go back with my fiancé! You have to go!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff.  Even had a chance to meet the owner.  Tasty salad, had the no. 5.  My husband had a Jaffle- one of their signature sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I picked up. Easy to order over the phone and the food was ready when I got there.   I got #25 it was ok. Not the best sandwich I have ever had. But I am willing to try a different one and see if I change my mind. My side was a potato salad that was good."}
{"text":"Was there again today and the place continues to win me over and over again. All the employees are very friendly and I've dealt with the owner and she's a wonderful lady. Both the breakfast and lunch sandwiches are consistently good and the ambience is casual and modern. Can be irritatingly hipster at times, but it's downtown, so is expected. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So to start off the second we walked in, the owner walked up to us and introduced herself and completely explained the whole menu to us. One of the most friendly people there is. In addition the food was awesome. Such a great innovative new idea. Lastly as we ate she checked up on us at least 4 times to make sure everything was perfect. It deserves a 5 star for overall rating for sure"}
{"text":"Great food, packed to enjoy on the go.  Stopped here during a road trip.  Had the turkey, bacon, avocado, tomato sandwich along with their house salad.   The salad is also very delicious -- kale (used for texture -- you cant really smell it), along with several other ingredients and pickling (i believe) -- eg) chives, onion, small oranges, shaved almonds...   Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are a fun round shaped. All sandwiches are toasted and made to order. You can also add or subtract from the sandwiches. Try the kale salad, too. They have a great house dressing. The employees are highly motivated to ensure that you dining experience is wonderful! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I see all the mixed reviews so don't listen to them, listen to me!  PRO:  The food here is very good.  I had a sandwich and potato salad   CON.  The prices are high, charged me $8+.  Which wouldn't be an issue if the kitti-kat portions  were not so small.  That 4 oz salad doesn't cut it.  Which explains why there are so many females in here for their foo foo lunch.  But a REAL MAN who is used to eating a double burger combo with fries and quart of beer will leave very hungry or very poor.  Be warned"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are crunchy and creespy. I love the food inside of the sandwiches like a box. Salad is good with sanwishes. But the drinks is so artificial flavor for me. I ordered the tea, it was not a real tea."}
{"text":"Awesome delicious and different sandwich place! Corn and bean salad was good, would like some other options.  Definitely want to go back and try one of everything! Staff were friendly.  All around great new little spot"}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh, fast and affordable. Again Yelp has brought me to a place I would never have known about. So nice to walk in to be greeted by the owner who cares about her customers. The sandwiches were amazing, can't wait to try them all."}
{"text":"Must try sandwich place,  serves breakfast sandwiches all day,  best sandwiches I've had in Phoenix.  Hubby and i shared no. 20 Turkey and no.35 roast beef.  The flavors explode in your mouth,  making you close your eyes and say mmmmm with each bite. The potato salad and the garbanzo bean salad are so yummy too.  Definitely our new favorite place."}
{"text":"Interesting spin on sandwiches. These sandwiches are tasty, filling and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a meeting in downtown Phoenix we wanted to find a new place to eat. we heard about this place and stopped in for a quick bite. I had one of the daily specials (ham, mozzarella, pinapple/jalapeno chutney) and it was fantastic. The flavors melded just right for a perfect balance of sweet and savory. The zook was nice and toasty without being greasy. My wife got the NO. 20 and was raving about hers as well.  The chipotle potato salad was light and tasty, we devoured them in just minutes as we were waiting on the sandwiches.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, we will definitely make the trek from Chandler just to come here."}
{"text":"I just had a wonderful experience here so 5 stars it is. If George Foreman owned a eatery it would be Zooks. Lol- they make their sandwiches in a machine that transfers your meal into a pocket type of sandwich melt kind of like the grills Foreman makes. See, so I made that fun connection. However, the difference is the owner Carole is a gem. (Okay, maybe George is too but I don't know him personally or have ever met him before - Call me George Foreman the next time you are in Phx and Zooks is on me.- lol, silly me.)   After I walked in looking a little lost, a woman comes running over to me with a big grin on her face. She was so welcoming and explains the entire sandwich making process to me. I had no idea what to order so we began to chat. \"Wow, the staff here are so helpful and nice,\" I am thinking to myself. ( especially after I tell her I meant to go to another restaurant and found my way here by mistake. Well not really since Zooks was on the \"Gotta Try List\" anyway. I believe Karma led me here today ) Well, as it turns out this charming lady is to my great surprise the actual owner, Carole. She is so delightful, helpful and friendly. It is apparent Carole loves what she does and is proud of her place.   The breakfast sandwich I received was pretty tasty. They use Wildflower bread, Ummm, \"Yummers!\" I can't wait to come back and try all of the different menu item sandwiches. I read all these great comments on the Kale salad so I will have to try that too.   The only thing you might want to note is that the sandwiches are smaller than the average way too big portions we seem to be familiar with in America. I was thrilled myself. However, some other people who do not know any better might be forewarned.   Thank you Carole and the pleasure was all mine to meet you. Just a note, I never made it to the other restaurant at all. I might never with you nearby."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find!  Super friendly service that you just don't find anymore. The sandwiches are amazing. Great value for family. We will be back."}
{"text":"I checked this place out on yelp before I went, I saw a lot of good review so I ventured and got me a sandwich after church. I was really impressed with the place, it has a very colorful atmosphere and a personal welcoming feeling from the staff. I ordered the #22 breakfast sandwich, and the guy asked for my name. I personally prefer being called by my name rather than a number on my receipt. The sandwich looked sorta small when I got it but it was very filling. You get a 10% coupon if you check into the restaurant, so make sure to check in into yelp."}
{"text":"We went here randomly after driving around starving bordering on being hangry. I'll lead with my favorite thing here- their teas! Like 6 different fresh brewed choices, I got peach and then the green tea. I run the other way when I see machine tea Lipton as it's a tea joke. Moving on, this is a panini lover's heaven. There are a bunch of different choices; we ordered one that had eggs, spinach, ham and sweet mustard in it. They press the sandwich into a closed circle, the bread was a good different, I can't place it but it was somewhere between a waffle and toast. The service was great and I appreciated the openness of the layout. Perfect breakfast and lunch spot. They even have mimosas which I heard were really good. We loved it here and the urban vibe of this restaurant made me feel so cool!"}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to try this place for months and was finally able to yesterday. I stopped in around 1:30 on Sunday and not a single other customer was in the place. I was greeted by a smiling man behind the counter who was friendly and gave me some helpful suggestions on what sandwiches were popular. I opted for the #10, even though that wasn't on his suggestions. It came with turkey, apples, parmesan cheese and hot mustard and I opted for the side of their kale salad over a few different kinds of potato chips.   After a short wait, my to-go order was brought out. As I took my Zookz sandwich out of the bag once home I realized it was a warm panini like sandwich that reminded me of those crustables PBnJ sandwiches you see in the freezer aisle. To my delight, the sandwich was really good. The apples gave the turkey a nice crisp sweetness and the flavor mixture was good. I really enjoyed the kale salad as well and dressing that came on it was nice and light and perfect for the salad. I would consider it a light lunch but it did fill me up for several hours.  I can't wait to go back and try all the other options! I checked their website for nutrition information but didn't see any. Anyone know if they have it? If not, I hope they do soon!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches were amazing! Got a breakfast zook and was instantly hooked. The prices are also great so that's a plus. Definitely will be returning!"}
