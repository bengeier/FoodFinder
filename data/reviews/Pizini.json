{"text":"Geez Louise!!! Took so long for our pizza! I would guess 45 minutes. My son's Carnivore pizza was really good, my mushroom shitaki had a funky taste. This is the first time I've met a mushroom I didn't love. Also even with only about a total of 5-10kids and adults eating I here it was so loud! Nothing too absorb noise. Won't dine in again."}
{"text":"I have only been here once but I will say it was good enough for me to return. I have myself just a regular pepperoni pizza and my date had a panini. We found out if you buy entrees you receive a voucher for a 5 dollar movie ticket to the theater next door. The pizza was good and  I did have a bite of the sandwich and it was pretty yummy. I will be back to try some of their other pizzas."}
{"text":"I tried there pizza for the first time while watching a movie and I thought it was a good size pizza for $8 bucks and it tasted great! I decided to try it again without the movie this time and the pizza was as good as it wasthe first time! I will definitely make this one of my favorite pizza places!"}
{"text":"On Sunday November 15th. I held my daughters baby shower.  Pizini has a perfect spot to have group events. The food was awrsome. Our server Juda was extremely nice and helpful.  I will definitely be returning to Pizini,  and I will be telling all my friends to go to Pizini as well. Thanks to the whole staff you made my daughters shower a success!"}
{"text":"Let me see if I can say this correctly, \"Stop everything your doing, forget about anything you thought you knew about true Artisan Pizza and get down Pizini Pizza and do it!\"  Best part, they not only have AWESOME 11\" pizzas for $8 but also Panini sandwiches, incredible mac&cheeze, kids meals, salads, the 4C's (Chocolate Chip Chunk Cookies) that are homemade, huge and only $1 each, ice cream, personal delivery to the attached theaters.  My goodness, what's up with that right!?  And with the Sicilian decor of a reminiscing a Sicilian village and the vibrant colors done in such an artistic way that livens the senses and gives new meaning to going for something to do. The restaurant is also attached to Fat Cats family fun center making this really a one stop for a fun night of things to do.  The sitting area is separate from the bowling lanes allowing for a quieter atmosphere as compared to other centers that offer arcade, bowling, etc.
When it comes to the pizza crust it is lite and slightly crisped to give a light chewy feel that makes you crave for more and I am not usually a crust eating kind of guy so this says a lot!
To show how fantastic the chefs (owners) are in creating a true masterpiece I recently ate at an upper scale Italian pizza restaurant where all their ingredients are imported from Italy which is why their 12\" is a whopping $20.  As I was eating at POMO (oops) I told my girlfriend we could have gone to Pizini's and had (by now I decided) the BEST pizza in Arizona.  Seriously, if you think I am over inflating this review then stop everything you are doing, forget about anything you thought you knew about true Artisan Pizza and get down there and do it!"}
{"text":"The pizza is really good, which is the only reason I rated as high as I did. The customer service is lacking. It is not kid friendly either.  They seem very upset when you bring children in. I have once gotten ran out because I brought several children in (I had my children and another families children alone). They were a little loud but not that bad. You are connected to Fat Cats, what do you expect?  Families coming in from play should be your target audience.  We hadn't even finished our meal and they came over and began cleaning our space up, even sweeping!  The broom actually was sweeping over my feet!  There was only one other family in the restaurant, so it wasn't like we were making a scene or affecting their customers."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. They even bring it to you at the movie theater. Just don't put red pepper on instead of cheese in the dark theater. The crust on their pizza is crisp and the flavor is great. I look forward to this pizza when seeing a movie."}
{"text":"Terrible organization. I think their priority is to attend food from the movie theater next by... They   serve pizza one at a time... So we waited 25 minutes for the last pizza, after they started serving the first one. Very poor organization. And the manager did not care. The pizza is ok, really saggy BTW, but I could not enjoy it since my kid kept asking why his pizza was so late. Last time I go to this place."}
{"text":"Complete disaster! STAY AWAY!!! My husband and I decided to try the Recline and Dine concept by ordering at Pizini and having it \"delivered\" to us in the theater next door.  Sounds like a cool concept and if executed properly, it could have been great. 

We arrived 15 minutes before the movie started. We walked into Pizini and stood in line for a few minutes. To set the picture, let me tell you that there were only 2 couples and a group of three in the entire restaurant. There was one couple in front of us in line. When we got to the counter to order, the kid that was taking the order was extremely frazzled and said he'd be with us in a minute. 

So we waited and he disappeared in the back. While he was gone about 7 minutes, two people came by and asked if we had been helped. I told them, No,\" but all that they did was say, \"okay,\" and walk away. Eventually the first kid did come back and took our order, which I had to repeat 3 times and it was just a pizza and salad. Clearly he was not the person to put in charge of taking orders. 


I could have overlooked all of this if the experience hadn't gone even more downhill from there. We rushed into our movie next door and were assured that our order would be delivered in a few minutes. 40 minutes later, no food. So my husband went back over to the restaurant to see what was going on. He was told by the owner that he had just reemed out his employees and that our food would be brought over in just a few minutes. 25 minutes later, no food. So, my husband went back down there again to see about the hold up. He was given the pizza and also our money back for just the pizza, but they forgot to give him the salad.

So, I ran back down there and asked for my salad. The girl wasn't sure how to make it and was moving slower than molasses, so I asked her to bring it to the theater since I kept missing integral parts if the movie we paid $9 each to see. Finally, 80 minutes after we ordered, I got my food only to find that the pizza was undercooked and the girl forgot to bring me a fork for my salad or napkins. This experience was an EPIC FAILURE in the part of this restaurant. I can overlook a lot of minor things and if only one or two of these issues occurred, it wouldn't have been a big deal. But, seriously, this was so insanely messed up that I was beginning to think that maybe we were on some kind of prank show ourselves. My advice, go for the theater, not for Pizini."}
{"text":"I am saddened to have to write this review. My son loves fat cats and we go there 2 to 4 times a month. Each time we are there we get a pizza from Pizzini. The pizza itself isn't bad, I've had better but, not bad. The problem with this restaurant is the staff. 75% of the time I either don't receive something I've ordered or what I've ordered is wrong. My most recent experience we ordered a margarita and received some sort of red drink with basil leaves in it. I ordered a pizza half margarita half pepperoni and received a margarita pizza. I ordered a side salad never received it. The best part is when you ask the staff to fix the problem it's as if they have no interest in doing so. Every other restaurant I've ever been to and mind you I've also been employed in the restaurant industry for several years, if you mess up you own your mistake and you do whatever it takes to put a smile on your customer face. I understand the restaurants can make mistakes but they make them constantly and have no remorse for it. If you're near fat cats and are hungry go to blue lemon, the food is better and the waitstaff is as well"}
{"text":"what can i say ..i really wanted to love this place since they deliver it right to your seat in the theater..but lets be honest..the pizza would be amazing if it had any flavor..AT ALL .very bland and life less....

Update:
they have changed their sauce and it tastes great now
ordered a pizza when i went to a movie this weekend out of hunger since the snack bar doesnt have hot dogs just nachos and candy
and was pleasantly surprised at the taste improvement"}
{"text":"Not impressed. 
I ordered a pizza to eat during my movie and was very disappointed. The crust was very thin and soggy. I love thin crust pizza, but this was not ment to be a thin crust. I couldn't eat it with out a fork holding the bottom of the pizza. 
I will try this place one more time and get a salad."}
