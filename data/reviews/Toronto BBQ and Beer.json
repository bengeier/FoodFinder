{"text":"We were there on a Saturday around 2pm, we expected it to be busy so we ordered, got a beer and sat down to wait, we waited about 40 minutes and the brisket was cold, no like room temperature cold but like they pulled it from the fridge 20 seconds ago... I took it back and  they told be it was going to take another 40 minutes because they have new orders coming in... Which to my experience you are supposed to take care of the errors before new orders... Food was a total fail, go here for a beer and the view but that's it..."}
{"text":"Way better than I expected. Generally restaurants on the island are terrible. 

The patio is a good place to Relax and enjoy the view. That's what this place is about. It's not the cleanest spot in the world. But it just about right for some beer and pulled pork. Kids meals were alright and I actually really liked he BBQ sauces that came with the pulled pork and coleslaw."}
{"text":"Beautiful view and delicious food. Definitely try the brisket sandwich. Great sangria."}
{"text":"You'll be greeted with amazingly great service such as no answers to questions longer than one syllable. They'll happily take your money, tell you to seat yourself with your order number and then proceed to ignore you. When you inquire about your order after being attacked by hornets outside for 30 minutes, you literally have to chase the waitress halfway into the restaurant until you're tapping on her shoulder because they will actively ignore you. Finally, after 45 min they'll come out and tell you that your order isn't available. At noon. When you order a substitute, they will place you at the end of the order queue--despite waiting 45 minutes and not being told anything until you inconvenience them by asking a question that takes more than a one syllable answer. Finally, when you ask for a refund, they sneakily only refund you part of your order and try to keep the tip! Unbelievable.

Worst service I've experienced in the past year."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing view. Friendly staff, with some amazing BBQ ! The prices were good and everyone loves the food, came with friends and family multiple times! The view of the CN tower from the patio was breath taking. If you want great food and an amazing view on the island this is a great place I'd recommend!"}
{"text":"Way better then expected. Don't know why this place is not packed. Try the BBQ nachos! Kind of place you can relax and spend the whole afternoon, soaking up the sun, drinking beer, and having a great time"}
{"text":"Order at the counter, take a number and wait for your meal type of place. No table service. If you want drinks you have to go to the bar on the patio to order. Kind of an odd setup. Went here on a Saturday afternoon and there weren't many guests. There's plentiful seating inside and on the patio. Good view of the Toronto skyline from outside. Lots of webs on the patio furniture. Average service from staff
Ordered only the BBQ pulled pork Poutine. The portion was big but it wasn't really pulled pork, lots of large chunks of pork. Was kind of plain for this type of Poutine. The BBQ sauce was really generic tasting like from a grocery store and there wasn't enough of it on my Poutine."}
{"text":"It's honestly shocking how bad this place is. It starts with you ordering your food before you can even sit down. Then the marketed brewery only serves coors, Canadian and Heineken. Also on Canada day their bar closed at 8:30. It's currently dark and they are using flash lights to wash tables. Very confused."}
