{"text":"Meh; service was ok, food was ok, not hot though. Fotlr $500+ including tip for 4 it should have been great. It did not hit the mark. It was unfortunate because it sounded like it had great potential
 Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Tried this place with some girlfriends on a Friday evening.  I ordered the beet salad and mushroom / pine ravioli.  It was delicious.  Great atmosphere other than the periodic revving of motorcycle engins from 17ave.  Why do they do that?   Better yet, why doesn't the city do anything about it?  But I digress.

The food was great, the opera cake was just fine.  I would have liked more of a coffee flavour but otherwise was a nice end to our meal.

Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite brunch place and I am telling anyone and everyone who will listen! This exquisitely decorated and bright space is exceptionally inviting and oozes class without being pretentious. The large vaulted skylights give a certain 'je ne sais quoi' to the space and makes one feel good about the world. The servers are attentive and professional, and I appreciate the use of proper cloth napkins, good solid cutlery, quality glasses and dishes, and an elegant menu display.

I found the food to be reasonably priced for the quality and portion size, as well as keeping in mind the atmosphere of Royale. Two of us had the smoked salmon eggs Benedict; it came with 2 eggs, a generous amount of smoked salmon, fresh crusty bread as the base, a lovely mild hollandaise sauce and capers, sides were house made pan fries and salad. For $16, I though that was a pretty good deal, in fact nothing on the brunch menu was over $16. The latte I had was also delicious!

All in all, I was very impressed! For roughly $20-$25 per person for brunch and a coffee, including tax and tip, I am happy to pay that given this is a higher class restaurant that has done it right! Can't say that about many \"high class wanna-be\" places in this city. 

I will be back and I highly recommend you spend some time in this beautiful space; enjoy the ambiance while catching up with friends or family, or just sit and soak it all up  while savoring a lovely cup of coffee waiting for your meal."}
{"text":"From Seattle just moved here and I will for sure be back soon! From the time we arrived the service from our hostess Miko was awesome. It was the first time I've tried escargot and it is forever a favorite of mine! Our waitress Shannon was super helpful and genuine! Beautiful restaurant beautiful food! 10/10"}
{"text":"Had a dinner night with a girlfriend at Royale and everything was great! The service was good and we went with several recommendations from our server. Atmosphere and decor were quite nice. Good cocktails. Solid food: We shared the mushroom poutine, the sea bass, the scallop & pork belly and the apple tart. All dishes were delicious and were very happy with our meal. The prices and portions were reasonable. Excited to return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"2017/08/12: I can't even! The service here tonight was terrible! The bartender stopped serving us and went flirting with a girl instead. Not sure I'll be coming back. 
-----
I was expecting the same quality as Teatro but Royale falls a bit behind. The food is good but it did not blow my mind. Not everything is made in house. Some plates, like the burger, are just average and more suited to a pub place. Prices are not pub-like. 

PS. The crowd is really mixed (the sweat pants and rubber sandals kind - on a Saturday night)"}
{"text":"Went with a girlfriend who loves brunch as much as I do. Shared a couple of things and enjoyed a couple Kir Royals at the same time.

The Croque demands to be a Madame, so add the egg. This delicious dish is amazing as it, but that egg on top takes it to another level. This is the best Croque Madame I have ever had and it is one of my favorite breakfast dishes. Beats Benni's everyday.

The Quiche Du Jour changes every day. Was a generous portion with a lovely artisan green salad on the side. Not sure what is in the salad dressing but those greens were gone before I even touched the quiche. Light pasty and still just a touch of moisture in the quiche. This is a dish that is either exceptional or juts ok - Royal is getting it right. Ours had salmon in when we went.

As their brunch menu also has the lunch menu, we couldn't help ourselves and had to try the Moules Frites. The cream, white wine butter sauce their mussels come in is outstanding. We definitely got more bread to soak up every drop. 

Saying all that - $24 for the portion of mussels we received was way more than I would have wanted to spend. We had even looked at other options on the lunch menu to try and were just blown away by the prices. Value for money here is definitely around the brunch menu if you go for the higher end items.

Would I go back for brunch? Absolutely. Would I go for any other meal? Not unless someone else is paying, far too expensive."}
{"text":"I went for dinner at Royale the other night and my food was absolutely fantastic. We ordered a bit of everything from the starters and mains. The steamed Mussels & Frites, Beetroot & Grilled Pears, Royale Poutine. 
The Mediterranean Sea Bass, Stampede Burger with an egg. 
For dessert we did the French Lemon Tart, and Carrot Cake Royale. 
What can I say it was amazing one course after another. 

Our server was very knowledgeable and friend. 

I love the interior at Royale, it was very comfortable. 

Our experience was a five thumbs up  

I would highly recommend this place just for a quick bite anytime of the week."}
{"text":"Very average food considering the price tag (~$35 a plate), very slow service - took almost an hour to get a meal for one prepared on a Sunday night in a half empty restaurant. The waiter was nice, when he was around, which he wasn't very often. There are really no redeeming qualities to this place, forgettable and overpriced. Can't see them being in business for very long."}
{"text":"Generally I quite like Royale. Great food, pretty attentive service and a good cocktail menu. In the summer a nice patio. 

However, this evening's service was well below expectations. We had three drinks in total, and the first round took about 15 minutes to receive (it was a beer and a glass of wine).  The second was a cocktail that took another 15 minutes. When we asked for the bill, that was another 15 minutes to which the server said she didn't grab a machine and suggested we pay at the bar. 

My friend paid first and in between, the bartender (long hair and beard) who was programming the machine left to go and talk to the three women sitting at the bar. I stood their for about two minutes, waiting for him to come back and program the credit card machine for me to pay my portion. 

All in all, a very bad night for a restaurant I like to rely on for good food, drinks and service."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and attentive staff. I had the salmon tartar, sea bass, and the lemon tart with raspberry sorbet. I recommend them all. The dining area is well arranged and the skylight is a fantastic touch. The place is a must in Calgary and I will be back on my next visit."}
{"text":"Visited here for brunch, I loved the atmosphere when it was Corbeaux and they have kept many of the same elements but have changed the seating up a bit. The bunch menu looks good, I want to try the salted caramel pancakes next time but for now stuck with the classic le bacon and eggs, a good classic breakfast although a slightly higher price point than you would find at other places which is to be expected at Royale. The sour dough toast was excellent and I really enjoyed the marmalade that was served with it. The latte I ordered was also really good so no complaints on the food side."}
{"text":"Royal treatment -- French peasants unite! Closest restaurant to Balthazar's in New York you'll ever get. Have the mussels and any drink the maître de recommends -- this guy knows his food and drink. The patio is impressante! So is the steak and Pinot. Don't leave the premises without ordering the crime brûlée -- I repeat, the creme brûlée will change your life. Bonne chance mon ami!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday, but didn't know they had a Sunday set menu option. We had a groupon so decided to skip the set menu and ordered a la cart instead. We ordered a couple cocktails, mussel & frites, pork belly & scallops, and the market fish which was sea bass. The cocktails were good and the mussels were great; however our entrees were average at best. While the scallops were good, the pork belly skin was rock hard and inedible, couldn't even cut it with a steak knife. The sea bass for the price was nothing special. If not for the groupon we had, this was a very overpriced dinner. If we do come back, it'll only be for appetizers."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday night.  Free corkage = excellent!  Friendly staff.

However, they fall VERY flat on food service.  3 out of four entrees arrived stone cold and had to be sent back.  Desserts took half an hour to arrive after they were ordered.  After dinner cappuccino was finished loooong before they arrived.  Food on a whole was good, but not spectacular.  

At this price point, you expect more.

I will not be back."}
{"text":"This French bistro is truly a gem in Calgary. With a charming and elegant French ambiance, this is an ideal venue for celebrations with friends and family or a romantic dinner. We tried a ridiculously awesome steak tartare with a fresh egg yolk that will make any tartare lover rejoice. We also enjoyed a lovely charcuterie platter with an amazing terrine and foie gras combo. Royale also offers a careful selection of wines which pairs so nicely with each dish. To top it off, the service was superb. It's a bit on the pricey side but, well worth the indulgence."}
{"text":"We came with a group for dinner and found the service extremely slow and, not surprisingly, the prices quite high for what we got (side of fries was expensive, the baked brie was burned, the burger was just ok, nothing special).  Our server would disappear for long periods of time and even when we tried to get his attention he would go and serve other tables.  

He had a lot of trouble splitting our bill, after the 3rd wrong attempt, we had one person pay so that we would figure out the split ourselves.  He then told us, it was our fault for moving seats.  I understand it's confusing but we did go through how we wanted it split.  

After the poor service we were told we had to pay a mandatory (not true) charge of 18% or 20%, I don't remember the exact amount as we were so shocked to have to pay such a bit tip for poor service and mostly average food."}
{"text":"I went tonight to meet a friend for an after work drink, we both thought each staff member we interacted with were very friendly, kind and genuine. When you are a woman of an older vintage staff can often be dismissive. Here at Royal we were made to feel special.   The food was great and the wine list while small was carefully selected to be rewarding.  I will come back for sure! Thank you to the staff at Royal"}
{"text":"A friend and I dined at this nice restaurant on a Monday night. It was so good and very busy! The decor was amazing, the food was amazing and our server was amazing. Can't wait to go back with my hubby! Thanks Royale for a great experience!"}
{"text":"After a Saturday morning workout, I had my mind super set on where I wanted to brunch at 10am but when I arrived and it didn't open until 11am, I was food baby broken. My gf Hailey and I were already on 17th avenue so we decided to look around for other brunch places that opened at 10am - I found that there was a mix of places that opened at 10am and 11am. We browsed a couple menus before we got to Royale. Although the menu says they open at 11am for brunch, there was a sign out front that posted a 10am opening time. We decided to give it a try.

We were the first two guests to arrive for brunch and we decided to sit out on their lovely patio. Still or sparkling water was offered and we were handed menus. They have a small brunch menu: classic bacon and eggs, benedict, omelette, croque madame, quiche and pancakes. Hailey and I were eyeballing the salted caramel pancakes but decided to be semi-good ;) I went with Le bacon & eggs ($14) which came with two poached eggs, two pieces of bacon, herbed potatoes, and a piece sourdough toast with some house made pineapple ginger jam. Hailey went with the Croque Madame ($17) which is a sandwich with ham, béchamel sauce, gruyere cheese and a sunny side egg on top with a side salad.

Being the only ones, food didn't take long. There was maybe a third cup or less of potatoes that were a little too greasy for me, not seasoned well and not crispy. Poached eggs were to my liking and the bacon, was bacon. The sourdough toast was okay; it has some burnt edges but the house made jam made up for that. Hailey liked her Croque Madame but wasn't WOW'd especially when it was recommended by our waitress but really enjoyed the salad it came with.

Overall, the brunch wasn't anything special here, can get the same classic bacon and eggs elsewhere for sure. We had a great view of 17th on the patio and the waitresses were really nice but I didn't love my meal, maybe it was too 'healthy' for me, or maybe I was just hangry?....we will never know. Though, Hailey said she would return because it was a nice light breakfast and didn't feel gouged on the price."}
{"text":"Decided to enjoy the afternoon last Friday and walk 17th Ave. Our plan was to check out some of the new restaurants for a late afternoon glass of wine and charcuterie plate. Royale was on or path so we stopped in and checked the menu. 

Royale is one of the newest restaurants on 17th and part of the Teatro Group. The first thing you notice is the open and very expansive space. One of the most enticing decors seen in some time. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess who made us feel welcome. Lots of menu checkers! During our menu check we we told select wines were $5 per glass and they were all French wines. Our dietary requirements can be a challenge and the one improvement I noted is the need for the Manager to accommodate, unfortunately he was resistant. I didn't want to it a salad, was hoping we could sun some veggies for the bread. 

Decided to give them a try ($5 glasses of wine was the hook) and we weren't disappointed. Sat at the bar to enjoy a fantastic charcuterie plate and great service by the bartender. If you go ask for Fadi, he was great. Enjoyed a couple of hours of great conversation with him. 

There is an opportunity for them to be more accommodating and since they are new the Manager could have stopped by to check in. Other than that very minor thing this place is going to put a stamp on 17th."}
{"text":"This was a horrible disappointment. Our server seemed fine initially, friendly, giving us the specials, coming to refill water often. However, she went way too long without coming by after that. We were ready to order for about a half hour before she finally returned. Drinks were slow. Food was slow. My food was okay but a bit cold by the time it came out, small portion, and over-priced. Coffee was delicious.
Now, after we ate, our plates were cleared quickly and a dessert menu was brought. But then 45 minutes went by without our server coming by. We wanted to order cocktails but it wasn't possible at that point. There was only one other table at that point, and the server was just chatting with other staff at the bar. Okay? Apparently if it's a big party and an automatic 20% tip you don't need to try at all. I would avoid this place at all costs given that it's a new restaurant on 17th avenue it is unlikely to stick around with poor quality service and overly priced food. Maybe they manage better with smaller parties, but it seemed to be just plain old lazy."}
{"text":"AMAZING! The food was plated very nice but more importantly it tasted delicious! The drinks were also super tasty. We passed on dessert as we were so full! We are already planning our next visit to Royale as this restaurant is one of a kind...a gem right in the heart of the city."}
{"text":"This restaurant is gorgeous the service is excellent and the food is amazing. I have the beef tartar and the mussels au gratin every time I come. The tartar is the best I have ever had. A big portion of tender beef with cornichons and onion, served with a raw egg yolk and Dijon mustard, and - the best part - skinny extra crispy waffle cut chips. Those are the perfect vehicle to deliver the tastiness to your mouth. The mussels are super tender and the herb, breadcrumb, garlic gratin sauce they are baked in is to die for. This a great spot for a special occasion or romantic date."}
