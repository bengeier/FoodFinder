{"text":"I ordered a chicken kabob pizza expecting chunks of chicken on the pizza, but it was more like a veggie pizza with a few measly slivers of chicken. The quality just isn't there and I was expecting a lot more for the price."}
{"text":"Pros
The food taste good but nothing spectacular. I had the fried chicken wings and pizza. I like the fried chicken, they are crispy and are spiced well. 

Cons
The pizza is too small and not worth the price. A large pizza is like the size of a medium compared to other pizza stores.
The fried chicken wings are nothing special and do not have the thick batter like KFC or Popeyes. These are wings that can be easily made at home. But if you don't want to cook this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"I often come here to grab pizza and wings on days I cannot cook.  I love the fast and good service.  I also like to go and support local businesses.  I normally order the pepperoni or cheese pizza. Always made fresh. And chicken wings.  Also excellent.  The Kashmiri chai is amazing especially on a cold day. I recommend"}
{"text":"First thing one notices is the wide variety of options in the menu and unique topping options for Pizza. A decent place and i believe the place attracts regulars. 

Went in for Breakfast - Puri Halwa which was decent but could have been more expressive in terms of taste .

Can give the place another try as the owner is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza with quality and taste.  This is my favorite pizza store considering I've tried all the commercial name brand that don't live up to their company mottos.  Only issue with this place is their customer service is really bad."}
{"text":"I got a flyer for this place recently and being a foodie my mouth was watering at the sight of it. The prices seemed a bit high relative to other pizza places but I decided to give it a try.

I've got to say, I will never be returning to this establishment. I ordered a large pizzaand some fried chicken. First of all, the \"large\" was quite small. It honestly looked like one of those frozen pizzas, worst of all it was under cooked. 

The fried chicken.... Don't even bother, I could seriously make better chicken at home. The skin wasn't crispy, the chicken was dry. Overall it was a disgusting experience, i usually like to support small businesses but there is no way I would recommend this place to anyone."}
