{"text":"We recently had a luncheon in the lower level, following my mom's funeral. We showed up an hour early and they were extremely accommodating. The warm fireplace was a cozy welcome on a cold January day. The food was wonderful and the service was outstanding! My parents had been regular customers there for years. I also had my baby shower there 30 years ago. A great, friendly place for any occasion. Thank you Rockwell's!!"}
{"text":"We were in town for a high school playoff game,  and saw this place on yelp. It exceeded all expectations! Small dining area with bar, but homey.  Great beer,  wine and cocktail menu.  The pepper jack crab soup is amazing!! I got the blackened tuna with blue cheese risotto.  The flavors were perfect together.  My husband's Caesar salad was very good too.  We live too far away to be regulars,  but I would highly recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"My family needed a place to eat to eat during a 4-6pm break from a funeral home showing at nearby Bekavacs.  I called the day before, and Lynn handled us very promptly, professionally.  While they already had a group in their banquet room, they set aside a separate raised area in the back which fit our 20+ sized group perfectly.  They menu wa varied enough to suit all food types such as vegan gluten freee, Eric in our group.  The staff was excellent, gracious, prompt.  Our entire group was very pleased with the arrangements, menu, food quality and setting.  We sat in a quiet area where we could all be together during our sad time and everyone commented how perfectly it worked for us.  Thank you Lynn and staff."}
{"text":"Nice find on our way home from Triple B Farm.  Stop in for lunch and enjoyed one of the specials, a wedge but salad with grilled chicken and homemade blue cheese dressing. The hubs had the loaded pierogis.  Most likely Mrs. Ts topped with cheese, onions, and bacon. Kids shared the cheeseburger which was the perfect size to share with fries and apple sauce. Warm fresh bread also. Waitresses were very friendly. If we are ever in the area again we would definitely stop back."}
{"text":"I ensure I go to this restaurant every time I'm home on leave.  I have tried something different every time I have been here and have not once been less than happy.  The chef has cooked every meal I've had here perfect, and the service is always great.  Keep up the great work and see you in a few months."}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday with high school girlfriends..very nice decor, other than plastic table covers (tacky...really)! Food was good, but a bit expensive for lunch. Our server was very good, knowledgeable about the menu and very accommodating for any of our special needs. We all will probably give it a return visit, parking is a bit tricky, however! Street and public metered lot, that is supposed to take care of all the parking needs for all of Elizabeth."}
{"text":"We booked our rehearsal dinner here for our son's wedding, we are from Wisconsin and were not familiar with Pittsburgh dining options for such an event.  We relied upon our son's recommendation for the restaurant which he had been to several times with his fiancée who is from the Pittsburgh area.  We tried lunch there in the summer and it was very nice, good portions, tasty, nice atmosphere, etc.  We booked a private rehearsal dinner in the cellar dining area for our party of 26.  We had appetizers and drinks before our meal, each person was given a choice of three entrees, dinner included salad, bread, iced tea or coffee, and they included pumpkin ice cream for dessert.  It was absolutely fabulous, all dinners were delicious and all our guests commented how good it was and what a nice atmosphere with the stone walls, cozy fire burning in the fireplace on a November evening, and the friendly service by Brandy and support staff!  Everything was set up just as we had requested it, we could not have been more pleased.  We will fondly remember this lovely evening!"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch and the place is interesting to look at inside and the food was great. I had the French onion soup and salad. My dinner date had the pasta...which was a huge portion for a small price. Real table linens. The lunch prices are very reasonable and the dinner prices were more, but still a good deal."}
{"text":"Always enjoy my meal there, lunch or dinner. Food is consistently good, nice creative touches to the menu at times. Staff and service are always also very even, nice people.  Just wish they could ditch the plastic tablecloths... Now that they have been there a number of years they are getting sticky.... And the plastic is a bit tacky for the level of restaurant this one tries to be . Don't let that turn you off, though, the food is good."}
{"text":"Old, worn decor. Took 30 min to serve a burnt hamburger because \"they make their own\". Fries greasy. One * for the mango smoothie."}
{"text":"I have been back to the Red Lion 5 times since I wrote my last review, once for a girls' night out with friends, 3 times with my husband and once with hubby & 2 other couples.  I found the food to be just as good as the first time.  I did have one entree that I wasn't fond of, but that was my own fault for ordering something with capers when I knew I really disliked them!  As I said before, the chef is very accommodating.  One of my friends didn't care for the sauce as it was described on a particular entree and asked if she could have a different sauce.  No problem!  Our server said the chef loves to change things up to make a guest happy.  If you like fritters (my mom used to make them - loved them), they have shrimp fritters on the appetizer menu that are wonderful!!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant located in downtown Elizabeth, PA. They serve very high quality food and have a lobster bisque that is out of this world! I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to have a nice night out, or celebrating a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Super cute spot to eat in town. First tome ive been here and i will forsure be going back only downfall was our Server was a little lost. Didnt seem all there but other than that we loved it"}
{"text":"A solid option in a place where there aren't many.   Now that I live in Raleigh, my hometown always seems so sleepy and quiet when I visit.   Gone are the plethora of options within a stone's throw.  Instead, there are smaller places with weird hours and less than exciting menus.  Rockwell's is the exception.  I deducted a star for ambiance, which is a little old-fashioned for my taste.  The food was really good though.   Well worth the trip there.  I tried a sample of the pierogies, potato pancake, shrimp fritters, zucchini fries, chicken piccata, pasta marinara, filet mignon, mahi-mahi, jalapeño grits, and the devonshire.  The only thing I didn't like was the devonshire - it just wasn't the traditional version that I remember from my childhood.   Everything else was excellent.   Service was great both nights - they stayed on top of our demanding crowd and were very friendly.   Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"was here for a retirement party, not from the immediate area. Wonder atmosphere. Beautifully decorated for Christmas! Loved the food. Worth a drive back!"}
{"text":"We called and made reservations and upon our ontime a rival our table was waiting for us with ice water and there yummy bread.   I liked the Renaissance/ Victorian decor. With just a few small tweaks it could have an even better feel. Like removing some of the animal antlers and adding iron pieces that match the neat chandeliers. And adding cushioning to the booths.   Our waitress was the best, and couldn't have been better.. I wish I could remember her name.  The food was really good. From the soup to the dessert. It was hot, cooked perfect and came out in a reasonable time considering how busy the were.  The biggest  downfall was that particular night they were haveing some kind of band playing in the street and the constant in and out of people (we were seated by the door) was so annoying, especially if you are paying over  $20 a plate.    Lastly, I felt some of the dinners were overpriced, especially if the there is no difference in size or quality from the fish, beef ect... used in the lunch menu items. We will be back.   Also and hopefully the restaurant sees this... installation of a new flooring like tile or wood and some cleaning and sprucing up, like removal of the shirts for sale hanging in the dining room and putting them in a glass case ..  and removal of the clutter around the hostesses area would really raise the bar."}
{"text":"I never have eaten at such an awful place in my life!!!! First the waitress was slow and made mistakes with our order. Told us they only iced tea they \"had left\" was sweetened tea which we were fine with but when it came us was bitter tasting unsweetened tea. So sad service of our food was slow is a major understatement!!' The only people in the entire restaurant was myself, daughter and husband and a party of 6 at the other table. We waited well over a half hour for our food. The crab meat Mac and cheese had no crabmeat in it...tastes like lain Mac and cheese although good we paid for \"crabmeat\" in it. It came to us barely warm. Ordered a cup of French onion soup and received a bowl in which we were charged for. It was no way near hot enough but tasted ok. Had better but it was good. Then our dinners came out after the long wait. My daughter and husband both got the fish sandwich. My daughter refused to eat it since the fish tasted freezer burnt and the bun hard. It was a half sandwich and was tiny with one piece of awful fish. My husbands was the full sandwich and the fish on it was dry and tasted freezer burnt. The loaded fries were cold as was the fish sandwichs. I got the French dip. It was barely warm, no cheese or green peppers whatsoever on it and just a few pathetic onions. This is what we waited over a half hour for??? The au jus was flavorless. The only good thing I had was the huge onion rings. They were good even though they weren't very hot.  Oh and also they were out of Rueben sandwhichs which was what my daughter wanted. Never ever again!!!!  Waste of over $50......"}
{"text":"I came for a baby shower that was held in the downstairs area. This place is old and dingy inside. Almost like going to grandmas house where everything is from over decades ago and grandma forgot to dust. There was a cute fire place. However at some points I felt as thought the smoke was filling the room and my eyes were burning.   The food was ok. Not really seasoned well. The menu consisted of a pasta salad, green beans, roasted potatoes, stuffed shells and chicken parmigiana. The chicken parm was soggy."}
{"text":"It's been about a month since my latest visit here since I don't live anywhere near Rockwell's but this place has never disappointed me,   Every time I've ate at Rockwell's I've gotten the Jumbo Lump Crab Meat appetizer ($11.95) and I will continue to do so every time I come here.  It comes with garlic butter toast points topped with a bountiful amount of jumbo lump crab meat. I live down near Washington DC and I've been eating Maryland  blue crabs my entire life, and while I'm not as snobbish about my crab as some are, Rockwell's has great crab for a place 300 miles from saltwater. I definitely recommend it.  The Creamy Pepperjack Crab Soup is ridiculous, even if you don't get anything else on the menu, you really shouldn't miss out on this, it's creamy and crabby with a bit of a kick. They also sell their soups by the pint to-go. ;)  On my most recent visit for my main course I ordered the Duck Black Forest ($24.95) which is half of a semi boneless duck served crisp, glazed with a raspberry and black cherry sauce. There are full cherries in it, and it's sort of like a pie filling on an entree, though I am not complaining at all because it's soo delicious. I may however be a bit partial because I was craving a cherry pie my entire visit in PA so this satisfied that.  Meanwhile everyone else at my table ordered the Veal Rhode Island ($25.95) which should been indicative of how delicious it is. I managed to steal a few bites off someones plate and I was not disappointed. I don't think there's anyway you can go wrong with the combination of veal, crab, and garlic herb butter.  I've tried their crab meat risotto ($7.95) and its honestly such a fantastic side dish very creamy and delightfully crabby, not to mention a generous portion.  TL;DR: Rockwell's is really great, a bit more pricey than other places in the area, but I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for a special night out or a damn good meal."}
{"text":"This is a nice little restaurant in Elizabeth PA. Has a good selection of lunches and dinners, usually well prepared. I really like the pistachio encrusted salmon salad and the pepper jack cheese crab soup.  The sandwiches and lunch meals are very reasonably priced. The entrees are a little steep, but generally very good. Definitely best place right in Elizabeth. And an easy hop off of rt 51."}
{"text":"After being turned down at Francesco's restaurant twice (which I will never go to again), we decided to try Rockwell's Red Lion.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  The waitress was very pleasant.  The bread is outstanding.  We ordered and the meals were brought in a timely fashion and delicious.  They appreciated our business.  I will come here again."}
{"text":"Great French dip. Ordered it on every visit. I have been there three times, bc it is the only game in town. Lunch menu is available at night for some lighter fare. Great place for entertaining family while visiting."}
{"text":"Nice place in a converted bank building. Wide selection of food at decent prices such as Beef Stroganoff Crepes, Apricot Chicken, or Duck Breast. They have an interesting pepperjack crab soup the service is very nice.  All-in-all a nice place to get a good meal for under $20."}
{"text":"My company had a retirement luncheon for one of our employees here. They worked with us very well and the food was ready as soon as everyone sat down. I tried their steak sandwich which is a real flat iron steak to my surprise. I also got the pepper jack crab soup which is to die for. If there is one thing you need to try here it is that soup!! I will definitely come back here soon"}
{"text":"Stopped in today around 3:00 for a late lunch. The restaurant was dingy inside. The ceiling was falling apart in places and the carpet was old and stained. There was a moldy odor when you walked in. We did have a great waitress. She was kind and attentive. Too bad the food was awful! All four of us ordered salads (two steak, Two chicken). Nothing special. The lettuce tasted unwashed.  After reading all of the good reviews, I had high expectations for this restaurant. Drove over an hour to give it a shot and was thoroughly disappointed. Took my mother in law and grandmother in law and I was embarrassed I had even recommended it."}
