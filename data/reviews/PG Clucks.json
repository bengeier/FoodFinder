{"text":"Yesterday, a friend took me to PG Clucks on College in the middle of Little Italy and came to this little hole in the wall next to the Royal Theatre. It wasn't much to look at and could do with some new decor. It wasn't hard to notice that their was no inside eating area or tables just a little counter. I order the spicy classic and my friend a mild classic. We walked for about 30 minutes to my friends house with both sandwiches in tote. When we arrived I was thinking that these sandwiches would probably be cold and soggy. Mine was still warm to the touch and still intacted and not soggy. I bit into this sandwich and I was really impressed with the flavour and texture of the chicken and bun. The spices were just right and not to over powering. This is the best chicken sandwich that I have eaten and have found my new sandwich place and can't wait to try the honey and jalapeño and some of the sides."}
{"text":"I don't think anybody here saying this is the best fried chicken sandwich they've ever had has tried Porchetta and Co's chicken sandwich which is easily better than PG's. Prices at PG are great but next time if I'm craving a chicken sandwich I'm hittin' up Porchetta. I got the Big Cluck sammy with deep fried pickles and a side of coleslaw. I am aware this isn't a Michelin star restaurant but even then, your food has to taste good...the coleslaw was one of the most bland slaws I've ever had, they might've put a thimble-full of dressing in it which wouldn't have made a difference if they added more. Not sure whats up with Marc F.'s comment about it being \"creamy and delicious\" because it was neither of those.  The breading for the deep fried pickles was good but the pickles weren't soft enough, nbd though. The chicken was great, Nashville hot breading is very tasty, however the sammy gets super messy super fast. Normally I don't mind but the bun they use is way too soft and small for a piece of chicken that big. Porchetta and Co. uses basically a kaiser bun which holds everything together (I swear I don't work there).  If I wanted to get super picky, only complaint I have on the chicken itself is it actually could've been left in the fryer for another minute. The cheese slice is a solid addition to the big cluck, tastes like a Big Mac and who doesn't love a Big Mac. They use sweet pickles for the sandwich which I'm not really a fan of but it didn't ruin the whole sammy. Next time I might just get chicken on its own and try a macaroni or potato salad. Its still a good fried chicken sandwich, but don't believe the hype that its the best in the city..."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy classic with extra chicken. The extra chicken is a perfect snack for two people and might be too heavy for one person. I would come back again but do the regular flavor since the spicy flavor is a little too spicy for me. But i would still recommend the spicy for others since it has a nice kick!  Prices are extremely reasonable, i mean $7 and only $3 for extra chicken - not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Moist and tender, crispy chicken in a bun! Melts in your mouth...need I say more!? Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken sandwiches never tasted so good!! It's always fresh and crispy. Every bite is heaven!... But why do you guys charge $2 extra for every item on foodora when it's PICK UP!!!? That's ridiculous, I'm picking up so what difference does it make how I order. Keep making the great chicken though, I'll just order in person and wait in line next time."}
{"text":"Easily the best fried chicken sandwich in Toronto. Go here. It's delicious. The chicken is unbelievably moist. Try the Big Cluck if you're hungry. The classic is really good too."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are going to kill me. I don't want to eat anything else since I've tried them. I introduced some friends to them, and they have a similar problem. If you like fried chicken, I bet you'll agree this is the best sandwich in Toronto."}
{"text":"If you've read some of my reviews, you'll know that I really like fried chicken (Dirty Bird, White Brick Kitchen, Cluck Clucks), and I have had my eye on PG Clucks.  Somehow I thought they offered only sandwiches, so held off my visit as I'm not too keen on a messy sandwich.  Well, I looked more closely at the photos from other Yelpers, and realized that you can order chicken by the piece.  We ordered an 8 piece order (which came with 3 sides).  Additionally, I had to try a chicken finger.  Everything is made fresh when you order so there is a bit of a wait.  When we arrived around 6pm, there were maybe 3-4 people ahead of us, but they were waiting for sandwiches, and they got their orders fairly quickly.  Our wait was around 15 minutes.  We ordered medium spicy, and asked for the nashville hot sauce on the side, to keep the chicken crispy as we took it home to enjoy.  After a short ten minute drive home, the chicken was at a perfect temperature for enjoying!  What a treat that the pieces are all boneless!  The chicken finger at $3 would make a perfect little snack!  Really enjoyed the fried chicken from here!"}
{"text":"Tried spicy classic sandwich. the sandwich was filling but still somehow light (or may be i was hungry), juicy and finger licking good."}
{"text":"i find it expensive for a takeout place (0 seating). i like the chicken is boneless but it is just way too oily."}
{"text":"Mind bendingly good! If you have an appetite order ore than you think you need as the portions are a little small but every sauce is awesome as well. Nashville hot is also recommended for those who can handle it."}
{"text":"Wow... ordered the original spicy chicken sandwich. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Anything from the pickle, sauce, the coleslaw down to the juicy and tender but crispy chicken thigh. The burger was $7 and HUGE. Customer service was great. We had to wait 6 min for the next fresh burger and it was well worth it!! You must try it."}
{"text":"I didn't get a sandwich. I got 2 pieces of fried chicken and a side of coleslaw. The fried chicken was ok, a bit greasy. Yes I know it's fried chicken, but yet somehow Kanpai does a perfectly fried chicken that isn't greasy, yet delectable so it's an achievable goal. The coleslaw was very disappointing, had no flavour. Just ok. Nothing special to write home about it."}
{"text":"Way too good. To bad there is no place to really sit. Well...that's more of a my problem than a their problem I guess. The chicken sandwiches are all really well-designed and made with delicious ingredients.   The best fried chuckwich I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Delicious and fantastic. Their award for best chicken sandwich in the city from a local publication was well deserved and earned! I go entirely too often for my waistline but I can't help myself, it's so good. Try this place out!!!   My go to: Spicy Fried Chicken Sandwich. I have tried the other sandwiches and they're good too but after trying the other options once, I know that the Spicy Fried Chicken is the thing that satiates my need.   Because the place only uses fresh food sometimes they run out of buns before closing so I will happily go for the massive straight up spicy fried chicken pieces.   Also, they have great, freshly made deep fried pickles. Try those too! This is especially awesome because they prep the pickles for frying on site. I doubt they actually do the pickling but they almost certainly are doing the cutting and battering in the restaurant as opposed to other places which just use frozen, out of a bag pre-battered pickles.   IMPORTANT: They have no seating. The entire place has very little room for patrons so usually after ordering, people wait outside on the sidewalk. If it isn't a nice day out to go sit in a park or on a bench somewhere and you don't live nearby/have a car to sit in while you eat, you're gonna wanna figure that stuff out before you have a glorious chicken sandwich and an empty stomach but nowhere to put the 2 together."}
{"text":"Just ordered some chicken and sandwiches through Foodora. The fried chicken is SO FLAVORFUL!!! still crispy when we received it. Sides were on the small side but still tasty. Will be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"SO HAPPY to have discovered this little gem! Quick, friendly service. Fantastic chicken. Fairly priced. Many sandwich varieties to choose from. Take-out only. Highly recommended, no doubt!  Came here as part of a food passport program. Bought their regularly priced $7 grilled chicken + jalapeno sandwich for only $5.   Pleasantly surprised! The chicken was freshly breaded and fried right there. Very well seasoned, moist, flavourful, and drool-worthy! The jalapenos added a kick of spiciness to their amazing honey sauce. Wow! Loved their flavour combinations!  Only wish we could've added more sides/ toppings...and more honey sauce please!  In sum, for a place that specializes in fried chicken sandwiches, this place is now my go-to fried chicken place! Seriously can't wait to come back! The owner is also really nice and actually takes the time to speak with you if you start a conversation. :)"}
{"text":"Forget union chicken, this is my new favourite chicken burger place. I had the spicy version of the classic and it's actually very simple - brioche buns, pickles, huge chunk of fried dark meat dipped in some sort of oily spicy sauce, coleslaw, and some more spicy looking sauce,  but it's oh so good. I also love how it's basically half the price of the same thing from union chicken, but with even bigger portions."}
{"text":"Hands down the best boneless fried chicken in town. The fact that they also put it in a sandwich makes it the best boneless fried chicken sandwich place ever but I digress because I stumbled upon this place while hangry for fried chicken. There wasn't a place to me and my miss to sit but the fella inside was kind enough to offer several places we could go. I got the big cluck sandwich ($10) and an extra piece of chicken ($3), which was apparently unnecessary since my sandwich already came with two pieces. She got the jalapeno & honey sandwich ($8). The sandwiches was delicious and chicken was HUGE, crispy, and juicy. Her jalapeno & honey was a nice mix of spicy and sweet, it was mouth watering. We scarfed it down in our car in 5 minutes.  N/A out of 5 for washrooms."}
{"text":"PG Clucks is a fried chicken sandwich takeout spot in Little Italy. They do not have any seats for dine-in. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich ($7) and made it a combo (+$3) which included a side and a drink.  One of the best fried chicken sandwiches I've had in Toronto. Incredibly juicy and the sauce was fantastic. They would receive 5 stars, but I wished they offered fries as a side order. They only have coleslaw, pasta salad and potato salad and portion size is very, very small."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't review here yet.   Best chicken sandwich in Toronto.  Muncheez has great chicken sandwiches too but this is a FRIED chicken sandwich, OK?  The chicken is very tender, super flavourful and extremely crispy on the outside.  Like a piece of fried heaven protected in a crusty batter.  The spicy version is unbelievable but even the regular is incredible.  Among the best (or possibly THE BEST) fried chicken in the city.  I'd eat it before Stockyards and Cluck Clucks myself, but that's not to say it's \"better\" as much as different and fantastic.  The other two have a more traditional fried chicken and they're both excellent.  But PG has this weird take on fried chicken where it's boneless brown meat cutlets absolutely encased in a layer of crispy fried wholesomeness.    And the flavour stays on your breath so that you're hungry after you eat it because it smells so damned good!  5 stars easily.  Never seen or heard of anyone being disappointed in this.  If they are, hang 'em high...."}
{"text":"OK. That has got to be the BEST fried chicken sandwich, I've ever had.   It's really is a 'food truck' in brick-and-mortar. No dine-in, just take-out! Sandwiched (hah!) between the CHIN building, and the theatre. It's easily missed!   Offering fried chicken + side(s) (coleslaw or potato salad), and sandwiches (regular, Nashville hot, honey & jalapeño); you can't go wrong.   Opted for the honey & jalapeño sandwich, and it was nothing short of amazing.   IMAGINE: A big, juicy, piece of fried chicken coated in honey, smothered in buttermilk ranch, loaded with a layer of SWEET and tangy jalapeños, sitting on a perfect sweet potato bun.  They were no average jalapeños either. Think, pickled and sweet, like the veggies in a Vietnamese banh mi! Literally.   They also make fresh crullers. Not as notable, but still very good. Light and fluffy, and thankfully not as sweet as your average timmies cruller.   They were quite busy on a rainy, Tuesday afternoon, and you'll see why!  My only regret: I was too full to try their Nashville hot chicken too. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"the pengest munch this is for sure the pengest munch  i had the spicy chicken sandwich and i felt like the spice was burning my insides after. so flavourful though.   get the original sandwich."}
{"text":"As a weekly fried chicken eater, you can say I'm your neighbourhood fried chicken dumpster. I love eating bread and fried chicken, so let's put them together and find glory with PG CLUCKS.   The chicken is made to order, fresh out the fryer 10~ mins after ordering. Heavenly sweet pickles on a beautiful thick piece of juicy chicken with a nice mayo slaw. Simple ingredients, and a huge punch to your taste buds.   I've gone to many fried chicken domains and this was by far the best sandwich I've ever had in the city. For $8... you can't go wrong when bar hopping in lil Italy."}
{"text":"This is a tast chicken sandwich.  Had the fried chicken sandwich with coleslaw pickles and ranch and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was.  Small take out place only on College street in Little Italy...too bad they don't have more locations."}
{"text":"Yummy. I had the jalepeno and honey sandwich the first time I was here. I felt was a bit too much honey so didn't really like it. The classic sandwich is delicious though, and a good price.   We got a bunch of their fried chicken pieces another time and those were also quite good. Boneless, crispy, and very flavourful. Didn't really love their sauces, but it didn't really need any."}
{"text":"Damn that's some spicy jalapeno and honey chicken. Came here on Saturday evening for a quick bite. I'm not the biggest fan of chicken sandwiches, but this blows the mcchicken away.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered in and found the reviews here were excellent, so it seemed like a no-brainer, and you know what? it was... I got the standard sandwich, sweet pickles, buttermilk sauce, coleslaw, with an extra piece, holy crap was it HUGE, i'm glad i didn't order a side, as that sandwich was larger than  could possible imagine, the bun was brioche style sweet and fresh as could be, i was really impressed to be honest. I also ordered an extra piece Nashville hot style, totally unnecessary but I honestly had no idea how much food i was getting, that being said, the extra piece was fantastic,  hot, but not too hot, the Nashville rub on it was pretty damn excellent, I was very happy with the food here, and i'll definitely be back.  Also, on the delivery side of things, these people know ow to package their food to stay warm and most importantly CRISPY!  not Styrofoam, covered boxes or plastic containers, so no chance to steam anything. Food arrived nice and crispy and not squashed, it was a nice touch as I was partially expecting it could be a soggy mess. Nope.. This place lives up to the reviews."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after having it bookmarked for a year! It did not disappoint!! It's a really small place take out only. I got the regular chicken sandwich which had pickles and coleslaw. It was delicious!!! I would definitely come back and try their Nashville hot chicken. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"The kind of place you just pick it up and eat at home or on the way to somewhere. Very small location. The people working there not the friendliest but the sandwich makes up for it.   I tried the regular hot chicken sandwich. Wasn't too spicy but had just the right kick. The sandwich included lettuce, pickles, some sauces (and maybe onions.). Very good combo and the sauces were amazing.   I believe they offer delivery with some companies but I've never tried it. Also very easy to get to."}
{"text":"These other reviewers are nuts.  Totally mediocre, average chicken sandwich.  It's cripsy, not that flavourful, not very juicy, covered both mayo and mayo-y coleslaw, and that sums it up.  Meh.  This is a total 5/10."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken, so warm and juicy. Great flavour too. Definitely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Yay!!!! I almost didn't find this place lol. Thankfully, they had a sign on the side walk saying fried chicken or something like that lol.   This place is a take-out restaurant and a must try!!!   I had the Jalapeño and Honey Chicken Sandwich!!! Omg the fried chicken was crispy on the outside and moist in the inside. They glazed the sandwich with honey and this tangy white sauce. They add jalapeños inside. The sweet, tangy, and the spicy were a good combination. Try it!!! Yummmm"}
{"text":"Great chicken, extremely juicy and flavourful. The spicy is on point but it's not for the faint of heart. The pasta salad is also a good side.   This is a take out joint, so hurry in before the first snow! Other wise you'd have to wait out in the cold."}
{"text":"Little Italy has so many places to check out that's it's practically overwhelming.  With the difficult parking to the one way streets to the stretch along College that twists just a bit between Grace and Bathurst is a place that could be considered holy if you worship that sort of thing.  I'm talking about the church of deep fried chicken.  Is this place the fried chicken center of the universe?  The Vatican City, the Mecca, the Jerusalem of the fried chicken there is to be had in Toronto?  I don't know, that would be a bold statement but I could see for some how it could be a consideration.  Fried Chicken Sandwiches.  No, that's not the name of this place but rather their signage on College facing south up, up and above the street.  A red font on a white back which at first appearance may seem to basic and simple but yet so accurate.  No, I don't think the style or hook of those three words put together is any sort of elaboration of what they may have.  There's simply no ambiguity here, no play on words or disingenuous deceit.  Fried Chicken Sandwiches is just plain, honest, face value here we are and this is what we have...   Like a food truck built into a side of a building, this brick and mortar is a simple line with a menu as simple as In-N-Out.  You're ordering a chicken sandwich (or a big one) or fried chicken but how many pieces.  Simple, concise, to the point.  You pick up your order and yup you have to leave.  You can't eat it inside because there's no space at this order counter of a restaurant.  It's safe to say if you're ordering something, it's to go... for sure.  There's what seems to be a small city bench right outside the restaurant along side the green compost bins and other city refuse containers and being beside a large theater that had something going on that evening, there was a well dressed, young hip crowd outside perhaps during an intermission to a show or something like that.  Using the bench as a place to put your food down seemed practical.  I mean I'm about to have some Nashville hot style chicken tenders and split a chicken sandwich.  I need somewhere to properly stage this stuff to prepare it for consumption and take a few flattering shots of these poultry delights.  The chicken sandwich was good.  I mean it was good but seemingly pretty basic.  For a place that got voted the best something or other from Toronto Life I can say that it was good but the sandwich is a chicken sandwich.  Mind you it was the third of the day for me at the third different place.  I was more infatuated with the chicken tenders which from what I gather were deboned thigh, breaded and sauced up.  Nashville hot is probably my new fav as far as chicken goes.  It's hot and while versions like Uncle Ray's lightning at Union Chicken can be borderline crazy hot, PG Cluck's version is a solid hot but not kill you where you stand kind of hot.  I like it.  The flavor is there, enjoyable and bold without causing you to have to go down the street to Toronto Western Hospital.  PG Clucks to me is almost a carnival type experience.  You order your food and then you're scrambling for a place to consume your goodies.  It's good but as opposed to food trucks or carny type pricing it's actually rather affordable sort of like Dirty Bird type prices.    I'd put PG Cluck's right up there for great fried chicken to be had in the city of Toronto.  I'd highly recommend their Nashville hot version as well.  The wait can be a long one if it's busy and when you're this good it's not a surprise that they can be busy."}
{"text":"Court is now in session and the verdict is in.   The suspect is found guilty as charged on all counts. The crime: being an outrageously cluckin' good sandwich  These things are seriously tasty.   (I would just ask that the amount I ate be stricken from the record)"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! All you need in fried chicken is packaged in this cozy place (no seating though, it's a grab and go style restaurant). Tried the \"Nashville hot\" chicken. Juicy and delicious!!  Also, great value for money! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"For this price, this is probably as good as it gets! The sandwiches will definitely leave your hunger satisfied.   PG Clucks may look small from the outside but those sandwiches are nothing short of enormous. I've been here quite a few times and I have yet to be disappointed in this place. By now I've tried pretty much everything on their menu (aside from the honey crullers, not much of a dessert fan in general) and the chicken has never once been dry or overcooked. It's always crispy on the outside and tender/juicy on the inside. I do admit this isn't really the place to go for a  first date though, these sandwiches are as delicious as they are messy and the sauce can end up dripping all over the place if you aren't careful.   Advice to those of you guys trying to find a place to sit and eat after getting the food: there's a couple of benches at the end of the block (past the theatre) on the left! And there are very few passerby's that go past the benches as well so you'll get a little bit of privacy.  And if you can persevere long enough to walk 10 minutes, Christie's Pit isn't that far either! Great place to sit around with friends, enjoy the nature, and eat some good food :)  You won't regret coming to this place guys!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to check out the place since it opened but it was only open for dinner! Luckily they changed that and now you can get your sandwich at lunch. $6.50 for their chicken sandwich. With a price like that I had to wonder what was wrong.  it's made to order. Has a little bite in the sauce, on a small bun. If you can eat, you'd need 2 but for lunch it's perfect or you can get a sandwich with double chicken!! I liked it enough to go again."}
{"text":"On my way to Birreria Volo, I saw \"Home of the Big Cluck\" sign out front. I was so excited because this used to be the temporary home of Brando's Fried Chicken. For one second, I thought Brando's Fried Chicken was back. Except it wasn't. It's PG Clucks.  It was busy when I walked by and it was busy when I ordered. The Big Cluck is the chicken sandwich, but I just wanted the chicken, so I got 2 pieces of regular fried chicken, it comes with a choice of one side, coleslaw/pasta salad/potato salad, and I got the coleslaw. It came to $8 + tax. Two pieces of boneless, tender and crispy chicken was served to me with a buttermilk dipping sauce as well as hot sauce. It was placed into a paper bag and I was sent on my way.   No, you can not eat in because there are no tables, there is no dining area. It's a takeaway only type of place. Although, if it's a great day, you most definitely can just eat it on the sidewalk.   I immediately wanted more when I finished, but I thought it was better to save it for next time. Because there will definitely be a next time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I research food places in Toronto because we are from out of town. We happened to came upon this place on Toronto's food blog and Instagram.   I have to say, this place is hands down AMAZING! It blew my mind. We ordered their spicy chicken sandwich, chicken tenders, and one of their pasta salad sides . After we finished, we came back for seconds ^__^  No dine in type of place, order and go! There is a bar next to them which you can sit, order a drink, and eat!   We are definitely coming back to Toronto for this place!"}
{"text":"I've had three of these, they taste good, a bit heavy on the garlic. BUT every time the chicken doesn't seem to be cooked all the way through. The one I had yesterday was the worst one, after a bite through the outer crust, it was slimy and a bit pink, the texture was really awful, I had to spit it out in the snow. This is dark meat, not white breast meat. I don't think I could try it again, it was more slimy than wet tofu. It's a texture thing. The buns are not that great either.  There is usually a long line to get in, but the service is fast and enthusiastic. You have to eat it on the sidewalk or take home. Closed Sunday and Monday."}
{"text":"There is no question that this place has the best fried chicken sandwich I have ever had. I got the classic spicy chicken sandwich and it blew my socks off. Every part of this sandwich was noteworthy: the chicken was juicy and breaded with just the right amount of sauce, the coleslaw was creamy and delicious, the picked hot peppers, and the fresh and tasty bun. Loved every bite.   Next time, I'm going to try the fried chicken with a few sides.   His place is a hole in the wall. So bring some camping chairs or you'll be dripping all over yourself. There is one bench right in front of the place but with the lineup of people, it was hard to get."}
{"text":"The Big Cluck sandwich is definitely delicious as all the other reviews say. I also got the 2-piece combo with pasta (macaroni) salad. I had one piece with the Nashville hot flavour, and regular for the other. The Nashville piece was definitely tastier, especially if you like spicy. I would not recommend getting the items separately because after trying the coleslaw, macaroni salad and chicken separately I wish I went to Popeyes instead, but after biting into the Big Cluck sandwich which includes pickles and some secret sauce I understood the hype about this place. I would come back for the Big Cluck if I'm in the area.  Note that this place is takeout only and there are some benches in the south-west corner by the traffic lights close by. This also means that there are no washrooms, which I was desperate for at the time I was there."}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and can't go wrong with that! The Cole slaw inside the sandwich was yummy and the chicken was fried perfectly."}
{"text":"PG Clucks Sandwich was absolutely amazing!! I had the classic spicy chicken sandwich. The fried chicken was so tender and juicy and the sauce is fantastic! It was a perfect introduction to this new venue,going to be new favorite for me. The sweet dill pickles off sets the spiciness  of the sauce. Ahh sweet and savory a perfect combination. The bun is the perfect size to hold everything together. Definitely coming back for more. Mmm mm good!"}
{"text":"A great value! My husband and I got 2 combos for basically $20, which doesn't even happen at McDonald's anymore. We got a classic and jalapeño and honey sandwich with coleslaw and potato salad and soft drinks. There really isn't any place to sit and eat, but we were fortunate to go on a nice day and ate at Trinity Bellwoods Park.  The sandwiches were delicious and HUGE! Extremely fresh and crisp and hot even after walking to the park. They use boneless chicken thigh so the sandwich is flavourful and juicy.  Both salads were just ok, but we would definitely come back for the chicken!"}
{"text":"Probably the best fried chicken sandwich I've ever had.  Not expensive either!  They lose one star because their honey crueler is basically like eating soggy muffin mix that is filled with pockets of oil.   Fried pickles are amazing! Love their slaw!  What a find!"}
{"text":"I can eat Stockyards everyday, but I thought this was way too greasy. Also had too much batter."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the basic sandwich via Foodora. The chicken was slimy and stretchy. It was really disgusting. It actually did not look like something one should ingest. We threw it away at home. There side potato salad was good. I enjoyed it. I'm really surprised as others have reviewed this place at quite high with wonderful comments. Perhaps this was a one off. Either way, I will not be ordering again from this place!"}
{"text":"One of the best chicken places I've been to in the city!  Chicken is delicious, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  I had the Jalapeno and Honey sandwich, and the sauce and toppings were complementing the chicken and it all worked so well together!"}
{"text":"This one was a huge miss for me..  maybe a great spot for dark meat lovers but we didn't like it at all.. They gave me a bunch of gnarly super dark leg meat pieces that just totally ooze grease and just looks generally unappealing once you look inside the sandwich.. should've done my research  At least offer a white option for god's sake, something a little lighter !"}
{"text":"Successfully riding the fried chicken wave in Toronto, PG Cluck's is a standout.  The first time you come here you will want to know a few things...  1. Order the classic sandwich. It is a large piece of white meat chicken that is fried on the spot served on a sweet potato roll. The sandwich is topped with a slaw, two sweet/bread and butter pickles, a ranch sauce, and a hot sauce. 7$ plus tax. 2. I asked \"does spicy mean 'Toronto spicy' or 'southeast Asian spicy'?\" The answer was \"somewhere in between\", which I found to be true. If you are not a fan of the heat, ask for a mild sandwich. 3. There are no seats here, just a city bench on the sidewalk. 4. It takes 8-10 minutes for them to cook and prepare your sandwich. Bring an umbrella if it threatens to rain. 5. PG Cluck's is available through foodora, so you can have it delivered.   This is an excellent fist full of deep fried goodness."}
{"text":"When you factor in service, price, and quality, we have a win here. I ordered spicy chicken sandwich, and what struck me was just how massive and weighty the thing was. There's a bit of slop with the two sauces and coleslaw topping, but the stacking of the different flavors was on point. Chicken was succulent and tender on the inside with a good amount of crusty crunch on the outside. The level of heat was also exciting without being overpowering. This is definitely a sandwich you want to eat by yourself...away from judgey eyes.   Can't wait to come back and try their other items."}
{"text":"I went because of a BlogTO article. That is sad in and of itself.  Ordered the Classic sandwich + deep fried pickles + cold salad thing   The best part of the sandwich was the dressings; the coleslaw and sauces were really, really good. Seems like the sauces are meant to be the driver of this sandwich.  The chicken; huge portion of meat. Problem is that I found the chicken terribly fatty. A wee bit gross as a result.   I didn't find this anymore greasy than I already expected. Also, I did not get the spicy one, but I found it spicy. I was able to rebuild my life after having my tongue unexpectedly inundated with heat.   The deep fried pickles had the wrong flavour. This was a sentiment shared by my wife, who would eat a tire if it was battered. Its the pickle that is off, its in an odd brine, or no brine at all. A pickle that doesn't even have a hint of vinegar flavour is just a small cucumber as far as I am concerned.  I would not order the deep fried pickles again.   Apparently the cold salad thing was good. I don't eat that, its far too beige for me.  Look, for the price the sandwich is a steal. Its not the best Chicken Sandwich in the city, but its damn good.  Also, business owners....smile FFS. I don't need you chanting 'Cum bye Ah' but between the 3 of you, the 10 minutes it took to cook the food could have been cut by a \"how are you?\" \"first time here?\", honestly you could tell me I've put on weight and I'd still probably be happy. Better than staring at each other."}
{"text":"Fried. Chicken. Sandwich. What a clever idea eh? The owner of this joint combines 2 pieces of toasted sweet breads (brioche, I think) and neatly nestled in between lies a good sized fried chicken thigh - we ordered a classic spicy sandwich (pretty spicy, but in a good way) plus coleslaw and pickles $6.50.   To sum it up, it was delicious and we'd definitely come back again when sneaking in goodies into the Royal. Meow."}
{"text":"Their business plan is smart and they get point for that.  They also get point for cooking to order (massive win). Plus points for the juiciness of their chicken.  Double plus points for the size of each piece of chicken and it being mostly dark meat. Triple plus point for their amazeballs customer service (seriously - I kind of want to adopt the staff and bring them home for a non fried dinner).    They lose points for the following;   Spicy does not actually mean spicy in the house of PG.  I imagine PG must have grown up in a home where pepper was reserved for special occasions.  We ordered the classic as well as the jalapeño, asked for extra spicy on both.  Neither delivered on the spice. Further, the Jalapeño honey should be rebranded as just honey with a side of pickled, mild as prekindergarten, jalapeños.     The biggest challenge though is that their buns do not stand up to the meat.  We live 6 minutes away and the buns were fall apart wet by the time got home to eat them.  Like throw away soggy.   If we visit again, we will just order the chicken and make our own sandwiches at home with better spice, bread and sides   Their chicken is great though as are the people.  They need to rethink the sandwich concept given they are take away only"}
{"text":"I mean, with a name like PG Clucks, it was inevitable that I'd be eating here eventually.  I kept it simple and ordered the spicy chicken sandwich. And because they apparently fry the chicken fresh every time, it takes about five minutes for the sandwich to be ready. (I will wait much, much longer than that for a fresh sandwich rather than something sitting under a heat lamp.)  Anyway, the sandwich is pretty magnificent. The oversized piece of fried chicken is deliciously, gloriously crunchy without losing the juiciness of the meat inside, while the accompanying condiments work quite well in the context of the sandwich (although I will admit the abundant coleslaw occasionally did take away from the chicken itself). The hot sauce gave the whole thing a welcome kick, too."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. Best chicken ever. Enough said. Sides were alright, not as saucy as I personally like it, but the chicken, man... don't hesitate to at least try this place once for the chicken."}
{"text":"Not that good. I was super stoked to try this place after having Nashville hot chicken in Nashville and reading about it in the paper. I expected it to be melt your face off, intensely spicy, authentic southern fried chicken. Nope. I had it Nashville hot- which looked like a quick dip in a bowl of some red-tinted oil. So it was extra greasy.  The good: Deboned dark meat. All the flavour, none of the work. The chicken was super juicy and tender, pretty decent meat. Chicken was cooked to order. Decent price- 2pc, 1 side, $8.  The bad: Batter was greasy in the worst way. Like bad F&C. Maybe the temp of the fryer wasn't set correctly? And that second dip in the bowl of 'spicy' oil only made it more greasy. The coleslaw tasted like old beer. Malt vinegar maybe? It was watery, and pretty flavourless. Could have used some salt.  Popeye's and even KFC are better bets. Bummer."}
{"text":"My friend and I had been wanting to try the famous Nashville-style hot chicken for some time and finally got a chance to recently. We decided to go with \"Mild\" since we weren't really sure what to expect! Mild turned out to be just spicy enough (for us, anyway) to be interesting. It was very good chicken and we enjoyed it and our side salads very much. I would certainly order it again. I'm curious about the sandwiches that everyone here is raving about...will have to give them a try as well."}
{"text":"Ordered 6 pieces with potato and pasta salad.  Boneless juicy chicken pieces. Regular & Nashville. Battered but not crispy. Pieces of chicken were not uniform, I was given a small piece (what a rip-off). Each piece cost $3.  This experience would have been perfect if I had not gotten 1 small piece of chicken and salads were a bit colder. $18.  French crueller at $2.50 each.  Both salads were small; potato salad was better than the pasta salad; the salads were not cold but rather were served at room temperature.  Service was prompt."}
{"text":"We went there last night and brought our friends from Long Island, NY because of the rave reviews. We live 50 min drive from this disgusting hole  in a wall. Three of us ordered the plain chicken with coleslaw and my husband ordered the spicy chicken sandwich. I asked for my plain chicken to be in a separate bag as I can't have certain spices due to allergy reactions. We went and sat in our car to eat. I opened my chicken and grease was pouring off it into the paper container. It looked awful before I took one bite. Well, I can tell you they cook the plain chicken with the spicy chicken in the same fryer. I had an immediate reaction on my lips and today, next day I have a reaction inside my mouth.  So dissatisfied with this place."}
{"text":"There were pros and cons, okay.  The pro was that, you know, it tasted pretty good.  The really good thing that I also really appreciate is when the fillet, the chicken fillet - or is it the patty?  No, it wouldn't be the patty.  I always love it when the chicken fillet extends beyond the boundaries of the bun.  Not a criticism of them but of most places, they don't toast the bun or heat the bun and it's very muddled in the end.  You have a hot fillet, right, and a cold bun.  It's disappointing.  Overall, very good."}
{"text":"Good chicken and nice sized portions. Don't get confused by big lineups which might be for the next door theatre"}
{"text":"For what you want, it's deliciously topped deep fried heaven. Ordered on Uber Eats, and I'd recommend the spicy chicken sandwich!   Really couldn't complain, even with the delivery if you eat it right away it wasn't too soggy and it was piled high."}
{"text":"Tried the Jalapeno and Honey sandwich.  - chicken dipped in honey  - pickled jalapenos  - jalapeno sauce  - ranch sauce   Straight 5/5. Good portion of fried chicken, smothered in honey and sauce. Soft sandwich bread. The mix of sweet and hot flavors works really well. Overall complete sandwich especially for the price. Confined space, strictly takeout but great staff and the overall operation is clean, well organized, and fast.   Would recommend and would go back. Got to try the Classic and Big Cluck ( chicken variant of a Big Mac ) next, basically compete the sandwich menu."}
{"text":"Picture this: it's a bright, sunny day and all you're craving is fried chicken. So you walk over to PG Clucks. You order one of their fried chicken sandwiches and eat it on a bench out front, as coleslaw and ranch drip down your face. If this isn't summer living, than I don't know what is, TBH.  Anybody who is anybody in this city knows that the fried chicken at PG Clucks is where its at. It is crisp, tender and juicy. All important things when eating fried chicken, IMO. There are a couple varieties on the sandwich: their Big Cluck (which is similar to a Big Mac, $10), Jalapeno and Honey ($10) and then the Regular (coleslaw, ranch, pickles $8). I'm a purist, so I always stick with the classic and I'm never disappointed.   If you're going to order a side, get the potato salad. I'm dreaming of it right now and my mouth is watering. It should also be noted that the 'sides' are actually pretty substantial. So it's well worth the price. But if you're looking to order something with your sandwich, they do offer combo prices. My sandwich, side and drink came to $15 with tax and tip.  Also, be aware that PG Clucks is 100% a takeout joint. You should not plan to eat here."}
{"text":"ooooooomg probably the best fried chicken sandwich I've ever had!  The honey jalapeno sandwich freaking unreal....the best place to grab food before a show at the Royal.  Recommend 100%"}
{"text":"Definitely by far one of the best fried chicken sandwiches of all time. Piping hot, juicy and well flavoured. Not much more I could have asked for. Be prepared to grab and go as it's more of a hole in the wall and the street is narrow so you can't really stand in front of the shop!"}
{"text":"Finally tried PG Clucks!!! Has the classic spicy sandwich. It was really awesome! The fried chicken was very tendered and spicy. Balanced well by the coleslaw and pickles. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic fried chicken. I've heard about PG Clucks for some time and one day last week decided to give them a shot. Got a 3 piece of Nashville Hot fried chicken with a side of potato salad and can confirm that this is the best fried chicken you can get in the city. Chicken was very juicy and had a great crunch to it, with a perfect amount of heat and a ranch and hot sauce for dipping! Potato salad had a great tang to it, portion sizes were excellent. 10/10, would recommend PG Clucks to anyone looking for some comfort food in a hurry. Prices are also very good."}
{"text":"The chicken they make is super delicious. However, the burger I had was super average. Nothing special, not much of taste. The pasta salad side I got for it had a funny taste. It was a few pasta pieces in a not so tasty sauce. They're not selling fries. The place is super cheap. For the chicken it worth a try. It's a tiny place, there is no space to eat inside, it's really just take away."}
{"text":"Cluckin' good sandwiches. Popped in for the big cluck, and it left an impression. Super unique milk bun, and the chicken is absolutely ridiculous. The tenderness is almost incomprehensible. I don't get it. I'll definitely be working my way through the rest of the menu sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"So good that I have half a mind to drive from Detroit to Toronto just for this. It's a boneless thigh that's smothered in a delicious coleslaw between a brioche bun. It is a small store as many other reviews mentioned, and they seem busy, even at 10pm on a Friday. You can call in your order though and get it to go, if you want save some time and not worry about paying for parking.   Price is right too - It's about ~$6 American dollars per sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is unpretentious and has a very simple menu mainly focusing on 3 different chicken sandwiches. I had the classic and it was 5 stars, both taste and value. You'd be hard pressed to find a better fried chicken sandwich in Toronto.   While the fare is simple, it is expertly done. The breding is crispy, chicken perfectly cooked and the slaw not too creamy or dry because this cabbage is freshly cut and not slathered in dressing.   The thing that makes the biggest difference is the freshness of the oil which doesn't even have a hint of rancid/bitterness which is key when your main fare is fried stuff.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Holy moly, I'm not a sandwich person, but PG Clucks has me re-thinking my stance on sandwiches. My friends were raving about PG Clucks for the longest time, so when I was back from school, we made plans to venture downtown. We were on a mission for the alleged \"best fried chicken sandwich in Toronto\".  First of all, let me tell you, it was NOT fun walking here at all. It was cold, raining, slushy, and I was drenched after walking for 20-ish minutes from the station. I was the definition of a very unhappy camper by the time we made it to the small and humble abode of PG Clucks.   I ordered the honey jalapeno sandwich and a spicy fried chicken sandwich to go for my boyfriend to try. The combo was just about $10 including a drink and a side, which was a pretty good deal. To top it all off, there was no place to sit after receiving these 2 massive chicken sandwiches, so we ended up eating on the ground floor of this dingy apartment since it was still raining.   Now you might be wondering why the heck I'm giving PG Clucks 5 stars despite my disastrous trip downtown. The fried chicken sandwich was just THAT freaking good. The chicken was super tender and covered in the delicious honey sauce and pickled jalapenos which provided just the right kick in spice.   It was, quite literally, a mouthgasm.  The chicken was somehow still super crispy and the bread was so soft and buttery, I practically inhaled the sandwich. It was the BEST fried chicken I've ever had and folks, this is not an exaggeration by the slightest. They strongly deserve their title of best chicken sandwich in the city and if I am downtown again, you can bet that I will be here to eat the best damn fried chicken sandwich I've had the honour of tasting.  My boyfriend received his chicken sandwich 2 hours later and was still mindblown by how freaking good it was and demanded that we go there together next time.   So in conclusion, yes, you should be trying PG Clucks out and no, it is not overhyped. It lives up to the hype and your tummy and tastebuds will thank you for blessing them when you take your first bite."}
{"text":"Never enjoyed a fried chicken sandwich anywhere else! Loved the classic spicy. Comes with a hefty portion of coleslaw on the bun. Sandwich was huge and tasty! The 4 piece meal and one sandwich filled 2 of us. Worth the price."}
{"text":"WOW! To do this place justice, go to McDonalds and get a McChicken sandwich. It's bland, dry, and loaded in mayo sauce to give it some flavor because the chicken has none. I used to think Popeyes had some really good fried chicken and then I came here. The juices pour out of the sandwich, the bun is buttery and light, and the chicken! Huge! Moist! Tender! Delicious! The spicy version has some serious kick! And the price, $7 are you kidding me? What a bargain. The counter is a little short-staffed and the waiting times can be long if you come at certain times, but it's worth it. Again, I can't get over the price, this is such a great deal. I'm coming here all the time from now on."}
{"text":"PG Clucks is cluckin' up a storm in the heart of Little Italy. This newly opened tiny shack churns out a variety of snack and meal sized goodies ranging from delicious honey krullers, to fried chicken sammies topped with Big Mac ingredients. Each menu item packs a punch of flavour worthy of trying out.  Surprisingly, nothing is too expensive here which allows for a bit of experimenting on every visit. The sides are nicely priced at $2.50 each and include a creamy potato salad that has a very distinct flavour, not like the typical bland stuff you'd find elsewhere.  Must-try items: Classic Fried Chicken Sandwich Big Cluck Honey Kruller  While there isn't any seating available, ordering here is quick and easy depending on what time you arrive. Everything is made in front of you while you wait, and the staff are quite friendly and relaxed.   PG Clucks definitely caters to an audience of foodies and fried chicken lovers, which means if you don't love chicken, you may not be wowed by the experience. This place is affordable and sticks to specialties that they actually execute on very well, so if you don't find something you love here, you're definitely trippin'."}
{"text":"PG Clucks Mini Hack: How to Bite into the Best Fried Chicken on College:  1) Location and hours: 610 College St. If you're taking the TTC and travelling west on College, get off at Clinton St. Travelling east on College, get off at Grace St. Walk towards the vintage cinema theatre \"The Royal\". Now look for the sign \"FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICHES\" in red capitals. Closed on Sunday and Monday. Open 12 pm - 11 pm from Tuesday to Saturday. Perfect for a late night snack when pub crawling in Little Italy.  2) Fried Chicken: Important! Portions: if you're looking for a perfect snack, go with the $7 Classic (regular or spicy). If you're hungry for a meal, add a $3 extra chicken piece to your Classic. The Classic is their signature boneless, buttermilk, Nashville-style deep fried chicken with sliced pickles, chili sauce, and coleslaw all in a sandwich bun. OMFG - WARNING, eating this chicken will make you euphoric! CRISPY, TENDER, JUICY. It is simply one of the tastiest, most flavourful fried chickens I've eaten in a long time (nearly better than, dare I say, Bar Fancy, The Stockyards, Kanpai Snack Bar, The County General, Kitson & Co Sandwiches, and others).   3) Pros and Cons: The price is super cheap, $7 +tax for a sandwich. If you order for 2 and get the combo (1 side, 1 drink), it's under $20. Of course, no sandwich is perfect; the coleslaw in the sandwich was a tiny bit too watery, and so the sandwich was slightly soggy. The sides are decent but nothing special. Stick to the fried chicken. Another thing, there is no seating, no standing to eat, you just order and go. They also do Foodora.  PG Clucks: A new favourite for Nashville-style fried chicken, PG (owner Pawel Grezlikowski) Clucks is the only place on College West for some sinfully good fried chicken - with Kensington Market-like prices too!"}
{"text":"Voted #1 Chicken sandwich in Toronto for a reason. So good I ate it too quick & didn't take a pic. Literally came back the next day to have it again, that good!!!!  Recommendations :  Classic Chicken sandwich w/ honey   Thank you PG Clucks"}
{"text":"Alright listen here guys. I'm not sure If I can write this review without cursing but this place is so f***ing gooooooood.  For anyone who likes fried chicken sandwiches, this is the perfect spot for you. For $8 you could get yourself the most perfect combination of bird and bun. The chicken is so tender on the inside but fried beautifully on the out. The brioche bun is the perfect firmness to hold all of the juices together. The coleslaw is creamy but not too overpowering. It all enhances one another quite nicely. Will be coming back to try their sides so keep an eye out for an update on this review! Their sandwiches come in regular, Nashville hot or jalapeño honey. I can safely proclaim this place to be the best fried chicken joint in town."}
{"text":"This is a must stop every time I come to Toronto. The best chicken sandwich I've ever had."}
{"text":"4.5. Can I review based only on 3 bites of their sandwich? Well those bites were darned good! Kinda spicy but I love me some crispy flavorful chicken that is not dry but tender inside.  I did not have a whole sandwich because both times I was in the area I ate already previously.  I did try their deep fried pickles but they were not that great, pickled batter was not flavorful and the pickle was gumy not crisp - hence the -0.5 stars. Maybe they should just stick to their amazing chicken sandwich!  Its just a pick up counter so you will either eat standing or find a bench or take it home. Price is reasonable considering that it is quite filling and tasty! I will recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious and huge sandwich. The chicken is tender and flavorful. The potato salad is a little too salty for me. Good customer service. No seating but super busy."}
