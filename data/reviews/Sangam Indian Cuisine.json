{"text":"I had the lunch here today, the food was salty and the chicken fries were all very bad. One of the terrible indian food i had so far."}
{"text":"There are many attempts at Indian cuisine in the surrounding area. This is by far the best. The staff are warm and welcoming and the food matches the personality of the restaurant. It is quality and not over priced. My first stop for Indian food in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious food, wonderful staff. Wouldn't go anywhere else for Indian, dine-in or takeout."}
{"text":"The restaurant was good but the food was horrible. I went in because people gave good reviews to the restaurant. But I guess they gave it a good review so that we can feel the pain they went through eating the old food or maybe they just went in to see the restaurant and their menu and then thought maybe next time and felt the food might be good seeing the restaurant but it is not. 
They had old food even on a Saturday afternoon. 
But a nice surrounding place."}
{"text":"My brother and I came for dinner. The atmosphere was pleasant--despite being very crowded, the restaurant was not very loud. As our appetizer we split the vegetable pakora. It was very well balanced, with tangy sauce accompanying lightly spiced balls of fried vegetables. For my meal I ordered the vegetable patia, which was sweet and savory. We shared the mixed bread (without butter). For dessert we had the rice pudding. The food was amazing, the waiting staff was attentive and friendly, and I am very satisfied with my experience here."}
{"text":"A good indian food option around lake norman area. Like the chicken curry and garlic naan. Tandoori chicken was not that great."}
{"text":"My Dad treated my wife and me to a dinner here on New Year's Eve. My dad had a sampler, my wife had a chicken dish and I had a lamb one. All the dishes were delicious, especially with the naan. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best Indian restaurant in the area! Their chicken curry is to die for and I'm always sure to pair it with fresh garlic naan and gulab jamun for dessert. It is a family owned operation and they take much pride in their restaurant, great food, and consistently superb service. Overall, great food and service. Can't be beat."}
{"text":"Went to the lunch buffet. It was AWESOME and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Thought this place was ok.  The decor was nice and the staff was very polite & helpful, but the food seemed to lack spice to me for some reason.  Just wasn't too impressed with the food, but maybe we came on an off day.

I would go back & try it again, but wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Sangam two times. The first time I ordered takeout and the order was delicious and correct. Craving Indian and food & being in the Cornelius area, I decided to try the place again. I'm glad I did because I came during the lunch buffet. I normally don't do buffets but made an exception when I saw there were many vegetarian items. In addition to the rice & naan, there were six other hot vegetarian dishes to choose from. Plus there were also many vegetarian items on the chilled side of the bar, including raw veggies, oranges, & a garbanzo beam salad to name a few. The food was absolutely delicious! It was so good that I am still craving it. The cost was reasonable too--$8.95 for adults and $5.00 for kids. I think I've found my favorite local Indian restaurant!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I am a sucker for Indian food! And an even bigger sucker for REALLY GOOD Indian food. 

I happened to be running a few errands in the Lake Norman area and had a mighty strong hankering for some Indian. Thanks to my trusty Yelp app, I happened across this little gem. My gosh their lunch buffet was to die for. Palak paneer, Chicken tikka masala, naan, and so much more. I hate that it's such a haul to get here. Seriously, I'd eat here everyday."}
{"text":"Best Indian around!  We come here often as a family and live the variety.  Great owners and excellent service...never disappoints."}
{"text":"Without question this was the best meal I had in Charlotte. Apart from a serene and intimate dining room, the food was exquisite and delectable from appetizer to dessert. If you are in North Carolina or passing through SEEK THIS PLACE OUT! you are welcome ahead of time. :)"}
{"text":"I'm seriously in love with this place. 

Pros: 
-amazingly kind staff. I have never felt so taken care of. I felt like they actually cared I was there!
-amazing food. Got the salmon tikka masala. So rich but excellent flavor. The salmon was so tender it was falling apart in big juicy chunks. 

Cons: 
-not a place to have a private conversation. I could hear both of the tables next to us pretty clearly. Maybe they could turn up the ambiance music a little bit? But this in no way hampers their review. 

Go, and thank me later."}
{"text":"Always incredible!! Lunch is a must..you have the opportunity to taste so many of their tasty entr√©es. Outstanding service! Quick seating..food is always extremely fresh.   If you love Indian cuisine this place is a must!  If you are newer to Indian cuisine then get by at lunch time and you can try such a variety!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty, very fresh Indian food. 
 Wonderful atmosphere, very pleasant wait-staff, and delicous meals."}
{"text":"Always good and friendly service, the food is perfection. Our go to place.  Highly recommend!

Nice not to have to go into Charlotte to get excellent Indian food."}
{"text":"I eat here fairly regularly, every couple of months, I've been here a couple dozen times.  First, the food is really good.  I eat at various Indian restaurants as I travel around the country for work, and this is one of my favorites.  I suggest trying the dinner for two.  It is a good variety of dishes and flavors.  

The staff is very friendly as well.  I enjoy going back and seeing friendly faces."}
{"text":"I love Indian food because of the spices, strong flavors, and heat.  I found a bland copy of one of the richest foodie experiences on the globe.  The food was bland and did not live up to my expectations."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch at Sangum. It ordered the white fish(can't remember which) and a great Greek salad.   The pita and tzatziki were an awesome appetizer."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet at Sangam is fantastic!  The food is wonderful.  There is a nice selection of veggie and chicken dishes and rice and mango pudding-- each dish with a wonderful, delightfully unique flavor.  I've eaten there many, many times and have never once been disappointed.  While it is a buffett, the service is still stellar.  An empty plate never lingers on table and the beverage glass is never empty.  The people are always very friendly yet very professional.  It is very reasonably priced too.  The atmosphere is a small and cozy.  It is tucked back off the road in Shops on the Green and every bit worth the little effort it takes to find it."}
{"text":"We went today for the lunch buffet and tried a little of each dish.  Every one was delicious!  The naan was the best I've ever had, it was so fresh and warm.  Although I'm not a vegetarian, I easily could become one with the variety of vegetable dishes on the buffet.  My favorite was the chana saag (creamy spinach and chickpeas).  We were impressed with the curries, none of them was too overpowering, they had just the right amount of flavor and spiciness.  The mango pudding was heavenly, creamy and not overpowering.  We will definitely be back for the lunch buffet and we want to come back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"I've been here dozens of times for lunch and dinner.  It's always good enough, and occasionally excellent.  But I know most restaurants have off days.  Their breads are always excellent, but sometimes their curries and masalas suffer from being on the buffet table at lunch.  But it's cheap enough and fast at lunch, so can't complain.  The best is ordering individual dishes at dinner with a larger group and sharing around the table.  It's rare to find really innovative WOW tastes here, but that's the same with most Indian restaurants I've been to.  A truly great Indian restaurant sparkles at the top of any world cuisine-- but to get there, you need the freshest ingredients and a passionate chef striving for genius.  Sometimes Sangam doesn't quite get there, and I decide to go home and cook my own for a while before returning hoping they're having a great night."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food. Its a welcome break from the traditional  Chinese or Italian buffets you seem to see all the time. The food was good and reasonably priced. The staff was nice but a bit timid. We were seated at a table right in front of the door so people that came in stodd there watching us eat which was a bit uncomfortable. All in all though the food was worth it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Not only is the food amazing, but all of the staff are extremely courteous. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a quick bite at lunch or even a romantic dinner!"}
{"text":"Fabulous Indian food and a wonderful lunch buffet! This is our new favorite Indian restaurant in the Lake Norman area. The staff is friendly, the restaurant is very nice, and the food is fantastic! Try the lunch buffet to experience dishes you might not know to order from the menu. The lunch buffet is only $8.95 per person and they even run Yelp specials as well. If you want to experience great Indian fare, you must check out this place!"}
{"text":"Chicken Tikka Masala, Indian spicy is addictive."}
{"text":"I've eaten plenty of Indian cuisine, but I prefer this place over all others (I even like it more than the Indian food I ate in India)! Their lunch buffet is perfect - always offering pakora, spring rolls, vegetable korma, a potato dish, and other vegetarian-friendly foods. They have great service, decent decor, and plenty of seating since the opening of their extra room."}
{"text":"I have easily been to this restaurant 20 times for lunch buffet and the food is so delicious. Never disappoints. I love Indian food  and have been to many restaurants and the quality and flavors are great. To top it off the staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This is my once-a-month (if not more!) favorite for delicious Indian food. I always go at lunch because I love the wonderful variety of their buffet. The food is always fresh, the options change daily, and the food is yummy! The restaurant is small, clean, and the service is very attentive. Hmmm - I need a trip back there next week!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The service leaves much to be desired. Didn't feel welcomed and will not return!"}
{"text":"Come and try this place!  The buffet is out of this world and the prices are great.  Much of their dishes are cooked in their in house tandoor and the authenticity is palpable.  Don't miss out on the best Indian cuisine in the Lake Norman area!"}
{"text":"Sangam is super accommodating to their customers!

I called in at 9:58pm and asked if they would be open for a 10:10pm arrival, knowing that their hours are posted as 10pm closing. They said they would stay open, and when I arrived the staff did not make me feel rushed to order.

I think that in itself deserves five stars! I was travelling back home and I really just wanted some classic North Indian food. This place was the perfect choice.

I went with the Vegetarian thali and made two substitutions asking for mutter paneer and daal instead of the korma and chana. They happily obliged, and I was thrilled as it was becoming my ideal meal.

Everything was freshly prepared, evident by the taste of each of my dishes. The daal itself stood out as absolutely delicious, but there wasn't anything I did not like.

I look forward to my next visit here!"}
{"text":"Great buffet lunch. Has all the classics plus the Naan is soft and warm!  Fast, easy, and delicious. Oh, the price can't be beat either!"}
{"text":"This was some of the best Indian food I have ever had. Perfect level of spiciness. Not greasy. Very authentic tasting. We actually ended up ordering it for take out twice in the same day! Highly recommended. Try their gobi Manchurian as well as as the huge samosas !"}
{"text":"Absolutely Fabulous on all levels.  The lunch Buffet Monday-Saturday is not to be missed.  Still serving excellent flavors and providing a all around excellent glimpse into Indian Foods.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It it easily one of our top three choices when trying to figure out what we want to eat. We go for the lunch buffet at least once a week and either go there for dinner or get food to-go a lot."}
{"text":"My husband and I love eating here. The service is always fantastic. I have no capacity for spice and the make a dish for me that I can eat and enjoy! My husband really likes his good spicy and they do that too! The atmosphere is cozy and casual. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Always great Indian food and quality service. There is something to be said for consistency. The atmosphere is nicer than most Indian restaurants and feels more intimate. There is an overflow dining room if you have a large party."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I've ever had! I'm from out of state, and I always look forward to coming here when I'm in Cornelius. The lamb rogan josh and butter chicken are my favorites! I'm not even sure if the butter chicken is on the menu, but it's incredible. The service is always excellent, too. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm not a connoisseur of Indian Cuisine but found the lunch buffet to be delicious and offer a nice variety of items. Staff was friendly and attentive. Weekday buffet is $9.95."}
{"text":"This place is just awesome.  Great garlic Nann and Chicken Tikka Masala.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Sangam for the buffet.  It was simply fantastic.  We tried everything on the buffet.  All was prepared and presented very well.  The ambience was very nice.  Nice decor and very nicely arranged tables.  The best part was the food.  Everything was very good.  I thought I had experienced the best buffet north and west of I-85...I was wrong!
I will be back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"Very clean.  Saag paneer was good and naan was fluffy.  Vegetable korma was not good.  Medium spice is more like mild"}
{"text":"Weekday lunch buffet has got to be the BEST deal around -- the food (outstanding!), the service (superb - yes better 'buffet' service than most sit-down restaurants), white cloth tablecloths - small but comfortable.

Food temperature is perfect, serving dishes are kept clean & filled.  Always.  What makes it great?  The buffet changes, not the same thing day in & week out.

There is always Naan bread, basmati rice, tandori chicken (although the taste has varied lately), at least 3 types of chutney/spicy sauces/relishes, raita, a delicious cucumber/tomato salad, an 'americanized' salad, 3-desserts (usually kheer/mango pudding/fresh oranges).  Probably other things that I haven't had too! 

 IN ADDITION, in recent history there is * always * an appetizer (usually samosa or pakora), a saag (spinach) dish (My F-a-v-o-r-i-t-e-s), a chicken dish in sauce, a mixed veggie dish in sauce -- the exact presentation/cooking style changes.  

 The 'staples' (listed above) also vary in preparation, harder for Sangam but better for us!   Plus there are at least 3-4 additional main dishes that may be more veggie dishes always (YES!!!!), additional chicken dishes, some sort of dal (although rarely do I see my favorite yellow dal), and only very occasionally their tiny 'meatballs' (which my husband enjoys tremendously).  

There is one additional thing I'd like to see on the buffet though (in addition to yellow dal more than rarely) - some soup.  

The spice level of the dishes varies also.  Some dishes are spicier than others, the same dish on different days will vary (this is Good by the way!).   Since I prefer a spicier taste I almost always stop at the end of the salad/dessert buffet & add a generous spoonful some of the relish (onion chutney perhaps?) to my plate.

You will never have an empty water glass or a dirty plate at your table for any length of time, nor some overbearing waiter -- just superb service.  Get there early for a guaranteed seat.

Only been there for dinner 1x, cost added up because we're spoiled from the variety at lunch and wanted to order everything!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Extensive menu with numerous vegetarian items, and even so, they were able to make me a custom dish that wasn't on the menu! 

The wait staff is super attentive and the restaurant is casual (not shorts and tshirt casual, but not judgy!) 

The prices are very reasonable. I had dinner there as well as lunch buffet (I was there twice in a three day span!) and the lunch buffet at $8.95 is outstanding! Not the spice level I would like, but a buffet has to be good for all, so I get it. Still, the selections were so tasty! Chicken tikka masala, curry chicken, tandoor chicken, Channa saag, lentils in a curry, naan, sauces, mango pudding, rice pudding, salads...I'm missing some others. Definitely go and enjoy! Lunch buffet is everyday from 11:30 til 2:30, and there were people coming in at 2:25 who were seated and ate too! Very nice staff here."}
{"text":"A little caveat before we dive into this review....I haven't had a lot of Indian food in my life.  I do like it, it's just not (for unknown reasons) one of the first options that pops into my head when I think about going to a restaurant.  

That being said...I liked Sangam and everything we had there.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala and it was very good.  A little too spicy for me, but I am a total sissy (and I'm sure I was asked how spicy I wanted and I stupidly answered \"however he ordered it\").  I also tried a few other dishes, I just can't keep my fork to myself, and they were all very good.  We had a bottle or two of wine with dinner, they have a good wine list.  

Our server was great.  She was friendly and attentive and put up with our shenanigans.  What more can you ask for?  

Definitely a great option if you're looking for some good Indian food in the Lake Norman area."}
{"text":"One of the best. I have had Indian food in Albany, Denver, Nederland (CO), Boulder, Runtland (VT), Salt Lake City, and Sangam takes the crown. The whole roasted eggplant mashed with garlic, peas and diced tomato was exceptional. Nann was thicker than usual but fluffy, crisp and fresh."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet.  The food was top quality and very delicious.  It was about $8 per a person.  Lunch buffet included about 8 dishes, rice, naan, spring rolls, and a salad bar."}
{"text":"Best Indian buffet in the Charlotte area. Dinner is great too as you can get things spicier."}
{"text":"We eat here about once a week, alternating between meat and vegetarian dishes, and always have a good experience. They will spice to suit your taste and will make it hot for white people. (No disrespect -- it seems a lot of other places think that if they make the food spicy non-Desi people won't actually like it.) The lassi is yummy and the chai tastes like it is made in-house and not some pre-fab stuff from a bottle.

Nice atmosphere and the service is just right: attentive and pleasant but not overbearing."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate the luncheon buffet today.  We had lived in New Delhi for four and half years in the 1990s and welcome the opportunity to enjoy Indian cuisine.  The \"all you can eat\" buffet consisted of a wide range of traditional North Indian dishes including pakoras, tandoori chicken, naan, basmati rice, lentils, rice pudding, etc. All the items were tasty and prepared well. The server and manager were personable and professional. The dining area was clean, neat, and tidy with areas for large groups, families, couples, or individual diners.  A nice touch was the colorful mukhwas or after-dinner digestive snack by the door on the way out."}
{"text":"We have been regular visitors to this place owned by Ashok and Vishal (father and son). Last night, the chef had outdone himself. I ordered the malai kabab with as hot as it gets indian style and a wonderful concoction of succulent marinated chicken pieces were placed in front of me on a nicely spiced bed of grilled onions and green peppers. I recommend that you also ask him for a nice indian dipping curry on the side and this dish becomes marvellous. In general, I love the baingan bharta and the kofta lajawab here. The restaurant caters to all levels of spice, my wife likes medium as opposed to me liking crazy hot. The waiters are always courteous and friendly. We love this place and try to make it a point to visit quite often. The decor has been recently updated and I think if they continue with the food quality they have, then this could be an award winning restaurant in the making."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch buffet which in the past was good. I am not sure what happened but it was awful this past Monday. The chicken was fatty and looked like carcass scrap. I don't think I'll ever go back for the lunch buffet again. I'll stick to dinner which has never been of poor quality."}
{"text":"I like the buffet here. My favs are pakora, rice, dal, cucumber salad, pav bhaji and kadi pakora. If you have ever had decent biryani, stay away from the biryani here, the chances are that you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome Indian cuisine with a nice atmosphere and staff, but a bit on the pricey side for a college student. Your best bet is to go for the lunch buffet. Try the samosas!"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch off the menu and it was great. Took the advice of the waiter in regards to heat level and it was perfect. Warm and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Just found out about Sangam 3 weeks ago.  Needless to say, my wife and I have been there 4 times since.  We are vegans and its hard to find great restaurants around Charlotte that can easily accomodate us.  Sangam has multiple vegetarian/vegan meals and they are amazing tasting.  We are hooked."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian food I've had outside of India itself.  It's authentic, fresh and consistently awesome.  I've been here many times and have never had a bad meal.  The service is just as amazing as the food.  I strongly recommend trying the Samosas and well everything else too.  They also have a very affordable lunch buffet with many options.  Thank You!"}
{"text":"This review is quite overdue (it's been weeks since I've been to Sangam!) but I feel obligated to add to the praise.  Let me just start off by saying that we had the Sunday lunch buffet at my mom's initiation.  This is a BIG deal.  My mom is an Indian woman who grew up in India, eating the best Indian food.  She is also a talented Indian cook who generally cooks food waaay better than the cooks in Indian restaurants.  Her dining-out standards, particularly with Indian food, are VERY high and most of the time she is hard to please.  With that said, she really likes Sangam and SHE is the one who suggested we go there!

We had Sunday brunch at Sangam just a few minutes after 12:00 and the place was pretty empty (though it really picked up by 12:30).  We lucked out with seating and food because of our early timing.  They seated us at a table that we were happy with, which we were able to easily navigate to and from the buffet with no problem.  Perfect.

The food was incredible.  I deliberately accompanied my parents to this restaurant in one of my tighter jeans with the hopes of not overeating and keeping from gorging in check.  However no matter what type of pants you plan to wear, I can promise, it's unlikely that you'll stop eating after one plate.  Or two.  Or three in my case.  Everything was just so fresh and well seasoned, it was hard to control portion size.  They had a lot of curried vegetarian dishes that we loved.  But I also couldn't stop myself from going for seconds and thirds of the samosas and palak kulcha, and other apps.  They were all just brilliantly cooked and not over fried, which is a huge plus to me.  The rice was warm and soft, and the naan was perfect, so here too, overeating became natural.  I can confidently say Sangam has some talent in the kitchen.

My parents have been to Sangam on a non-buffet day, and they had the  kofta lajwab and thought it was terrific.  I want to go back and try their bhindi masala b/c I'm a fan of okra, and their eggplant bhartha b/c I also love eggplant.

The staff is very attentive and though we were there on a buffet day, they were still great about keeping check on all tables and ensuring water refills were done and that they were amenable for any menu requests.  We had no problem getting a request taken care of throughout our afternoon there.

It's been weeks since my trip to Sangam but I hope to go again soon.  It was a great first dining experience!"}
{"text":"One of the good indian buffets in charlotte. Unlike most restaurants, their naan was good , not too thick."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and so glad I found this place!!! The food is alway great! The staff is wonderful! Restaurant is always clean and has a great atmosphere!  This is a must try! Once you do then those night of deciding what to have for dinner will exist no more!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch one day with a coworker (who is Indian) & had the buffet.  I've never really had Indian before, so I went with items that looked safe to me.  The Chicken Tikka Masala, jasmine rice & the plain naan was pretty good.

I was happy with the buffet price of $8.95, because I didn't eat a whole lot. Keep in mind, the buffet is only for lunch, 7 days a week.

This food, per my coworker, is very authentic & what she is accustomed to eating.  I feel good knowing that. :)"}
{"text":"Great food, menu, service. Highly recommend when you're craving Indian food. Nice enough inside, doesn't feel like a hole in the wall. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food doesn't have any love and does have a lot of fillers in the sauces to make it seem bountiful and thick.....like cornstarch or something.The quality of the food is really bad and cheap and the chefs have a lack of skill with authentic indian flavor. Its like Costco Indian food. Ive given it three chances since its the ONLY indian food restaurant close by. I ordered off the menu adn have also tried the buffet. to me its actually gross and watered down....cheap food. there are hardly any vegan options and nothing new and exciting. I will say that the atmosphere is nice...too bad the food is awful. i drive to concord or Charlotte to find something palatable. We need more good Authentic Northern/Southern Indian restaurants. The waiters don't listen either. so you don't get what you ask for."}
{"text":"Food was great, I've tried better and this is the reason I gave only 4 stars but we will definitely come again. We are from California and we are just thrilled to have found Indian food here in NC."}
{"text":"So my second visit was completely a 180 from my first........the service was unacceptable, the restaurant is too small for the servers not to notice my son and I.  The crappy service somehow made the food less appetizing as well.  I'll have to think long and hard if I ever decide to return."}
{"text":"After watching our visiting football team defeat the home team, we took a break and then ventured forth in search of a diversion and dinner.  We didn't find much of a diversion.  But this place for dinner was quite good.  We got there before the real dinner rush started (before 8pm).  The place soon filled up after that.  

But that didn't diminish our experience.  Service was attentive.  And our food was really good. We started with the Punjabi Samosa and the Vegetable Pakora.  Predictably tasty.  A good beginning.  

While my Palak Paneer was very salty, the other two dishes on the table were clear winners: The Paneer Karahi (paneer cubes sauteed with onions, peppers, tomatoes, ginger, garlic and herbs) was really good.  Full of good flavor.  Not to salty.  And just the right amount of heat.  The Chicken Bhuna was also fantastic.  Marinated chicken breasts sauteed with mushrooms.  This went really well with some naan.

The lassis we had were also predictably good.  The mango lassi is better than the strawberry lassi.  I'd never had a strawberry lassi before.  It seemed somewhat gimmicky to me.  And though I am glad I tried it, I will stick with the mango.  

I'll happily return to this place.  Holler if you're coming with."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant! good buffet! attentive and friendly service!. 
Location- to restaurant can easily be noticed while driving down 77 so location wise is good.
Decor-Nice and quite upscale.
Service-very good never had a empty glass of water.
Buffet- Spicy,Some good options. Some unauthentic such as meatballs tikka masala. I really think they should just stick to Chicken Tikka Masala instead.
I Really like this place but dislike their unauthenticity. They have a lot of beef options. So yup, this place is tasty"}
{"text":"A recent transplant to Charlotte, my husband and I are happy to have found Sangam. We had buttery garlic nan, veg samosas ( 2 giant size) with sauce, and tandoori chicken and a side of mango chutney. All was delish and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Tasty and lots of great vegetarian options, but wasn't the best Indian we've had.  Definitely will work if you are craving something from the sub-continent though!  Service was friendly, although a little slow bringing our check -- just need to get their attention when you are ready to go."}
{"text":"Consistent and good flavor. The buffet is the way to go, although we still order to-go at least once every couple of weeks. Very authentic and the ownership/staff is very friendly. I highly recommend this little gem."}
{"text":"Placed my very first Yelp order at Sangam, and they did not disappoint! My S.O. and I ordered:

Garlic Naan $2.95
Roti $2.50
Mushroom Broccoli Karhi (medium) $12.95
Vegetable Masala + Tofu (medium) $12.95
Kulfi $3.95

Our order was ready on or before the estimated time provided. We were greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant and directed to the bar to pick up our order. I told the staff the name on the order and the two nice gentlemen helping us handed us our food. One of them explained that he placed the kulfi in a container with ice, but that we should place it in the freezer when we get home. He also handed us a complimentary mango pudding before we left.

The naan and roti were big. The roti wasn't as flaky as I would like, but it was soft. The entr√©e portions are smaller than what I'm used to when we order Indian takeout/delivery. However, the food was not short on flavor!  Both entr√©es came with white rice. We devoured our food within minutes. They were delicious, and we wanted more. I like my masala spicy, and the medium just had a little kick. Next time, I'll order spicy. The kulfi and pudding were both sweet and creamy. The mango flavor was present. I placed the kulfi in the freezer as soon as we got home and it was still frozen when we finished our dinner, which again, only took minutes. 

The S.O. and I are a fan and will definitely order from them again in the future, if not dine at their restaurant. The restaurant is located in a shopping center with plenty of parking. Didn't see much of the restaurant when we came in, but decent size from what I remember. They had a handful of customers dining that Friday night."}
{"text":"Favorite Indian food!  Great prices on buffet with attentive service every time!  Love that it's less than 2 miles from home."}
{"text":"Been here several times for the Sunday lunch buffet.  The food is outstanding and always consistently good.
Very good value for money and will always return. 
Employees are very friendly and efficient, and the restaurant is nicely decorated and clean.
Can't say enough about how good this place is."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is awesome! I am generally a carnivore but the buffet at Sangam allowed me to try some vegetarian dishes that I would not have ordered a la carte; I was really impressed and got to broaden my food horizons.  Flavors are bold but not overwhelming and the atmosphere is quiet and clean.  Service is low key but quick and efficient.

Sangam is a great place to try a variety of excellent food that happens to be Indian.  It's now part of my regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I travel a lot - and depend on yelp for guidance. Any negative reviews of Sangam are from people who go to chain restaurants. I've been a patron for years - Favorite place near the lake. If you love Indian, you will love Sangam!"}
{"text":"My team and I had a very good experience at Sangram Indian Cuisine.

We are from out of town and looking for some Indian food and this place was highly rated.  We stupidly went on February 14th thinking it was just another day and not Valentines day so when we walked in we were a little surprised to be asked if we had a reservation.

We obviously didn't thinking it was just a 'normal Wednesday' and were expecting to be turned away.  We were told to hold on just a minute and the waiter came back and told us we could have a table and would be served.  We thought that was pretty cool.

The staff was extremely friendly and very attentive even though we were the only people there 'not on a date' :0)

Overall the food was very good, very flavorful, although not terribly spicy even though I asked for 'Indian spicy'

I would definitely visit again if I'm ever back in the area.  Check them out!"}
{"text":"When you know grandma is in the back cooking, it's definitely legit. Good eats, good service, small space. I recommend the samosa, garlic naan, chicken vindaloo, chicken tikka & scallop masala. Can't go wrong with anything. Haven't tried their \"Indian\" hot but I hear it's HOT HOT HOT. Good luck."}
{"text":"Im going to have to go with three stars on this and its not bc of the main dishes.  It is due to the fact the buffet was missing different types of naan and rita. My two favorite things to have and neither had options. 

Overall. Good food though.  I will be back since it is an office favorite."}
{"text":"Love their food. Nice people and the food is always good. Have been going there for over 10 years and will continue.  Thanks Sangam!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food ever!  I have been coming here for a few years now, usually the lunch buffet.  Sangam has more variety of fresher food than other Indian buffets.  They always have at least 4-5 types of meats and rotating vegetable dishes. Their okra is outstanding, as is their onion chutney.  They have lots of lentil,'potato and spinach dishes as well as chicken tikka masala, some type of Corey or chicken korma, meatballs, and tandoori chicken.  This is the one place where I am a pig and get another plate at least 3 times."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for the lunch buffet. Normally I am not a fan of buffets but this is more of an upscale buffet: the tables are covered in white linen and the wait staff is very courteous and responsive. As for the food: best Indian food I have ever had next to my neighbors homemade Indian. The tandoori chicken is unbelievable and all of the veggie dishes are phenomenal. Very spicy but not over seasoned. Not a place for kids ( too spicy and more formal) but for a luncheon I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the Charlotte area!  Try the Chicken Tikka Masala and Keema Naan with lamb."}
{"text":"The best Indian food you will find in the Lake Norman area. I love the lunch buffet which goes until 2:30 pm, $9.99 per person which includes a variety of options including vegetarian and desserts."}
{"text":"Decided to go for an Indian Buffet. I didn't have my hopes up because of the fiasco at Mint and was not sure if there will be a good Indian Restaurant in the area. 

Surprising, Sangam was good. Overall the ambience was good, the servers were and the food was good too.  The naan was dripping with ghee and most of the curries had tons of oil. Just the way I like it. ;)

The highlight of the day was Mango Pudding. It was freaking amazing.

Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"the BEST Indian food, superb service, lots of good veg options on the menu AND on the daily buffet."}
{"text":"Amazing food, outstanding service. Since becoming vegan I've had to venture outside of my old staples, burgers and pizza and a friend brought me to Sangam's. Food is consistently outstanding with fresh flavors and they definitely know how to bring the heat! Prices for diner get a bit pricey for one but I always make up for it with the lunch buffet which has solid rotations on a daily basis. If you like Indian food this is a must try in the LKN area."}
{"text":"A very nice assortment of choices at their lunch buffet today and everything was very good. Friendly staff and good service, kept our ice teas and waters filled."}
{"text":"Fine Indian Dinning!  Smart, smart, SMART Service!  Last Saturday Night, Nothing was stopping me from finally eating at this place!  The Police, Traffic Jams in Charlotte and more on I-77 if my car broke down I made a Hitchhikers sign (you can see it in my photos I really made one!  I called Friday to make sure they were still opened and for reservations.  From my experience with that phone conversation I had GREAT feeling about this place!

I Love Great Indian food!  This meal started with the ground Chickpea thin Crackers and a Fantastic Mint, Cilantro, Onion, Citrus Sauce (this is the best of these I remember having anywhere).  The waiter brought me a menu and I interrogated him on Masala Chai (I'm picky about almost everything and I know what I like, most of the time).  He brought me a cup of Masala Chai and gave me few minutes to see how I liked it.  It was too weak!  He took it back and spiced it up a little more.  This attention to detail impresses me.  The Chai was still too weak, so I'll know not to get it next time!  While the Chai was not flavorful enough for me it was better than most, although I have not reviewed any of those places yet and probably will not!

Soup!  Here is where the servers get to begin showing me how intuitive and smart they are!  I asked about two of the soups and my server could tell I wanted both so he offered to bring me a half order of each!  Smart!  The lentil Soup was very good though I expected a more complex flavor since this is an Indian Restaurant.  Anyway if this had been Lentil Soup from any other culture I would give it 5 yelp stars.  The Tomato Soup was way better and probably my second favorite soup from any Indian Restaurant ever.  Tomato Soup here gets an easy five stars!

The Naan (Garlic) was an easy 5 yelp stars!  Probably the best Naan and Best Garlic Bread of any kind I have ever eaten!  If you have never had Fresh Naan it is a \"flat\" Bread fluffier than most Pita and almost all Indian Restaurants make it fresh and serve it hot!

Chicken Tikka Masala is an Entree I order at many Indian Restaurants and when it is Fantastic it is something special!  At Sangam their Chicken Tikka Masala had a very fine flavor.  Rich and Creamy of course yet the spice combination they used made it more flavorful than almost all I have tasted before!  If their version is not the best I have ever tasted it is a TIE for first place! 

Kulfi is my favorite Indian Dessert when it is a good one!  These were the largest regular portions I have ever been served and the Mango was a tie for the best, Mango version 5 yelp stars!  The Pistachio Kulfi was better than good and better than most though not great.

This is a nice looking place on the inside and intimate about 36 seats not counting a small bar.  The configuration of the interior made it seem cozy and private!"}
{"text":"We discovered Sangam during a trip last summer before moving here, and are happy to say it has become our \"go to\" choice for great Indian cuisine! We have experienced many places and only a few rise to the top, as is the case with Sangam. Not only is the food exceptional, but the service has always been prompt, attentive and very welcoming! 

This is clearly an establishment that cares about it's customers and extends this attitude in everything they do!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Three things make a dining experience excellent. Service, food quality, and ambiance.  They have it all!!!  Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Best food, best service, best value!!! Cant go wrong with Sangam. Lunch buffet is awesome!! Several options for vegetarians. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Good food, OK service. Tasty food, and the Kashmiri naan is amazing. But - I feel it is expensive for what you get, and the service is not quick. So, if you're looking to be out of this restaurant within an hour, either go during the lunch buffet, or order your food take out."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night, the food was absolutely delicious! We had the lamb Logan Josh and curry chicken (hot!) So good I couldn't stop! Super service will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. The food was excellent spiced perfectly and mango pudding for desert  was 6 stars"}
{"text":"Best Indian in the area, everything is made fresh and even the mango pudding is made with real mangoes in the morning by the cook not even using cornstarch. Service is really friendly this place is been here for a long time they deliver a quality product at a fair price. Every day is a lunch buffet and it's fabulous. I think it's like 12 to 2. If you can't get out to pick up the take out they have a delivery service that so don't let that stop you!"}
{"text":"Best indian food ive had in the 704 area. But the staff and customer service is what makes it one of the best restaurants in the 704 area"}
{"text":"Went there expecting a buffet from the review here, but I should mention the buffet is for lunch only. Also, they recommend recommend making reservations for dinner.

It is a very quaint little place with lots of charm. The staff is awesome and accommodating. Our kids requested some white rice as an appetizer (not on the menu and had no idea they would request it) but they brought out a huge plate of rice for them that they loved. 

The food was excellent. The chicken korma was awesome. The seafood biryani was delicious. 

That said, I shall now dedicate the rest of the review to the Carrot Pudding...

Please god, why have you allowed me to go this long without ever tasting carrot pudding? I am now obsessed with it and looking up recipes at home. Its like someone took carrots, mixed it with liquid amazing and spread it on Mila Kunis. 

Overall, well worth the experience, will be returning."}
{"text":"First time but trusted the reviews. Good thing we did!  The tikka masala, chicken vindaloo and the chicken biryani were amazing. The staff was very fast and accommodating. I wanted to try a sauce the way they eat it, so he made me an extra sauce. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sangam is a very quiet restaurant with peaceful music playing. The set up is very fancy and I love how nice everyone is. The chicken curry w/ rice is really good and so is the spicy stir fry noodles. My favorite of it all is the Mango Lassi. If you are nearby, definitely go and try the Mango Lassi!! It's so amazing!!"}
{"text":"Went to Sangam after a disappointing visit to Mint last week. This place is good- good ambience, good chicken, hot and fresh Nan and fantastic mango pudding. Overall, the best so far in this area."}
{"text":"The Lamb Vindaloo is the best I've had, and I've had some pretty darn good Lamb Vindaloo.  I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was amazing And I couldn't believe the price ! I will definitely be a regular here and be recommending friends and family."}
{"text":"Great.  Food was, in general, quite tasty and (fairly) cheap.  The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly.  

Two negatives (and these are minor - wow I wish Yelp had a 4.5 star choice) - the Tandoori chicken my dining partner ordered was a bit on the dry side. And my Veggie Masala was not spicy (despite my ordering hot - yes, I know I'm Anglo, let me suffer if I'm dumb enough to order it hot).

I'd still recommend it and frankly, will probably be going back before I leave NC."}
{"text":"Takeout. 
We got the paneer makhani and the chicken tikka masala, and asked for spicy, and they were a good spice level. The paneer was a little scarce in the paneer makhani, maybe 4-5 pieces in a whole dish. The chicken tikka was enough meat, and you could tell it was actually cooked in the tandoor and white meat, unlike other restaurants that just use dark meat or saut√©ed meat in their chicken tikka. We also got aloo tikki, not a huge fan, it didn't taste fresh. Onion chutney, raita all good too. My main reason for not 5 stars was definitely the naan. It was extremely stretchy, and just didn't taste fresh. My wife wanted to order Indian literally to just have some fresh naan that was soft and buttery, this naan was stretchy, chewy, tough, and just not good. Because the entrees were good, we'll probably
give it another try and just hope the naan will be better next time?"}
{"text":"I've been here often-dine in or carry out it's always great. Tonight (Thursday) it was very busy including a group of 40 in their adjoining dining room. Not a blip, everything arrived spot on. If you like authentic Indian cuisine this is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Great small quaint place. I got the combo dinner meal it was just the right amount for one person seeking variety!  Good service. I would love to go back."}
{"text":"I ate here today with a group from work, and it was pretty freakin' good. I am a connoisseur of Indian buffets. Or maybe \"connoisseur\" is too strong of a word, as I love every Indian buffet. Even the shady ones.

But let me clarify, after that disclaimer - this was not a shady Indian buffet. The vegetable pakoras might have been the best ones I've ever had in my whole, entire life. Also, I am positive that the mango pudding was made by angels. I kind of needed privacy to be able to eat it. It was that good."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant!  Definitely worth the drive from Mooresville.  We love the kachumber salad, the corn/chicken soup, garlic naan, veggie samosa, chicken tikka masala, and chicken biryani. Service is consistently excellent. Great wines. Easy location off 1-77.  Definitely in our top five favorite NC restaurants."}
{"text":"Phenomenal staff, service, atmosphere and food! Small, cozy and a warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"Such a great place. The food is phenomenal and you can make this a special night out or hit their lunch buffet. It's all good and definitely a gem in the area."}
{"text":"Been to Sangam a number of times and it has always been good.  This is a mash up of all of my visits because everything is consistent.  

Service is very timely in all aspects.   Once you are sat they are very observant in getting your drink order, knowing when to come back to take your order and checking on you while dining.  Nothing over the top but again just consistently good.  

Food here is done well.  Good quality food with portions that just the right size.  Somasas are a great appetizer to start with.  They are vegetarian and come in 2's (Good sized portions).  I usually get the Lamb Rogan Josh and the flavor and portions are on point.  I usually get the medium heat and it builds over time.  Again nothing too bad.  

Atmosphere is nice and comfortable.  It's intimate but casual which makes for a nice evening.  

I like it and have repeated often."}
{"text":"The food and service was great. We shared four different dishes and all were favorites."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food. We have loved everything we ordered here. We have only done carryout but service has been friendly and prompt. The servers even offered us a soda while we waited for our to be prepared. Will be back over and over again."}
{"text":"What happened to flavor?

My wife and I have been visiting nearly every Indian place in and around Charlotte (along with other areas) and while there are still a few we've not gone to I must say this place has been the worst.  

I cannot put my finger on what is wrong nor why there are so many great reviews.  I'm not a hater... I love Indian food and wanted them to be great.  The buffet was limited and nothing had flavor.  Things that should have been soft were hard and things that should have been hard were soggy.

In every way it was less than par and cannot recommend it."}
{"text":"Authentic Indian food. Second time here. First time was for dinner. Always order chicken saag with garlic naan. This time I came on a Saturday morning for buffet. It was good and fresh. Mostly vegetarian options. Buffet was small but had a good selection. They had the saag without meat and it was still delicious. The waiters are very attentive and never let your cup get dry. Very professional staff.  It's a hidden gem and I enjoy dining her."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried the lunch buffet but we both thought it was exceedingly bland which is surprising for an Indian restaurant. The price was ok but there's really nothing spectacular.  Service was normal, no complaint there.  I was just really surprised that Indian food could be so flavorless.  My wife is usually complaining about the Indian food being too spicy (hot) but this time even she said it was bland.  Too bad.  We just moved here and this is the closest Indian food to our house.  They have dumbed down the flavors too much. :("}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant.  The setting is quaint but relaxed.  I enjoy trying new dishes and have liked everything I have tried.  If your new to Indian food, I'd suggest the \"dinner for two\" option as a good choice. This provides a great way to try the best that this restaurant has to offer."}
{"text":"I went here again twice, after my first not-so-good-experience.

They were friendly both the times. Definitely, I saw smile on the faces and greetings when I entered. That's what one needs in addition to sumptuous meal, right? The lunch buffet is great. It's perfect for the price, and in fact much better.

I am a Pescetarian. It's hard to find fish on the lunch buffet however I am content with the varieties in the veg curries they had. On the Sunday lunch, I enjoyed the pakoras. The cabbage/potato curry was perfectly spiced up. That made me ask for few paper napkins but the taste was worth it. 

The taste and spices in all the veg curries were as expected. I think they make good curries.

This is a great place to have a lunch buffet if you are around Lake Norman area."}
{"text":"Delicious food, courteous staff. They are extremely helpful with gluten free and dairy free restrictions."}
{"text":"Our dinner here was delicious. A group of 4 of us were seated right away, and had a lovely dinner. The waiter was very attentive and kept our waters full and our stomachs happy. 

We ordered the onion & paneer naan to start with, and it was incredible. It came with a refreshing yogurt sauce, which had just the perfect amount of kick to it. A double order was the right amount for 4 of us. I ordered the Palak Paneer (medium), and I can say as a tried and true Palak Paneer connoisseur, this was some of the best I have ever had. The spinach was definitely the star of the dish, without being overpowering. My husband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, and also really loved it. It was a bit more tomato-y than what we're used to, but in the end I think we both preferred it this way. We also tasted the Chicken Korma, which was a little less heavy, less spicy, and also awesome.

To top it off, we got a discount for checking in on yelp! If we lived closer, we'd be in ALL the time!"}
{"text":"The best Indian food we've had in a long time along with excellent customer service. Specializing in Northern Indian cuisine the dishes were presented in a fresh and flavorful variety. We started with samosas and mango lassi and continued on to the chicken tikka masala and the chicken kabob. Our server added the saag paneer which was the housemate speciality and incredibly tasty. The naan was tender and light while the rice have enough bulk to hold sauces. Bonus they also serve Haywards 5000. Hubby ordered mango pudding for dessert and was pleased while I opted for a tasty sweet milky chai tea. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Love the lamb rogan josh!! This is the place that got me hooked on Indian cuisine! The atmosphere is quite fancy and the staff is always well dressed."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and we wanted to try this place.  We had dinner with our family and it was very good.  The staff and owner were very pleasant and attentive to our needs.  We will be back again.

Thank you so much."}
{"text":"Indian food is one of my favorites, and fortunately Sangam didn't disappoint. I ordered the mixed veggie dish but don't remember the name of it, but it was fantastic.  I always order my heat level at 5 (I like it hot).  The service was great and the atmosphere was friendly."}
{"text":"Only like my 4th Indian cuisine experience and this is the first I have enjoyed.  They have a great buffet and a great atmosphere. I look forward to going back. The rating would have been 5 stars if I knew if it was truely traditional."}
{"text":"This by far is our favorite Indian food!!! By the time you leave not only are you completely full, but you honestly feel like family! 5 stars from me and my entire family!!"}
{"text":"An excellent place to experience Indian food.
I went for the medium spicy option, but I guess I could had gone for the full blast!  I tried one of the samplers, and it was great!

Looking forward to go back and keep trying other dishes!  Don't forget to try the Mango Kulfi!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, well seasoned full dishes, excellent basmati rice as hot or mild as you like.  Really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Best indian cuisine in north Charlotte. Their lunch buffet is the best combinations, fresh flavors, and spice. Be sure to try the saag paneer, chicken dishes, and mango pudding."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of taking my family here recently.  My parents are not too adventurous when it comes to non \"American\" food (their idea of eating adventurous is General Tso's chicken :-D), so it was a real treat to introduce them to some of the best Indian food I've had in the Charlotte area.  We were there on a busy weekend, so had called ahead for a reservation, and when we arrived (there were 6 of us), they had a table set for us and quite promptly seated us.

From there, unfortunately, service was not as prompt.  They had a large party in the next room over, and they tended to focus more on them; to the extent that one time to get drinks I had to go find our server.  They were apologetic about that, and beyond that, I feel the service was decent, not the best I've had there, but given the business of the evening and the fact that we had nowhere really to go, it wasn't that big of a deal.  The restaurant is tucked away in a town square-esque shopping mall and doesn't have that much seating, so it was fairly easy to flag someone down if we needed them.

The food here is outstanding, and the real reason to visit.  My wife and I are visiting India for our Honeymoon later this year, and for all of the research we've done about the food and culture, Sangam gets it right.  One of the great things that they offer is varying levels of spice for all of their dishes, so even though you may want a Vindaloo   (traditionally a hot dish), they can make it mild for you.  The alternative is that when they say Indian Hot, they really mean Indian Hot.  My brother (who I've mentioned in previous reviews is a bit of a heat fanatic) got the Chicken Vindaloo Indian Hot.  He was visibly sweating halfway through eating it, but thouroughly enjoyed it.  

Their menu has enough of a variety that whatever your taste preference, they have something for you.  They even have a pretty good vegetarian listing; not the most extensive that I've seen, but given that they focus on Northern Indian curry's and tandoori dishes, that's to be expected.

Everyone in my family left quite satiated, and for my less than adventurous parents, it was an eye-opening experience to some of the true tastes and flavors of eating Indian cuisine.  The best part about it is that for the quantity of food you get (including essentially unlimited basmati rice!), the price isn't too bad at all.  It's right in line with a moderately up-scale Lake Norman area restaurant, but for the quality and quantity of food you get it's an excellent value.  Definitely a place to recommend for someone looking for something a little different for a lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the food as an Indian vegetarian. My partner and I had ordered the Veg Vindaloo which wasn't bad and Gobi Manchurian which unfortunately was. We had a coupon, which was applied manually on the bill. The restaurant has a comforting vibe, nostalgic Hindi music and friendly service. I liked the ambiance more that the food."}
{"text":"I've been to this place two times, both times for the lunch buffet since it's so close to work. I always leave feeling satisfied and wishing I would have more room in my tummy to eat more.
Let me start off by saying that the tandoori chicken reminds me of what we get back home. The drumsticks are small, hence get well marinated, and are still very juicy. I wish I could find out where they buy their chicken from because it's so different than the drumsticks we get at the grocery stores. I also like their chaat (the chickpeas thing they keep with the salads). The chicken curry that they have (not chicken tikka, the other light yellow one which I forget the name of) is downright delicious, especially when paired with the jeera rice, as are the beef meatballs. I do wish they would have some goat or lamb dish on the buffet though. Then again, I've never been here on weekends and they very well might have it then. For people who are familiar with Indian food, they do have amrakhand here. They call it \"mango pudding,\" but it really is amrakhand. Which, by the way is delicious! Since amrakhand is one of my favorite desserts, I never get around to trying their kheer which I assume must be great as well.

Service is good, servers make sure to keep your drinks full. It does get a little crowded to get to the buffet if you are in the room on the right after you enter and have to weave through tables, but I would say it's soooo worth it!

Oh and they play all the songs from the 70's which make me really nostalgic because I used to love listening to my parents' records (yes, records) of these songs back home."}
{"text":"We stopped here one Sunday for lunch. It's a quant little space with an upscale feel. We were quickly greeted after walking in and seated. We opted for the lunch buffet. They had the classics as well as some items I'd never tried before. They also had a salad and dessert area on their lunch buffet as well, a nice surprise. I didn't try one thing that wasn't good. Our waiter was prompt and friendly and best of all when we got out check we saw the lunch buffet was only $10!"}
{"text":"We stopped through after I picked my mom and sister up from the airport and enjoyed our meal.  I had a mango lasse, garlic naan, and the tandoor shrimp and chicken kebobs and thought the chicken was a little dry but good. It came with veggies,  which was nice. 
Spice/heat was Indian level spiced.

Two issues: one of our waiters poured water refills resting the pitcher in the rim of the already used cup (gross). I saw a yelp coupon upon check in,  but they had issues applying it to our bill.  Hmm

I would eat here again,  but nothing I'll remember."}
{"text":"Wife and I really like this place. Is our date night place.  Staff is outstanding and the food is out of sight.  It also a place to take friends. Love it."}
{"text":"Best Indian cuisine in North Charlotte. Never disappoints. Every appetizer and entree we have tried has been stellar. Service is always good as well."}
{"text":"The Lamb Rogan Josh was very good and we had Samosa for the app very good. The service was excellent, will definitely go again"}
{"text":"Sangam is a great place for Indian food.  Service is very good, and the food is perfectly spiced to your taste.  They also have some of the best naan I have ever had - piping hot and freshly made every time. The Chicken Tikka Masala and Shrimp Korma are our favorite entrees - we want to branch out, but can't bring ourselves to get anything different!  They recently freshened up the dining room with new paint and pictures for an even nicer atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a solid restaurant with a great take home menu. The butter chicken and naan are on point. I have generally received almost double what the amount of rice needed. Great little hidden gem."}
{"text":"We visited with some friends and overall was just ok. The service was really good, server was really polite and attentive. We ordered pakoras and samosas, both we great! I had the chicken vindaloo and it was just ok. The flavor tasted more like tomato sauce, expected it to have more flavor. Also the potatoes weren't cooked all the way, still hard. And personally I like places that give you lots of sauce and there just wasn't enough to cover the rice and dip naan. Overall was just ok, not my favorite in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service! 

I've been eating here for the past year with great food each time. I took my dad and his girlfriend here when they were in town. They had never had Indian food before. My dad was convinced he would hate it. But I knew the place was good enough to convert them. They wound up loving the flavorful food. 

Why not 5 stars? It's pricey. Chicken tikka masala (a standard) is $14! Add some garlic naan, and it's almost twenty bucks."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Sangam... and I cannot believe I have not already posted my review for it!  I have been coming to the lunch buffet for years, and while my office isn't always close, the drive is always worth it! I have tried a few other Indian Buffets around charlotte and nothing seems to ever compare! Their food is always fresh, hot, and there is always plenty of each dish! I typically enjoy the buffet because I am not always sure of what I love when it is spelled out on the dinner menu, however I have been in once or twice for dinner and the staff is always very helpful! I have also ordered takeout for dinner and I would suggest you give a little extra time for the pickup as it seems to take a bit longer than they originally commit to at ordering."}
{"text":"My wife and I are from Illinois but visit Charlotte three times a year. Whenever we are here, we must dine here as often as we can. They have the best buffet and service imaginable. The food has such wonderful flavors and before you say have you tried the restaurants on Devon in Chicago, the answer is yes, of course. But nothing beats Sangam."}
{"text":"This lunch buffet was very good! The place is clean and the staff is efficient and friendly. When we saw they didn't have any naan at the buffet, a waiter offered to bring us some whenever it come from the kitchen. I love the veggie korma even though some of the veggies seemed like they were frozen and not fresh before cooking. It did have fresh broccoli, though. The Chana masala was amazing and so was the naan. We appreciated the selection."}
{"text":"It's pretty easy to find pretty good Indian food in most places throughout the US. Having grown up on homemade Indian cuisine, it's harder to find GREAT Indian food - but Sangam Indian Cuisine was definitely great! We ordered take out and went with only vegetarian options. The samosas' filling filling was flavorful and the shells were crunchy but not hard - obviously fresh and very delicious! We also had the Gobi Manchurian and the Vegetable Masala - both dishes were the perfect combination of colors, flavors, and most importantly - spiciness! I was asked when placing my order for the desired level of heat on a 5-point scale and asked for a 3-4 range - the food was spot on! The rice was aromatic and cooked properly, and we ordered onion and paneer kulcha and garlic naan - warm and flavorful without overpowering the main dishes. The order was also ready in the time frame quoted (20-25 min). All-in-all: a very good first-time experience, and will definitely order from here again and consider dining in."}
{"text":"I cannot express how much I love this place!  Everything is excellent and the service is always wonderful!  They have a buffet for lunch, but I prefer to order off the menu. You cannot go wrong here!"}
{"text":"We've tried Sangam many times over the past three years. The buffet is consistently terrible-- the dishes are watery and salty and bland. We eat and cook a lot of Indian food and you're much better off driving into  Charlotte or Mooresville (Zaika on morrison plantation Rd is our favorite) for a buffet. Every time we've ordered off of the menu for dinner though, it's been pretty good (but expensive). The staff is very friendly, but steer clear of the buffet."}
{"text":"We finally made it to Sangam last Saturday for the lunch buffet! My only regret is waiting so long to make the trip up from Mount Holly! I can't wait until this weekend to take the kids for the buffet! I know they'll be thrilled after looking so long for great indian food after our move from Virginia!!"}
{"text":"It's very difficult for me to say this, but this restaurant was hands-down the best I have ever had in the USA. The food tasted amazing, not very greasy or spicy, piping hot despite being a buffet, very friendly staff and a spick and span place. There were many vegetarian and vegan options too. 
Overall, I am happy that it was well spent fo meal"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and value. I frequent this establishment for their lunch buffet with co-workers. It is very conveniently located off 77, and because it is a lunch buffet, we can get in and out quickly."}
{"text":"I ordered carry out online, and my food was waiting for me on time as soon as I arrived. I had the groan josh curry lamb which was out of this world- I haven't had curry this good in a long time! I paired some spicy achar and garlic naan with my dish which complimented it very well. I highly reccomend adding achar to your order if you are having curry- it adds a whole new dimension of flavor.
This place is definitely worth the 15 minute drive. I will be ordering from there again!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here for the lunch buffet and have had take out. The food is always really good. I bounced between 3-4 stars. I'm going with 3 because having lived in Silicon Valley, I've had some really amazing Indian food on the cheap. If we are ordering here, we are spending a good amount after all the extras. If it were a little less expensive, we would probably order from here more often. Still, I'm glad to have a decent Indian restaurant in close proximity."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! So glad I found them because I've been craving Indian food since we moved from Asheville, and I had my go-to there (mela). 

Everything was great. Flavorful and plenty of options. There was lots of little desserts to choose from too! 

Such a perfect spot to take someone who loves Indian food."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian restaurant in the area. Sunday brunch is definitely the best time to come :) it's always packed so be prepared to wait ... But it's definitely worth the wait !!!

Most interesting thing to note is that you will hardly ever see any Indians here, mainly due to their menu as they are heavy on the meats and also serve beef ! Their beef ball korma is truly to die for :) and I loved their chicken tikka as well ! 

Bottom line great Indian food, full of flavor and spice minus the \"it's so spicy it's burning my tongue \" sensation typical of many other Indian restaurants, where they compensate for low quality ingredients with hot spices. If you are the adventurous type this is definitely the place for you :)"}
{"text":"Amazing. Great service and great food. If you want Indian food, this is the place to go in Lake Norman."}
{"text":"Went in for wine and appetizer and was not disappointed.  Service was quick and the staff was pleasant. The glass of Shiraz was delightful and went well with the appetizers. Ordered the vegetable spring rolls and the assorted appetizer for two.  Both were delicious.  Great place for a quiet intimate atmosphere.  Buffet is available for some meals.  I can't wait to return for dinner!"}
{"text":"Damn, I hate to give out these \"fives!\"

But, I gotta.

Two superb entrees, one of which had more HOT than I expected, but was exactly the  way I ordered it.  Two great beers and service that is about as good as it gets -- an incredibly good-natured, knowledgeable, and nice fellow.  Also, very quick and efficient.

We'll be back. In fact, we may alter travel plans to do so.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We had a very bad experience at a previous Indian restaurant, and have been turned off from them ever since. But that was over four years ago in New York, so we figured it was time to try again. It's not like we would get sick from two different Indian places right? Luckily we were not only right but kicking ourselves for this delicious cuisine that we have been missing out on. I can't compare Sangam to other Indian restaurants, but I can say that whatever we were eating was downright delicious!

Sangam is a tiny, quiet little restaurant that offers a relaxed, intimate experience. Our server was extremely friendly and made suggestions since this was basically our first time eating Indian food. After placing our order they came out with the complimentary \"bread\" basket, but it was more like a cracker. I don't know what exactly it was, but it came with a mint jelly that neither of us really cared for. I tried to not eat too much of it because I was awaiting the arrival of the precious naan.

We ordered a serving of garlic naan ($3.95) and were not disappointed. This light, garlicy bread was simply to die for. It almost tasted like a pizza dough, with it's soft consistency. Man I could have eaten like five orders of that wonderful stuff by myself but there was more Indian goodness to come.

For an entree I ordered the Lamb Rogan Josh ($14.95), as was suggested by the server. I got it with medium heat and the curry had the perfect spice to it...hot enough to \"feel\" it but not too hot to be inedible. The lamb was tender with that fresh, gamey taste I enjoy and it melded really well with the curry. The entrees are all served with a giant bowl of basmati rice that is shared family style with the whole table, and that rice was super good mixed in with the curry.

My wife ordered the Shrimp Masala ($16.95) which was also suggested by the server, and once again he didn't steer us wrong. The shrimp were cooked perfectly but the star of the dish was the sauce. It's this rich, creamy tomato sauce that was insanely addictive. I had a hard time controlling myself to not steal more of her precious sauce as I enviously watched her devour it. 

For dessert we split an order of the carrot pudding ($3.75.) It may sound weird but it was really wonderful and I highly recommend it. The carrot is cooked down and served warm in a mushy consistency and  was topped with a scoop of ice cream. This thing was simply insane and funky and unique. As long as you like carrot I suggest you save room to try this bad boy out if you go.

Sangam saved us and brought us a renewed faith in Indian cuisine. The food and service are excellent and it's definitely a warm place for new-comers to curries and other Indian eats. I can guarantee that we will be back here again for more."}
{"text":"Being an Indian my reviews are going to be very different from what you would read otherwise. The food isway too westernized. I have had much better Indian food in US. What annoys me the most is when I specifically requested the food to be made to suit Indian spice palate.. What I got in return was bland food with no distinct Indian spices. For the price I paid for a meal I am sure I will never go back again"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Sangam. Not only is service beyond impeccable and efficient, the food is just simply amazing. There is something on the menu for everyone. From vegetarians, to spice lovers and also very mild creamy fiends, if you appreciate Indian cuisine this lovely restaurant will never disappoint."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is delicious and has a great variety of food for buffet. Not too spicy and mostly mild spicy yet very flavorful. Meat is very juicy. I've had bette Indian food for sure, but for the general lake Norman area, this is very good. Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants ever! The lunch buffet is the time to go if you're not sure what you want or if you want a little of everything! I seriously cannot decide what my favorite dish is. The staff is so friendly and nice! Go now!"}
{"text":"Food was great and the staff was very attentive. They got slammed with customers which they were not expecting so service was slow but the food was amazing and the staff was very apologetic and were sincere. Will definitely come back when we are visiting the area."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon because I was seriously craving Indian food. I was with my best friend who had never had Indian food and I was so excited that I picked such a great place for her first time. 

The decor is beautiful and very appropriate. We were seated almost immediately upon arrival and decided to have the lunch buffet. Not only was it a great price ($10!) but it was very delicious. My friend is a vegetarian and they had plenty of options for her to enjoy. The naan was incredible and I got it as soon as it came out, yum! The mango pudding was good too, I would've like it a little colder, but no complaints here.

I'll definitely be back for dinner to try their chicken tikka masala and other signature dishes."}
{"text":"We had an awesome experience with take out. The app was easy to order off of and it was ready in record time. The food was fresh and we loved both dishes we had ordered. My husband and I are a bit of Indian snobs, especially after living in England and eating the best there is. This place did a classy job at a reasonable price. The coupon on yelp honestly pulled us in but the quality, friendliness, and atmosphere when we were picking up dinner is what would bring us back.

I will say, if I had to nitpick, the take out portion sizes are a bit smaller than your average to gos. Considering they do a buffet, it might be more economical to eat in. Just be aware, as always, if you have any allergies (like mine with gluten), that cross contamination is likely."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant that I hold as a standard to which all other Indian restaurants should aspire. None other will fit the bill. Sangam is the best. 

First off: the buffet. Most other Indian restaurants serve yesterday's leftovers. If Sangam does thus, then they've fooled me! The buffet is always fresh and delicious, with no signs of dying under a heat lamp. Even the naan is made in small batches, so it's always oven-fresh. 

Also, if you abandon a dish at your table whilst going for seconds (or thirds...) at the buffet, you will always return to your table to find your used dish cleared, and your water glass refilled. The service here is impeccable. Attentive, yet you never feel as though your waiter is hovering. They are refreshingly discreet and intuitive.

And now, on to the dinner entrees:

The lamb rogan josh is out of this world. My fianc√© loves the chicken tikka masala. And no meal, vegetarian or not, is complete without the vegetable korma. Their naan bread is above reproach; spend the extra 45 cents and upgrade to the garlic naan. It's worth it! I love the tamarind chutney (ask for it specifically, it's not on the sauce list); the mint chutney is memorable as well. 

Although the dinner entrees are significantly higher-priced than the buffet might lead one to believe, TRUST me, they're worth it. The buffet is quite good...but the dinner is exceptional. Only first-hand experience can illustrate the difference. 

To conclude your meal, the mango lassi is a sweet-tart delight. But, since I am only lucky enough to be near this restaurant in Oct and Nov, I spend most of my year dreaming of the kheer. It's a milky rice pudding, served cold. But Sangam flavors their version with a light touch of cardamom and rosewater. The result is a subtle nuance of flavor, the delicacy of which I have never experienced before or after. I have sought this flavor in countless other Indian restaurants, and have failed to find the equilibrium of sweetness, texture, and fragrance that Sangam (seemingly effortlessly) achieves.

If I sound over-indulgent...good. They deserve it. Please, Sangam, don't ever change!"}
{"text":"Today was my first day here. The food was absolutely delicious. Talk about so much flavor!! The service was quick and nice and the restaurant was simply decorated and really clean! Such amazing food."}
{"text":"Went to Sangam twice while visiting the area, and was very happy both times.  I sampled a number of dishes at their lunch buffet as well as the Mulligatawny soup and chicken Saag at dinner.

The food was well spiced (a bit milder at the lunch buffet, but I completely understand that), cooked perfectly, and not sweetened or \"Americanized\".  The only complaint whatsoever that I have about the food is that it was just a bit salty, but not a big issue.  It was also very fairly priced (especially the $9 buffet), and the service was friendly, professional, and prompt.

I highly recommend, including for those who also like good Indian and Asian foods, and I would certainly go back!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that I'm still somewhat of a newcomer to Indian food.  A friend at work got me to try Nirvana II near the office for lunch once and that good experience got me started.  Turns out that I've become a big fan of the flavor profiles overall.

Sangam is near home and I learned they had a lunch buffet.  What better way to try more varieties of a new to me cuisine!  Other than the basics like veggie masala and tandoori chicken, there's no way I can tell you what I ate by name due to the newcomer deal but, I can tell you that I enjoyed all of it.  Every item I tried on the buffet was delicious, hot (temp not spice) and flavorful.  There are cards above each item letting you know what the dish is, what's in it, spice level, etc.

The service was very attentive with the old plate removed when I went back for seconds, water glass kept full, check brought and processed quickly at the end of the meal.  I love the fact that I can continue lunch visits to Sangam and keep exploring."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good food and great people. I go there all the time. Its slightly on expensive side. Still would recommend it."}
