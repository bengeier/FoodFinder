{"text":"Five star, definitely.  Best soup I have ever had and filled with strictly good stuff.  Smoothie bowl was beautiful AND delish.  My husband had the Bar and Vine smoothie.  Amazing.  This will be our new go-to when we visit Vegas.  Good job!"}
{"text":"First time going here and it's absolutely uhhhmazing! The staff is beyond friendly and super helpful. I will definitely be going back very soon. A must try while downtown."}
{"text":"I went for the first time last week, I had no idea what to order so I told the young man I had a cold that I was fighting off, he suggested me allowing him to make his own recipe for me. He asked if I liked fruits and if I would like it sweet or tangy.. he made me a fruit smoothie with almond milk & I forgot what ingredients exactly, but it tasted great & I like to believe it made my cold go away."}
{"text":"I cannot stress how happy I am and how lucky I feel that Grass Roots Juice Bar is within walking distance of my residence.  The store is beautifully merchandised with just about all of the fruits and veggies and nuts and seeds and flowers that I could possibly be eating/drinking on display just to tantalize me during my wait.  Their produce is as organic as it gets here in Las Vegas.

I had the vegan tortilla soup.  It was a perfect balance of \"creamy\", spicy, hearty, and delicious.  It is impressive that it was made to order within minutes.  Because they want to keep it raw, it is also served at the perfect temperature for a hungry person to devour immediately - albeit at just the right pace to also savor each flavorful spoonful.

I also had the veggieccino.  Once you have this drink, I don't see the point in going back to any sugar-laden version of a chocolate or mocha shake.  It is extremely filling, holds its temperature well (I had the soup first and hoped to make the smoothie last - and it did).  I've also had the mint whatever-its-called coffee smoothie drink that they make, and I love that as well.

I took a to go menu so that I can mark off what I've had and continue trying everything else on the list over the next few weeks.

Owner Shane Stuart has a gift for simultaneously checking in with his staff on the juice line, schmoozing with regulars as they come in, and educating newbies.  He makes the art of hospitality look easy and fun.  Too many places in this town - even the ones with good food - forget about that lost art of hospitality and the impact it has on customer experience.

As a fellow small business owner downtown, I wholeheartedly endorse this business.  I hope they open up shop many more places around town.  I hope they inspire the masses to eat more plant-based foods at all times of the day.  I hope they expand their hours here in this location because I get hungry later too ya know.

Thanks for all you do, Shane and Nichole and staff.  Us downtowners love you!"}
{"text":"A downtown gem! When you work downtown and you're limited with choices in healthy decisions to find a place like Grass Roots is a blessing.  Small but quant and helpful staff. Wishing this place a long lasting stay in downtown Vegas. My holy alkaline is amazing and my co-workers watermelon mint with super berry boost in both were a juicing persons dream."}
{"text":"Si l'un d'entre vous passe à Las Vegas, il vous faut absolument faire un stop chez http://grassrootslv.com ! Cet endroit est merveilleux et le staff est incroyablement attentionné ! Leurs produits sont non seulement délicieux mais également excellents pour la santé ! Shots aux huiles essentielles, smoothies et autres sont exquis. N'hésitez pas à leur dire que vous venez de ma part pour bénéficier d'une attention encore plus particulière. #positive #customerservices #powerful #inspiration #mathysmarse"}
{"text":"So lucky to have this place so close to where I work. I could probably eat a gallon of the broccoli \"cheese\" soup. It's so good I can't believe it's vegan. The staff are also very nice. Can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place since we don't have the best healthy alternatives in Las Vegas. First, I was not greeted when I entered today and it wasn't busy. It took a few minutes for someone to finally greet me. The smoothie I got was warm and the soup was room temperature. I drank half of the smoothie and I started to get major heart burn which I rarely get and finally puked while I was driving. I thought that only happened with tequila shots ;). I will stick with making my smoothies at home where it's safe."}
{"text":"Looooove this place! Much more exciting than your typical juice bar. Shane and Nicole have a wonderful, cheerful staff to take your order. It is really warming to have beautiful, smiling faces taking your order.

Grass Roots, unlike most of the cold press juice places, is centered around Vitamix creations. This gives you delicious smoothies packed with vitamins AND fiber. My go-to is the Holy Alkaline for a super refreshing green experience. Also love how many greens are packed into the Chocolate Peanut Butter, and how delicious it tastes.

The often overlooked part of the menu is their soup selections, and I don't know why. Their tortilla soup is completely plant-based, and probably better than any tortilla soup you can order in the city. Sooooo delicious!

Come by Grass Roots to nurture your body and your soul. I'll be back again, and again :)"}
{"text":"AWESOME smoothies. Totally accommodated my weird requests. Super friendly staff, clean place, fantastic energy. I love this place. Come back customer"}
{"text":"Oh, my goodness! So good! My favorite is the Green Ninja. Plus, even though most of their drinks are green, you can get kids to like it! Grass Roots Juice Bar is absolutely the best!"}
{"text":"I had the BUD & VINE smoothie, it took a little while to prepare but I appreciated that actually. It means they are taking care with their ingredients and focusing on making it right and making it fresh. And you know what, I would've waited 30 minutes more! LOL after how amazing it tasted! I wolfed it down so fast...it was one of the most delicious smoothies I'd ever tasted. It's pricey no doubt, but that is because they use fresh, high-quality ingredients and remember, you are getting a well-rounded meal with that smoothie so c'mon, you have to expect to pay for this level of nutrients!  Also, the staff was very friendly and you can tell they take pride in what they do and love it. I have yet to eat here, but I will next time I'm in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Can't get anymore unique, fresh, and delightful for your body and soul!! Love this place, it's on the best block in town! Shane and all of his right hands are incredible and have a heart of gold! 

Thanks again!"}
{"text":"The most friend environment and people. Their attitude was so wonderful. everything is so healthy and delicious. Shane provided the best customer service to the entire group!"}
{"text":"I am so in love with grassroots! I can't get enough of the Mint Capigreeno!
The employees are always super chill and friendly and often have samples.
I have had a lot of smoothies in my day but the ones here are truly mind-blowing. They fill me up and give me a lot of great clean energy for the day.

You gotta try it!!"}
{"text":"I was in town staying on the strip. Woke up feeling like most of us do when on vacation in Vegas. 
Although this is off strip- it's worth every penny to get there and get a juice. The owners were working and they were nice, informative and set me straight.
In fact, I went back the next day again. One of the best I've been to in the country."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch after a hike. In town for the weekend and had read about Grass Roots. Made a special trip downtown to try, as local, organic produce and healthy foods are very important to us. The guy working behind the counter was very knowledgable not only about their products, but about how each juice/smoothie ingredients benefits your body. We actually had a sample of a mint capigreeno while we were trying to decide what to order. It was delicious enough that I would've ordered that, had I not already had an Americano a few hours before. I asked about their nut milks and he assured us they were made in house. He let us sample the almond milk and coconut milk and they were so good and fresh tasting. My husband was skeptical (meat and potato boy) but to my surprise, he ordered the creme de avocate instead of going to Subway . And he was impressed! I ordered the chocolate peanut smoothie and loved them both. I would definitely return next time we are in town. It served as a meal for me, and I was full when I finished. That being said, I would rather spend $10 on a whole foods, organic, nutritious lunch than $10 on an unhealthy option in any other restaurant. For that reason, even though pricey, it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"Beyond amazing!!!!!! Shane and his staff are the greatest people and so knowledgeable anything I have ordered from there is always on point and consistent with the freshest ingredients amazing amazing amazing"}
{"text":"Thought I ordered a juice but got a smoothie. Waited more than 15 mins for it. Costumers who wAlked in after I had ordered got their drinks first and everyone else waiting. Nice people thou. There was a really nice guy who handed me my drink and apologized for to wait. Might give it another try."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and has become a daily tradition. Get the holy grail, add super foods, and thank me later. Shane the owner knows what he's doing when it comes to juice and no place in Nevada does it better than he they do."}
{"text":"When you first walk in it smells like a hippy ' s armpit...holy B.O. but it's a nice looking shop that is clean. I came during a rush (4 people ahead of me) so I waited a few minutes before someone was available to take my order, no problem. 32 minutes later I received my smoothie... kind of a problem, I had to extend my parking meter it took so long.

My suggestion to them would be to get a new POS system and get new staff or retrain. The gentleman working seemed to be in charge and was very nice but they were flustered, disorganized and were making drinks no one ordered or didn't know how to claim. I work in the food industry,  so I sympathize with them during rush periods but they need a better system by either assigning names/numbers to their customers' orders, possibly getting another set of hands to work the register (three people beind me had to wait at least 5 minutes before their order was taken), and have their order tickets be more clear because they were confused on almost all of them. Also, the one girl with long hair should take a servsafe class to know it's not ok to come to work looking like you rolled out of bed and hair all messy, it's not professional.

The smoothie was good although there were a few hard pieces of nuts that we're little surprises with every sip."}
{"text":"Finding this spot goes down as some of the best luck I have had in Vegas.  Friendly folks and healthy, tasty options...good stuff GrassRoots!!"}
{"text":"Tropical basil and the aloe pineapple mint juice are delish! 
Also go for the soups. All are amazing and super filling."}
{"text":"Great place to pick up a refreshing mixture of vegetable blends, fruit blends or a combination. There are whole food idems available also. Have been a loyal visitor since my arrival in Las Vegas this pass February. Please tell Bre(sorry if misspelled) hello and you read this recommendation from Gilbert. Enjoy your visit to GrassRoots"}
{"text":"I've been going to Grassroots for over a year. I much appreciate the science of the mixology, I have always been delighted by the way I feel after drinking their smoothies. My absolute favorite is the \"kickass,\" which is filled with rejuvenating stuff from all over the world! Great job!"}
{"text":"Delicious, filling, organic -- and hands down the best place to grab a to-go lunch in downtown Vegas. GrassRoots soups have amazing flavors with great ingredients. (You know a place has potential when it even thinks through what salt it uses -- in this case, Himalayan salt!) For $8, I can get a soup that satisfies me, and I have a robust appetite. I know someone who likes the Cashew Broccoli Cheeze soup so much that he ordered a bucket for his family's Thanksgiving dinner.

GrassRoots just added pressed juice; I look forward to trying it. This is the first place in the Vegas valley, that I know of, to make juice that is both pressed and organic. Not everything I eat is organic, but avoiding conventional pesticides especially matters in a concentrated juice. There is plenty more on the menu. I am still exploring.

I have never written a Yelp review before today, but am a big GrassRoots fan and have to share. My friends have started coming here, too. And they are starting to give me homework -- try the dirty chai, try the tortilla soup -- because they like it that much!

Edited to add: the staff here is great. Always welcoming. I once spilled my order on the floor -- it was entirely my fault -- and they replaced it with smiles the moment they realized what happened. That kind of hospitality will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"This morning I was craving a healthy refreshing smoothie before work. I decided to try something new for a smoothie/juice. I have been experiencing new places especially downtown and businesses within the downtown project. Today was the perfect day to visit Grass Roots Juice Bar.  This marvelous gem was incredible.  I ordered the \"Holy Alkaline.\" Packed with wellness including; Avocado, Ginger, Green Cabbage, Cucumber, Micro Greens, Coconut Water Or Alkaline Water, Coconut Oil, Kale, stevia, Spinach, Lemon, Wheat grass, this deliciousness was made with love, delivered with excellence.  Shane was very helpful, warm, and welcoming. Service was quick with nothing but smiles from everyone there. This was the best way to start today!!! Hands down, 10 thumbs my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"The chocolate peanut butter smoothie is out of this world.  And the staff is extremely nice and accomodating.  Excellent."}
{"text":"OMG! 
Finally. 
A juice bar that serves fresh REAL LIVE fruits and veggies......
((((((NOTE: this is not your ordinary mall, chain, frozen sweetened fruits from unknown origins-smoothie bar that serve frozen sweetened colored pre mashed yucky stuff.))))

This is the REAL DEAL in VEGAS! Beyond Organic!!!
( California TOP SHELF fruit that the Chefs use on the strip at the top restaurants- From Carrie Klasby (sp?) the intuitive forager.(TIP: Downtown 3rd street farmers market on Fridays FYI )
This is the real deal. Real fresh fruit and vegetables from farms and farmers that are
sourced and brought here directly! 
When you step into the shop you are immediately greeted with an assortment of the most colorful tasty fruits and vegetables found in Vegas. 
So many choices,  including soups!!!
I had the holy grail, and it filled my tummy and made me feel good after a workout. They have an extensive menu- so I will have try them all!!!

TIP: I would call ahead and have your order waiting for pick up...( I haven't tried this yet but the space is tight so this may be a solution to the space issue)

nomnomnomnom"}
{"text":"Super busy today for their first day. Packed so much I could not enter. I noticed big groups, guess they work down here, standing there only to realize only one person out of five were getting an item.....super annoying..... It is SUPER small inside.

I got the Beetaccino and I will def be back all the time since I'm in love with the Carson  building.

Super small location, zero seats but you can sit in the courtyard outside or there are chairs inside the door to the common area. 

Everything is organic and everything came from a local place yesterday and I drank it today.

Would give it a solid three but the drink was soooo good I will throw another star on. I don't see paying $12 something (with tip) everyday for this but I really think it's a good value. I have juicers and Vitamix at home so when I'm lazy I'll walk here.

Come try it for yourself. I posted the menu in the pics."}
{"text":"They make amazing juices that are full of super healthy amazing things!! We had some custom shots made for us and they were very accommodating. Super friendly people and their other customers are really friendly too. Highly recommend this place!! Check out our YouTube video: http://youtu.be/lCcazOsGk5U"}
{"text":"This place rocked my world. Having to be here in the heat; it was a perfect on the go breakfast to keep me revved all morning long for a tradeshow. Nicole and the team were awesome. Holy grail and Ginger in the Grass were my faves. I'll be back in Sept. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Never had a chance to try asked for a special request was told juicer was not working to try pre made juice. Next day was told still not working. Third time was told it was too expensive to just make my request. It was $30 an hour to use and it was not worth it for them!!"}
{"text":"Grass Roots is amazing and has become a weekly ritual even though it is nowhere near my house! Totally worth the drive!!! Shane, one of the owners, is an inspiration for everything charitable he does in the city, as well as his knowledge of healthy eating! I am addicted to the mint capigreeno... Their soups are out of this world! My 9 year old loves everything as well! My only complaint...Please open on Sunday so I can stop by more often!! A girl's gotta eat (and drink) some of the healthiest and yummiest stuff in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Yummy, healthy, goodness.  I love the Creme de Advocate and the Matchaccino.  Mmmm.  Sometimes, when I'm feeling extravagant, I get a smoothie and a juice.  Treat yo self!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing smoothies! Shane's passion is evident in the creations he has made! My favorite is the dirty chai!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The owner Shane knows his sh!t!  I walk in and tell them how I'm feeling and bam, boom! There's a nice healthy drink to get me through the day within minutes sitting in my hand.  I feel great after leaving this place.  Please go there and support this great local business."}
{"text":"Grass roots saved us!  During Life Is Beautiful we discovered this gem and began each morning with a fresh healthy start!  Bud and vine, ginger, chocolate peanut butter...  They're ALL good."}
{"text":"With three women behind the counter, it was odd that I wasn't greeted or addressed in any way for a few minutes. And when I was, it was with a blunt, \"What do you want to order?\" from a blonde with BRF (bitchy resting face).

Went with the beetaccino recommended by Elizabeth B. Beautiful color with some chunks of coffee bean crumbles, but flavor didn't wow me. For $11, it should- everything at Juice Standard does, and they actually smile. 

Service was friendlier to a regular who walked in and striked up conversation with the girls working. They responded pleasantly enough, and it was cool to watch an aloe vera drink being prepared, but the three other (non-regular?) customers were treated as I was, with the bare minimum of eye contact, conversation and service.

My drink was plopped on the counter and Blondie walked away without saying a word. I called out a bright, \"thanks!\" as I picked it up and was treated to a smirk. I added a \"have a nice day?\" for good measure, and got a reluctant, \"yeah you too.\"
Wish I could take back my cash tip.

TIP: Location is tiny and setup is odd. Be careful walking in, as the ordering counter is literally RIGHT inside the door and you might trample someone. Or just end up standing in the doorway awkwardly."}
{"text":"Passed by this tiny place a few times either on my way or to lunch or dinner to the numerous great restaurants on East Fremont thinking one day I will try this juice joint out. Well the day finally arrived and did it meet my expectations, after getting over the sticker shock of how expensive juices/smoothies are (they are high priced everywhere) I learned they are worth the pretty penny you pay. The girl there was so informative and excited to educate the newby in front of her, I realized the quality of ingredients and love that goes into every cup of juice/smoothies. I forgot the name of the smoothie I decided on, it was berry based and so full of goodness and yumm! Can't wait to try the juice they will be serving during Life Is Beautiful, it probably has 8+ antioxidant powders to make you really feel healthy and hopefully clean out all the second hand Mary Jane sniffs that will be lingering at the festival."}
{"text":"This place got my husband and I through our Vegas trip. We went to Vegas for 5 days, and by the third visit, they remembered us! Everything was amazing! The smoothies cured our hangovers and helped us have energy to continue our trip! LOVE LOVE LOVE!"}
{"text":"I've gone to Grass Roots about 4-5 times before to pick up orders for other people, but I've never gotten to try it until recently. As I tried to decide what I was going to finally order for lunch, I was given a sample of their new watermelon cold press. I was blown away at how refreshing it tasted even though it was a little sample cup!

However, I decided on the bud & vine smoothie bowl with granola, raspberries, blackberries, and cashew vanilla sauce. All of their smoothie bowls come with the choice of 3 toppings and 1 sauce. The ingredients all tasted incredibly fresh and the fruits on top tasted amazing, but I don't think it's worth the price of $13 for a 16oz bowl. Maybe I just don't understand the high cost for organic ingredients? I would love to try more of their items since their quality is definitely up there based on the sample cold press and the smoothie bowl, but I think that it's a bit too pricey for my taste.

For parking, there's a 15 minute loading zone that you can park in for free right in front of the store if you're looking to order and dip right away. Otherwise, your best (and cheapest) bet for parking before 6PM would be to park in the meters on 6th street or Carson street for $1 an hour."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite juice/smoothie place in Las Vegas. The Holy Grail is the perfect green smoothie and taste so amazing!!! It is pricey... But you are getting what you pay for! Well worth the price. Super unique set up & the workers are very friendly.

One of my favorite reasons I love this place is because you get to watch them make your drink right in front of you. You know what exactly is going in your drink and you can see how clean they are!! Gotta go!"}
{"text":"I love you guys. Thank you for opening in Vegas and being so knowledgeable and kind. I can't enjoy it as much as I'd like to because of the price point however I come and order through Postmates as often as I can afford. If the prices were more affordable I'd  eat and drink here every day, no doubt. Maybe more options on the kids menu as a suggestion. I'd love to see Bud and Vine come in a smaller size. Also, please bring back the ice cream this summer! Soups are yummy and I love the 4 out of 4 juices I've tried."}
{"text":"Grass Roots gives you super powers. I always feel amazing after I eat here! I've tried the Dirty Chai and Tropical Basil whole food juices and loved them both. I really like the blended coffee beans in the Dirty Chai for a healthy boost of caffeine. After trying the warm cashew broccoli cheeze soup, I know I have to try the rest of the soups, which are blended fresh to order. Recently, I ordered the Bud and Vine smoothie bowl, which was a very satisfying and delicious meal with the flavors of berries and lavender. I requested fresh raspberries, blueberries, granola, and a drizzle of vanilla cashew cream as toppings. The crunchy granola included whole roasted cashews and goji berries. If I had a whole bag of that stuff, I would not be able to put it down. It's unbelievably good.

Owners Shane and Nichole are very passionate and knowledgeable; not only do they run an awesome juice bar, they do a lot in the community, such as participating in downtown's annual Gobble Gobble Give and visiting schools to educate kids about healthy eating. Grass Roots is a made to order juice bar with no indoor seating, but there is a nice courtyard with some tables. This outdoor space is shared with O Face and Carson Kitchen and smells like delicious fried dough at times, but it doesn't make me crave doughnuts when I'm enjoying a Grass Roots smoothie. Sometimes I order both and you will see other people doing the same. Grass Roots is closed Sunday and open until 4pm the rest of the week, so plan your visit accordingly."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan or a vegetarian. I'm lazy and I drink way too much. So if I can do one good thing for myself and my body it's Grass Roots. 

Bud & Vine is my lunchtime go-to. I've tried other items on the menu and have never been disappointed. But Bud & Vine (with almond milk) is my addiction. It's tastefully satisfying and keeps me full from lunch to dinnertime. 

I'm so grateful that I can rely on Grass Roots to feed this lazy girl with bad habits something nutritious. I am getting into the routine of making my own smoothies at home, but they're never as delicious as Grass Roots. 

And the staff is SUPER FRIENDLY, always smiling, and always adding a little sunshine to my workday. Don't forget to join their rewards club. I think you get a free drink after purchasing 10."}
{"text":"would be five but one of the girls can improve her customer service skills. seems to be consistent in other reviews."}
{"text":"I love their tortilla soup and I usually hate tortilla soup! The cheese soup is great too! I wish it wasn't so hot so I can have more soup!!!

The tropical basil smoothie is great and so is the aloe cucumber, wasn't crazy about the beet one with coffee beans. There's a green smoothie that's good too, but can't remember the name :(

It's a little crowded in there and sometimes it takes 20 mins to get a smoothie so put lots of change in the meters."}
{"text":"I would love to pick this place up and take it home with me! Great service, informative staff and such delicious juices and smoothies. I always look for juice bars when I travel to stay healthy and this is the best one I have ever found. My husband, son and I each ordered something different and each juice or smoothie was fresh and delicious. We started each day of our vacation here and couldn't wait to come back. They also have great essential oil shots for those hard to beat colds, coughs, etc. Try Grass Roots, you'll love it and love the way you feel!"}
{"text":"It tastes like home! Moving to Vegas from Portland was a bit of a shock, especially in the fresh/organic/farmers market department. But not at Grass Roots Juice Bar! The juice is fabulous, I got \"The Holy Grail\" green juice-delicious, and the staff was very knowledgable and friendly. 

All of their produce is certified organic and purchased from local farmers. I like that a lot! The bar is small, but very clean and the staff whipped my juice up in a jiffy! It wasn't busy when I was there, but I arrived right at opening. There aren't any places to sit inside, so plan on just grab and go. This place is a must try and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Okay, I finally branched out from my usual order of Holy Grail of Greens and the Bud & Vine and HOLY CRAP am I thankful I did. The tortilla soup left me speechless, it's so good. In a matter of minutes, a large portion of steaming hot and creamy soup was poured after being made from fresh and raw ingredients. I watched with awe as cashews, cherry tomatoes, bell peppers, banana peppers, cabbage, and more was portioned off and put in a blender. 

The Mint and Spirulina truffles are no joke either, made by the always cheerful Jorge and Sabryna. Can't wait for the cold pressed juices to come out!"}
{"text":"I had ginger in the grass. Yum!
Smoothies and fresh juices are my favorite. 
This was my first time here but I will be back to try bowls and other smoothies. If you want to come and just hang out there is a new bench for seating in the front but more if you go out the back door and into the courtyard."}
{"text":"This will be a very short review.  Why? Not much needs to be said.  This is the best smoothie/juice bar in Vegas.  Extremely nice employees...fair pricing...and some really great tasting drinks.  The Holy Grail of Greens in my personal favorite.  Every time you leave this place, you feel as if you did your body some good.  Whenever you're downtown hanging out in the afternoon...stop by this place.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"This is best juice place in las Vegas. Its better than organic at whole foods because the fruits and veggies come mostly from  local farmers markets. Cool little spot with great fresh to made juices and made to order raw soups."}
{"text":"really good but prohibitively expensive. it should not cost $30 for a couple of smoothies and a bowl of soup, but it does.

strange hours and location in a shady part of town only add to the apparent lack of business acumen on part of the owner(s). and it's never cool when an employee has to personally go unlock a restroom door for you. 

put the same shop in a high-traffic, low crime area, reduce the prices to a more palatable level, and this place would really rock it!

UPDATE: Going out of business! Told ya so."}
{"text":"Love it!  Everything is packed with nutrients and tastes even more amazing!  Great ratios!"}
{"text":"So... We came here for lunch after a night of drinking for my birthday. It's a cute little spot nestled downtown... Small but... They have a little hidden patio that you can sit outside and eat and drink. Everything there looks healthy and delicious... They use fresh organic ingredients and extracts. They offer additions like protein etc. at an extra charge. The smoothies are healthy... And real... Don't go in expecting the typical tropical smoothie... We each ordered a smoothie. They were okay... Very very filling. The veggitino? Wasn't very creamy... We should of just ordered one and shared.

We ordered the soup. Made fresh to order right in the blender... It was amazing. Definitely give it a go for a light snack on a cold afternoon. 

Service was okay. Took a little while but... When everything is fresh... It's to be expected. It was around $40 plus tip for two smoothies with protein and a small bowl of soup. Was it worth the 40$? Probably not... I'll stick to making my own smoothies... But I'll be back for the soup!"}
{"text":"Holy grail and holy alkaline, were delicious and super detoxifying! Perfect quick stop before getting back on the road."}
{"text":"Chocolate Peanut Butter smoothie. Oh my goodness! Amazing. Expensive but worth it. I travel all over S CA and AZ for business and I seek out healthy shake places. This is the best one yet.

If you're traveling, the Original ChopShop in Phoenix has a smoothie called Muscle Malt which is excellent. Also, Simply Healthy in Ventura, Temecula and Murrieta is wonderful."}
{"text":"Great juice bar, the staff was helpful and friendly. It's very convenient for me since it's literally right around the corner from my work. I've only been there 2 times and I've tried 2 different juices both were great and tasted really good!!"}
{"text":"I like this place. It's got juice. Good juice. The lil truffle ball things are yummy. I got a ginger drink. Staff is really nice. They have a rewards program. Easy parking right in front."}
{"text":"i would absolutely recommend Grass roots! Went in for a cleansing juice and left with their most popular juice, THE HOLY GRAIL. It was thicker than regular cleansing juices but thin enough to sip easily through a straw. completely organic and natural, it was so delicious and sweet with just enough tart! I also opted on getting a soup because I was starving. I ordered the thai ginger soup and it was deliciously creamy. I will definitely be back! I'm so excited I finally committed to going in instead of eating food at work!"}
{"text":"grass roots juice bar is super fantastic, awesome, and the greatest -- along with many other superlatives i'm not going to list.  i love the dirty chai, the holy alkaline, ginger in grass and their fresh coconut milk is worth the drive from anywhere in the valley!  highly recommended."}
{"text":"Well done!  A great addition to the Las Vegas valley.  My wife and I ordered two juices each and thought they were excellent.  Great pride of ownership and a friendly helpful staff.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, especially since they are all organic! Grass Roots never lets me down. The staff is always friendly and quick.  The drinks are always good too. Today I ordered Ginger in the Grass and this may be my new favorite drink. I also ordered the Tortilla Soup, which is definitely one of the best tortilla soups that I have had."}
{"text":"I don't consider myself a juicer at ALL and have never really had true beverages w/fresh, \"from the backyard\" ingredients. I stopped by after running a 5k (low on sleep and hungry) for a pick me up and was pleasantly impressed. I went w/the Bud and Vine. Blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, sage, micro greens, spinach, avocado, dates, and lavender flower w/my choice of soy milk. It was delicious and creamy, sweet and smooth. I couldn't have had a better experience and would take this over a Jamba Juice drink any day! I also had a Vitality Shot for an added boost. Turmeric root juice, lemon juice, coconut juice, ginger juice, lemon juice, coconut juice, cayenne pepper, and turmeric. Talk about a ZING! This came with a kick and a pow! It no doubt woke me up. I can honestly say that I felt energized and didn't feel the need to eat a meal after I was done. I would love to come back and try more! #teamgrassroots"}
{"text":"This is a small juice/smoothie/soup bar, and don't let the size or area of town steer you away. This place is a hidden gem! 

I had been wanting to step in here after I my Bikram classes, unfortunately, they are not open very late (I take evening classes). I had happen to take an early class and was able to try this place out. 

I ordered their Tortilla Soup, which was amazing!!! I'm so impressed by the freshness and creativeness of this soup. Since almost everything they use is vegan, it was refreshing to be able to have vegan tortilla soup! Best part was it was MADE TO ORDER. They blend everything together right there in front of you even asking how spicy I had wanted it. 

I will definitely be back in the future to try other items. However, it is a bit expensive so it doesn't have me wanting to come back every day."}
{"text":"How did I never write a review for all of those times I indulged in some of the best vegan food I've ever had? Vegan soups made in high-speed blenders and breakfast bowls made with real fruit!! They use all-natural ingredients and some that you can't get at most other places. The prices are perfect and the quality can't get any better.

Their customer service is on point and everyone has always been so friendly, even the owner when he took my order, which I thought was awesome! He seemed passionate yet humble, good combo. :)

Let me tell you, if you're hesitant to try the Ginger in the Grass juice because you're not the biggest fan of ginger, DON'T BE! :D I was very scared to try it but, because my friend ordered it, I tried a sip. BAM! Amazing, refreshing and tastes like mellow green apples+teeny hint of ginger+spinach or something else to mellow it out. I'd have to look at the menu again to remember but don't be scared to try anything! 

The peeps that work there will talk you through any fears, hold your hand, and make you delicious nom noms. Don't be shy. :)

My favorites:
-Tortilla Soup 
- Broccoli 'Cheddar' Soup 
- Ginger in the Grass"}
{"text":"The real deal. Not jAMBA juice. Friendly, healthy and tasty. These were quality, real ingreduents. I got the (something i cant remember) and vine. Awesome.
Off the beaten path a bit, but worth it.  Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Healthy never tasted so good! The tortilla soup is unbelievably delicious. I questioned how it was going to taste seeing all the various ingredients being put into the blender - I wish I could eat it every day! The chocolate peanut butter smoothie was fantastic too. Shane and staff have a friendly, positive vibe. I'll be stopping by often because now I want to try all the other interesting drinks!"}
{"text":"The dirty chai is delish! I would recommend calling your order in, since they make it right there, small spot but everything looked super fresh and Everyone super nice. This will be my go to lunch juice from now on. Love it"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Grassroots now and my only complaint is that there isn't one within walking distance of my home. Seriously, this place is amazing. Stopped by here on our trek to Fremont Street based on Yelp reviews. It's pretty easy to find, and perfect for a grab-and-go breakfast. I tried the Ginger in the Grass and my guy had the Chocolate Peanut Butter. The employees were very friendly and mixed up our juice and smoothie quickly. I was a little nervous after seeing what went in their juicer/blender, but out came some seriously healthy and delicious magic. I even saw one of the workers taste test the smoothie to make sure the consistency was correct before she passed it along. They obviously care about putting out a great product. Both drinks were twenty-four ounces and filled us up! Prices were steep but I think you get what you pay for with the quality and freshness. We loved the flavors and can't believe they were so good for us, too. I'd wholeheartedly recommend."}
{"text":"Juice joints don't need to be located in big open spaces to sling their wares. This place is no exception in its compact space. Located walking distance from Fremont Street area, around the corner from O Face Doughnuts. Everything is organic here and they try to purchase produce from the local farmers market as often as possible. The prices are comparable to other juice places, but a bit on the higher priced side of the spectrum at $11."}
{"text":"On a road trip from San Diego to Denver and yelped this little gem!  SO delicious!!! It's hard to stay feeling healthy while on a road trip and rest assured thanks to YELP and Grass Roots we are able to do so!

I believe her name was Kim, cousin to the owner.  She was SO kind and knowledgable.  She asked us what we liked and offered some suggestions on the menu, as well as told us we can customize our juice.  She made it very easy and never rushed us, which made it all that more comfortable.  
and the juice is SO delicious!"}
{"text":"This is close to my work so I stopped by to check out a healthier spot. I wasn't greeted when I walked in, but all the blenders were going and it was pretty loud. The girl who took my order was extremely nice.
I ordered the peanut butter chocolate smoothie but I definitely got some type of berry smoothie. It was good but not what I ordered.
Overall I would come back.
Parking is easy if it's not busy and the place is small so nowhere to sit and hang out for a little."}
{"text":"Great option right in the middle of downtown, popped in on a weekday holiday morning visit and they kindly split one of their large orders into two for us. Neat place - the mixers are right up at the front and are super loud so it must be jammin when they are busy - it was a bit tough to have a conversation with the staff though."}
{"text":"I Flew Into Vegas Knowing I Was Going To Visit This Local Juice Bar.

I know when I come here for business I'm going to look for the best food I can get because the Strip doesn't offer much in my opinion. Plus I love to look for local businesses offering fresh, flavorful, and, if possible, locally grown food.
Grass Roots Offers All 3 And More!
Between Seth(sorry if I have that wrong. It's the name I heard when you were ringing me up) and Chancey(sp) giving me small tastes of juices she was making before mine was ready, I had a fun experience at this New JuiceBar on the corner of Carson and 6th. It's small so keep your eyes open for the glass door with the Grass Roots logo. 
Part of the fun was I intercepted someone else's order. I was standing at the pick up spot cooling off after a 4 mile run - yes, I'm a little crazy to be running from the strip in 92° heat at 7:30 in the morning but I will do that for a great food(juice) experience - so I grabbed the Ginger In The Grass that Chancey handed me(Great green juice, btw. Buy this one if you want to get Your Green fix) and thought she was being nice giving me a cool drink until I order. No, it was for the guy standing beside me. Sorry brotha. 
I downed that drink pretty fast and ordered up a Matchaccino. Another great one for a pick me up with green Matcha tea, coffee beans, almond milk or coconut milk, if you prefer and some other amazing goodness. It's thicker so I felt like I had a great, healthy meal in a 24 oz cup. 
All in all, I very highly recommend Grass Roots for the juice recipes, fresh, local produce and great, friendly customer service. It's given me another reason to come to Vegas. 
See you soon Grass Roots."}
{"text":"The YUMMIEST healthy juice and smoothie creations! I've been here about 4 times. Two of the times were on one day...that's how good! Very nice people! So happy it's here by me and can't wait to try everything on the menu. Cucumber miso soup is great and was nice to have while I had a cold. Fav drink so far is the Dirty chai (without coffee beans). Very filling as well and packed with nutrients,"}
{"text":"Darn good smoothies, yogurt cups, ice cream, juice drinks! Located in the newly renovated Carson hotel on the corner of 6th and Carson this place is a Jem! Glad there are healthy options now for lunch instead of comfort heavy food. 
I tried - Holy Grail of Greens and the Dirty Chai smoothie... Both are DELISH!"}
{"text":"Located in the John Carson Motel on 6th Street near Carson. It's a great stop while in DTLV when you need something quick and healthy. It's not the recently-popularized cold-pressed juice, but everything is made fresh and blended to delicious perfection. Everyone is really kind and helpful. It makes it so easy to find something you love and they make sure you love your drink before you leave.

I couldn't find something I really loved, so one of the baristas asked me what it was I liked. I said I wanted a juice with beets and ginger since I needed that boost on this day. She suggested the Beetaccino (Beets, raspberries, blueberries, dates, curly kale, purple cabbage, avocado, lemon, vanilla, and coconut oil), mentioning that it could be fully-customized. Since I didn't want caffeine, we removed the coffee beans and added fresh ginger. I don't remember why, but we also added housemade coconut milk. Also, originally, I didn't want the dates, but after tasting the finished product, it needed the sweetness, so she added it back in. After everything, the juice was exactly what I wanted and delicious!

I also sampled the Bud and Vine (Blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, sage, micro greens, spinach, avocado, dates, and lavender flowers), yum!

I've had a few of their other beverages and the Super Truffles at events and everything is really great. This is definitely one of my DTLV spots."}
{"text":"Amazing! I had the Bud & Vine which was such a great mixture of ingredients: Blueberries, Blackberries, Strawberries, Sage, Micro Greens, Spinach, Avocado, Dates, Lavender (Flower Only),

I love Sage and how it really brings out the flavors of fruit.  You honestly can't taste the Avocado, Spinach or Micro Greens which I think is a plus for people who want something fruity and nutritious but don't like veggies.  

I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were visiting from CA and and across this place on yelp. The lady made me a dirty chai bowl (wasn't on the menu) and it was honestly the best smoothie bowl I have ever had! I will definitely return next time I am in Vegas. Nice staff, healthy and yummy options!!"}
{"text":"It's about time Vegas had this type of option available off strip! Great for a mid day energy boost. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place was yummy! It's kind of out of the way for me since I don't live in downtown LV but if I'm ever in the area I want to try it out again.

I asked for a Bud and Vine. I didn't realize it was both a smoothie and a bowl so I just asked for it thinking I would get the bowl version but the employee just assumed I wanted the smoothie so I got that instead. The girl making the smoothie said she would dump it out and put the granola and fruit on top to make the bowl but she said the smoothie and bowl are made from different ingredients so it wouldn't taste the same. It was nice of her to offer but I declined since it wouldn't be the same. The smoothie was really good but I was kind of disappointed since I really wanted the bowl. I wish they named their smoothies and bowls different names to avoid confusion."}
{"text":"Ladies here are amazing!! So nice and friendly. Nice to have something fresh and healthy after week at furniture show conference with bad food and too much booze. 

I highly recommend coming here!! My Dad and I will be back next time for sure!! YUM"}
{"text":"Really wonderful staff.  I just wish this juice bar actually served juice.

Ever been to a juice bar that doesn't have a juicer?  You have now.  Their \"juice\" consists of throwing the ingredients in a blender.  You know, like a smoothie.  

They make smoothies with ingredients that consist of mostly liquid, like watermelon and grapes, and call it juice.  When you ask about it, they give you an explanation that consists of telling you how it is better because you get all the nutrients from the skin and pulp.  If I wanted all of that, I would order a smoothie, because that is a smoothie.  I ordered juice, because I wanted juice.

No thanks."}
{"text":"Love this place! Ordered the Real 90 protein shake and it was excellent! The staff was also super nice! They gave me a sample of the tortilla soup which was good! Wish I would have grabbed some on my way out since I was only in town visiting and they weren't open Sunday but highly recommend that soup too. All of the options on the menu looked tasty! Service was fast, cost was reasonable, facility was clean, parking was simple!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to loving this place, I LOVE green smoothies, organic juices, and healthy foodie options. My friends and colleagues in the DTLV & tech community have raved about the good experiences they've had here. I was really really really looking forward to this place and I'm all about supporting local small businesses. My foodie friend and I drove all the way from Anthem (Henderson) to try this. At least a 30 minute drive. 

Sadly, I was disappointed. I have made my own smoothies and juices at home for years and I was disappointed with what I tried here. Service was great, staff was friendly but not informative. I wanted to try the smoothie bowls, that was what we drove across town for, but it wasn't available. They didn't have the ingredients in store. 

Okay, no problem. There were a few smoothies I wanted to try because of the ingredients they use. I asked for my second, third, fourth choice. Sadly, those weren't available either. All the ones I wanted to try were not available. Or rather they couldn't make it because they didn't have all the ingredients but informed me that the fruits are on they're way there. They didn't have an estimated time when they would arrive either. Ugh, come on now. Throw me a bone! And we got there in the afternoon. 

So....... I settled with the Tropical Basil ($8). I didn't really want it, but I wanted to try something here. Sadly, I was disappointed again. I felt so confused and disappointed I didn't realize that the Tropical Basil is suppose to be a juice, not a smoothie. I had a sip before I left, and it tasted alright. I tipped them a few bucks and left. After looking at the menu again, I realized the Tropical Basil is a juice. Or it should be. The drink I had was thick, more of a grainy smoothie with chunks. I'm surprised because even with Vitamix, this should have been smoother. 

My friend had the Dirty Chai ($10) she was disappointed as well, and yes, we both complained about it being chunky and grainy and not worth the $10+ tip.

They were also at the Yelp event Redline Rendevous in October, but yet again it didn't make up for my previous experience. I had a sample of their popular green smoothie, I think it was Holy Grail of Greens and a healthy truffle. The truffle was flavorless and the smoothie, well I could have made something better. 

I am so sorry, I really don't want to give a 2 star, but yes \"meh. I've experienced better.\" I don't want this review to seem like I hate this place or discourage other yelpers from trying this place, I advise you to try it for yourself. I'm not saying I won't try this place again, but I don't know if I would drive all the way from Henderson, pay for parking, and go out of my way to try this place again. I hate to say it but just writing this makes me feel disappointed and let down."}
{"text":"Wow! I just want to live in this little juice bar....love, love, love.  The avacado bowl, cashew cheese broccoli soup, beet smoothie, ginger smoothie.....all perfect."}
{"text":"WHAT?! Did we just become best friends?!
That's how I feel about this place. Kinda in love. Nice people makin' good, delicious and healthy drinks. How can it get better? 
It is a bit on the pricy side but then again, can't put a price on health. 
Holy Grail of Green is my go to now. Perfect after going to Downtown Bikram Yoga which is right next door. Step outside to the back patio for a urban lunch get away."}
{"text":"As good as it gets right here folks! The owner is completely community oriented. If you have an opportunity to stop by, you should. They even teach you as they juice. This isn't the average juice bar, its so much moore."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of stopping by the other day right before their soft opening to catch the crew in the middle of training. The space looked great! I'm so happy they're doing something positive with the John E. Carson building. A little concerned with how they're able to offer fresh cold-pressed juice on the go, home made ice cream, smoothies, AND soups in such a limited space, but I have absolute faith in them. 

I got to meet Shane & Nichole (owners). It's nice to be around people who are passionate about what they do on top of being absolutely knowledgeable as well. They pass that same energy down to their employees, which makes me excited and confident to be a customer there. Especially since all their ingredients are organic and mostly sourced locally.

Shane made me the Dirty Chai smoothie out of the most obscure ingredients. I was definitely unconfident of how the beverage would turn out as I watched him toss things like cabbage, ginger, pumpkin, coffee beans, and wheatgrass among a bevy of other ingredients into the VitaMix. However, all my concerns were demolished once I took my first sip. My first thoughts were, \"WHAT KIND OF SORCERY IS THIS?!\" Immediately followed by, \"Must. Have. More.\" Needless to say, that smoothie was inhaled swiftly without remorse. 

My only gripe with this place is how far they are from my home, and how early they close. Being a night owl is not conducive to my need for delicious & healthy items that I have to drive across town for before 3pm. BUT... That won't stop me from trying!"}
{"text":"Grass Roots is shuttering its doors this Friday on June 10! So if you haven't had a chance to visit this juice bar in downtown Las Vegas yet, this week is your last opportunity to do so! I've always wanted to try out a healthy smoothie from Grassroots, and my co-worker finally made it happen when she made the executive decision to get some juices delivered to us via Postmates last week.

MINT CAPIGREENO ($9.95): I called the shop for advice on what to order because I was overwhelmed with options. A friendly employee advised me to get the Mint Capigreeno since I'm a fan of mint chocolate chip ice cream. This caffeinated beverage has cacao nibs, mint leaves, and avocado to name a few ingredients. It was smooth and refreshing. 4/5

DTLV will surely miss Grass Roots Juice Bar, and I wish owner Shane the best of luck!

YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #39"}
{"text":"Hands down the best juice I've ever had!  Refreshing and full of flavor and cold!  They cold press and blend with ice I believe. They have whole food juices, smoothies, caffeine and greens, soups, smoothie bowls and vegan ice creams. I got the Ginger in the Grass Juice, totally kick ass!  Green Grapes, Ginger, Spinach, Pineapple, Lime, Tangerine and Wheatgrass. All of the drinks come in 24 oz. so it's a lot for me. But it's worth it, and a good price compared to other juice bars. You should go, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I was happy to have met your awesome staff and taste the great food at the Yelp event at the Shelby Museum this past Tuesday 10/6. Great food tastings (especially the Hummus and Cucumber) and the orange drink you were serving was a real eye-opener and really revived my senses! I plan on visiting your location real soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible!  It is very hard to find a TRUE juice bar.  These people do it the best I have seen!!"}
{"text":"These juices are the GREATEST pick me up -- especially on a warmer Vegas day. Tropical Basil juice is amazing so is the aloe...mint something something. The consistency is between juice and smoothie/shake and it's really satisfying. Highly recommend 100%"}
{"text":"I love GrassRoots. I've been waiting for a juice or smoothie place in Las Vegas for a while. The staff is nice and everything tastes delicious. I'm personally a fan of the Holy Grail of Greens."}
{"text":"SUPPORT THIS PLACE.  I created the juice I wanted...I told the clerk what I would like and they suggested extras to make it more delicious....I handed her my debit and signed and tipped on an iPad.... I was quickly handed my veggie juice and my friend was handed her soup and we sat outside and the handsome owner introduced himself and thanked us for the visit!   Support local and small businesses and I love supporting anything downtown Las Vegas!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good! Need a pick me up get the Dirty Chai with almond milk."}
{"text":"About f-ing time DownTown got a real juice spot! I have been waiting for one of these for years. A couple have popped up here and there DT but didn't quite mimic what I wanted. I wanted something more like Greens and Proteins with a mix of Whole Foods and I got it. 

Pros: 
- From what I understand, everything is organic. And they have an array of vegetables/mixtures/and fruits...like yellow watermelon? Damn good.
- The juice and smoothies have a right blend of enough greens but not too much to taste like grass and not too much fruit where you start wondering how could this be healthy. The perfect balance.
- Unlike some of the other posters I actually had a great customer service experience my first time. A blonde woman helped me pick my order, let me try a couple of samples, and was actually another reason why I came back. However, on my fourth or fifth visit, there was an older brown haired lady who was a little sassy and I don't mean fun sassy like Blanche from Golden Girls, but just sassy.


Cons: 
- Closes early and not open when I need it the most aka drunk and want to be healthy.
- It's tiny in there, so if more than five people are waiting for juice, be prepared to wait outside or in the building where you can chat up random people from different shops like bikram yoga.
- It's still downtown so I've had a couple bums ask me to buy them a juice. Not really a con it was just random, I've had a bum ask for cigarettes, money, and alcohol but never a juice. Guess  they need their nutrients too since they're outside all day, makes sense."}
{"text":"I finally found some good grass in Las Vegas.  I had the vegitinno (sp) which had sweet greens, cacao and and superfood supplements that jump started my day.  The smoothies, juices, bowls and other items are the menu are healthy and tasty.  Staff is friendly and informative.  Lots of green proteins here.  Does your body good to have some good grass."}
{"text":"Marisa M., I had to wait till summer, but I finally made it to Grass Roots Juice Bar. The staff is friendly and welcoming. With small children running around at my ankles, I am always grateful for a dining experience where I feel happy I arrived. 

I ordered a. TROPICAL BASIL (Basil Leaves, Tangerine, Banana, Pineapple, Passion Fruit, Carrots, Dried Apricots, Lemon, Coconut Water) which my daughter enjoyed too. With Vita Mix in one hand and organic freshness in the other, this tall, cool delight was just perfect for a late afternoon break.

My clan and I enjoyed outdoor seating. We read about Nevada's ecosystem and I devoured CASHEW BROCCOLI CHEEZE SOUP (Cashews, Broccoli, Broccoli Flower, Bell Pepper, Green Cabbage, Leeks, Black Pepper, Carrots, Celery, Tomato).  I need a supply of this at home, maybe there will be cooking workshops or demonstrations in Grass Roots' future. 

Grass Roots, thank you for taking care of us. XO"}
{"text":"This place was my saving grace in downtown Las Vegas!  They served up healthy options for juices & smoothies & smoothie bowls.  Delicious!  The staff was really friendly & helpful.  It's fun to watch them make your smoothie/juice/smoothie bowl & I'm glad I could because I noticed they put ingredients in my smoothie that weren't listed on the menu.  That's the only reason I'm giving them a 4/5 star review.  I asked for no sweetener & they added some coconut palm & said they add it to every smoothie (even though it's not listed as an ingredient in all the smoothies).  I'd also love to see them fill the fridge with fresh grab & go items.  There were a few in there, but it was pretty sad.

Keep up the great work GrassRoots.  With just a few improvements to your transparency of your menu & stocking up your shelves you'll be at 5 stars in no time =)"}
{"text":"Where a similarly located John E. Carson shop insists on too much filling to cover a lack of basic flavor structuring, Grass Roots is entirely the opposite. Each juice starts with the basics that will give you an appealing color, a pleasant texture, and for all its complexity, you'll have no idea just how many greens and other healthy things are blended into your cup. Basically, your juice will be sweet and tangy and smooth all over. And yet there is SO much STUFF in the juices, smoothies, and soups that you can order off the menu, or you can work with the juicers to craft something all your own. It's certainly more magical to watch Shane Stuart and his team concoct colorful juices with your taste buds in mind than it is to select a few veggies for a \"build-your own\" sandwich. 

Of all the places I will miss in Vegas when I move east soon, newcomer Grass Roots is certainly in the top three. Even more than my work friends who inevitably end up here after nearly every team meeting, I am viciously jealous of children in Las Vegas who have Grass Roots juices to look forward to after braces-tightenings. As young teens, my brother and I shared those torturous braces years. Our mother, fretting that her growing children couldn't get nearly enough nutrients for the week or more following a painful tightening, kept weird-tasting, canned nutrition drinks on hand at all times. I remember surviving, barely, on those for a week or two at a time. It certainly helps that Shane can hide kale, cabbage, and just about any other green or veggie in the drinks and you'd be none the wiser. Seriously, kids with braces, I hate you so much right now. No matter that I am freakin' lovin' my juice right now.

But as an adult, there are other times when juices and smoothies are a solution to the inability to eat solids. Grief from a loss, and other additive stresses has lately warped my ability to feel hungry or very much interest in eating. Food, especially anything I would cook myself, simply hasn't appealed to me. However, where solids aren't enticing, Grass Roots is not only helping me put something meaningful into my body, but I'm actually recharged and calmer after a Mint Capigreeno or a Ginger in the Grass. As I treat my body well, my mind finds more normality too. While enjoying the wait for my juice, I've met some others who have similarly found that where sadness or stress has eliminated their desire to eat solid foods, Grass Roots is doing more than feeding them; it's helping to heal them. 

The wonderful community that presses into the popular, small juice bar at all times of the day is a great addition to the therapy as well.  Everyone wants to know what's hidden in your juice, and you KNOW you're equally as curious. Go ahead, ask them. They want to tell you, and they're going to give you such a long list that by the time they finish, and you're listing out what is in your cup, you'll be fast friends. 

Don't forget to tip your concocters."}
{"text":"The juices here are ALWAYS amazing. A little pricey but definitely worth it !!! 
I try to stop by whenever I'm nearby and I'll be back for more soon"}
{"text":"I'm just trying to stick to my roots, my grass roots that is. 
I'm a big fan of downtown and I'm also a big fan of delicious smoothies, and wouldn't you know, this place fits nicely in the middle of that Venn diagram. 
The drinks here are incredible, everything is fresh made right in front of you and all super healthy. The menu items are all different mixes. I was able to try the strawberry melon, which is nice and cool but I absolutely loved the smoothie bowl. I don't know if it's a common item because this the first place I tried it, but it's a smoothie in bowl form topped with whatever fruit or granola you choose. That right there made me a super fan
 I've actually ended up talking with the staff. They were super friendly and outgoing and Shane was very personable and answered any and all questions about the menu
The only slight negative is that the inside is a bit small, so I could see it being uncomfortable if there's a lot of people ordering, but it's also next to a courtyard that you can relax at. 
As a  denizen of downtown I certainly welcome the addition"}
{"text":"OMG- nicest small business owner, EVER!! Every employee was helpful, sweet, and friendly! 

A group of four of us walked in, and began to check out the menu-- the owner offered us a free sample right away and when our youngest member (10 years old, and suuuuuper picky) made a face, he offered us another of a savory soup-- we all LOVED it, and ended up buying it-- the delicious tortilla soup. This is probably the best soup I've ever had!!! We nearly licked the bowl in finishing it off, lol. 

We also had the Yummy Berry-- definitely Yummy, and the Chocolate Monkey something, with a superfood-- heavenly!! 

The owner kept giving us little samples of exotic fruits, smoothies, and he even opened up a raw pizza and gave us generous samples!!

Great great great place for a really high vibe pick-me-up, and a smoothie cool-me-down or a soup heat-me-up!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a cool, refreshing and healthy drink . everything is made fresh, right on the spot. I tried the \"Ginger in the Grass\". Sooooo delish! Prices are reasonable.  Can't wait to try another juice."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great options, friendly knowledgeable staff, welcoming environment.  I highly recommend the Ginger In The Grass, my favorite!  Also for all the vegans out there, you can't forget to pick up some Virgin Cheese, which is the best vegan cheese I've ever had in my life."}
