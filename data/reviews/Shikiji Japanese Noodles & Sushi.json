{"text":"Their ramen is the bomb! Serving is huge and I never get to finish the whole bowl lol Nice and friendly servers. Don't forget to try their takoyaki as well super deli and addictive!"}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband (Japanese) did not have any expectations since Japanese food in Edmonton has completely disappointed him but we both loved the ramen we got. Very authentic and delicious.   I think it might be useful to have half-size portions, though, because it's too much!"}
{"text":"We walked from downtown to this place because of the reviews. For one thing, the staff is very nice and friendly and the service was great. The gyoza are fantastic, light and crispy, just like in Japan, and they're made of spinach dough I think so it has a bit of a modern twist. The goma chili ramen was ok. Maybe I'm just not a fan of this style of ramen, but I felt like it was too thick and the vegetables were cut up too small so that everything sank to the bottom and you just had a bunch of ground pork and stuff to eat at the end -- i guess if you like that then its fine. The noodles were great though--perfectly cooked and great texture.  I guess, its a modern twist on this type of cooking - I'm sure their other dishes are interesting."}
{"text":"I gave it 5 stars!! They have the best Ramen in town!! Great costumer service!! I love their sushi!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend and was pretty disappointed. For a restaurant owned by a Japanese person, they serve some of the most unauthentic food you can find. The prices are around the mid-high range with portion sizes being a bit more on the small side.  I opted for a bowl of miso ramen, my friend tried a bento box, and we also got a plate of sushi rolls to share. My ramen was extremely underwhelming. It lacked the rich flavour a good soup base should have, the two pieces of pork were very small and rather bland but quite tender, and the toppings were a bit strange. I got one piece of black fungus, one piece of lettuce, and loads and loads of bean sprouts. In fact, there were more bean sprouts than noodles.   My friend's bento box at least had more flavour even though it wasn't great. The fried rice he chose was so bland that it may as well have been plain rice. The portion sizes of the meats were pretty sad and in their attempt to save money, you get a huge chunk of deep fried onion slivers as part of your tempura. The sushi was mediocre at best but at least it wasn't fishy.  Overall, it was a disappointing experience, especially considering my favourite ramen place is owned by his son. Would I return? Most likely not."}
{"text":"At this point I've been to Shikiji twice. Both times have been fantastic and it's close to becoming my favourite sushi spot in YYC.    First suggestion, MAKE A RESERVATION! Tonight my friend and I showed up at 7pm(on a Monday) and without a reservation there was a 15 minute wait for a table. Not too bad of a wait, but do keep that in mind.  Mondays are a great night to go, why? It's Martini Monday, I've made it through most of the martini list now and each one has been well made and great flavours. Some very Asian inspired through the use of Sake and Soho, some more contemporary such as the Bill Murray, a martini made with espresso vodka, Baileys and vanilla vodka.   The sushi on both visits has been perfectly rolled with the freshest ingredients. I described the Negitoro roll to my friend who had until this visit, never tried it as: \"think of it as a tuna sandwich with an abundance of creamy mayo, it has that texture.\" Of course it doesn't have mayo in it, that would be an abomination!  It was all about the texture, creamy smooth and a beautiful blending of the flavours.    The BC roll is probably the best one I've had outside of Vancouver(I'm an ex-vancouverite) and is certainly the best one I've had in Calgary. The salmon skin was delightfully crispy and and the dollop of unagi bbq sauce finished it perfectly.    Will I go back? Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"Ramen soups were decorative but tasted very salty. We had to add whole cup of hot water to the bowls of soup. When we made comments, we were expecting to here \"thank you for the suggestions we will take it into consideration.\" The cashier said, \"All Asians said its salty but it's Canada right, we are not gonna change it.\" Well, I guess its first time and also last time here."}
{"text":"Always had this place on my list to check out the noodles since I moved to town. After a few visits, this is where I come when I need my chili goma ramen fix. That broth is pretty special. Not particularly spicy but nice flavours. The pork is more chopped than ground. Still like Menyatai better for ramen but not sure they have a chili goma ramen in their arsenal.  Typical Calgary over priced fare - $15 for a bowl of ramen is steep but it is what it is. I can almost justify it for this bowl. $14-$23 for udon/ soba/ donburi is no joke. Other standard sushi bar offerings with some daily specials like big eye tuna on occasion. It's a nice space but you definitely pay for it. Decent service."}
{"text":"Food is always good here. But the service is not! They try to get you in and out so fast that you cannot enjoy your meal. Appies and mains are served at the same time. Seriously, who does that.  Okay, here is by far the biggest problem. We had a party of 5 and my 3 month old. These idiots slapped an 18% gratuity on our bill because their policy is auto grateful for parties of 6. But there were only 5 of us! They considered a 3 month year old as the 6th guests.  I argued and they refused at first. I have never been to a restaurant that does this. And they just didn't get it.  Eventually we made enough stink about it they took it off. We won't be back because of that. Complete bs to expect 18% tip when service is poor and to claim my baby is a sixth guest? Shikiji is f*cken bull should!the!!!!"}
{"text":"So to preface this review I have to mention that I didn't actually get to eat here (though wanted to).   My wife and I have wanted to dine at Shiki Menya for a while now, but every time we have driven by, it's been too lined up (which is not a bad thing as busy most often equates to good). This time we only had to wait about 5 minutes or so for lunch. So as we sat down I noticed that all their Ramen options are made with a pork based broth except for the \"Veggie Classic\". Since I don't eat pork I opted for the \"Veggie Classic\", naturally. Well it just so happened that they had run out of Veggie Classic at 1 PM on a Wednesday. Seriously!! And of course there are no other options on the menu to accommodate people that don't consume pork. Unbelievable! You would think that in this day and age they would have a few more options, or ensure that there was enough vegetable stock for an entire day!! Or what about using chicken stock for some of your menu items?! Very disappointed! Might not be back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times and it's always amazing.  The staff is very friendly, and the sushi is incredible.  Price is reasonable for sushi, which tends to be a bit more than western food, but it's totally worth it.  The quality is there.  It's a great place to take a date.  As long as your date likes sushi I guess.  But if they don't should you really be with that person?  None of my business.  Anyway, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've only been to Shikiji a couple of times, but I was never particularly impressed with it. I thought the prices to be high, for one thing. Also, I believe there was a katsudon with melted cheese on the menu, which I find just bizarre. I heard that it switched hands and really went downhill."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The service is great. Been here on multiple occasions and the staff are always very friendly and service is quick.  You'd be wise to make a reservation as most times it is busy here, for good reason!  Chili Goma Ramen is my favourite ramen and the ocean mango sushi is both beautiful to look at and tasty. They have daily sushi specials and they are always so fresh and some of the best sushi I've had in Calgary."}
{"text":"Shikiji is the kind of restaurant that's so good, I almost don't want to encourage more people to go there because that makes it more crowded! We've been going here for years and have tried most of what they have to offer. The food is always fresh, the staff is friendly and attentive, and the ambiance is intimate and a bit funky.  If you have never tried it, lunch is a great time to stop by! You'll save a bit of money ordering from the lunch menu, and you can take a bento box for great variety and value. ($10 on average, includes a small miso soup, bowl of rice, and chicken/beef plus a few sushi rolls, depending on what you choose. They have 8 varieties). Their ramen is delicious and the portion is huge. I haven't had anything here I didn't like. They're always prompt to refill drinks, even taking a pot of tea away to refill it, but won't disturb you too much.   The sushi selection is quite good, they have all the classics (try the negitoro! Sooo good) as well as \"feature\" rolls that often have more Western ingredients like the \"Ragin' Cajun\" roll. These are a fun but usually pricier way to try something a bit different. I've never had a roll here that wasn't delicious.  As other reviews have noted, the space is small and tables are limited. It's part of the charm, but it comes with a price! Make reservations if you can so that you aren't left waiting, because huddling in the very limited space at the front for 15-20 minutes isn't very fun."}
{"text":"GREAT little restaurant! The sushi was really fresh, the rice had the perfect temperature and texture and they have quite a few good options for special rolls.  Service was great too, food was on our table in less than 10 min from ordering and it is very reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Good miso ramen!   Great place. Good to be able to get great ramen and sushi in one place"}
{"text":"I often feel as though I am an inconvenience when walking into restaurants these days. Not so at Shijiki! I was greeted warmly and promptly shown to a table. My server was extremely attentive without being overbearing and throughout the whole experience I felt that they were genuinely happy to have me there.   I tried the salmon mango roll and spicy tuna roll. These were excellent, so flavourful and the salmon mango combo a welcome departure from standard fare. The spicy sauce does have some kick!  Not wild about the brown rice green tea, definitely would not try that again.   My friend opted for the California roll which was exactly as you'd expect, nothing too special there. She also had gyozo dumplings which were the most delicate, flavourful, not-over-cooked-at-all dumplings I've had in quite some time.   I'd definitely return to Shijiki!"}
{"text":"Hubby ordered the miso ramen and I had the warm shikiji soba noodles.  My husband thought highly of the fatty pork in his soup.  The sesame seeds he added made it smell amazing. Hubby gave it a thumbs up for extra veggies.   My soba noodles were served with 2 pieces of shrimp tempura, a little container of warm broth-sauce, and a tiny quail's egg on the side.  The dish  was quite rich and filling even though it isn't as soupy as the miso ramen.  The veggies, tempura flakes, and the tofu added  a lovely crunch and texture.  We both rolled out of there completely and utterly stuffed. Great noodles.  The best ramen award still goes to Santouka ramen in Vancouver--but this is still definitely a recommend."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  I love sushi, but it is so hard to get really good fresh sushi in Calgary.  We need a closer ocean!  Since that won't likely happen, Shikiji will have to get me by.  A lot of people think Shikiji is just a noodle place, and while their noodles are great, they are highly underrated in this city for their sushi and sashimi.  I highly highly recommend the Chirashi Sushi, but anything on the menu should be good.  Service is always good, but the food is why I keep going back!  Also, Shikiji is only a block from a very well reviewed sushi place, but I think Shikiji is so much better."}
{"text":"Nom, Nom, Nom!!  This place is so yummy!  I really can't say enough good things about it. Firstly, the Chili Goma Ramen is to die for. It is spicy (but not too spicy) and has this rich, complex flavour that I would eat every meal of every day, if I could. I certainly am no expert on Ramen, never having been to Japan, but it was seriously fantastic- the soup came in a huge bowl with a charming wooden ladle. The noodles were fresh and addictive and the extra pork that I ordered on top was delicious. I do wish there was a chicken version of their Ramen -maybe one day!  We also ordered a large sake to have with the meal which was hot and delicious. And we had the tempura salmon roll which just melted in my mouth - it was so, so good!  The service was friendly, a bit perfunctory but that's ok, and I was a bit disappointed in some inflexibility for our order (eg. When you order Ramen you can choose whether you want it lean or fatty - my hubby asked if he could have a couple of each and was told 'no'. Why would that be?  It's obviously just added in top just before serving?) But that is a small quibble.   I hope there are plans for a SW location but until then we're going to keep making the trek - its worth it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The service has always been great but you can expect a bit of a wait if you don't have reservations. The chilli gomma ramen is amazing. The sushi is consistently good and the gyoza is done of the best I've had. The pain size for the ramen is generous and I have never left hungry. If you are looking for some of the best ramen in the city, Shikiji is a must try."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night. It looked pretty busy full of people. We both ordered the chili goma to go. I think it ended up like $16-17 each.   We waited about 15-20 minutes before our food came out. Upon arriving home, we unpacked the food- they kept the noodles separate from the broth to keep it from getting soggy. Pretty standard for most ramen places. The flavor of the broth was amazing. The pork was so tender and delicious - topped with some sesame. I can't say how deep their menu is or how good the other food may be, but the chili goma was worth every penny! Stop by and try and a bowl!   Ps. The soup is a bit spicy so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"yum yum yum. The lunch ramen specials are awesome, a good sized bowl of ramen, a salad and a rice/meat dish for a very decent price.  They also have udon, sushi & sashimi but really the best choice is the ramen.   It may make you feel guilty afterwards, but try the fatty pork in the noodle dishes, it is delicious.   Dinner noodle portions are huge and well worth the $12 - $15. If you are looking for a quick, hot and delicious meal north of downtown, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The Chili Goma Ramen is totally worth the drive down 16th ave during rush hour and the akward series of left hand turns I have to make to get to Shikiji. This delicious ramen has the perfect combination of spicy and nutty flavours. Now when I feel like eating ramen, only the Shikiji Chili Goma ramen will do!   I'm a bit of a baby when it comes to sushi. I only eat veggie rolls, so I can't really comment on the sushi menu. If anyone cares, the cucumber rolls are great :)"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, once for lunch and recently for dinner.  The sushi was excellent. Everything tasted oh so very fresh and the flavors were good.  The dessert selection was excellent. Ordered the pumpkin souffle, presentation was good. A little light on the sugar and it lacked the 'just baked warm and toasty' quality.  Pricing was fair and portions were good. Service was also excellent."}
{"text":"Front of house is totally incompetent, she was more concerned with reconciling her receipts than seating customers even though there were several seats open and multiple people waiting. Watched several customers leave due to this and go across the street to Pho So 1.  We waited an extra 15 minutes on top of the 30 minutes to be seated at a table that was vacant and cleaned 20 minutes prior. Saw a family with small children wait even longer, this could have been avoided if they optimized the seating area with the use of smaller tables put together.   The decor is mixed, the tables and chairs say cheap Chinese restaurant while the accents attempt to make it somewhat trendy.   The ramen was over cooked and soup was bland. At least the food came out quick but would still not come back to this place."}
{"text":"This place was just average for me.  I wouldn't drive out of the way to come here.    Today I had a sushi/sashimi/teriyaki chicken combo box.  The teriyaki chicken was OK.  My tuna sashimi was still a touch frozen.  Luckily my son ordered  chicken udon so I was able to cook the two super cold sashimi pieces.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Our experience at the restaurant was deplorable.   We were seated promptly just after 5 PM. When we were ready to order, the exchange went something like this...  Us: We are ready to order.  Server: (requests us to hand over her the sushi menu to her, and takes it) Ok, what would you like? My wife: We need it back (in order for us to order. It's not like we memorized your menu).  Server: Ok, I'll be back in a minute.  Us: (DUMBFOUND, as we told her that we were ready to order).  *** Server takes order from the next table, and comes back. I was little upset at this point.  My wife: (asks) How we are able to order the items?  Server: OH, you wanted a marker? (Puts the marker on the table), \"I'll be right back.\" -- for the second time!  Look, seriously? We said that we were ready to order. Our experience at this restaurant was one of the worst memory ever. We didn't care if their food was the best in the world.   Oh, and of the food? Right, that muscle fiber that is imposible to chew through in our two pieces of Toro.   Make your own judgement. I think there are many more options in Calgary that provide MUCH BETTER CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE than this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the chili ramen, it was ok, wasnt anything special. It's ridiculous how they charge $5.00 for pork in the noodle. The chili ramen didnt have any meat in it. The soup base was too oily in my opinion. I had a stomache afterwards. Service wasn't friendly at all."}
{"text":"We went last night and I have to say that the broth for the tempura udon is so amazing that I absolutely had to sing their praises yet again!! I don't know how they do it...! Is it the added katsubushi that they add at the end, the piece of lemon or the clarity of the broth? All of their soups are excellent but there is no smoke or mirrors. No hiding behind flashy garnishes or lots of ingredients. Seriously you have to try this soup it is so, so good!"}
{"text":"Food is okay Service is so shitty! Both cashier and waitress don't even want to talk! I have to yell to get some packing box. They pack my food at the back, I don't even want to eat it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We didn't try the sushi, but we had the appetizer of Tako Yaki, which were baked balls filled with octopus. I had seen these on an episode of No Reservations, when Tony spent time in Osaka, and always wanted to try them. Shikiji did not disappoint.   My husband had a combo, with the Soy Ramen soup and the Curry Donburi. It was ridiculously huge and delicious - a value for $15. I had the Nabeyaki Udon, which is always one of my favorites, and this was easily the best bowl of udon I have ever had. The flavors were rich and deep, so much more than the typical instant Dashi that so many places use. We want one of these in Houston. Please consider a franchise!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places for ramen. The broth is always rich and flavourful but not too salty, and the noodles are the perfect texture (firm but not undercooked). The pork they use in the soup is also very fresh and delicious. Do yourself a favour and always get the fatty pork. It's most definitely worth the few extra calories.   My favourite is the Chili Goma ramen, which has a spicy peanut based sesame broth with ground pork and bamboo shoots. Great comfort food for a chilly Calgary day or just whenever you need a pick me up!  The sushi is also pretty good, but nothing mind blowing. The real star of the show is definitely the ramen!"}
{"text":"Keep coming back again and again for the chili gomae ramen omg so good. On a hot day their cold apps and sashimi are a great alternative to their hot soup/rice bowls"}
{"text":"Had the most deelish meal last week at Shikiji. The place was packed with Japanese people, which is an excellent sign that the food's good - and it was.  Aside from the top notch food, we had excellent service from the host and the waitress.   Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi and ramen all the time. Service is on point and the place is usually pretty buzzing. Make a reservation if you can!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and ramen! They also have great curry catsu"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the Shikiji Udon bowls for dinner here. They were artfully presented, very tasty and memorable. My husband has a sensitivity to MSG so he was not feeling so well afterwards; despite this minor setback, we will be back for the fresh and delicious sushi."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and continue to come back because I really like the food here. The chili goma ramen here is the perfect mix of spicy sesame broth and ground pork. The sushi quality is comparable to other sushi places I love, and they're always coming up with fun feature rolls.  The parking may be a bit of a cluster since it's right on center street. But I think that's the only downside to this place!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in Calgary one weekend for a staycation and I had this place bookmarked as I had read that they had one of the best ramen in the city. We ordered some sushi rolls (delicious, fresh, standard) and a bowl of the chili goma ramen to share. When the waitress brought out some fried garlic chips for the ramen my husband looked at them a bit incredulously but I reassured him \"just waitttt.\" I love garlic, what can I say? Anyway, the ramen was delicious and totally lived up to my expectations. The broth was rich and peanut-y, and with the ground pork and added condiments, it was very filling, and would be amazing to have on a cold day. We ended up nearly emptying the little container of garlic chips given to us; they were a great topping for the ramen. Service was friendly, if not a little slow, but I would definitely come back to try out more of their ramen bowls."}
{"text":"Portion size is BIG Tastes is GREAT Price is REASONABLE  I recommend to make a reservation if you dont want to wait long."}
{"text":"Love ramen and we'd heard good things about the chili gomae so we tried it last Saturday night. Hostess was curt and cold..oh well.  I ordered the chili gomae and my wife ordered the shio ramen. We ordered edamame and a cucumber roll for my son and a spider roll to share.  The chili gomae's broth has a nice spice and taste to it but I was disappointed with the noodles and the ground pork. Wish they made their own noodles and I'll ask to get BBQ pork IF I ever go back. The shio ramen' broth wasn't very flavourful.  DO NOT order the spider roll!  Worst one I've had ever..pretty confident the crab was canned.  As well, everything was overpriced in our opinion, especially based off the quality.  The price for tea is $1.50 on the menu, which they charged each person for even though they only bring out one pot..so, overall we don't recommend Shikiji.  Try Shiki Menya if u can get there in time!"}
{"text":"I can't believe the best ramen, since noodle row in Tokyo, is right here so close . We've tried many since our trip to Japan. But only the top reviewed, I must say the difference and authentic flavours are huge over the competition. I've almost decided this must be the best . Very well done!"}
{"text":"We ordered tempura udon (my favorite), unagi don, and one of their special roll (I think it had some fried avocado). Everything was very very delicious! The tempura was done just right, and the broth of udon was simple yet great. You can never go wrong with unagi don. Also the roll was so yummy. I will definitely visit again when I am in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Poor ambiance and overly salty food.    Music was strangely loud for such a small and mostly empty restaurant.  We could not hear what our server was saying.  Our server certainly couldn't hear us. We were not surprised that our order did not arrive correctly.  Everyone at our table found the food to be too salty. The soy ramen in particular was just too salty to eat. The ramen broth lacked the rich flavor one expects - mostly it just tasted like salt and OXXO gravy in water.     Perhaps it was just an off day for Shikiji (or me!) but there are more enjoyable noodle houses than this one."}
{"text":"Shikiji was very likely the best tasting sushi that I've had in this city.   The Sake was...intoxicating.  The service was also very helpful and polite.  Unfortunatley I found the atmosphere very loud, possibly thats to be expected on a Friday night though. Parking was a bit sub par too.  All in All it was a good expierience.  4 harajuku girls out of five."}
{"text":"Loved it! Everything was delicious and our server was lovely. The popcorn shrimp was perfectly cooked and delicious! The raman and kimchi was some of the best I've had. I will definitely return to this place. *Note* We called ahead and made a reservation which was a good thing because it was very busy when we arrived (Saturday around 7:30pm)."}
{"text":"Ok...I must admit that I don't love it. The soup is good and I can see why people love it but I much prefer Vietnamese satay soup. However, I did try the beef curry and it was delicious. If Shikiji were closer, I would go back to try it again."}
{"text":"Ate here on a friday night with my foodie friend. I was particularly happy but I remembered that I was not the biggest fan of their broth. Maybe it was just my personal preference. However, they are generous with vegetables which is always a plus! I'd say this is now my second fave ramen place in the city after shiki menya! I also love how they let you grind your own sesame seeds."}
{"text":"Shikiji was serving ENDANGERED SPECIES (bluefin tuna) as their sushi special tonight.   My husband and I went to Shikiji tonight and received terrible customer service. The waiter came to our table and told us about their specials, including bluefin tuna sashimi. Since this was the species featured in the documentary about overfishing practices around the world, \"The End of the Line\", and also the cult classic 'Jiro Dreams of Sushi\", I asked, \"Isn't that an endangered species\"? The waiter said he didn't know anything about that, but in his opinion, 'everything's going to be endangered anyways'. I asked twice where they sourced the fish, and he tried to deflect my question by asking 'what is ethical and what is unethical anyways'? We decided to leave the restaurant after his rude and nihilistic behaviour, at which he wouldn't even let us peacefully leave. He tried one last time to stop us, saying \"I admire your beliefs, but if you understood the world, you would think differently\". UNBELIEVABLE.  The server was incredibly rude, and had no respect for the planet or his customers, and also no knowledge of what he was serving. This experience was unforgiveable - we will never go back."}
{"text":"I've been three times now and I've never been disappointed.  Twice I've had the sushi and once the ramen.  Left with a full tummy and completely satisfied all three times.    My last visit was on a Monday just over a month ago and I was sad to learn their Monday Martini day was no longer as the website stated, but I did enjoy a cocktail anyhow.  The fact that the website was misleading lost them a star.    The staff is always friendly and helpful.  There was some math problem over the bill at the end, but was easily worked out."}
{"text":"Wow! Absolutely delicious Chili-Goma Ramen. Soo freakin' good. The broth is hearty with just enough of a spicy kick. The ground pork is nicely seasoned as well.   I ordered it once with extra BBQ Chashu pork, which was incredible, but a little too much to finish. The second time I came here, I just ordered the Chili-goma by itself and that was just enough. Also, the tako-yaki here is quite good. Rare to find.   The miso ramen here is decent, but if you're not getting the Chili-Goma Ramen, you're wasting your money here."}
{"text":"Mmmmm mmmm my tummy is satisfied.  I went to Shikiji for lunch today.  It's a great place for a hot bowl of Japanese ramen on such a cold day.    I like the Japanese interior design.  I found it's very nifty.  Yup, my friend and I went crazy today at lunch.  We ordered 2 appetizers (taki yaki and small assorted tempura) and 1 California rolls on top of our big bowl of noodles (Chili Goma Ramen).    This was my first time trying their Chili Goma Ramen.  Thanks to my friend for the recommendation!  It was de-lic-ious!  I really love how flavorful the soup base is.  Also my first time trying their taki yaki (which is octopus balls), it was ok.  It does smell and taste a bit too fishy, so if you don't like fishy stuffs, don't get this appetizer.  Also I found that there are too much batter, so I am not a big fan of that either.  There are 6 octopus balls for one order.  Pretty good size for an appetizer for a group of 3 to 6 people.    The waiter we had was in training.  He was attentive and polite.  Actually I have always had good experience with Shikiji, so I am not surprised that the waiter-in-training is good."}
{"text":"Good food good service. I'd give 5 stars but I rarely find a bad sushi restaurant and I can't give them all 5 stars! Although, my friends had the ramen noodle bowls and said these are the best in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Always wondered what was behind these walls and finally found out.  3 of us shared the tako yaki. Battered was cooked the whole way through and great tako yaki sauce on top, with good portion of bonito flakes.  I had the bbq pork ramen (scallions, bok choi, six piece bbq pork, soy soup base) and it was the right amount of saulty tasty broth.  Friend had the same but with lean pork. You could notice the difference between ours. More meat than fat on her slices for sure.  The boy had chili goma ramen (scallions, ground pork, bamboo shoots, shiitake, spicy sesame soup base). He liked the chilli flavour and said he would have it again. Was definitely hot enough.  Noodles in all 3 dishes were excellent and cooked to perfection. Can see why this restaurant has been around log before ramen became popular in Calgary."}
{"text":"Have always been for sushi but never the ramen.  Have fallen in love with the chilli goma ramen.  Extremely flavourful and filling. Well worth it!  Accommodate takeout requests in 15min.  Bonus!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I always order the chili Goma ramen with the pork toro. Broth is flavorful with just enough spice. Pork toro is tender and the fat is melt in your mouth good...probably the best part!"}
{"text":"First came to Shikiji on a friend's referral. Try the chili ramen soup he says...  OMG. You have to come for the chili ramen soup! Deadly good. Huge. Similar to a Vietnamese sate soup but about 1000x better.   Home made noodles. Delicious broth. Make sure you ask for the garlic and sesame to crush up!  The sushi is also tremendous, the staff is friendly and fast   Shikiji is a small restaurant - it is usually VERY busy. Reserve a table if you're coming during the lunch or dinner rush. They do close in between lunch and dinner. So no late afternoon soup for you!  Parking is a bit of a pain on the south side of the building. There is a few spots closest to the road and several more near the back of the lot on the left. Make sure you park in a Shikoku spot.   This place is awesome! Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and great service!  Hiyashi chuka noodles were chewy and delicious and just like in Japan.  Make reservations; the place is busy!"}
{"text":"We were a little disappointed with the ramen here. We had the miso and shio and both of the broths lacked depth. The shio had way too much wakame and was overpowering for such a tame broth.  Ambiance was ok, we sat near the back and could hear the kitchen, since there wasn't really any music playing. The restaurant was clean.  The prices were pretty much on the mark where they should be. And service was fast and courteous.  Overall, a mediocre experience. We probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is great. The space is a little crowded when it gets busy, but the atmosphere and service is really nice.   PSA: The lunch time bento boxes they sell for $14.85 are an INCREDIBLE deal. You get an insane amount of delicious food and they have lots of combination options including sushi, tempura, beef and chicken dishes. They also are served with rice, salad and miso soup. I very reasonably could have eaten half and then saved the rest for dinner, but it was so good I stuffed my face.   The sushi prices are pretty standard for Calgary, as with the ramen. I have only tried the miso ramen, and it was very good with the option of lean or fatty pork.   This is definitely one of the best options for Japanese food in the city."}
{"text":"Food: 2.5/5 Service: 3.5/5 Ambiance: 3/5 Overall Rating: 3/5 (With heavy rating on food)  1 - Terrible; would not recommend and will not return. 2 - Poor; would not recommend. 3 - Average; nothing to rave about, would not be my first choice. 4 - Great; highly recommend and would go back. 5 - Fantastic; a rare score, restaurant with over-the-top and exceptional food and service.  **********************************************************************************  It's been a long time since I've visited Shikiji. This time around, I came to try the sushi which people recommended was good.   Shikiji is a fairly small restaurant with about 10 tables and a few \"chef's table\" seating in front of the sushi prep area. The decor was simple, modern, and casual with a dark mahogany finish. It wasn't gimicky or had tacky pictures of sushi along the walls like some places.   Our server was friendly, refilling our glasses of water often and the food came out fairly quick despite most tables being filled.   Shikiji is a nice place to visit, but I rate it lower in the sushi department compared to other Japanese restaurants. Although the sashimi tasted fairly fresh, it didn't seem much different to me and was pricey. A slice of sashimi salmon/tuna was $2.30/each and toro was $3.60.   You will find generic rolls such as Rainbow, Spider, Spicy tuna/salmon, tempura rolls, etc... Overall, I found the rolls to be too loosely packed, had more rice than filling, and lacked flavour.  - Salmon Mango Roll ($13 for 8 pieces) with salmon, mango, avocado, cucumber, tobiko: Was heavily packed with cucumber with very little salmon slices.  - House Special Roll ($6.50 for 4 pieces or $12 for 8 pieces) with salmon, tuna, shrimp, lettuce, avocado, capelin roe: Too much rice-to-filling ratio and fell apart when I picked it up.  - Prawn Tempura Roll ($10.50 for 8 pieces) with prawn tempura, flying fish roe, lettuce, spicy mayo sauce: Was my least favourite roll. It was like eating lettuce with rice and an overly sweet teriyaki sauce on top.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shikiji-japanese-noodles-and-sushi-calgary?select=e6ZdSX5SAOd255lIGMHS1w#e6ZdSX5SAOd255lIGMHS1w  - Large tempura ($13) with 4 prawn and 4 vegetables: The tempura was greasy and the batter was too thick. Would not recommend. I did appreciate the waitress giving my friend and I our own dipping sauce.  Overall, I do not rate Shikiji high on my list of destinations for sushi/sashimi, but the ramen is still some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite sushi place! I found this place, as a Japanese friend of my, raved about the ramen, so I told her I'm always up for trying a new place, and I trust her judgement over mine.  They have a delicious plum wine, that comes in a super cool glass, so that is always a must when I go, even the hubs will have a couple sips and he is not a wine person.   I've actually stepped out of my usual order here, as they do have tons of noodle bowls, and some GF (the buckwheat noodles, soba are gluten free). The soups are awesome when it's cold outside and you just want the warm hug feeling.  I've also smashed on some serious sushi to. Again the stuff I order is GF, and have never felt ill after going there.   It is pretty busy, so reso can be recommended, or just go at an unusual time. Awesome servers, they have great timing of when to check on you.   Definitely my top pick when picking sushi."}
{"text":"I love the food here,it is always the first choices when we are traveling to the Calgary. We ordered the spice ramen ,tempera, Unage don. Food is nice. Service is ok, but  they entered tips for you, not let you to choose."}
{"text":"I must say this use to be my most favourite place for ramen in Calgary... but it has since changed---service is mediocre which may attribute to why the drop in rating but generally food is good!"}
{"text":"Better than the majority of Canadian Japanese. Restaurants  But still middle of the road for flavor  Had the wild veg soba cold dish and pork gyoza, both very authentic but not super tasty  For ramen huge bowls and very savory, the lunch bento box a also a hit with my co-diners   I am not sure why all the fives in the reviews, in my book if you get a five you probably have your own cooking show.   Should be a 3 1/2 but will go with a 3 to offset the number of 5s handed out already"}
{"text":"For lunch, I ordered a bento box with sashimi and sushi. The sushi was great - rice was not mushy or too vinegary. The sashimi was fresh but cut in irregular shapes, a bit ragged. The tempura was a bit oily. Good value - $13.00. The octopus balls are okay, nothing special. However, the nabeyaki udon is fantastic. Such a huge portion, delicious broth, and a very healthy portion of tempura. I don't like ramen noodles (period), but my boyfriend loved their miso ramen noodles. He lived in Japan for a while, and declared it as good as his favourite noodle places in Kyoto.  While delicious, Wa's doesn't charge for their equally delightful tea. Oh well, this place still rocks."}
{"text":"Shio ramen with fatty pork... One of the best noodle soup dishes I've tried.  Never disappoints.  Some folks find it a bit salty but it is fine as a flavoring as I don't typically drink the soup by itself.  Watch out if you have a peanut allergy as they use peanut flavoring for this soup base. Sushi is always fresh.  Yakatori don is terrific say the kids.  and the calamari appetizer is delicious. Service is typically friendly and efficient.  Great place to dine as plenty of great dishes to experience."}
{"text":"Good Ambient, friendly & good services. Our server Brenda was awesome. Foods are very flavorful & a bit over the salty & greasy side. Over all pretty good!"}
{"text":"I choose to eat at this restaurant after looking at the good ratings on Yelp.  I came here for dinner by myself and parked in the back alley of the restaurant.  It was only 8 p.m. but it was kinda dark back there, but don't worry... I am still alive to tell you about my experience ^_^. The restaurant was fairly busy for a Sunday night and that is always a good sign.  I was seated facing a wall (I guess that's what I get for dining by myself) and after a few minutes a waitress came by and asked if I wanted water. I said yes and she said \"Can I see ID?\" What??!? I asked her to repeat the question and again I heard \"Can I see ID?\" \"For water? You want my ID?\" She looked at me and said slowly \"Are you READY?\" Maybe it was just me or the music, but wow... I really couldn't understand her... I guess she didn't like me after that, because she never came back to my table... Another waitress came to help me.  That's ok, she was nicer ^_^. I wanted to try their chili pork ramen and I asked for no bamboo shoots.  The waitress told me it was already mixed with the ground pork... Bummer! I ordered California rolls, Avocado rolls and Spicy Shrimp rolls.  The CA rolls and the Avocado rolls were good and the Spicy Shrimp rolls were delicious.  Made with real crab and shrimp, they were sweet and very refreshing in my mouth.  LOVED it!!!  I absolutely plan to come back here again next time I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"Make reservations!!!!! Got there when they open at 5 on Sunday and they were a full house. We got a table because we were the first people in. Food portions are big. Service was okay.   Had the Chili Goma Raman it was good. Wish it had a bit more veggie in it. My bf had the Katsu curry don which was good, the beef in the curry was so tender. Would go again if I was in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place is super busy. There was a line up before we got ourselves a table. I guess also because of the busy 16th avenue location. They  have good selection of food. Friendly staff. We tried their salmon fingers which was delicious. There was no fishy smell and the sauce it was served with was spicy and creamy. We also had their Chicken yakitori don. It was more sweet and lots of onion that u could barely taste anything else in the plate. However we really Udon a lot. it is hard to find hot Udon soup place in town."}
{"text":"Just another one of those crappy days in Calgary today with enough rain to cause flooding all over the city, and lightning that set a condo building ablaze, and a cold wind that makes you dig for your parka.  All that;s missing is the funnel clouds.  Oh, that was last week!    On top of feeling a little depressed, this sudden change in weather gave me a splitting headache that just wouldn't go away.  The remedy, I figured, was some shopping therapy, to be followed by a warm bowl of ramen.  After an hour at Holt Renfrew, it was off to Shikiji for the other half of the prescription.  We started off with an order of pork gyozas and an order of tuna tataki, which was a special of the day.  The gyozas were delicious, with a nice texture that was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  In fact, you get a nice burst of pork juice when you bite into one  The tuna tataki is a piece of albacore tuna that is seared on the outside and served rare on the inside.  You get six slices that is covered with shredded lettuce, red cabbage, and drizzled with some ponzu sauce ( citrus and soy).  The crispness of the veggies and the suppleness of the tuna, tied together by the sharp acidity of the ponzu sauce proved to be a nice combination.  When I ordered the ramen with the miso broth and bbq pork, my server asked if I'd prefered it lean or fatty.  Fatty, of course.  The only other place that offered me a choice was Kintaro's in Vancouver.  Yeah, I know animal fat ain't good for you but it's better than the lean stuff that most places serve which tends to taste like cardboard.  In fact, the two pieces of fatty pork that was served in the ramen was so succulent ( it melt in the mouth), I ordered a side order for $4.00 more ( 4 slices).   My GF had the curry katsu don which is a breaded piece of pork cutlet served on a bed of rice with a japanese curry sauce, which is milder than an Indian curry.  The curry sauce, that was served on the side, was actually a beef curry as there were chunks of beef and carrots in it.  Man, talk about your double-double!  The dish also came with a bowl of miso soup.  All in all, it was a very enjoyable and inexpensive meal.  Just what the doctor ordered for such a lousy day.  In fact, as we left the restaurant, we noticed that the rain had stopped, the wind had died, and the sun was peeking through the clouds.  Heck, even my headache was gone!  On a footnote, Shikiji closes quite early, 9 pm, even on weekends.  Also you should always make a reservation if you can.  When we were there at  8pm, the place was packed with people waiting in the doorway.  Unless you have a reservation, you'll likely get turned away."}
{"text":"Family was hungry and sushi hiro and zipang were closed for lunch so we decided to go to shikiji again. Thankfully, the devils spawn hostess named Jenna wasn't working.   We ordered two bentos, shio ramen and a sushi roll. Almost everything in the bentos was inedible. Tempura was fried in old oil, chicken and beef were very very tough to chew and was frankly inedible (I would place Edo Japan as a 10/10 compared to the meal we had) nigiri was sliced poorly, salad was meh. Need I say more? The sushi rolls had frozen fish inside the roll. Nice touch.   I didn't taste the ramen but my family said the noodles were overcooked and the broth tasted very different from before.   Highly suspect either the management or kitchen staff have changed."}
{"text":"It's always great to have ramen and char siu in steaming hot broth on a cold night (according to the menu, all ramen broth is pork based).  Condiments include a little mortar with a pestle to grind toasted sesame seeds into your soup and garlic flakes (vampires beware!).  Just kidding, the garlic flakes have been roasted, so they impart a wonderfully pungent flavor to your soup.   I love the portion sizes!  I haven't tried the sashimi here yet, but I had a nibble of my son's cucumber and california rolls--they were pretty good.      Please note that this restaurant closes at 9pm..."}
{"text":"It has the most amazing soy based ramen, and the pork toro is so delicous and tender. Ramen comes with garlic chips on the side which is a great topping. The chili goma is also really good. This is my favorite ramen place in Calgary"}
{"text":"Came in here on good Friday.   Didn't  make a reservation had to wait 20 minutes.   Left my name  and took a stroll down Center street.    I suggest one dish per person and not getting all gung ho and ordering your weight in ramen.   I think I'm going to poo a  noodle when I get home.  It was delicious but my udon came with plastic in it that's why they got a three."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant based on the yelp reviews and was not disappointed. I had the bento box with sashimi, sushi and tempura. The fish was fresh and the tempura batter was light. My husband had the miso black cod and it was delicious. The dish cost more than we typically pay for lunch but we do not have the opportunity to order where we live. The miso did not overpower the taste of black cod so the fish had the right balance; however, rice was not included so I shared my rice from the bento box. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Shikiji and I will definitely be back. I got tipped off from a coworker about this place and it was nothing short of expectation.   I went at 1130am on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed, luckily we got the last seats at the bar. So lesson learn't, it is handy to make a reservation here!  I had the: Chili Goma Ramen -Ground pork, green onions, shitake, bamboo shoots and noodles in a chili sesame soup base. This was exactly what I wanted on a chilly Friday afternoon to warm me up. It was so full of flavour and they definitely aren't cheap on the filings. I only made it half way through and boxed the rest for take home! So delicious.  I've heard the sushi here is amazing so I'll have to be back for another round soon!  It's a small joint along a busy street, but they make it feel warm and homey! I would recommend this place for a date night out as the lighting is romantic and intimate.   Happy Eating!  Jenn"}
{"text":"There aren't really any ramen shops in Edmonton so I was pretty excited to try Shikiji when I was in Calgary last summer.  The restaurant is located on the southeast corner of the Centre Street and 16 Avenue intersection. They have a few parking spots on the side of the building and I was lucky enough to get one. I went for lunch on a weekday and I'm glad I showed up a little early (around 11:30am) - it filled up pretty quickly after that!  I wish I could remember which ramen I ordered but in any case it came in a massive bowl, was flavourful, and had some delicious fatty pork slices laid on top. I really liked the springy noodles too. As others mentioned, the ramen comes with an assortment of little condiments like sesame seeds and roasted garlic flakes - I had never seen this before but I also haven't gone for ramen too often so maybe this is completely normal - in any case, I loved being able to customize my soup.  I also ordered a few pieces of salmon and tuna sashimi - nice thick slices, fresh and tasty.  They take credit cards and the service was decent. I'd really like to come back and try some of their other offerings - maybe the next time I'm in Calgary :)"}
{"text":"On a cold day like today I wanted something warm and spicy so went here for the Chili Goma ramen.  This is my favorite dish here.  My boys had the BBQ pork soyu ramen and the chicken udon.  Both were tasty as well.  Hubby had the bento but the sushi wasn't very fresh.  Again we don't come here for the sushi, but the ocean mango sushi is appealing and pleasing on the palette."}
{"text":"My friend rarely gets to have sushi and wanted to take me to Nami Sushi and Grill when I was in town, unfortunately, they were closed on Sunday. The next logical option was to go to Kinjo since the restaurants belong to one of our schoolmate's dad, but we settled on trying something new for her and ended up at Shikiji.   Shikiji is a smaller space and, typically, gets busy according to yelp reviews.  Luckily for us, we were only a party of two and there were a few seating open on the bar counter along the wall--that's fine with us.  We ordered three sushi rolls to share. A calamari roll, shrimp tempura roll, and salmon roll topped with mango.  I was craving a noodle soup and glad to see that they served ramen so I ended up getting the Chili Goma Ramen add corn.    The sushi rolls were pretty tasty.  Love the sweetest of the mango with the fresh salmon and appreciated the different color tobiko.  The ramen contained ground pork, green onions, shitake, bamboo shoots and noodles in a delicious chili sesame soup base.  It hit the spot and was way too much food for one person.   I would've shared my ramen, however, my friend is allergic to peanut and doesn't eat pork.    Food was good and service was great, I would come here again but I have so many other places to try next time I am in Calgary."}
{"text":"Do not understand why it gets high ratings. I had the shio ramen and it had a huge heaping of seaweed that unbalanced the entire ramen and made it fishy and taste weird like a seaweed soup, not the delicate saltiness shio is known for. They also give you a mortar to crush sesame seeds. Sure it looks cool maybe, but that totally overpowers and overwhelms the broth. Don't understand why you would ruin the taste that way. The tempura was chopped in large chunks that made it hard and raw inside. Finally, the sashimi all had a fishy taste to it, which means it's not that fresh. We went on Friday which is when I assume most sushi restaurants would get their seafood delivery. At the end, we had diarrhea afterwards.  Overall regretted the wasted dollars and calories. Tasted like a run-of-the-mill Japanese restaurant, not a yelp top ten."}
{"text":"Ever since watching a movie about the actual tradition of ramen in Japan I have been dying to have some traditionally made ramen from scratch. Finally I found this restaurant and ordered a pork ramen while Colin had the spicy ramen. I also ordered a negi toro roll. My soup was really yummy and fresh. I found the broth a little salty but other than that really flavorful. The noodles were fresh and cooked to perfection. The pork was very, very moist but I don't really eat pork so I tasted the pork then gave it to Colin. If I was a pork fan it would have been amazing by how soft and flavorful it was. The negi toro roll was one of the freshest I've ever had. The tuna was so fresh I ate Colin's rolls too. Colin didn't like his soup very much but for a good reason. It was meant to be spicy but even I didn't find it spicy and I am a real whimp with spicy things. Plus it tasted too much like peanuts. If I ordered for him again I would get him the pork ramen with spicy sauce on the side. Or the spicy soup with extra spicy and no peanuts. We had take out that night and I would love to dine in one night. They had a full bar and more rolls on the menu that looked yummy. I need to try a few more other traditional ramen restaurants before I can judge how good theirs really is. Of course if I could go to Japan I'd probably eat myself to death;)   The pork ramen was absolutely worth the drive to pick it up and I can't wait to try more items from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Not much to add to what other reviewers have said, so: just order the Chili Goma Ramen and be done with it. Great comfort food on a cold winter day (or night). The place is small, so make reservations or else be prepared to wait. Parking? Iffy."}
{"text":"My friend and I called ahead to see what the wait was and was told itd be about 30-45 minutes.  Luckily by the time we got there, we were able to be seated right away.  :).   We opted to split a bowl of ramen and sushi because we couldn't make up our minds what we wanted.  Miso ramen was pretty good.  Our server was nice enough to bring us two bowls so we could share.  We enjoyed the noodles, the broth tasted clean and had seasoning at the table if needed, the meat was yummy and it came with plenty of vegetables.  It was nice to be able to customize our bowl with specific ingredients.. Surprisingly I didn't see a soft boiled egg as an option on there... Maybe we both missed it?    House sushi roll, prawn tempura roll, and mango salmon roll were all good.  The fish tasted fresh, rice was seasoned well,  portion sizes were huge, and things were priced well.    The waitress was very timely - she checked in with us often and as soon as we were done with a dish, it was cleared away.  Definitely had a great experience here and will be back!"}
{"text":"I tend to hit up Shikiji when I meet my friends. Sadly, I have not had the famous ramen, as I am a lover of sushi! I often find myself ordering that instead.  The staff is friendly and they do an awesome job in maintaining good service regardless of how small the restaurant area is.  Maybe people don't pay as much attention to this as I do, but when I'm sitting in a restaurant, I really do listen to the music, and they play some great stuff sometimes! Anyways, back to the food. The foods good and I had the opportunity to try the Green tea tempura ice cream and that was a delight. Crazy how they made it, but it's also quite tasty! A night with my girls or my boy and it's always great service. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food was fair, service was excellent.  Staying at the Banff Springs Hotel, this restaurant was open when needed, and was tasty."}
{"text":"Bento box lunches are like a small gift from the food gods. I love them, and so I love Shikiji's lunch service because they have about ten different options for their bentos. Ten bucks gets you rice, a salad and a choice of two other options like sushi, teriyaki and tempura. I've been to lunch here about ten million times, and these bentos always leave me feeling like I'm about to explode in the very best kind of way.   Dinner service is also good. I'm a big fan of the hot Shikiji Udon soup, which is both weird (to me) and delicious. It comes with a quail egg on the side, which you cook in the hot broth. The thick, fresh udon is delicious and is topped by a fresh selection of japanese-style veggies and tempura shrimps. You then pour the broth over top so it is never soggy.   The tempura is fresh and maintains its crisp even when you dip it in the dipping sauce. And the sushi seemed to have gone downhill a while ago, but as of my last visit has regained its former glory. Even a simple sake (salmon) roll is inside out, with nori flakes and sesame seeds decorating the rice. I enjoy the spin on those simple favourites, so it is a major destination when I go out to eat."}
{"text":"Wanted to have some ramen while I was in Calgary for Stampede and found Shikijii (great name - you can't forget it, so close to kijiji!).  Anyways, the place is a bit tricky to see but if your driving, there is a parking lot just south east of the restaurant (which I clearly didn't see until after). No biggie.  Anyways, for the food, we had:  - Soy Ramen ($12) - came with a couple decent slices of bbq pork, green onions, bok choy and noodles in a soy soup base. You choose the type of noodles you want (fat or thin - I went with thin). Noodles had a nice chew to it and broth was tasty. Not salty. Also, they bring you a couple small things that you can add into your ramen if you want (dried garlic, sesame seeds, etc.). I thought it was pretty good for Calgary!  - Salmon sashimi ($11.50) - you get 5 pieces. My buddy just wanted a snack so he had that and said it was pretty darn good. Fresh and good quality sashimi.  Definitely would have liked to try more of their dishes but for sure try their ramen! Yum."}
{"text":"Was in town for the weekend and because it was a chilly day,  I figured, nothing beats the cold like a big bowl of noodles! I looked up ramen places in town and this one came up with high ratings. I also heard about the chili goma ramen so I really wanted to try that. I loveeee sesame! But maybe I should have looked at the pictures first.  When the bowl of noodles came, I knew it was going to be a bit of a problem for me. The sesame flavour turned out wonderful but the oil from the chili made my tummy turn. My tummy and excessive oil aren't friends. The flavour was also fairly strong / salty especially with the ground pork in a dark marinade so after 1/3 of the bowl, I couldn't finish. I guess it's not for everyone. I liked the concept though and the first few bites were interesting. It was a pretty big bowl too for $14. Our group also had the vegetable tempura and we loved it. The batter was perfect and it tasted super fresh. Service was fast and friendly as well. We went in around 1:30, just after lunch hour and it was still fairly busy but no wait. Maybe next time I'll stick to the original."}
{"text":"Fantastic autumn salmon and avacado roll.  The ramen is the best I've tried in Calgary thus far.  Definitely a good spot."}
{"text":"The environment of the restaurant had a good Japanese feel. In terms of food we got the chili Raman and the shio Raman.   The chili Raman was good but it had ground beef instead of pork belly which was a bit odd. The shio Raman was a salty broth, but personally for myself ( someone who loves salty stuff) it shio was a bit too salty for my liking.  We were given the Raman in nice bowls but I wasn't a fan of eating with wooden chopsticks."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this place as a top-notch ramen joint and my experience fell well short and I left disappointed.   The restuarant itself is a in decent location with it's own parking available around the side, which is great. The decor and atmosphere is also perfect for this type of restaurant, and so was the service.   However, the fundamentals of a restaurant are the food, and I felt like the quality here was lacking. We had the Miso ramen, the shio ramen, and the chili goma ramen, as well as a ahi tuna poke dish.   The miso ramen broth was mediocre - not as rich and as deep as ramen broth should be. the noodles felt cheap and the contents were sparse. The flavour overall was very forgettable, and the ramen didn't even come with the customary egg. Considering this was $13, I considered it to be borderline at best.   The Shio ramen, unfortunately, was even worse. Not only was it way too salty, that was the only flavour that was present in the broth, and it had even less substance than the miso. This was a poor bowl of ramen - I would avoid it.    The Chili goma ramen was redeeming - the broth had great body and flavour and was very rich. The toppings / contents of the ramen were fairly sparse, but overall it was a pretty decent bowl of ramen (for a whopping $16).   The Tuna Poke (sashimi) was also disappointing - the 4 discernible ingredients were small tuna cubes, liberal sesame oil, green onion, and sesame seeds. That's right - no salty components, for a whole $6.5 for a small portion.   Overall, while the ambiance was great, the food quality was mediocre and the quality price ratio was poor. With so many excellent ramen joints in the city, I would see no reason to go back here unless no other options were open."}
{"text":"Chili goma ramen is a must!  You can actually get it less salty as well; you just have to ask the server."}
{"text":"One of the top 5 sushi places I have tried in Calgary, if only some of the rolls were small enough to fit in your mouth :-) The place is not too big, but the service was very good, the staff were friendly and we had a pleasant experience..."}
{"text":"Tried this place out with Missy D. last week. I have to say, I'm pretty picky when it comes to my sushi, and I usually stick with what I know. When she suggested we go here, I was a tad hesitant, but hearing that her Japanese friends approve was enough for me. She introduced me to the plum wine which was fabulous, although a tad too sweet for me. We ordered a variety of sushi, some tempura, and the ahi tuna, which was delicious. Everything tasted fresh and was served quickly and hot. The service was great and the guy at the front who took our payment was fun and friendly. Parking is a bit of a pain, but I really enjoyed it here. I'll definitely return next time I'm in the area and craving sushi!"}
{"text":"I have bookmarked this place for a long time. I was told they have the best ramen. Well came here with a couple colleagues and I have to say the walk to this restaurant from downtown is super far. Overall our lunch took 2 hrs return and back. Don't recommend walking if you work downtown.  So sat down and I realized they have other selections, not just ramen. Bento boxes ... Hmmmm.... Well I just ended up going for the miso ramen because I was told that was good. Bowl size big, food portion ok. two pieces of fatty meat. I liked it. Not bad. Broth is tasty. Not too salty.   Also if you come during lunch time, its not that busy.   Overall, I liked it and I recommend trying this place. I don't think parking would be hard to find if you are planning to drive."}
{"text":"Went with sis, niece and mum. Snowy Saturday, and I was determined to have my first bowl of restaurant ramen!  Seated swiftly, bentos for mum and po, miso ramen with lean pork for me.  Little G shared with all of us.  Food came very quickly. Miso soup for the two bentos, with fried tofu chunks.  Mum loved it! At the same time i received my ramen accoutrements: chili oil, garlic, toasted sesame seeds, chili spice and a small mortar and pestle.  Smelled and tasted all, but was not quite sure of how to mix them all in......  The portions were huge, and well priced. 13 dollar bento, such great quality and portion size.  Grace wanted noodles so I gave her some from my bowl, but there was such a generous selection of veggies atop my soup, i had to dig for them.  Not a bad thing by any means! The miso broth was lovely, salty, gingery and hearty. The lean pork was two generous slices, tenderloin sized. I think bobo and i could have shared the bowl was so large, but of course, he'd say, \"hey, get your own!\".  Fantastic.  The first Japanese meal we've had where mum was eager to go back!"}
{"text":"Cute Japanese restaurant. I had soy ramen and it was good but I have had better. Can't complain though! Tako yaki (octopus dumplings) were pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what my fascination is with fish flakes, but I get such a kick out of ordering them and watching the little flakes come alive on top of a hot dish as they do on the tako yaki (octopus dumplings) at Shikiji.  Shikiji's a lovely little spot, I enjoyed platefuls of the salmon tempura, avocado/cucumber, and calamari rolls. Fave though was the ocean mango roll.   I'm not the type to eat sushi more than once every couple of months, but as an average sushi aficionado, you'd find me back at Shikiji! It's close to home, it's got free parking and I liked the variety and the ambiance of the restaurant... ok, maybe because of the fish flakes too."}
{"text":"Tried the chili goma ramen bowl with extra fatty pork that people raved about on Yelp. Broth had a strong sesame flavour that I enjoyed and was nicely spiced but the noodles were average and soft, not al dente as I hoped.   We also had a salmon mango roll. Nicely presented but the sushi rice was slightly more sour than anticipated.   Service is excellent with attentive staff and it was a decent meal to fill me up on a cold Calgary day. I think the hype on Yelp may have set my expectations higher than they should have been. Overall, a good place to fill your tummy but no gastronomic ah- ha moments here."}
{"text":"This is a cute little sushi lounge with speedy service and decent food. They have some of the classics like spicy tuna roll, seaweed salad but my favourite by far was the hand made veggie gyoza. The Japanese pyrogi!  If you're driving by I would stop in to try it for sure !"}
{"text":"I have been to Shikiji several times for both Lunch and Dinner. My wife and I have been to several Sushi restaurant in the city, this is our favorite. We always have great service and the sushi is always fresh. The rolls have a generous portion of fish and are very flavourful. We always order Rainbow Roll, House Special Roll (massive roll) and the Prawn Tempura roll. I also like the Cajun Shimp Amebi. I have heard the noodle bowls and rice dishes are fantstic. I always say I'm gonna order one, but once I get there I go for sushi. I work in the hos[itality industry and have recommended Shikiji to several guests, always get a positive response. You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was great. I had the miso udon, a spivey scallop cone and shrimp tempura. It was all very lovely"}
{"text":"Our intrepid friend Angelo is always on the lookout for new places of culinary adventure, and we came here one night at his behest. It is a considerable distance away, and we always compensate for this by ordering a wide variety of items to try out. Because we were in a ramen mood, I think two-thirds of our table ordered some variety of their ramen (I had the pork) as well as some sushi; let's face it, if you are in a Japanese restaurant, you need to get sushi. The smoked salmon was divine, very fresh and flavorful, and although the ramen didn't blow me away, it was filling and satisfying. The interior design is also warm and unique, and quite cozy. If you are in the area, definitely try it out, though be warned: they do close from 2-5, so don't get there at ten to two expecting lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is probably the best ramen restaurant in Calgary. Sushi is so-so. If you're going during peak hours, a reservation is probably smart. There isn't a lot of seating inside. It isn't designed to host a big party either."}
{"text":"Great ramen! The rice bowl left a bit to be desired. I'll have to come back to try out the sushi but overall very good service and food."}
{"text":"Every time I go here I order sushi -- some of the cooked meals look good, but that would mean eating less sushi.  Every time it has been quick, fresh, and very tasty.  It's often busy here, but it is worth the wait!  The sushi and sashimi pieces do cost a bit more than some other places in Calgary, but it's worth it for the freshness and good service!  It will be pricey if you order a lot of sushi and/or alcohol, but it's also definitely possible to eat here for under $15."}
{"text":"Best sushi and ramen I've had in Alberta so far! Cute little spot just up from downtown, cozy inside. Fast and professional service. But the best part is food quality! Nice and thick ramen with tasty flavor and lots of veggies, shio and miso are to die for! Fish is fresh, rolls are huge with a good amount of rice (house roll is the best). And the prices are just so reasonable! Its a gem for me, will return every time I'm in YYC"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great sushi at a decent price in a nice and clean setting.  I generally go there for lunch so can't really comment on the evening menu/cost.  Lunch menu boxes, however, are affordable and delicious.  The Japanese style fried rice is awesome.    My only minor gripe is that they often close with unclear notice in the early part of the week and i've too often been locked out of one of my favorite Sushi restaurants with a dying urge to eat raw fish."}
{"text":"3.5/5 We decided to try a new ramen place today and Shikiji seemed to have some decent reviews! A bit difficult to spot, this place in on Centre St, just south of  16 Ave NW on the east side of the street... I missed the parking lot that was available but found side street parking pretty easily anyhow.  It was fairly empty and there was no music so the ambience wasn't fantastic, but that's not what I came for today... today I just came ravenous for ramen! The service was fast and decent and the place seemed clean.  Prices seemed pretty average for ramen except for the one I ordered. I didn't really look at the sushi much so can't really comment there... although I did see $4 nigiri which is ridiculous in my opinion unless you're going to a high end establishment.    On to the good stuff   I ordered the chili goma ramen and my husband had the miso ramen and tuna poke. The latter wasn't too expensive by Calgary standards but I was rather disappointed nonetheless... 2.5/5  The fish had good melt in your mouth texture, but I wouldn't really be able to explain the taste of it since the entire thing was smothered in sesame oil.  ..... I love sesame oil.... I am Chinese and was probably Japanese in another life and sesame oil is like liquid gold as far as I'm concerned .... however, rather than bringing this dish to life, they put so much on that it was smothered to death. Rant over.  The chili gomae ramen was pretty good! I would give this dish a 3.5/5 since the broth was rich and had a nice depth of flavour, with sesame and pork at the forefront. The ground pork was also well seasoned and cooked. While the broth and pork were nice, it was too oily and there was nothing to cut through that. And worst of all.... the noodles were overcooked... overcooked ramen noodles kills me and brings down the score significantly.  As for the miso ramen, I only tried a bit of the broth. It was nice and rich, but was a bit too salty for what I'm used to. It looked to have tonnes of veggies which is what I saw when my food envy kicked in! My husband did really like his dish though and said he'd be back.  Overall I prefer Menyatai. I would be interested to go back to ikemen and try some of their more modern and interesting bowls as their classics didn't overly impress me but I'd like to compare and see. I'd eat here again but it wouldn't be my first choice.  Happy slurping!"}
{"text":"Excellent place! I ordered miso ramen with extra pork. Noodle is great! Meat is impeccable!"}
{"text":"I've been to Shikiji a couple of times. Friends of mine have said it's their favourite sushi restaurant by far and my husband says it's his favourite noodle house in Calgary. The sushi is very good but I find it a little bit pricey. The ramen is very well priced at $10, especially for what you get. They bring a mortar and pestle with sesame seeds, a little bottle of hot chili oil, a little jar of dried garlic, so you can season it to your taste. The soy broth was delicious as was the pork. The noodles were quite good as well. Although I really enjoyed it, I wouldn't say it was my favourite. The salmon sashimi I ordered as an appy though was delicious! Not sure if I was loving sushi more today than usual, but it was such buttery textured tasty salmon! We also ordered the Uni Uni roll and while the unagi on top was very delicious and a nice thick cut (no skimping there!), it was lacking in the rest of the roll which was just filled with cucumber and a bit of roe. $17 for a 8-piece roll seemed steep. The service was fast, friendly and efficient. I would certainly return for another meal but would try a different roll."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, place was packed but they were able to seat out party of 5 quickly. Menu has a good variety from sushi to ramen. I ordered the chili goma ramen.  Full of flavor, rich broth and perfectly cooked noodles.  Service was quick and servers were attentive, always making sure our water glasses were filled.  Will go back."}
{"text":"Never been to a ramen restaurant in YYC before so when a friend raved about trying this place we had to check it out.   Parking is limited but there is a lot across Center Ave you can pay for.  Service was great,  our server was friendly and attentive.     I ordered the cranberry soda which was very delicious,  but a bit pricey at $4.   My husband had a sake box shot,  which is basically a small glass of sake in a small wooden box that gets over poured -  so you have the sake glass then drink the rest of the sake from the box.   Interesting,  and he seemed to enjoy it!   For food we had the assorted tempura as an appetizer,  the batter was light and crunchy and came with enough to share between four people fairly evenly.   Everyone told me I had to try the chili goma ramen -  I'm sure glad I did!   The pork and the peanut /sesame broth was to die for.   I loved everything about it,  and will definitely be going back again for more!"}
