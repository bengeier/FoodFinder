{"text":"A coworker brought me lunch for this place and their fish was delicious. The fried rice was good as well, not greasy like most Chinese food places. I decided to grab some dinner from there that night and I was disappointed with beef stir fry. A bit rubbery, but the rice was just as good as the rice I had for lunch. I tried some of my sisters sesame chicken and I was hooked immediately. The egg roll was really dark brown and was probably fried for too long... Would definitely go again for the sesame chicken. Really low prices too as my dish was a bit over 8 bucks after taxes. Really small joint, no place to sit and eat. Best for take out"}
{"text":"Prices are very reasonable. General Tao chicken is a fam fav at my house. My husband loves the chicken wings. Now with that said... It is nothing too fancy just your typical Chinese take out. They do lunch specials which are pretty cheap for the amount you get. Also you can get dinner meals for 2,3or more that are pretty reasonable also. All in all decent for the price and gets a recommend if in the area"}
{"text":"Probably the best China take out in the area.. Food is fresh and very tasteful. You won't be disappointed. You won't wait longer than 5-10 min.. Try them out"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better places for Chinese food in the area. Have ordered from here multiple times and always satisfied :)."}
{"text":"Not the best, but definitively tasty and convenient. Since this location only does take-out or delivery there is virtually no wait. My husband and I always get their lemon chicken as it delicious, but we always found the chicken fried rice to be a miss. It is very cheap and great for a busy weeknight when you just don't want to cook.

{"text":"Never ever order from the place. You won't get it delivered. I waited over 1 1/2 hours after I was told 45 minutes. I kept phoning and they kept lying saying the driver was on his way. I finally drove over to pick it up only to be told the driver had a fight with the manager no smashed my delivery on the floor. I have never dealt with any establishment so unprofessional. The food is ok but inconsistent so this time I'm done with them. There are plenty of other Chinese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Very good.  Very greasy.

It's a hole in the wall.  A dive.  But, man oh man their food is crazy tasty.  I don't know a single person who has had their food that doesn't absolutely love it!

Kids always order their sweet & sour chicken balls. We always order the crab rangoons and spring rolls (not the egg rolls), general tao chicken too.

They offer a discount for pick-up and cash payments as well as a free appetizer item when you spend over a certain amount of money; BUT you have to ask for it cause they never offer it."}
{"text":"Oh how sweet it is to have a Chinese place that's open seconds from home.

This place is tiny, and only take out or delivery. By far the fastest service. Pick up is ready in 10minutes. No lie. Every time we have parties at my place, we feed the hungover folks with this the next day and it's ready within minutes. 
To be frank, the thought of how fast it's ready scares me. But also makes my tummy quite happy. win win?
Also, open on every major holiday. xmas and New Years included ^_^

My go to order

dinner for two: $17.95
2 egg rolls - not the greatest. They almost always seem too soft or old. I usually ask to substitute this for spring rolls. 
sweet and sour ribs - my friend swears these are the best ever made
chkn fried rice - VERY portion friendly. The rice is not too over cooked. Just perfect. They stuff the container. You can share this with 4 people, easy!
general Tao - WOWZERS. Delicious! tender, juicy, saucy and just the right amount of spicy with sweet. 

OR
dinner for 2: $22.252 
spring rolls - yummyyy. Always fresh. Flaky and the perfect amount of veggies stuffed. 
sesame chicken - perfectly cooked. Goes really well with the rice. 
beef and broccoli - This dish is very saucy. Don't expect the broc. to be fresh. With all the sauce and beef, you won't notice. 
chkn fried rice  - always a plus. 

They have a ton of specials. The portions are very big and can be shared easily by 4 people."}
{"text":"Food is tasty and prices are reasonable. I love the jar doo chicken wings and their chicken corn soup! Big portions with the combos. A must try for sure!"}
{"text":"been surviving on ChINA China take outs for all of my high school yrs awww good o'days! Love love it no matter what!"}
{"text":"Got some take out from this place the other day and it was awesome! The portions they give you for the price you pay is amazing. $8 for a lunch special of a huge box of general tso chicken and chicken fried rice (and an egg roll) and I couldn't even finish it all! I called in to order and they said its ready in 10 minutes so I drove right over and when I walked in it was ready immediately. The General tso chicken is probably one of the best general tso I've had in a long time and it was super fresh!"}
{"text":"Love going here when I'm craving Chinese food, it's not too expensive and it's near by. The food is good quality but a bit greasy. The Sweet and Sour Chicken Balls are great with the Mixed Vegetables and Fried Rice."}
{"text":"This is our go to Chinese delivery place. Food is hot, fresh, and delivered reasonable quickly. They have the best chicken balls; relatively smaller than you are probably used to but very little dough.   Other favourites are General Tso's Chicken and Shrimp Lo Mein.  Portion size is decent."}
{"text":"3.5* stars. A total dive with greasy fare that ended up being pretty delicious on an empty stomach. Picture white bathroom tiles covering half the walls. Metal tables and plain chairs. Floors spotty with age. This place ain't fancy, not by a long shot. But if you look past the very dated decor, you'll find very charming owners, sweet service, reasonable prices, larger portion sizes, and an overall decent meal. 

Located in the same plaza as the Mississauga Applewood Valu-Mart, we dropped by on a Saturday afternoon and ordered the C11 combo which included an egg roll, chicken fried rice, 4 pieces of crispy chicken wings, two fortune cookies, and for an extra $1.00, we replaced the sweet & sour chicken balls with sweet and crispy general tao chicken. Overall, the meats were pretty delicious albeit reallllyyyy greasy and deep fried - but if that's what you're craving, it'll taste delicious to you. The chicken wings were crunchy and dusted perfectly with some seasoning. The general tao chicken (white meat) was sweet with good texture. However, the chicken fried rice was pretty bland and needed a bit of a kick (or some salt). Overall, if you're looking for deep fried Chinese greasy goodness in the area, with bigger portions, at a reasonable price point, this isn't a bad choice at all. 

Note that they also have lunch specials for around $7.00. Our total for the C11 combo, with tax, came to $11.02."}
{"text":"Has anyone tried China chinas French fries ? I'm addicted and need too know what ingredients are on the fries obviously the won't tell me so someone please help lol. Thank you other than that I've only tries there chicken wings and fries and it's pretty good! (Only while fresh)"}
{"text":"I usually just order delivery from them. I do like some of their dishes but its a hit or miss sometimes.. theres no consistency since its a little too salty or a little too sweet. But its not too bad to be honest, I would order from them again (which I do)."}
{"text":"Friendly faces, fresh/hot food, affordable prices... What more could you ask for? This is of course Americanized greasy Chinese food but hey... That's what I like! I ordered the combination platter for one... Came with these amazing chicken wings, chicken balls but I substituted it for lemon chicken (extra$1 to substitute), chicken fried rice and an egg roll but I also substituted It for a spring roll (.50 to substitute)... Meal was devoured! Hidden gem I've driven by for years! Try it out! You won't be disappointed!

Side note: Chicken wings were definitely the star of the meal. Fried rice needs a bit of work."}
{"text":"We've only tried their other location at 1125 Bloor and it's actually not too bad.  I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and it was very fresh, not oily and the portion was way more than enough for one person!  My husband ordered the Crispy Beef, which was more like \"Soggy\" Beef; wasn't cooked well on the inside either so it had to be thrown out.  He also ordered the Pork Fried Rice which I would give 7.5/10 but he thought it was just mediocre.  My neighbour had the General Tso Chicken and loved it!  It was a huge portion as well and could easily be stretched out for two to three meals.  Bottom line: prices were quite reasonable so my neighbour and I would go there again for the dishes we ordered but not sure if we'd venture out into anything else as the rest of the menu items look very Canadian-Chinese."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Placed an order for food and was told 20 minutes later that they were canceling my order. Order was placed 45 minutes before posted closing time. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I would take a bullet for the person(s) who makes the sesame chicken. 15/10 holy crap. Also huge portions. You can feed 5 from one container."}
{"text":"Smiling people, fresh cooked, delicious meals and affordable prices. Just one concern, there is no AC for summer."}
{"text":"Typical Greasy Chinese food. I order chicken balls, chili chicken, chicken fried rice and shrimp rolls. I really enjoyed the chicken balls, they were different, not the typical big round dough w chicken inside. These were a box full of mini chicken drops the size of your thumb nail, which again i quite enjoyed alot . The chilli chicken was dry and not spicy enough. I am used to having the wet version almost like a general Tso with more spice and red in colour. It was ok but not preferred. The chicken fried rice was also very dry and definitely not fresh, but eatable, i mean its pretty basic cant really screw that up. Lastly the shrimp rolls have no shrimp at all, either they messed up and gave me spring rolls instead or they are just very stingy on the shrimp meat.
I think next time we will try somewhere else as we just moved to the area and are trying to find a reg Chinese food spot."}
{"text":"My work orders food from here very often as it is very cheap and they are definitely not stingey with the amount of food they give you. They also do delivery which is another plus and very convenient for companies such as mine to order good Chinese takeout. They deliver the food pretty fast as well (and that's ordering food for 10 people). As for the food, it's great. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Worst tasting food ever. Though I'm a lover of Chinese food, this place succeeded in turning me off for good."}
