{"text":"Ignored by 3 people while I waited at the counter for too long. Too bad, pastries looked good but I won't be back now."}
{"text":"This restaurant has absolutely horrible service and the owner Christina was terrible to deal with. From the beginning they weren't too friendly and had an air of anger and distraction. We should have taken that as a red flag. Unfortunately we went ahead and placed a very large order for an event which was a few days away. When we tried to pick up our order she increased the price she quoted us by $55! We had written down her original quote over the phone and what she confirmed in person when we went to place the order. It was my friend who was picking up the order so I tried calling to clarify that there was no mix up with our order....I actually was going to pay the newly inflated price but guess what? Each time I called she purposely hung up the phone on me. This was witnessed by my friend who was still in the restaurant. She says Christina was yelling \" why is she calling me? The price isn't gonna change\". My sister was able to eventually get through and Christina proceeded to yell at her and insist we MADE UP a price! How can a customer randomly make up an exact price? This was not only a very negative experience it was very strange and I would NEVER go back there or recommend it to anyone. Anyone with such negative energy shouldn't be feeding people. We did not end up getting our order from her as she was extremely rude and unreasonable. She was more interested in trying to bully us and probably thought she could get away with it since we needed food for an event. We gave our business to another restaurant which treated us respectfully as paying customers. I wish I could give zero stars."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken, bife a casa and fish dishes.  Call way in advance if you are looking to pick up a few chickens for dinner......If they tell you it will be 25 minutes, expect to wait 45 minutes."}
{"text":"I like the hot food and baked goods here quite well, though their potatoes don't match up to some other Portuguese spots in Peel. The custard tarts are great, naturally, and the other stuff's good, too. I often pick up their small buns, which are fantastic!   I was going to rate this place four stars, but the service is completely unreliable. Staff are generally polite enough (and today the service was fantastic) but usually it takes a long time to get attention and the service is forgetful at best and non-existent at worst.   I definitely go here from time to time, but it's not a place I ever foresee feeling like a regular."}
{"text":"Mostly go there to pick up a BBQ chicken to go. Nice that they cook it over coal, and their hot sauce is indeed hot, with a nice unique flavour. Tbh, I haven't even used their bakery much, which is funny since I live so close. Maybe I'll update my review down the road when I try more of their stuff. Still, great place to pick up a chicken! (I'd recommend calling ahead for it)"}
{"text":"Excellent parties, fresh bread and a delicious selection of Portuguese entres. Specializing in grilled chicken, and excellent custard tarts."}
{"text":"It was Friday afternoon and the rain was pouring hard. It didn't matter to me as I came here especially to try their Portuguese egg tarts and because I have not had lunch yet, I thought to try their \"famous\" barbecue chicken as well.  When I came in, people were looking at me, I wasn't sure if it's because I was kinda wet by the rain or because I am obviously asian.. I stood behind a couple who's waiting to be served, there was a woman in front of them that is just waiting  for something so I asked that woman if it the line starts where she stands.. she said she doesn't know. Then the couple skipped the line and went ahead by the counter, the cashier called them.. So I figure it was not the line where I was standing. The cashier lady gave a menu to this woman that I asked which is now in front of me.. so I thought to asked a menu as well  which is suppose to be a smart thing to do while waiting, right?  The cashier lady handed me one... then she said in a loud voice \" it's Portuguese,  I don't think you can read that\" woh! Racist much? I thought to myself.. but then I immediately gain my composure and asked \"so do you have English  one so that I can understand and one that I can read? \" she said no they don't have... hmmm... ... that was the highlight of my visit.   I still bought some of the things I that I went there for and ate my lunch there too. . I figure they might not be racist..(I really hope not)  probably it's just the tone of voice that I'm. Not use too.. There was a man who came to me and  apologizes on their behalf.. he's Portuguese, one of their frequent guest, he seems really nice..that's why I'm saying that it's probably just the tone of voice. They can be friendly I reckon.. later then i began to understand why they were looking at me.. because guests are almost Portuguese and Caucasian... Interesting! :)  food to try whenever you'll be in the area.. egg tarts,  Tarts are really good! Oreo cheesecake is good too. Barbeque chicken is not bad with some veggies. .. :)"}
{"text":"The BEST custard tarts I have ever had in all of Brampton and Mississauga. Their chicken is delicious and very tasty. You can tell they take pride in what they serve customers. My bf and I enjoyed our meal and the random goodies we purchased. I honestly hope they reopened soon as I have found no equal in custard tarts."}
{"text":"Had a leisurely Sunday lunch with the family a few weeks ago. The food is very fresh & tasty. I got the grilled squid and it was tender and grilled to perfection. The rest of my family got a vegetarian dish with veggies and rice, the grilled basa and steak with fries. Everything was very good.  The only issue is service. The service was slow and we also ordered a half chicken for take out. We ordered it in advance but they took forever so we left without it. My family was very upset as we gave them advance notice and paid for it. It seemed like the owner didn't even care.  If I am in the area I will go back for the food but the service is left to be desired."}
