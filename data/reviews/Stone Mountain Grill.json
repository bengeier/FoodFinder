{"text":"Went there for my birthday last night and was treated great by the hostess and wait staff. Ordered the 8oz Filet which was perfect. Great experience for a first time visit. Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"This place is just great! Delicious and wide variety of food with friendly service. The outdoor patio is awesome! Very relaxing! I recommend the fish tacos, shrimp and grits, or meatloaf! Always torn on what to order! Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"No frills type of place.  I come to get meat and vegetables and it's delicious.  When I come here I know I'm going to get a good hearty meal.

Very nice atmosphere.  Every time I've came it was busy but it did not impact our service at all."}
{"text":"the food here was wonderful, five star worthy. However, the service was even better. Carolyn was an exceptional waitress. She was so helpful and remembered my table's order two days later when we came back. Also, as we were about to leave the restaurant to walk back to our hotel (probably about .2 miles away) it was raining. She drove us to our hotel. We will always come back here"}
{"text":"Lots of choices but mediocre taste. Nothing special except atmosphere is cozy and has a cabin feel. The best part of our meal was the buffalo chicken dip appetizer -great taste but spicy. We ordered a chicken quesadilla & the raspberry chicken salad- both did not seem fresh. Quesadilla wasn't hot either. We had high hopes but we're disappointed. Would not recommend..."}
{"text":"SMG seems like a very similar  concept to the restaurant  that failed before it. I went there last night and was disappointed. I was really hoping to be surprised. The service was poor and the food not very good. I really hope they can turn it around. Don't want to see the space empty again."}
{"text":"Jerk Chicken Taco's - Great
Firecracker Shrimp App - Great"}
{"text":"The first thing that we learned is we needed to have our mind right on what kind of place this is...we we're looking for a date night place and learned that it's not a substitute for local faves like 131 Main or Vine...this place is more like a bar...we would think about Stone when we look to go out to Duckworths, Fox and Hound or Hickory Tavern.

Once we got past what it's not and what it is (which took us a while to do), we enjoyed our dinners.

The service was decent, food was tasty and reasonably priced.  Definitely get the 20 percent coupon by signing up for their email club...not sure how long that promo is going on for, but worth the try.

This place isn't healthy...even the salad had fried potato strings on it...with cheese and bacon...but I'm sure there's a couple of dishes for those watching calories.

Like the other reviewers, it was loud (especially during game time) but the bar area looks like a lot of fun for that activity.  While the dining room had tons of families and kids, which is great for this area.

Net is that this is not a date night place...We would return with the right mindset, lunch and enjoy the patio and catching a game.

Agree with other reviewers...great to see another option like this in the hood and hope it thrives!"}
{"text":"Always a treat. Love their wings, burgers, onion rings. The buffalo chicken sandwich is the best. My place to watch Panthers football games. Bartenders are awesome! Great service!"}
{"text":"Loved this place last Saturday nite.  Came back to use 20% coupon we got online. Steak was overcooked and over seasoned, broccoli cold. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great fire cracker shrimp!!!!! Love that, but the mashed potatoes were cold the last 2 times I have visited! They need to be hot!"}
{"text":"I visit for business every few months and consistently find great food and great service here. There are tons of items on the menu that I love, and I never get tired of eating here."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal or service. Tacos are great. When my CEO and his wife came to visit, I took them here. This place is always consistant. I love the tacos. They are my favorite."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service at lunch is really slow. We thought we would give it another shot today because there is a double discount. NOT a good idea. We even came early to try and beat the lunch rush, but 45 min after sitting down, our food still hasn't arrived. You want to avoid this place if you are on your lunch break.  Their lunch menu is huge with a great selection, but that is also most likely their Achilles heel."}
{"text":"Great food and great outdoor/indoor patio. Food is consistently good everything from the fish tacos to the ribs. I was a little skeptical to pay $22 for the ribs for lunch one day but they are some of the best."}
{"text":"Husband and I visited yesterday late-afternoon. First impression was wow...nice, cozy atmosphere. We were seated immediately and noticed the place was nearly empty (at 4:30pm)...thought that a bit odd.  Yes there are fire-places but it was freezing inside. My husband's a tough guy and I think this is the first time he's ever complained about the temperature in a restaurant.  Our waitress had a nice smile and was friendly and attentive. However, the reason for the 2 stars is because this restaurant lacks polish. The music is too loud, the manager is insensitive to diners by almost yelling (because the music is so loud) to someone out of our line of sight, laughing and carrying on (very unprofessional); the chicken quesadillas were very good and my husband seemed to enjoy his burger but my blackened southern chicken sandwich was rubbery (yuck) and had way too much avocado. The fries were way over-salted and not nearly crispy enough (soggy fries).  I think this place has potential but needs quite a bit of fine-tuning."}
{"text":"We recently tried the new restaurant that opened up in the Ballantyne area that hosts plenty of good eating choices. The menu is great with tons of good choices that will have us coming back. Food was delicious. Nicely decorated and good bar scene and we had very good service w/o being rushed. Menu changes to more limited selections after 10pm but even that seemed to offer good choices but we ate off regular menu. They have a 20% off coupon on their website to attract traffic while they are new...take advantage!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night for a last minute business dinner and really liked the place.  Got there around 6 and the place was empty, service was good and the menus should have something for everyone.

I got the basic burger & fries and it was one if the better ones I've ever had, worth the $9.  The people I went with got a steak, pasta and chicken, all of their dishes looked great as well.  Since it was work related no alcohol so I can't speak to that part of the menu.

Overall it was a great dinner and I\"ll be back, if you want a burger in Ballantyne I'd go here before smashburger or five guys."}
{"text":"Really surprised by some of the negative reviews, but hey: everyone got their own experience. Been going here mainly for Friday Happy Hours with some work buddies for several years now. Never eaten in the restaurant but tried plenty of bar food - the shrimp are to die for! The bar is top notch, Jordan is The Man!"}
{"text":"This place is convenient when you're staying at the Staybridge Suites, Charlotte NC, it's walking distance.  We went with a large group- 15 people.  They handle large groups very well.  If you have a reservation, the bartenders prefer you to be served by your assigned wait staff so that the tips are fair, sounds weird but also a great concept, means the staff works well together.  They give you these fried asparagus at the bar that are delicious.  We also had chips and dips platter and firecracker shrimp.  So if you're on the sriracha craze, you'll love the firecracker shrimp.  the chips and dips, the guacamole was impressive, it had a lot of flavor to it, wish it was a larger portion, the salsa and pimento cheese was good but I would have been happy if it was just guac and chips.  Main meal, I had a ribeye, caesar salad and chocolate cake.  Meal was good, nothing that really stood out, but no complaints.  The attention from the servers were great and I thought they handled a large crowd on a relatively busy night very well.  Ambiance is nice, they also have an outdoor area but since it's record heat, staying inside was a better choice, but on a nice spring evening, I would opt to sit outside."}
{"text":"Good food,  good service. Has a cabin in the woods feel to it with a fire place in the dining area. 
Got the fish tacos and enjoyed them. Big portions. Would visit again."}
{"text":"I love this place, every time I'm in town I make at least two trips... go for the tacos, AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 6 at 6:00pm on a Saturday.  We got there extra early and to my surprise this place was mostly empty.  We got a nice corner booth for our group and Catherine was very friendly and attentive.  I was pleased there was a 4 course dinner for 2 for $50 (cuz I'm cheap)
Fried pickles are really just perfect.  They're long slices so the salty is not overpowering (yes I have an issue with circular fried pickles).  The house salads came out wrong.  there were 4 brought out instead of 3, with the toppings and dressings wrong.  Instead of taking it back she gave me a salad with no dressing to sit there and wait for her to return.  Kind of weird procedure to leave inedible food in front of me, but second attempt was all 3 correct salads.  The meatloaf was fantastic!  Topped with onions and pimiento cheese, thick slices that were grilled so it had a nice char on it, served with lumpy potatoes (just that way I like it!).  I did not care for the southern style green beans, as they were surprisingly flavorless.  We were stuffed from everything else, so I took a cheesecake home.  It was tri-layered chocolate mousse, cheesecake and a cookie crust.  Overall, it was pretty good the next day.
I really like a wood d√©cor - it felt intimate enough in the booth that they sold the log cabin feel very well.  I saw a nice sized patio I'd be happy to check out at my next visit.  The entire menu looked wonderful!  Great prices too"}
{"text":"The jerk chicken tacos are hard to beat.  Great service and a friendly staff.  I make it a point to visit every time I travel to Charlotte.  

The place is pretty new, but the tables are always sticky...  I think it's the varnish and NOT because they are dirty."}
{"text":"We visited around 6pm on a Friday, without a reservation.  We were able to get a table in the bar area.  They also have a nice outdoor seating area.  By the time we left, people were waiting in the lobby - a hopeful sign for a restaurant operating in a location where two have failed. 

We ordered the crab cakes appetizer, and were surprised that we only got 3 smallish cakes for $12.  My wife had the Smothered Chicken, which was very good.  I had the meatloaf.  The flavor of the meatloaf was good, but the covering of pimento spread was odd and did not seem to add anything from my perspective.  The green beans that came with both dinners had good flavor, but were way overcooked.  The portion sizes were generous.

Service was just OK, but it was their busiest time.  Overall, it was OK-to-good."}
{"text":"Amazing !! Service, food, drinks!!! We are here twice in one day !! And the atmosphere is awesome- fireplaces everywhere! Will be back for sure !!"}
{"text":"I have been here 4-5 times and it has been good each time.  The service can be a little on the slow side but everything I have eaten has been very good.  The firecracker shrimp are really good and on Wed. you can get them for half off!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night with my boyfriend, and my first impression was \"wow\"! Unfortunately, the beautiful restaurant does NOT fit the food. The fried pickles we had for an appetizer were very good, but that's where the positive ends. The service was uncomfortable, we got there around 9 and they don't close until 11(according to their website) but I was made to feel like we had inconvenienced the whole staff. I ordered the Firecracker Shrimp Wrap which was mediocre and my boyfriend ordered medium well burger. His burger was burnt and hard as a hockey puck, he's never once sent food back but he really had no choice with a $10 burger. His replacement was decent, but obviously pre-made and frozen. On top of all of this, the sweet tea we both ordered was warm and tasted fermented(must have been at least a day and a half old). We both have worked in restaurants for a long time and our experience was bizarre and terrible.  
There was never a manager in sight! And the hostesses (when, rarely at the stand) were playing with their hair(very unsanitary) or their phones the entire time!
Just skip this place. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Sometimes service can be a little slow but the food is always great here. The Cedar Plank Salmon is probably my favorite. They're generous on their wine portions too and the managers are very attentive."}
{"text":"Good restaurant & watering hole near my office. Consistent good food & service. Nice atmosphere, primarily for adults; however, kids would be fine. I've enjoyed both the bar & dining area, depending upon the situation. I'll return."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at Stone Mountain Grill. I had made reservations for 10 people of which most was from out of town. There was a bit of confusion regarding my reservations however, once we arrived we was seated in a different area from where we had requested (patio). Due to the misunderstanding the manager on duty Rob went above and beyond the call of duty to make the situation better. Not only was the food delicious the service we received was outstanding! I have never done a review but this one deserves to be recognized! Highly recommend Stone Mountain Grill."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere! But the food leaves much to be desired. We had ribs and filet - $60 meal. Ribs had great flavor, but definitely lacking in meat. Filet was one of the worst steaks I've ever eaten. I seriously struggled to cut it without making a scene shaking my plate, let alone chew it. I have never had a filet cut (cooked medium) that was so tough. Maybe the tacos and burgers are better! Avoid steaks and ribs."}
{"text":"I think this place tried to pull out the stops for Queen's Feast, but they weren't up to the challenge. Their Queen's Feast menu sounded fantastic, but the food quality was very banquet-like. My oysters rockefeller were fried dough balls with no discernable oyster, sitting on a bed of creamed spinach that tasted canned. My filet oscar, while cooked perfectly, was tough and not very flavorful. The sauce was more \"Bernie\" than \"Bearnaise.\" While our server was absolutely as nice as he could be, the kitchen was backed up and our meal took 2.5 hours. He got the checks all mixed up, too. Sadly, the meal was quite a disappointment, especially compared to the other wonderful QF restaurants we could have selected."}
{"text":"To be honest with you, we did not even stay for the meal.  We want to try this restaurant become it was close to home.  We were seated at the end of the restaurant furthest from the bar.  We ordered drinks and realized we had to almost yell across the table to each other to have a conversation. We asked our server if they could turn down the music or find a quieter corner of the restaurant, and that was not possible.  We paid for our drinks and we had dinner at another local establishment."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Hot, and flavorful. Enjoyed the variety of menu. Nice bar area with multiple TV's, but separated nicely from main dining. Service was prompt and accurate, but not overly friendly. Atmosphere in dining area good, but not great."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and the food is spectacular! I got the regular chicken sandwich not the spicy one which I've had before. Both are great! I've also had the fish tacos and tried the smothered chicken, all excellent! The staff and owners are very nice and do their very best. I also wanted to add that the desserts are wonderful and very reasonably priced. We will be going back soon! And if you like Mac and cheese and REAL green beans, they don't disappoint!"}
{"text":"The service was great... The drinks were great however the food was terrible. We had 3 appetizers the firecracker shrimp/cheese sticks/ahi tuna everything was way over spiced. The creole pasta...shrimp was fine but not sure what other meat was on there suppose to be lobster pretty sure it was crawfish or shredded weird meat and the pasta was way overcooked. Great drink spot bad food spot"}
{"text":"It is a great place to go after work for drinks but not the best place to take the family for dinner! Kids didn't enjoy it much and it became more of a hassle than anything else! Going to stick with it more for appetizer and drinks after work!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was empty when we arrived but our server seemed annoyed we weren't ready to order as soon as she approached our table. The baked Brie was very good but the rest of the meal was mediocre at best. My husband's ribs were dry. I got the penne rustica which had only a few small pieces of meat. Neither entree had much flavor. Once it got busier, we rarely saw our server."}
{"text":"Awesome omelet with cheddar grits and bacon!  Great service by Jake!  Always great food and my son loves the flat screen tvs!"}
{"text":"The service and value make this a wonderful place! We usually go to 131 main or firebirds for birthday dinners but decided to try this because we had a coupon. We were more than impressed with the service - our waitress Amani was very sweet and did a great job serving. You also get a lot more \"extras\" than other comparable restaurants- They do a free birthday dessert, ice cream comes with all kids meals, etc. We came on a Wednesday which was also half priced wine and $5 appetizer specials. (You can tell we love a deal!) ;-) Our table was greeted by the chef and manager, Everyone was very friendly. Food was good quality - we had several dishes, salmon, Mai mahi, meatloaf and steak. The food was simply seasoned and came out fairly quickly. We had our 2 and 4 year old with us and the atmosphere is nice but also loud enough to mask any screaming/whining etc that usually comes with bringing the kiddos. Lastly there is a cute patio area with lots of TVs that is enclosed to be all weather- we didn't eat there but it looked like a fun place to sit and have drinks or watch a game. We were satisfied and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I find it almost like Hickory Tavern with a nicer atmosphere. Food he always been good, not spectacular. Went last weekend and sat outside. All went well until they refused to take my Visa gift card as payment. They accept Visa, but wouldn't take my card. I understand their concern, but really bothered me on principle. Never had this issue anywhere else. Doubt I'll go back now."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner on Saturday, 2/17.  We were celebrating my birthday weekend, and I wanted a good piece of salmon!  We ordered the fried pickles to start, and I thought they were great!  The crust on them was crunchy AND is stayed put (didn't slip off or crumble away covered in grease)... and I had a Grey Goose martini (it was perfect!)...

I ordered the cedar plank salmon, cooked medium, with asparagus and an extra side of mashed potatoes... everything was cooked very well... the asparagus was not over done, the salmon was tender, flaky, and delicious, and the mashed potatoes are dangerous!

They brought us a warm, gooey brownie sundae for my birthday.  We ate it with embarrassing speed!!

All in all, this place has a nice, cozy atmosphere which can be dressed up a little, but mostly good for jeans and family dinners... the food is good (not overly unique or fancy, but if you want a good meal at a decent price, this place makes for a nice change), the drinks are well made, and the service is excellent!  Give it a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Good bar food and burgers, conveniently located near several Ballantyne neighborhoods. I would say go with burgers or the salmon for good dinner staples. The burgers are big and juicy and come with a side for about $13. That is the going rate
even at nearby burger places not fast food. I liked the taste of the burger & switched the side to mashed potatoes. I did takeout once but it was a busy night so it took awhile. Instead I would recommend sitting in the bar and eating at the small bar tables. Lot parking is usually the way to go."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for the first time for Queens Feast and had a really good experience!  Our server took our orders right away and everything came out in perfect timing.  We had just the right amount of time to enjoy our appetizers before our main entrees were brought out.  Me and my dad both ordered filets medium and they were perfect!  The other steak was ordered medium well and came out more medium but was thoroughly enjoyed so no complaints there!
Our server didn't seem to be in the best mood but did his job very well.  He always made sure our drinks were filled and offered to box up my brother's meal when I asked if I could have a box to do it myself.
As for the food itself, the three of us split three different appetizers: the firecracker shrimp, crab cakes, and filet kabobs.  The firecracker shrimp were the best of the three and got rave reviews from both my companions.  We all got the surf and turf entree and were very satisfied with the filet, shrimp, potatoes, and asparagus.  As for the desserts, I tried both the key lime pie and tuxedo mousse cheesecake and thought they were both delicious!"}
{"text":"We so wanted to love this place. We came tonight for the second time.  We are new to the area and are looking for our go to middle of the week \"I just can't cook tonight\" spot.  The first time was lovely. We enjoyed a meal on the patio, enjoyed a few drinks, and had a super attentive waitress.  Tonight, however, was a disaster.  We got our drink relatively fast and Our wa took our order and then...poof.... she was gone.  Someone else delivered our food to the table. The salads we so overdressed they were almost inedible.  We all ran empty on drinks and my husband finally went to the bar to get refills on his own.  Only then did she ask him if he needed anything.  She brought those and disappears again. We were able to flag her down to get dessert for our daughter. It came out very quickly and the brownie (obviously microwaved to warm it up) was to hot it burned her mouth.  As we were finishing dessert we asked for the check.  She said ok, grabbed our unfinished dessert, and left us sitting there waiting again.  Desserts are a little expensive to be snatched before we can even finish them.  Only upon exiting did we discover she was covering a large party at the bar.  I guess our 55 dollar tab wasn't important enough to get quality service. So sad.  I really wanted to love Stone Mountain Grille."}
{"text":"Delicious
Server: Matthew 
This is my first visit to Stone Mountain Grill. A friend and I decided to come here for restaurant week. I must say I thought it was a little more upscale but I was pleasantly surprised at how relaxed it was. The food was delicious and Matthew was great even though he was limping due to a bug bite that I advised he should definitely get checked out! All in all I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I dine out frequently, particularly on Sundays after church with my family. Stone Mountain Grill ruined one such Sunday for my family. The food was generic.  Our server was great aside from the fact that we told him we didn't like the food and he did nothing to appease us. My kids loved the patio and the atmosphere.  Hated their food. The food runner dropped some of my ribs on the floor and said he would be back to replace them, he never returned. Honestly that was fine, the ribs were not good. They were cold and the sauce was nothing special.  All in all a huge waste of money and time. We ended up having to eat again an hour later."}
{"text":"I have been to Stone Mountain in the past and had GREAT food. This time, the service was GREAT but the food was nothing to write about. We went for early dinner on Sunday. It seemed like the dinner we ordered was maybe already prepared and just waiting for us. The guacamole was brown (clearly had sat out too long) and the tacos were barely warm. I really like the place and will give it another try, but am sad to say it was not good at best."}
{"text":"Poor service.  One and only time there.  When the waiter took my wife's food back to be boxed up he placed other dirty plates from other tables on top of hers and walked back to the kitchen area.  No surprise as it got tossed.  The manager came to apologize and offered to reduce our bill.  We waited another 10 minutes with no bill until I had to flag down the manager again.  During the meal the waiter never checked back and we were without water for most of the meal.  We noticed annoyed customers who also had that waiter.  Filet mignon tasted old and almost pork-like.  I liked the chicken Caesar salad."}
{"text":"Food, service and atmosphere were impeccable. Just a 20 minute wait for a party of 10 on a Saturday evening. My wife fell in love with the meatloaf. My fish tacos were unique and satisfying. Outdoor dining with large screen TV's, indoor fireplace make for a cozy dining experience."}
{"text":"SMG offers a variety of menu options. Staff was friendly and timely. Good food and service."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 8 on a Friday night and were able to make reservations on their site through Open Table which was very convenient. We were sat right away. They didn't have a beer menu, but I was able to get an Angry Orchard cider. It was served with a chilled glass, but from a can. I'm weird about cider in a can, because I think it tastes like a can, so I think that should have been told to me from the beginning, but it was ok. 

I ordered a burger with cheese and fries. It came out hot and was really good. Not the best burger ever, but still very tasty and I do recommend it. 

They have a frequent diners club that you can sign up for and get 20% off your first bill minus alcohol. It was a great thing for first time diners like us."}
{"text":"Stone Mountain Grill is a solid lunch/dinner choice. I have never had anything I didn't like and it has always been good stuff. The environment has a great ambiance.

My usual two things I always order are the Firecracker Tacos or the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. The Tacos are by far my favorite and an absolute hit. They come with a hard and a soft shell. The sauce is sweet yet spicy-similar to Bonefish's Bang Bang Shrimp. Simply put they are great! The Buffalo Chicken sandwich is perfectly fried and very big portion. The mixed drinks from the bar have always been on point too.

The service has been hit or miss for me. Sometimes it has been over and beyond amazing, sometimes not so hot. Overall, a solid option I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Corn dusted or multigrain? Confused?  Me too!  How about white or wheat?  

My burger was pretty good.  The bacon was cooked well, not soggy.  But next time I'll try the tacos since they looked like the main event passing my table on the way to other happy diners.

The real surprise was the giant piece of chocolate cake.  Seriously, it was so good you could talk me in to coming here just for dessert.  And a drink.  Scotch and chocolate anyone?"}
{"text":"We went on Saturday, early evening. We were seated immediately and had attentive service right away.  We tried the Firecracker Shrimp appetizer, which was very good.  They split the wedge salad for two of us. For dinner, I had the Grouper New Orleans.  It was spicy, but not too hot.   It has lobster and shrimp in it, over rice. The fish was properly cooked, and It was good. My daughter had blackened chicken pasta and my wife had the seafood pasta. We finished it off with the double decker cheesecake.  I would say the food was good and the service was above average. We will be back."}
{"text":"F this place. Someone warned me about this place. They were right. Horrible service. Ran out of food. Ran out of appetizer plates. Took 1:30 to bring out a freaking brownie Sundae. Really?!?  Place wasn't even full so that makes no sense. Will never ever ever come here again. Have already spread the word for no one to ever come her. F this horrible place. Oh, food wasn't even that great either."}
{"text":"Just tried to get a table on patio (place was pretty empty overall) and was told that the 2 open tables were being held for people, this in spite of fact that they don't take reservations for the patio.  They said they were holding them for \"VIP customers\".    I explained that this will be my 3rd time there in a Month and they should seat us.   My Mom is 86 and can't sit on the high tops.  They wouldn't seat us and let us walk out.   All I can say is the owner/manager didn't value our business enough and wasn't consistent in their policy and for that reason alone I won't be back ever again.   I'd think twice about the allure of the Patio as odds are you'll be sitting inside even if the Patio's empty. Went to Vine and had a great meal."}
{"text":"My visit not as great today as my first visit. This time I knew to order my salad (salmon/spinach) WITHOUT onions.  So, I get my salad and it has those awful red onions diced so small that you cant easily pick them out. BLEH!! I detest raw onions - ESPECIALLY the red ones. 

So when our server finally makes it back around to check on our table, I showed her the onions and reminded her that I had ordered without. She took it back so they could remake it...and I waited & waited & waited.... 

When she finally brought it back out, my dining companions had already finished their meals. Since we have already been gone for an hour, I asked her to go ahead & box it so I could take it back to the office to eat.  Waiting for it to be boxed took a long time too... WTH? I should have asked her to bring the container to the table so I could do it myself. Sigh. 

When I finally got back to office & had a chance to eat, the mood was ruined for me. I did not enjoy my salad and certainly did not enjoy my overall dining experience.   For the $ I definitely expect better from them."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is excellent. Food is awesome. ScOOt Pittman performs Live Acoustic Music on Friday's from 430-7pm. Located in beautiful Ballantyne just off 485 Johnston Rd. Exit. Firecracker Shrimp is great to start off, Tap your toes to the music, enjoy your favorite beverage then order dinner from Stone Mountain Grill superb menu. Woohoo! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Was staying at the hotel across the street and wanted something easy. Ordered the chicken Cesar wrap to go and it was ready in under 10 mins. It was good, seemed like good quality chicken. Fries were a very generic and could've used some salt, but were good. The meal won't impress you, but it'll 100% leave you satisfied."}
{"text":"Really great meal amazing food it is a higher price point than I expected but the quality was definitely there will definitely come back ***also had seven dollar bulleit and eight dollar mini bottles of champagne!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for business and to visit family.  We decided to try Stone Mountain since it had recently opened and is near my family home.  The atmosphere was fantastic.  We sat outside on the patio which is decorated like a cabin.  There are large TVs, a fireplace, and cozy couches.  We started with the spicy shrimp appetizer.  It was delicious.  They serve the same shrimp in their tacos- which I plan on trying the next time. My dining partner ordered the wings and loved them.   I ordered a flat bread pizza.  The pizza was not that great.  It was soggy and all of the toppings slid off of the pizza.  I am not one to complain.  Especially, since I was not sure if that was just how it was supposed to be and I ordered poorly.  I am giving this restaurant 4 stars because (I wish I could remember his name and position) a gentleman came to our table as we were nearing the end of our meal and had asked how my pizza was.  I was honest and nice as I explained.  He stated that they were new to making the \"hearth baked\" pizzas and the dough is made fresh daily and they were having trouble with the dough rising and cooking crisp.  He apologized and stated that they had eliminated pizza from the menu for the remainder of the evening since they were having trouble.  He removed the pizza from our bill and gave us free appetizer cards to use on our next visit.  As someone who eats out often, I appreciate this service.  I appreciate anyone that can admit a mistake and apologize.  I did not have to complain or bring it to his attention.  The restaurant noticed the mistake and took the initiative to still ensure our evening was pleasant.  I would absolutely go back to this restaurant.  The food that had been made correctly was amazing and they, clearly, have a great staff who take pride in food and service."}
{"text":"Food is solid for sports bar atmosphere. However, service is exemplary especially at the bar. If Jordan is there, you are in luck as he is a true professional!"}
{"text":"A coworker and I decided to try this place for lunch and I'm so glad we did! It's delicious and the service was wonderful. My coworker got the meatloaf and had to take 1/2 of it home. Huge serving and was so good. I got the Fire shrimp wrap and their 'boom-boom' sauce absolutely made it. Do yourself a favor and order the fried pickles as an app, too. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Stone Mountain one time for the past three years. First year- excellent- the second year good to above average this year fair to average. The food and service has gone down hill.  I ordered a medium well steak it came back rare.  They need to get their focus back. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Went here for a late business lunch. The food was good but the service lacked. It was like our waiter had better things to do. Rarely came back to check on us and when 1 of us asked for something, he just kept on going even if someone else needed something. It's the type of service I might expect at a fast casual place, not a restaurant that serves $30 steak. I also found it odd the hostess, while pleasant, had on ripped jeans. Not quite sure what look there going for here. Menu has a large variety and you can easily spend up to $30 a plate or $10."}
{"text":"I have to say what just happened to me in this resturant was appalling and embarrassing to say the least! I took my family there after church for Easter brunch since this has been my go to place every since they open a few years back. I go to order my normal kids menu item that I've been ordering for the past year and the server said no. He is a new server to me so I explained to him that I had gastric surgery last year and that the resturant has always accommodated me in the past. The server said to me that he would have to get with his manager. I said that's fine, I know most of them from coming in. Needless to say the co owner Robert come over and tells me that he will not allow me to order off the kids menu, that I have to order off the regular menu. He then said \"whoever has allowed this before needs to be fired\". I was upset and embarrassed but said to my family ok because I didn't want to cause a scene further. Then Robert proceeds to tell me that's \"it's people like you that's going to cause us to go out of business\" excuse me No it's people like you that should not be in business. I'm in business and I understand the whole food cost etc of his business. I also understand that people take advantage of ordering kids meals but when I tell you the reasoning behind me wanting to order it because I can not eat that much, that you dont offer a smaller plate or smaller portion options on your menu and wasn't trying to save money you should of accommodated me or anyone else in my position. It's just down right rude! To the other co owner, you should buy him out! Cut ties! To  managers, servers and everyone else that works there, I'm sorry you have to work for someone like that. I'm only one voice and will probably be overlooked but there is a lot of us out here that has had this surgery.  We are given a card to show that we have had this surgery as proof so when or if we do encounter people like Robert we can show them and I would of gladly shown you mine if given the chance."}
{"text":"Went here today. Giving it 5 because their Lodge Meatloaf is the greatest version of meat loaf I've ever eaten. Baked, then quickly grilled, topped with onions, mushrooms, and a wad of gooey pimento cheese, it was supremely decadent for being a giant slab of greasy meat. Served it with mashed potatoes, and I subbed out the green beans for the grilled baby bok choy, which is an absolute MUST.

Their wings were good. Nothing insane. Garlic parm wings were the best I tried. Their fried pickles were awesome. Full pickle spears, great idea! Beer selection was fine, nothing too fancy. 

Decent price range. Menu had options for as low as $7-8, and for as high as $29-30, so there's a little something for everyone. That meat loaf though...get yourself an Uber ride home afterwards or you might fall asleep in the car on the way home."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here tonight! Food was delicious, our server was attentive and prompt, and the atmosphere was delightful. I ordered the firecracker shrimp and it was fantastic! I've seen this on many menus but here it was just the right balance of flavor and heat. The heavy sauce went well with the light lettuce. Then I had the jerk chicken and fajita steak tacos. Both were delicious. The key lime pie for dessert was also top notch. Almost didn't give this place a try due to some negative reviews. I'm very glad I did!"}
{"text":"The Good- Great service!  We were warmly greeted when we arrived and they allowed us to be seated earlier than our reservation.

Food was good, but not great. Food was served on basic plates and standard silverware.  Drinks were very reasonable.

The Bad -  Nothing!  This was a nice place.  Not upscale at all, very casual and basic.

Not blown away, but We would come again for the great service and good food."}
{"text":"A friend of mine always raves about the martinis and brie plate so I finally stopped in to try. Our waiter Jeremy was excellent and even accommodated our immature requests to have him recite Matthew McConaughey movie quotes! He ran down the drink specials and I ordered the pineapple mango martini. After the first sip, it was clear that I could guzzle it, so I drank it up and ordered a dirty martini so I could be sure to sip at a slower place. I'm pretty picky about a dirty martini and this one was perfect. We ordered the brie plate which came with a ton of crackers as well as a large bunch of grapes, raspberries, apples and blackberries. The brie was warm and gooey and just the way I like it. I ordered the blackened grouper and mashed potatoes. Grouper is my favorite fish and to be honest, I'm not sure this was grouper. The mashed potatoes were yummy but I'm not sure I would order this fish again. It was too thin for my liking. Overall, the place was warm and cozy and ALL the staff were nice and accommodating. I will be back for martinis and apps for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and only had one mediocre experience that was later taken care of by management. Me and my wife love the bang bang shrimp, always great. I really enjoy the steaks, and the burgers are great too. Great deserts some of the best keylime pie around, nice and tart. I wish they always had prime rib but at least this makes me try more of the menu."}
{"text":"When visiting Charlotte (Ballantyne area) on numerous occasions, I have eaten at this restaurant about 1/2 dozen times. The food has been consistently good. I really enjoyed their seafood dishes. The service has been decent, but the food consistently good,"}
{"text":"I have gone for dinner a few times and I've had a great experience every time! The food is delicious and the outside dining area is really nice with flat screen TVs and a fireplace. It's a very cozy atmosphere. The firecracker shrimp is my favorite item on the menu! All around great food, drinks, and service!"}
{"text":"We have been here for lunches and dinners, just wife and I and with family and children.  Excellent place with lots of room and a very nice outdoor, covered patio with a stone fireplace.

Menu is great, lots of choices to include children offerings.  The lunch menu is abbreviated, but there are adequate options.  I love their Fire Cracker Shrimp, on salad or as a entre.  It will truly light up your life, so if you are not into spicy, don't go there.

Lunch menu has lots of salads, sandwiches, soups, tacos, burgers and entrees.  More than enough and with a full bar you might go with a crisp white wine to go with them fire crackers.

Dinner has much more to offer with lots of chicken, steak, ribs and seafood options.  The darkish dining room can be pretty romantic.  Just an idea.

Service is good and prompt.  Kitchen keeps up with the flow and you can do reasonable substitutions.

Sun City residents get a discount and they offer some others, so ask.

A good choice for good food, service and drinks."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday at lunch with co-workers. Atmosphere seemed promising. Server came right away even though we were waiting on folks, awesome! Then all down hill from there. Ordered when everyone got there, simple food mind you (burgers/wraps). Order took about 45 mins and it was not busy at all. There were people who arrived after us that got food at the same time...and I am talking 20-30 mins after us. Food was just OK, not bad and not super. Fries were good. I will not be back and sad since it is a purely local joint and not one of the 1000s of chains in the Charlotte-Ballantyne area."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Went with friends and we were seated early for lunch.  Took over 50 minutes for food to arrive.  We were ready to walk....  Other patrons who had arrived after us were being served.  Food finally arrived; some hot, some not.  Waiter never returned to table during our meal to check for refills.  At the end of the meal we had to flag him down for refills and the check.  Food was mediocre.  Service was lousy.  We won't return.  :("}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a meh review with all the nice people working there but the food is just plain blah. I love the decor & the feel of the place. Definitely reminded my husband & I of his grandparent's cabin on a lake. I guess I would give them another try but it will be a while."}

{"text":"This casual, rustic style restaurant exceeded our expectations. The food was good and well priced and quick to our table. Our server was clearly new to the role but by no means sub par - she put a lot of effort into making sure we had everything we needed (we tipped her 25% because of her attitude). 

All in all a great experience. The appetizer of baked Brie and wild berries sounded great, however we didn't order it. The chicken tacos were excellent with a mango salsa and the smothered chicken was very homey. No dessert for us. 

This is a good place for groups and/or children - it has an average noise level and plenty of space."}
{"text":"Food was ok but the service today at lunch was horrible... We waited for drinks and our waiter seemed upset about everything... We had to get another waiter to get our bill when we where ready to leave... This is our second experience with poor service... Not sure we will return..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with work.  Had the chicken pear salad and a water.  Food was quite tasty - grilled chicken was fresh and tasty, and the pears were a nice addition.  Also had roasted walnuts and a light dressing.  Biggest disappointment was the service - super slow!  Would come back for lunch again."}
{"text":"We love the atmosphere here outdoor and indoor fireplaces. Has a wonderful lodge feel. I had the grilled mahi and asparagus it was wonderful. He had blackened chicken pasta . I usually get the grilled pear salad which is amazing! Our service is always good here and the bar is full of business folks from the local Ballantyne area."}
{"text":"I had the meatloaf and a was great - baked well with a little char on the outside. Nice staff and the bar has plenty of tvs and a patio"}
{"text":"I thought this place would be similar to an Applebee's or another chain like that. However Stone Mountain pleasantly surprised me. I went for lunch and sat in the lounge area. It has a nice feel to it with wood accents and a stone fireplace.
There is also a patio, also with a fireplace, with sides made up of clear drop down material if the weather gets cold.
The menu offer a variety of steaks, fish, burgers.
I went with the fish tacos. Two large tacos of grilled mahi mahi were outstanding. It also came with a side of black beans and rice.
Looking forward to coming back to try dinner!"}
{"text":"Very good experience.  Food was well cooked, adequate portions and good value.  Service was friendly and efficient.  Ambience was pleasant.  We had fish, chicken sandwich, burger and chicken fingers.  Everyone was happy but putting onions on a kid's salad is not a good idea.   Overall. a good restaurant and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"On the last day of restaurant week we tried this spot. I ordered the roasted prime rib, which came with potatoes and green beans. Everything was seasoned to perfection. My husband ordered the seafood pasta. It wasn't bad after adding a little salt and pepper. We also had fried oysters and they were delicious! We enjoyed the service, food, and atmosphere overall. We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic for our company Christmas event. 
They were so nice. They were very knowledgeable about the short, group menu. We all split different appetizers. The firecracker shrimp is literally to die for it is so good. I have the crab topped mahi mahi and let me tell you about a succulent dish. The crab was real and the cream sauce was so fresh. I can tell real from fake crab because I am a crab connoisseur. Everything was so delicious, I will be back."}
{"text":"Very good! Our group of 7 had a variety of menu items and we were all happy.   Great selection and very reasonable prices.  3 had salmon and it was excellent,  and meatloaf was outstanding. We will be back!"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to grab dinner and drinks on a Tuesday after work, and after seeing pictures of the patio on their Facebook page, we knew that's where we wanted to be!

At 6 p.m., the patio was maybe half full, and I appreciated the options of high top tables, low top tables, and comfy looking couches in front of the TVs and fireplace.  We chose a low top table, which was really comfortable.  Overall, I felt like I was hanging out on a friend's patio - it didn't feel \"restauranty.\"  

Our waitress was really nice and helpful; she could've gotten to us just a smidgen faster, but we weren't in a hurry, so I didn't mind.  

Tuesday are half off glasses of wine, so we had a couple of glasses.  For dinner, I ordered the raspberry fields salad - the chicken tasted fresh and warm, which was a nice juxtaposition to the cold salad greens and fruit.  My friend got the firecracker shrimp tacos, which she said were really good . I thought they looked pretty interesting since it was a hard shell taco wrapped in a soft shell taco, and the shrimp were HUGE.  It came with black beans and rice, and there wasn't much left, so I guess she did like it!

Overall, I think it's a great addition to Ballantyne, and I really hope it makes it since many others haven't.  It seems like a nice, casual, restaurant with a lower price point than Vine (which is right across the street), and I'm excited to go back."}
{"text":"Good food, good service.  Kid friendly.  Chicken fingers were fresh and moist.  The shrimp tacos were great, the fish tacos weren't that good, lacking in flavor...my 11 year old liked it though.  The asparagus tasted like a dirty grill and weren't cooked well.  I probably wouldn't go back.  I realize now they forgot to give us the ice cream & drink that came with the chicken fingers meal...oh well."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times.  The first time I was there was not impressed.  I decided to give it a second chance and I was surprised that it was alot better.  I had the fire cracker shrimp.. Really good!  Served with ranch on a bed of lettuce...next I had the steak tacos...fantastic.... They were good and pretty good sized...I had enough to take home....prices are pretty good....ambiance is good....it has a nice vibe"}
{"text":"We eat at this restaurant often because it is very close to our house. Overall, we enjoy the food. We have noticed though the sides have been slacking lately. For example, we offered a few weeks ago and my husband got the Mac n cheese for a side. The Mac n cheese was 100% stouffers brand Mac n cheese. We love stouffers and eat it often, However would expect a nice restaurant to make their own Mac n cheese. This evening I ordered their green beans and they were clearly canned green beans. Not impressed. Also, their side salads could use improvement. Again, we order from this restaurant regularly because the main course/entree's are always good. Their sides could use a lot of improvement though."}
{"text":"We loved it! The Grouper New Orleans was amazing. Great atmosphere and cute patio with fireplace. Buffalo Chicken dip as an app was delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place so much after our first visit that we returned again the same week.  The grouper w/pineapple salsa was fresh and really flavorful. Burger & fries were also excellent! Fresh, hand-formed patties cooked to order and served on a soft roll hot off the grill. The service was outstanding on both of our visits.  If you're looking for a nice casual dining experience with great food and a versatile menu that can accommodate a variety of tastes, give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight with 4 people and a young child
Food excellent 
Server Kory was excellent 
Prices very good will go back as often as o can
I highly recommend this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"very basic menu but the ribs I had were VERY good.  fall off the bone meat and great sauce. nice decor in the bar area and outside seating- has a rustic feel.  the primary dinning room is very basic."}
{"text":"My dining mates and I ate here for restaurant week. 
I have eaten at the Stone Mountain grill several times before . I have always enjoyed the dinners much better than the lunches.
Once I had a lunch of a fish tacos and did not enjoy it- hardly any fish  in the taco. However  their dinners are especially good. I have  enjoyed the cedar planked salmon as well as steak dinners.
The atmosphere was comfortable , the waitress was exceptionally attentive. 
 Since it was restaurant week we decided to order from that menu. For $35  one  can choose an appetizer , main course and a dessert  with a variety of  selections from each group .
 My dining mate and I had the fish , the mahi-mahi as the main course. Our friends had the steak, and the surf and turf. For appetizers we ordered  the  tomato  stack,  2  orders of barbecued bacon wrapped  shrimp appetizers ,  and  a wedge salad .
Dessert were the  salted caramel cheesecake and a key lime pie .
Portions were  good , food came out hot and was plated nicely . Meat and fish cooked perfectly and tender.
Everything was tasty and delicious .
Menu prices reasonable. 
Beer and wine menu too.
We would certainly return again for another dinner."}
{"text":"We love this place so much we got married there!  Rob was amazing at helping us plan our special day.  The food is great and we always look forward to dining here.  He outdoor patio is perfect in the middle of winter to cure the winter blues.  We will always be guests of this great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick casual lunch. I have sat at the bar in the back to get a quicker service. The service was quick enough for my needs but the food wasn't as great. I have ordered the quesadillas as it seemed simple enough to be quick and at the same time taste something that would be surely made it fresh. The food was not great. It was extremely spice to the level my tongue was burning for a few hours after I left the restaurant. No quesadilla should be this spicy. I won't probably be coming back due to other reviews as well, seems like this place needs to spice it up the quality but not the food."}
{"text":"Great service and very good food for the price point. Ask for Ana, she was great and has a great personality."}
{"text":"The food was over priced gross bar food and drinks water downed first time there I don't know how people return after going there just once. Stay away if you know how good food tastes like. Absolutely not a fine dining experience would classify this as a expensive Applebee's or chilis."}
{"text":"I always forget about this place but won't after dining there yesterday. We went for their Memorial Day BOGO Steak event. Altho they don't offer a bread basket I didn't mind bc they use that (possibly) wasted investment on the quality of food instead. Smart! The Pomegranate Martini special was an excellent pour and tasty mix ($5). To start, a side salad of dark, leafy romaine topped with raspberry dressing, shreaded cheeses, diced cucumber & potato sticks ($3).  It was nicely chilled and crispy. My friend & I both ordered the Chargrilled center-cut Angus Ribeye topped w. garlic butter, medium rare-plus and it was the best we've both had in a long time! The temp on this 12oz. steak came to the table exactly as ordered, was so tender we could use a butter knife and wasn't smothered with seasoning - which was refreshing as it is a petpeeve when chefs mask food with stuff. We split our sides of the smokey, roasted bok choy & smashed potatoes. Both were excellent! Each dinner was $21.99 each, minus the BOGO, we each had a ribeye steak dinner for $11. Drink, salad, steak & (2) sides, bc we shared them, for under $23. Can't beat that! Another friend had the Mahi dinner which was a great cut & seasoned and cooked to perfection! Bravo!
Now for service .... Chris and teammates never left us asking/wanting for anything! A well-oiled machine, with eyes on all tables, working together. Upbeat, knowledgable and readily available, even for a couple of photo shots! A wonderful experience!  As I recall, the other 3xs I went here I was also very happy. Stone Mtn. Grill has our business, without question! As a matter of fact I plan to grab this special offer again, before it ends Memorial Day!"}
{"text":"Had literally just checked next door at the Staybridge suites in the evening and was very hungry and didn't want to search around.  Decided to try this place due to it's 100ft proximity to the hotel.

I'm very glad I did.  

Service was excellent.

Drinks came quick.

The Tuna appetizer as well as the steak appetizer were a great way to start the meal.

Ordered the Crab Encrusted Mahi Mahi, and almost forgot my manners when I was done, because I wanted to lick the plate.

This place has a great \"hunting lodge\" type of feel and I would come back here again if given the opportunity.

Positive experience all around."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my husband here. We both enjoyed our food very much. Our waitress was professional and efficient. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had the Western Bacon Cheeseburger and my boyfriend had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. We both got it with a side of fries. Staff was great and food was very good. You get a taste of all ingredients in each bite... which is rare these days. The only downside for me was that we didn't get straws for our drinks and it was pretty chilly inside. Other than that it was all great!"}
{"text":"Maybe I was just in the wrong place.  I had a completely different experience from most other reviewers.  If what I had today was representative the normal here Stone Mountain will follow in the footsteps of its predecessors.  

The place itself is fine.  Not much different than Flat Rock.  Our service was also fine, no complaints in that department.

The menu seems great with a lot to choose from.  Burgers, wraps, sandwiches, plenty of entrees.  I ordered the Chicken Tortilla Soup which was flat out nasty.  Not sure if this was premade or made in house but it was so overspiced it was metallic tasting.   They could not have tasted it prior to sending it out or else anyone with any slight culinary ability would have rejected it.  I also ordered the Sonoma Chicken Sandwich,  I have never been to Sonoma but the town of Sonoma definitely has a lawsuit on their hands for misrepresentation.  Bland, flavorless and completely lacking imagination.  It had the most awful guacamole on top and the chicken breast was supposed to be blackened which after tasting the over seasoned soup I was shocked that the sandwich was completely void of any blackened flavor.  The sandwich was served with ice cold fries which were quickly replaced by our server with the chefs apologies.  

Sweetie had the California Veggie Wrap which was also described as lacking flavor.  She asked our server for some chipotle mayo to see if she could jazz up the blandness to no avail.  Someone else at my table ordered the same thing and wound up dipping the wrap in their bowl of overspiced soup just to try and add some flavor.

In order to make it in this area you have to have great food.  Stone Mountain, on this visit fell way short of my expectations and I will not be back for a second try."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my daughter on a Sunday evening and couldn't have asked for anything more! For appetizers we ordered Boom Boom Shrimp and Mozzarella sticks. I ordered my Boom Shrimp without the Boom Boom sauce and it was great! It says a lot about food if it's good without the sauce that was designed for the dish. I ordered the herb roasted half chicken with broccoli and a Long islands Iced Tea, both were delicious. My daughter ordered the salmon with broccoli and she also said her dinner was outstanding!
Our service was prompt and the atmosphere was comfortable for families or date night. We enjoyed Stone Mountain Grill and will come back again soon."}
{"text":"I gave it two stars because the service was good.  However, the food was negative 10 stars.  The meatloaf was dry and flavorless, the mac and cheese was not fresh and the blackened chicken pasta was ok but the actual chicken was rubbery.  The bourbon glazed salmon was also ok but the asparagus were hard and twiggy - you just could not bite through them.  We didn't complain nor did we send the food back.  If they couldn't tell by the amount of food left on our plates that we didn't like it.. Oh well.  We couldn't pay the check and get out of there fast enough.

I may go back and give it another shot.. Maybe I'll try the burger.  I usually dismiss a location after two tries."}
{"text":"The best item are the charred wings, you will not be disappointed.  The restaurant is not busy later in the night."}
{"text":"We've been coming here to meet friends for the past few weeks.  We usually sit in the bar or patio area.  The servers are very friendly and attentive.  We've had the steak tacos and they are so good, we haven't tried anything else.  Hubby and I usually split it and it's enough for us."}
{"text":"My son and I went here for brunch and ended up ordering more of a lunch because the options looked so good. We started off with the firecracker shrimp which was really, really good!  I had the buffalo chicken sandwich, which was not only fabulous, but enough to feed two. My son ordered the sunrise burger which has a sunny side up egg on top. No words for how good it was. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best location and has great Lunch and dinner options. I am a huge fan of their Salmon Salad and turkey burger. Great options to stay healthy!! The service is also fast and consistent! They have an outdoor covered patio as well, perfect for Game Day!"}
{"text":"Had a short lunch with co-workers and opted for the veggie burger. To be honest, it tasted like it came out of a box. Flavor profile was very bland, it wasn't seasoned well (if at all), and I felt like I could have made a better option myself at home. The fries were good, but how can you really mess up fries?

I pass this place all the time going to work and never thought about stopping in and likely won't again unless my company is footing the bill. I think a revamp of the menu would go a long way here. I can't complain about the service--our server was pleasant, prompt, and the other servers who delivered the food seemed pleasant as well, but I likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Stone Mountain Grill last weekend with another couple.  We had a reservation and were seated on time.  The server was good however the food took a while to get to us.  I had a caesar salad which may have been the worst one I've ever had.  It appeared to be iceburg lettuce and the dressing was given to me in a plastic container on the side. I don't know why a restaurant with that price range would serve something like that.  My Angus Ribeye steak was very good but the onion rings tasted like they came frozen out of a bag.  The chocolate cake was very good though.  I will give it another try if I have a coupon.  With all the competition for the public's dollars, the restaurant has to hit a home run on all the dishes."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a rainy saturday. Place is cozy with only a few people around. The table was icky sticky as well as the tiled floor.  Ordered the sunrise burger (with sunny side up egg). First my order came without egg and sent it back. Then it came with an egg not just on top but smudged everywhere as if after frying they just dumped the egg on the burger. The burger wasn't bad and our server was a nice young black guy. But whoever prepared the food in the kitchen ought to be sent back for training."}
{"text":"Menu is ordinary... nothing special. Service was ok, waiter was not very good and the tortilla chips tasted like old oil. Yuck. Never again."}
{"text":"Always great!  You must get the firecracker shrimp and the sea bass!  I have never had a bad meal at this place!!!"}
{"text":"Their outside patio area is AWESOME. Great food, quick service. :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant never disappoints!  They have such a large menu with a variety of food and the atmosphere is so cozy!  Great for bringing your family or a date (hubba hubba). I love their fish dishes and their shrimp appetizer. If you love wine, try visiting on Wednesdays for 1/2 off bottles or glasses of wine. Hump Day Fun Day!  Finally, their outdoor patio can become enclosed in cold months and includes a fireplace and TVs. Great location for a small gathering/party/event. And...if you're staying in Ballantyne on business or pleasure, you can walk or Uber to your hotel"}
{"text":"My last visit here this week caused me to lower my rating of the place.  

This visit I ordered the salmon which came with a huge portion of salmon on a cedar plank and mixed veggies.   The veggies were great.  The edges of the salmon were great also but once I got into the center of the salmon, it was raw.  I didn't come here for sushi and actually lost my appetite once I saw the raw portion.

Not only was my salmon bad but my colleague ordered a medium well burger and it came out medium rare.

What made this experience worse is how the staff handled the situation.  Our server commented that she was sorry, she would take it away.  Obviously she didn't know what to do.  Eventually she brought over a manager who asked what was wrong.  When we told him about the problems, he didn't seem to care.  The real kicker was when he asked if I wanted to take the salmon home.  Really?  Sure, I could take it home and cook it but that was their job.  

The last issue was we ordered an chip dip appetizer which on Wednesdays is $5 and we were charged $10 when the check arrived.  We were talking about it when our server overheard it and came back and said she updated the check.  Also, The manager eventually took the two bad orders off the check.

This incident may not stop me from returning.  As I said in my previous review, the meat loaf was great and I've heard the firecracker shrimp and fish tacos are good.  But I will stay away from the salmon in the future. 

There are definitely inconsistency issues here and the staff doesn't seem to know how to handle the issues."}
{"text":"I'm in love with their jerk chicken tacos. It's the best thing on the menu to me. The service is always great. Either to go or dine in, you'll always receive great service. No complaints from me."}
{"text":"Have come here several times. I keep hoping it would improve. One time my table had almost finished eating before my wings arrived. No apology for their mistake. Went again last night & had filet kabob....which was literally 2 tiny pieces of dried meat. Guess med rare is not in their vocabulary.  Tea never refilled but the waitress did bring alcoholic drinks for the ones drinking those.  Food is average. Service is average. Good luck in getting your food in a timely manner as ordered."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dining in the enclosed patio.  Nice atmosphere.  
Delicious food.  Good service."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy this restaurant frequently. The food is great and we really like the patio seating."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Stone Mountain Grill yesterday and were pleasantly surprised by how great everything was. The atmosphere is nice for families, friends, or a casual date. It sort of reminds me of a Cabelas inside but a restaurant version , very rustic and open.

The food was excellent; both of our steaks cooked perfectly med-rare with yummy garlic butter on top ( we had the NY strip ) .The loaded mashed red skin potatoes were indulgent to say the least...in a good way. 

The service was friendly and on the faster side.  Overall we will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic, but it was the the worst ribeye I have ever eaten. Extremely fatty, chewy and complete flavorless. I hate giving bad reviews, but this place can't serve steaks this bad and stay open."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow. I got a sweet tea and it tasted unsweet. Server apologized and gave me a new one and it tasted like he gave me unsweet again with artificial sweetener. I got the tacos and they were pretty good. Restaurant has a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We alway have a great time when we go here.  We LOVE to sit on the patio by the fireplace.  We try to try something new every time and never have had a complaint."}
{"text":"Went here last night for restaurant week. Made a reservation for 7:15 and we were in seats at 7:18. Once seated we were promptly greeted by Sandra our waitress (who was excellent). She told us about the restaurant week specials and told us we could order from the menu or take advantage of the restaurant week special. The special came with appetizers for each of us, a main course meal for each and a dessert choice. Wifey had a kale salad to start, followed by Salmon and vegetables for her main course and key lime pie for dessert. I had firecracker shrimp to start, ribs with fries and Mac&Cheese and salted caramel cheesecake for dessert. They also had drink specials which we took advantage of. The food and service IMO were top notch and welcomed being these two are hard to find together anymore. We will go back."}
{"text":"I love this place I work nearby so it's perfect location plus they take the Ballantyne card which is 15% off . My favorite is their Daisy Duke chicken sandwich because it has mayonnaise lol the chicken is very moist an flavorful. I've had a side salad w it an their Mac n cheese. I'm a southern girl I know my mac n cheese delish it passed my high standards, creamy n not a powder cheese it's real cheese yum. I just had din there last night an ordered the burger which they will substitute a turkey burger for you. However I wish I'd know it was just a frozen patty they put in the grill not good . Now they also have an amazing appetizer chips w guacamole/salsa/pimento cheese great to share before ur meal . I'll b back thee for sure they have a smothered chicken sandwich I've seems looks n smells amazing . Try it out an normally they have a special on wine last night was half off I believe."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on a popular Sunday and were pleasantly surprised that it wasn't overfilled. No surprised here for brunch as this is an American restaurant, so has your basic omelette and egg sandwich options. We had a few issues with the service in terms of having to ask another server for some items since ours was sometimes hard to get a hold of.

The food was fine as we aren't expecting something that pushes the tastebuds. The atmosphere was tailored to more for lunch or dinner as it reminds me of most american chain restaurants but with a mountain/western decor. It did feel like we were outside of Charlotte so that was a nice effect. I probably wouldn't come back for brunch since it wasn't anything special but I'd have to try it for dinner and check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at this place, and the service is always great.  The experience is very consistent.  That said, if you are looking for a cheap meal, this isn't the place, your bill will be on the higher side of casual.  Usually somewhere in the $40-$50 dollar range for two people.  I think it's a small price to pay for consistency and that has not stopped us from coming here frequently."}
{"text":"Had the ribeye steak - very tasty and cooked to a true medium as I requested. Maybe just a tad too salty though. The mashed potatoes were also very good. Service was excellent and the patio is really nice with about 6 big flat screens. Definitely a good place to catch up on sports highlights while enjoying a good dinner."}
{"text":"Friday night and a good crowd in the dining room, the bar and the outside patio with fireplace. Impressed by the menu with everything from pizza to burgers to entrees. The firecracker shrimp appetizer was great and well presented. We each got burgers which come in beef, turkey, and veggie options. Great fries as well. A varied wine menu had a lot of options."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant last night with a friend. They had a great special for $50 for two..you got an appetizer to share, each got a salad,  six main courses to choose from and dessert to share. It was a great deal, service was awesome. The waitress approached us as soon as we sat down to get our drink order and was very attentive through the night. Appetizer was delicious and the main courses were delicious also."}
{"text":"We went here recently for dinner.  It was amazing!  We were seated quickly, our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable.  Our food came fast and was absolutely delicious!  I had the pimento cheese meatloaf.  It sounded strange to me but I tried it and it is the best meatloaf I have ever had at a restaurant!  My husband tried the pimento cheese burger and he love that too!   I can't wait to go back!!  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My first time here.  I tried the spicy shrimp wrap.  It was pretty good but a small portion.  I chose Cole slaw as a side - it was the worst slaw I ever had!

Service was horrible.  Waitress must be new and never been to a restaurant before.

This was also my last time I'll be going here."}
{"text":"Not my first time here...but I failed to post reviews of previous trips. My previous visits were pleasant.  I have tried the cedar plank salmon, which was so tasty I had it again during a second visit.  I had it with the loaded potatoes minus the bacon. And I've experienced the rich decadent chocolate cake - yum!  

My experience with the salmon on my second visit however was not as pleasant, because though things started off good at the beginning, as I got closer to the center it was not fully cooked. I had the waiter return it where they finished cooking it. 

Fast forward  to today's trip where I went and relaxed a bit while watching the football game(s). I decided to try the jerk chicken tacos, as I had seen plenty rave reviews about these tasty treats. And I am very grateful to say that the reviews did not disappoint!  

At first I did not think that I would like the tacos in a hard shell as that's not my thing...these were a definite exception.  The meat, the spices, the mango salsa, & Mexican slaw, along with the sauce they topped it with and the soft and hard shells marry together exquisitely.

I would definitely come back and get the jerk chicken tacos again. I also want to try the shrimp tacos. I did get to taste the turkey burger, but I did not care for it.

Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but they only had one vegetarian option. It was the California Veggie Wrap. It was mostly lettuce and came with a side. It wasn't too bad, but I wouldn't come here again because that was literally my only choice of food to eat."}
{"text":"Great food & great service! Jordan & Amy were fantastic servers...ask for them, they will definately take care of you!
Food was yummy. We started with cheese sticks, they were not greasy at all, and more of them than some other places. The fish tacos were wonderful, and the portion was huge...a crunchy shell inside a soft tortilla, and correct proportion of fish to veggies, guacamole was yummy but my favorite part was the spicy sauce they put on. My table also tried the chicken quesadilla, and it was also well received. I was hugely impressed with the variety on the kids menu and the amount of food was enough for my 1 & 3 year old to split...they had the cheeseburger (which was 2 sliders) and mac & cheese, and the meal also included a drink & ice cream, all for $5! We will xefinately be back, and most certainly will sit in Jordan's section again!"}
{"text":"A group of 16 of us were out of town and decided to go over to stone mountain grill. The manager told us he could not sit all of us together as we had such a large party even though you can make reservations online for 20 people. He said it would be to much for the waiter or waitress and we would all have ro sit seperately. He suggested next time we call a week ahead of time. Are u kidding me! We walked out, as to us that was not true service and they did not deserve our money!"}
{"text":"Very nice interior - comfortable and clean + extremely friendly and enthusiastic staff. I wanted to give Stone Mountain Grill a four, but the food did not wow me. The prices are fair for what you get but my cheeseburger fell flat. The meat wasn't as juicy or as nicely seasoned as I like. Toppings were too large and clunky and as such the burger kept falling apart. The bun was nicely toasted and flavors were fine, but it just didn't blow me away. When I go out for a burger I like to be wowed and I often am. I believe with a bit of investigation and extra effort Stone Mountain is not far off from improving this situation. The fries were nearly perfect in taste, but there were too few of them...my plate looked sad and only half dressed. My companions appeared to enjoy their food and it looked tasty to me, esp. the onion rings. I was glad that I did not order the shrimp salad that my friend ordered because there were only a few shrimp. I really do believe that with a few simple tweaks Stone Mountain could take this 3 score up to a 4...they're not too far off the mark, but they're not quite there yet."}
{"text":"It's good. Not our favorite - but not terrible. The server was unlike any we've had - jovial, dynamic and very attentive.... But..... The food wasn't stellar. I've been to events where Stone Mountain has catered, but when I ordered the same stuff in the restaurant it's completely inconsistent. I really want this place to be successful as they're conveniently located, but the quality is lacking and consistency is the key to keeping regulars. This location has turned over so often - I just want a superstar restaurant to stay put for awhile. Management, heed the feedback - pull it together.... We WANT a regular place and you have great staff that could do it!!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad joint.  Chicken and Moz sticks were very good but the fish tacos were overly spicy with the Sriracha sauce.  I would stick to burgers, fries and chicken here or just beers and apps."}
{"text":"First visit and very impressed. Service was excellent. Thanks to Tana our waitress and food was very good. We ordered the meatloaf and filet. Yum!! Will be back."}
{"text":"Rustic, casual, not a huge wait on Sat. night . Cute outdoor
Seating Area with a large fireplace. Not expensive and good wine and bar service  

Had the trio with chips-great guacamole, decent pimento cheese.
Fish taco's were good.
Flatbread pizza, so , so

Over all- higher ceiling make for a loud experience but many television make the bar a happening place"}
{"text":"We stopped here in between soccer games for lunch while in town for a soccer tournament. The food was excellent, staff was very friendly, and we enjoyed sitting on the Patio. I had the firecracker shrimp taco & Jerk Chicken taco both were amazing. I could not decide between the two so the waitress suggested that I could get one of each! Loved them both! Will definitely be back if we are in this area again."}
{"text":"Went for Queens feast with another couple. Oyster Rockefeller in spinach dip was tasty. Blackened Grouper was great as was the cedar plank salmon. Our friends had surf & turf and would order it again, the cheese cake was better than the key lime pie. 

Wine list was good and reasonably priced. Service was friendly and efficient.

We would visit again"}
{"text":"I drive by this place all the time and just recently got around to visiting for the first time.  The restaurant was near empty when we arrived which always is a little worrisome.   Staff was friendly, prompt and made sure we had everything we needed.  The host took note of our need for floor space for our infant car seat and picked out a suitable table and removed the extra chair.  We are new parents and have come to find that many restaurants are not accommodating when it comes to this.  

I had the shredded chicken tacos and they were so good.  My husband had the smothered chicken and thoroughly enjoyed it. Overall a positive experience.  We will likely return again."}
{"text":"Excellent bar food...the buffalo chicken dip is my favorite!  I got the Tacos as well, one chicken & one steak.  My husband got one of the burgers and it was cooked to perfection.  Drinks were a plus too, great Moscow mules.  We will definitely be back soon since it's very close to our home."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, sat outside and it was so cute. Our server was Mason and he was awesome.I ordered a flavored martini, really good. My guy ordered a beer. We just ordered apps and a salad. We ordered Firecracker Shrimp which was lightly fried on top of greens with their \"boom boom\" sauce an topped with scallions and drizzled with ranch dressing. Yum-Fuckin- O!! Their Filet Kabob were tender and perfectly cooked and came topped with crumbled blue cheese on top of arugula salad with onions, mushrooms, and peppers. So good. I ordered a small side salad and this thing was huge and chock full of shit!! Wow!! We hafta go back and  you should too."}
{"text":"I stayed while in town at The Marriott across the street & decided to try this place for dinner with a friend & 2 teens. Have to say it was great. We sat out in their patio & had the set menu for 2. $50 for four course  dinner with choices. Great value. Nice ambiance relaxing vibe, lots of tvs. Staff were great & many people in restaurant. It was perfect for dinner. It beat getting in car to drive somewhere. Not often do you get a great place right beside a hotel. I would definitely recommend for anyone needing dinner. Servings huge. Food good."}
{"text":"Great! My server was Melissa and she was very friendly and attentative. I had the rib eye medium, it was a little overdone for medium, but overall very yummy..The loaded mash red potatoes definitely stole the spotlight.  I would go back and just order them! One of my favorite aspects was the warm, inviting and cozy dining room and the outside looks like it would be nice in the warmer weather seasons.!"}
{"text":"Went a few friends and our kids last Saturday and the service was horrible. I am not sure if they were short staffed or the waiter was not trained properly. 

We sat down and the waiter came and got our drink orders and that was about the last time he brought us drinks and or refills. We had to ask the manager and 2 other members each time to get a simple refill. The waiter did not come by to ask if we needed anything. We ordered appetizers and the wings came out 30 minutes later. The wings were good but took way to long. After that out enters came 45 minutes later. We complained the the manager and his reply was we can cancel for you, no apologies or anything. I did not expect anything to be free but something should of bee on the managers part. Not a sorry or anything.   

I would not return because of the manager. I don't expect his staff to be trained appropriately if he is the manager. The ownership should really re think who they have leading their staff."}
{"text":"We recently went to dinner with friends here and had a great experience. They had an extensive drink list. Two of us at the table got beer and two of us got mixed drinks and everyone enjoyed their beverages. 

For dinner, I had the buffalo sandwich in the form of a wrap and loaded mashed potatoes. It was all delicious. I wish I would've asked for more
Hot sauce on the side but otherwise, it was wonderful. My boyfriend had the meatloaf, which he said he really enjoyed. Our friends (who come to this place often) got the tacos and the shrimp and grits. Everyone scraped their plate clean. 

Good spot. Check it out."}
{"text":"I hate to give a new restaurant a bad review, but my boyfriend and I went there last night for his birthday, and were expecting a better experience than we got. First of all, they did have delicious fried pickles, which were even better dipped in our requested honey mustard. However, the service, the food, and the one drink I ordered were all mediocre at best.

Our server was very sweet, but after she told my boyfriend they did not have a beer menu yet, and she couldn't even think of any of their beers off the top of her head, she did not make any effort to find out what kind of beer he liked and/or find out what beers they offered. I had ordered a Patron margarita, which tasted watered down and bland.

For our entrees, I ordered the Sonoma chicken sandwich, which tasted good, but wasn't anything I couldn't make at home. My side of broccoli was only warm, not hot.
My boyfriend ordered the sunrise burger, which had a sunny-side-up egg. The egg had way too much of that undercooked clear, slimy consistency, which my boyfriend carefully scraped off, and his fries were undercooked and under-seasoned as well.

Our dessert was the brownie sundae, which was very dry on the outside, but luckily pretty moist on the inside. It could've been warmer to contrast the cold ice cream. But in their defense, I am picky about brownie sundaes.

On top of everything, they don't do anything special for birthdays. I understand some places don't, but I really think a seemingly upperclass restaurant like this should at least put a candle on our dessert.

Probably won't try this place again anytime soon, which is unfortunate because we could tell they put a lot of work and time into the interior decor."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's casual dining. Our last visit was Wednesday and to our surprise it was half price wine!  The wing, quesadillas and sliders are all very good.  I had the Grouper New Orleans and like it a lot. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Finally was able to try this place since it is pretty much in the parking lot of my office.  Two things that peaked my interest. 1 - Received an email that I could receive 30% off if I used my Ballantyne Corporate Perks card and 2- It's close to my office.  The dining room has a cabin feel and almost an intimate vibe with the fireplace going.  Their sanitation score was a 97...check! The bathrooms looked great. They were clean, smelled fresh and everything was stocked...check! Everything about this place was almost perfect until we received our food.  I ordered the firecracker shrimp wrap and my colleague ordered the chicken and pear salad. The girl who brought the food out asked which one had the Asian salad, which was neither one of us.  My coworker said no she had the chicken and pear...the waitress immediately corrected herself and said \"I meant the Chicken and Pear\". My friend said no that's not it because there is mushrooms on it. So she took it back and a few minutes later brought out the actual chicken and pear.  No problems there since the kitchen quickly corrected their mistake. My friend was not overly thrilled with her salad but she did eat it all.  Now onto my wrap.  It was so bad I didn't even eat half of it.  The fries were awesome...but the wrap was terrible.   2 Stars for environment and cleanliness."}
{"text":"I like the food here.... It wasn't mind blowing, but it was good.   Not bad for an American food restaurant.   

The buffalo dip was really good and so was the jerk chicken tacos.   The quesadillas was just ok.  

The next time I come back.... I will most certainly get the jerk chicken tacos."}
{"text":"Service is okay, but the food is definitely below average. The Caesar salad was terrible with wilted lettuce and non-existent dressing; the fish tacos had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. No reason to ever go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located directly across from my work.  I've written a review on their Facebook page before but this place definable deserves a positive Yelp review!  I've been over 8 times since they've opened and I have yet to have a complaint! The staff is friendly and every entree I've had has been to die for.  This has definitely become one of my favorite restaurants!  Fave:  Jalapeno burger and all of their tacos!"}
{"text":"This has been come one of my favorite lunch spots. The food is always on point, hot and fresh. I have found a great waiter who understands time constraints of my 1 hour lunch break.  I would definitely recommend SMG to anyone. The firecracker shrimp tacos are my favorite."}
{"text":"Not off to a good start!!! Had a reservation, sounds like we have a table in front of the fireplace--sounds good, but it's on the side in a corner-your sitting on the side of the fireplace--great seat if you want to look at brick.
We request another table, then they sit us at a table to accommodate a group-like talking across a canyon. The noise level is high, even our waitress couldn't hear stating it was loud.
We asked for bread, to which they state they don't have bread but could toast a burger roll? I'm not making this up.  I was looking forward to trying this place out, but think this will be my only visit.
We both ordered the crab crusted Mahi.  I think it was previously frozen and not fresh.  The fish was tough and undercooked.  The waitress even agreed and apologized.  We ended up leaving and went someplace else. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I live in the Ballantyne area so it is nice to see that this building that has been abandoned for a good 3+ years finally has some life to it! My husband and I have been there 3 times by ourselves, with friends and with my mother. Each experience was differnt but pretty good in my opinion. Every new place will have some humps along the way and the beer menu and some servers are things that need some fine tweeking. I have had the Jerk Chicken tacos and the Fish tacos both are STUFFED and any normal person could get full off of just one but they serve you two. The tacos have been my favorite dish so far having a hard shell taco wrapped in a flour tortilla and good side choices if you dont want the beans and rice that come with it. We have also had the Buffalo chicken dip which I have made myself at home but have gotten on 2 sperate visits because its that good. 

Good food, decent prices for the area, but some work needed on the bar (beer choices and menu also training staff on what differnt type drinks available). Lots of this can just be ironed out after expierence. Glad to have a new place in the neighborhood!!

Oh and I almost forgot, when it gets warmer they have an Awesome outdoor area!"}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant with my family. The food is always well seasoned and comes out fairly quickly. Good for a casual dinner. In the winter the fireplace adds a nice ambience."}
{"text":"They never seem to get the orders right. My requests are simple. A wrap dry-meaning no mayo or any sauces. Always...always...always, they add mayo. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner with her parents and all I can say is food drinks and service was great!"}
{"text":"Loved the decor and atmosphere in the dining room. Great for family and low key outings.  Food was good.  Not anything that blew my socks off, but I would come back to try more dishes.  Firecracker Shrimp was awesome.  I got the Mahi Tacos...came out cold but not too bad.  Friend got the Shrimp and Grits. I felt like the sauce could have been a little more flavorful but still yummy.  Looking forward to trying more.  And on Wednesday they have 1/2 off wine and $5 apps...can't beat that.  Was here on a Saturday night and they had $5 long island...not bad for Ballentyne and Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is the second time eating here in three years as I remembered how good the ribs were. The barbecue ribs here are an extremely hidden secret in Charlotte. For $21 for a full slab, and great quality, it is worth a special trip."}
{"text":"I'm always glad when a new restaurant opens. It reminds me of how much Charlotte has to offer and it just keeps getting better. Went here the first weekend it was open. The server was wonderful. She was funny and helpful and didn't let you wait. The food was okay. The bard area was pretty great and the deck looked like someplace I would love to hang out if the TV's were off for just a little while. We'll be back, but this time for appetizers and deck time."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night my sister and a great friend. This place is fantastic. The food was incredible for each of us. Server was friendly, attentive and food arrived hot and timely. I would like to see them offer some type of specialty bread. We never had to want for anything. I'll certainly keep this place as a must to visit."}
{"text":"Knocked another one off my #Yelps10FirstsCLT list and i'm happy with it. I pass Stone Mountain Grill at least twice a day, 4 days a week for the past 2 years. It's literally 1 minute from my job and I never stopped in until now. I went in for lunch, but it was around 2pm so there wasn't much of a crowd. When I walked in there was nobody at the Hostess stand, I had to wait a few minutes for someone to show up. I didn't even see servers walking by to flag down. But when she arrived she was friendly, patient and helpful. I went with the Firecracker Shrimp Spinach Wrap & Green Beans as my side. Less than 10 minutes later my togo order was ready! The Wrap was so delicious! I was a little worried. I don't normally like fried foods in my wraps because they have a tendency to be soft fried or soggy. But not this wrap. Even with the sauce on the shrimp they were still crispy and the shrimp were tender. This is going to be one of my new lunchtime go-to's! Now the Green Beans i'll probably pass on next time. The seasoning just didn't go anything for me. You can tell they were cooked in meat or fat... but they forgot the salt and seasonings. They were just bland. I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Really good food. Good service. Nice variety of dishes. Our table had steak, seafood, and pasta dishes and they were all very good."}
