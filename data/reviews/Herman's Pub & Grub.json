{"text":"One of my favorite pubs in Brunswick. I almost don't want to put this review because it's a good kept secret. Food is excellent, staff is friendly and professional. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Ehh. That's pretty much what I thought of my experience here. I was disappointed based on all of the good reviews from here, Facebook, etc. The place was pretty busy and there were times when we had a fairly long wait(to get our food and refills), but I don't blame the waitresses. They were doing the best they could given the crowd inside and outside. I got a burger and felt it was a little dry. It maybe could have used some mayo and there wasn't much flavor to it, but it was a larger burger. The fries were good, but lukewarm. The crowd appeared to be more 40+ and I'm guessing quite a few were regulars. The air conditioning was running almost the whole time, which chilled both my husband and I. He got a gyro and had no complaints. The prices were decent. We had both meals and soft drinks for under $20."}
{"text":"i went out last night with my buddy Luke. we started at one end of Brunswick but that establishment didn't serve food (and i hadn't eaten) so Luke suggested Herman's. 

I remember when this was Buddy's and I'd been there once over 15 years ago. 

I ordered a Miller Lite and had a Herman-ator burger (8oz smoked bbq pulled pork, slaw,
pepper jack cheese w/ lettuce, tomato and onion also). The burger was huge and potentially messy. I managed to eat it without making a mess and i have to say it was delicious. the french fries were cooked perfectly and i wish i'd had a few more. it's so rare to find a perfectly cooked french fry - crispy but not over cooked. 

i'd say it's a safe bet I'll be back. i worry about smaller places like this so I hope people in the area get out and give it a try. it's worth your time."}
{"text":"Cold Saturday we decided to explore somewhere new. Read the reviews and decided to give hermans a shot. Don't know which establishment these people visited. If you like deep fried processed food this is the place. Looks like summer would be a blast on the patio for some drinks"}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  Good food. Lets hope Brunswick keeps a hold of this, try it out, I was totally surprised..in a great way!"}
{"text":"Love this place! the service and food are phenomenal every single time we go in.  I think a lot of people pass by this place thinking it is a little hole in the wall..but omg are they missing out. Drinks,food,sevice and atmoshpere are all on point!"}
{"text":"Great spot to meet friends for drinks, dinner, or lunch. Good food, cold beer, great patio, VERY clean!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork is awesome, as are the burgers! Service is great, everyone is super friendly. The patio out back is awesome too! We love Herman's!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today, was glad to see somebody with reasonable prices and food open for lunch around where I live and work.

The wings are awesome, jumbo size and the mild sauce has the right amount of bite. I had a classic chicken sandwich with BBQ and while its only chicken, the poultry was juicy and the sandwich was large.  Fries were cooked as requested and hit the spot.

The inside of the establishment has been completely gutted and upgraded, definitely a huge difference. Two brand new pool tables on the upper level. Don't let the outside appearance of a strip mall discourage you, the inside is very nice.

They have a Touch Tunes machine, a number of Flat Screens both above the bar, along the back side and then will be installing a few more on the other wall (opposite the bar).

I have driven by and there were a number of people there, so it looks like people are giving it a try. Definitely not Rico's kind of crowd a little more upscale than that I would suspect.

I concur that I hope Brunswick Hills doesn't impact this, its definitely a great addition to the corner of this side of town.

Good luck to the owners and the staff, they are an asset to the community."}
{"text":"Great service, the Philly burger is excellent! With 2 waitresses/barmaids, never had to wait for a refill on mine or my husbands drink. I  can't get past this Philly burger, but hubby has had different menu items without any complaints."}
{"text":"We ordered the Philly Burger and the Gyro Burger.  Both came out hot off the grill and cooked to order.  Fries were also nice and hot.  We're here on a Saturday early evening and were able to get two seats at the bar with OH-IO playing in the NCAA tourney."}
