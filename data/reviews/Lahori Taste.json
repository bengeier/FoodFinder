{"text":"If you are curious to try this place, save your money, and stomach and taste buds!  Don't go here.  They wont last very long.  Experience: -  Customer service sucks, and did not have half the menu items available. -  Butter chicken:  wow!  I have never had butter chicken that stank of fish!  could not eat it!  You can make way better with National or Shaan mixes! -  Channa:  poor!  chick peas were cooked, i was impressed. -  Naan:  average at best. -  Shaami kabab:  frozen batch.. nothing special at all. -  Chicken Seekh Kabab:  was ok!  Eatable!  not special..  So at first he charges me 40 bucks, and when i go to pick up: \"OH sorry sir, we made mistake, its 50 bucks.. so im like thats not right.. he is like no problem, I will take some dishes back.. LOL!!!  what great service!  Shammi kabab, he wont even make it if you don't order 4 minimum!  2.50 each!  In conclusion.. insult to any taste Lahore has to offer..  Many better choices in the area!"}
{"text":"One of the two best places in town to have Keema Naan. It can be a little less spicy though.  He makes the naan any BBQ item fresh which is always a plus. For the most part I am satisfied with this place.  This place is more like a hole in the wall. So don't expect service or ambiance. Go for the food!  Update: Balance of spices has certainly improved. The owner was also talking about moving to better location in near future.   Food continue to satisfy taste buds."}
{"text":"This place is closed down, not to much surprise as having no use of ethics in operating a business.   Places like this eventually have the inevitable of going under because of such poor practice in customer service.   Gives a bad reputation to the south Asian community with how so many of the eateries have no really good reputation."}
