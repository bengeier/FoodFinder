{"text":"Everything here is amazing and made in-house. The various BBQ options, sandwiches, dips, and desserts (especially the homemade cheesecake) are absolutely delicious. They also make large sizes of BBQ, chicken salad, and ham salad for your party needs. Don't pass this place up and say hi to Diego and Sam who are making this amazing food daily!"}
{"text":"Average at best.  

Wife and I tried for the first time.  We arrived to an empty restaurant, which was not a problem, but the greeting from the woman behind the counter was unenthusiastic.  Dining area is small, especially if there are other diners present.  But it was very clean.  Prices were reasonable.  We both ordered salads, which were ample and well priced.  Disappointed that soda not available thru fountain, only packaged.  No lemonade for making Arnold palmers."}
{"text":"Just had a baby shower and Southern Salads was my go to for chicken salad,  croissants, and pimento cheese. ...everyone commented on how good everything was!   I only had a couple croissants left,  so that made for easy cleanup for me!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Clay and company are amazing!  We love Southern Salads. They have gone above and beyond for us. Amazing and fresh food!"}
{"text":"Have had great food from Southern Salads in the past. Called in order at noon today for their great burgers. Got there at the appointed time and no order. No record of it. Big problem I had a four hour drive ahead of me and couldn't wait for them to start from scratch. Person who took order was a little shaky when taking the order. Will try again soon but will make sure order is entered in the system."}
{"text":"I wish I could give more than 5 stars. Not only were the salads the absolute best salads my husband and I have had in a very long time, but the service was phenomenal as well.  Young man that took our order, as well as the young man in the back preparing our food and washing dishes were both kind and personable. It truly made our night, having such great food and service. Thank you for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Everything we have tried on the menu has been fresh and delicious. Creamy chicken salad is my fav! Also have ordered a catering tray and they did a great job.

Best for take out-- seating is minimal, do not plan to stay especially if you have more that 2-4 people in your group."}
{"text":"So the chicken salad was amazing.  Just like my mom made.  Although the bread wasn't fresh, it was still pretty good.  Ok, this place is small and its filthy. The atmosphere is not appealing.  Hope they make it."}
{"text":"I came here for something refreshing. It was really good I got a chef salad and chicken and rice soup. Both were delicious. Salad was fresh and salad dressing was  homemade which is always a plus for me. Establishment was small to wait for my to go order but it was out within 5-7 minutes which was great. I have not tried there chicken salad but I will say people were in line buying it by the containers full. I will try next time but this is a great place for a to go lunch ."}
{"text":"Had their crab cake sandwich with chips. Really neat lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my chef salad. Very fresh and plenty of toppings. The red velvet cheesecake is also good."}
{"text":"I tried Southern Salads because they advertise that they use Breadsmith bread for their sandwiches.  I'm allergic to soy and it is in most commercial breads, so eating a sandwich or a burger from an unknown place is risky (although the symptoms are just that my stomach will hurt pretty bad).  I ordered a tuna salad sandwich on wheat toasted for the wife and a turkey salad sandwich on wheat not toasted for me.  My wife loved hers and everything was fresh.  Everything was also fresh on mine except for the bread.  I eat Breadsmith bread all the time and this was definitely their bread.  Their bread goes bad quickly, especially the wheat, since they use no preservatives.  It wasn't stale or moldy but staleness was not far away.  It was at the point were it was becoming \"airy\" and the ingredients fell out of the sandwich.  The turkey was good and the lettuce tomato were fresh.  There was a decent amount of meat on the sandwich - more than a place like McAlister's or Jason's Deli and it was also cheaper.  

The place isn't dirty as the previous review stated (their sanitation grade is 99):

That being said, the place is a little dark and dismal that makes it appear dirty.  It needs some brightness (more overhead lights).  The menu is written in pinkish chalk and a blackboard and it is difficult to read but they have paper ones.The previous reviewer is definitely correct about the atmosphere.  The darkness of it will keep a lot of people away - perception is everything.  Their product is good and the price is fair, so I hope they succeed.  I will definitely come here for a sandwich or a salad over the chain deli-type places, but I will ask for the bread toasted next time."}
{"text":"Small compact little diner with AMAZING food! There are only about 4 tables inside which is a little disappointing but the food and service made up for the lack of space. I had the Fried Bologna and the meat was cut to about an inch or a little bigger thick!! That is a meal in itself. The prices are great as well. Absolutely going to become an thing when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Ate there today. This place is filthy! Ice machine wouldn't work so the girl climbed on the counter with her boots to knock the ice. Back kitchen looked disgusting. Floor looked like it has never been cleaned. Customers needed silverware and saw her put her hand down in dirty water to get some to clean. Ordered a salad. Small serving for $10. Nothing special. Lettuce was brown. Only positive was the cashier was super nice and friendly. Sorry to say we will not return."}
{"text":"I had a great sandwich here, a grown up grilled cheese!  I am looking forward to trying their tuna salad and soups!  Definitely recommend Southern Salads.  Friendly and courteous staff.  The gal behind the counter was going on maternity leave the next day.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are fabulous,  especially my favorite,  the chunky chicken salad on whole wheat toast and a side of the most amazing cherry jalape√±o relish, wow.  The girls working there always remember us and the service is fantastic.  We actually bought a pound of the chunky chicken salad and made sandwiches on our road trip to  NY, unfreakin believable I tell you."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop in for lunch. I love the bread choices and the chicken salad is really good! To the belly acher that thinks refrigerated chicken salad doesn't last a week or so... quit being such a hypochondriac. It's fine. The reason they are not \"shut down\" is because its fine and you are just one of those people that can never be satisfied. If you want to make your own chicken salad every day and throw it away EVERY day, eat your heart out. I eat the chicken salad here a lot and it's the best I've ever had AND I'm still alive! Imagine that. I had one of their burgers here today for the first time and it was awesome. The prices are reasonable too. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I try another item that blows me away. Today I had the Tomato Bisque and it is delicious. Always good service and a good meal here. The Rocking Roast Beef is amazing"}
{"text":"I have seen commercials for 10 years from Rock Hill SSS Co.  They now have this Fort Mill location and we decided to give it a try for lunch.  The gal at counter who took
our order and guy preparing food were such nice young folks.  I so wanted to like the food.  Unfortunately I was quite underwhelmed by their 'famous homemade chicken salad' sandwich on white bread.  The salad was bland and bread was dry.  My wife had meatloaf on grilled bread.  Hers was better with the bread grilled.  The dining area is very small and soda only comes in bottles."}
{"text":"I was really excited the first time I tried this place! I thought originally that the chicken salad was delicious! The next time I visited..... I thought maybe since I saw they had packaged chicken salad that I would also get some to go.... well this is where I got disturbed to say the least. I was looking through the tubs checking dates. Every container said it had been made about a week ago. I went to the counter and said these are all old and no good. Do you have anything made today? The cashier says, \"these were made last week but you see the other date says they are good for another two weeks\" 

I was horrified by this response. I said politely, \"hah, I don't know about you... but when I make chicken anything it must be eaten within a few days, I wouldn't ever eat a chicken dish that was more than 3 days old.\"

To this the cashier replied \" to be honest I don't either at home but that's just what they do here, they must have a way to keep it from spoiling\"

I tried to push past this exchange and I asked, surely there was a fresh batch that had been made today to serve to patrons and she goes to the kitchen to see if it was fresh and what they were serving that day was a few days old already as well!

WHAT THE **** 

This place should be shut down."}
{"text":"Smoked chicken salad is delicious! Great selection of soups, salads and sandwiches. Cool spot too., but small... good for to-go or in-out"}
{"text":"Our office got a to go order from here. We were all pleased with our salads. Prices are really good. Salads were nicely placed. I got the grilled chicken salad with italian dressing. Chicken had a good flavor to it but it was slightly dry for me. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Wow this place was a pleasant surprise. Found my new favorite lunch spot. The chicken salad sandwich on a croissant was so delicious. Especially with provolone on it. Looking forward to trying out your pasta salad and potato salad next."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Lunch today and me and Baldie finally tried it. Every time we attempted to try it, they were closed. We ordered the chicken club on toasted sourdough bread. It was huge!! We ordered the \"creamy\" style chicken salad instead of chunky. It was loaded with chicken salad and bacon. So good! Thank God we decided to share. We also ordered a Harvest salad with apples, craisins, and walnuts and chose the raspberry vinaigrette. It was a little too sweet for me, but perfect for Baldie. We got a small side of Cole slaw, Delish! You can buy containers of egg salad, chicken, salad, pimiento cheese, etc and the prices were reasonable. Everything Was fresh and delicious. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I thought everything was awesome! I tried the French dip, which the bread was perfect and they politely remade it for me after I had forgotten to say no cheese. The sweet tea was some of the best tea around and I even tried one of the chocolate chip cookies, which was a great deal for $0.50! My friend tried the potato soup and loved it, but it was very filling and I would recommend getting the smaller portion if you have a smaller appetite. Overall the service was very friendly and I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"I go here regularly for lunch and the occasional tub of chicken salad to go.  Their food is consistently delicious and the staff is courteous and friendly.  The chicken quesadillas have to be my favorite special, but there's so many great items to choose from.  If it's your first time, I'd say get the chicken salad, or one of their specialty salads, or try the tomato bisque with a grilled cheese, so damn good."}
