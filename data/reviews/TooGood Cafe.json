{"text":"There's a new owner now, and they serve every kind of Crepe you can imagine! also their burgers are freshly grilled and cheaper than McDonalds!!! I found this little place last month walking though Main St. and it was the best find all month! I'm definitely going back for second and thirds! I had this breakfast Crepe, it was a the best thing ever. I was some Dessert crepes I need to try next! :)"}
{"text":"If you can't even get a grilled cheese sandwich right, you might as well pack it in! We went there on a quiet Sunday afternoon. The heat wasn't working and the owner is practically incompetent in his food-preparation methods. The tea was lukewarm and never in my life have I seen a grilled cheese sandwich served burnt (thoroughly and on both sides) and squished to the point that it appeared to have been run over by a pick-up truck. A questionable and solitary sliced tomato was served alongside the burnt sandwich, and was peppered with a dried green herb of some kind. The sandwiches were also expensive--$5.25 each! To make matters worse, the owner used Kraft singles--something that I haven't seen done since 1977."}
{"text":"Nestled in Main Street Unionville, this little cafe is nice to drop by for lunch during the summer months. The outdoor patio makes for nice people watching. There's a decent number of tables outside. I would avoid dining indoors in the summer. It's stuffy and dark without much light.  The atmosphere is relaxed and there's free wi-fi so if you need to get some work done but don't want to be stuck home, this might be a good place to check out. 

Now the food... the only thing that stands out here is the paninis. They're $5.99 each and the two times I've had them, they were hot, toasty and very tasty. The coffee and the baked goods were okay. I haven't been in a few months so I don't know if the quality of the food has gone up or down. I just generally like this place because compared to the other restaurants in this area, this place is tucked a little further away and quiet enough to work or chat with friends."}
