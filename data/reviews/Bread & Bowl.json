{"text":"Great food and super friendly staff. Got a free brownie one time. Brought some friends over another time and the lady have us a free plate of brownies and marshmallow rice crispies. They remember who you are and treat you very well! The food is superb, especially their sandwiches. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"A a first timer and taking a quick later lunch break while caring for a loved one in the hospital, the Bread and Bowl restaurant offered a calm and friendly atmosphere, with good service. The food is very fresh and delicious. The salad and dessert were both healthy and tasty. Their almond flour walnut square with honey was a good choice as was the Ni√ßoise salad. Good choices for people who are wheat free. I'd have that again for sure and I'd like to try something else like their sandwiches during a future lunch. Their daily specials look great as do their soup selections. Clearly there is a regular clientele who is recognized and thanked for their business when they leave. I had a good experience."}
{"text":"The turkey sandwich is amazing. I'm told they make it fresh in house. I had the roasted red peppers on my sandwich and they are seasoned to perfection. The staff are super friendly too. Would defiantly recommend for lunch."}
{"text":"Worst sandwich experience, and I've eaten at Druxys.   I went in my a friend and we both decided on sandwiches. The woman behind the counter wasn't rude but was acting as if she had no idea how to do anything. This is fine except she had no one with her. The place was empty and it took 10 minutes for me to order JUST MY sandwich and for her to put literally mustard, mayo and lettuce on it. After the longest sandwich building experience of my life she goes to the back for another 5 minutes and comes back with her manager who tells me they have no turkey. Now I haven't been at all rude up until this point so I'm not sure why she felt she needed her manager to tell me this, but I digress. I tell them that I wouldn't have stuck around at all if I knew that they didn't have turkey, as that's the only sandwich I wanted out of their poor selection (considering they're mainly a deli).   The manager was rude after this point and told me \"well you don't have to stay.\" No shit. Needless to say I got out of there quick, went to Sid's Deli down the street, and had an amazing experience! Check out Sid's Deli is the moral of this story.  TLDR; service sucked, didn't have the meat I had ordered, and manager was rude. Go to Sid's Deli."}
{"text":"Best breakfast and lunch place around!!!! Awesome breakfast special just ask for the \"Sheldon\".!!! The wraps are awesome and the soups are delish!!! Everything is home made and made with care.... Awesome place!"}
{"text":"The pizza's so gorgeous there and the salads are amazing. I don't like the sandwich there but i like the package. Pulled Pork pizza is the best pizza i have ever eaten. The salads are a little bit too much for girls. If they offer a smaller size, i will appreciate that."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of colleagues from a nearby hospital in which we work. We came in at around 10:30, no one in the restaurant aside from us. We proceed to order our breakfast. There were 3 staff behind the counter, busy prepping for a catering event, I presume as evidenced by the big trays they were preparing.  Not one individual acknowledged that we were even in their midst. It was only until I asked if anyone was going to take my order that anyone even looked up. I proceeded to order French toast which came with bacon. I was told there was no more bacon! I said it was fine. I will take just the French toast. The staff person behind the counter would only take one order at a time, which is of course problematic as we had many orders from other colleagues. That's ok we tolerated the wait as we needed breakfast. When the French toast was done, I was informed that they've also run out of maple syrup.   At this point, the appetite was lost and we wasted a good 20 minutes waiting for food that was not going to be had.   I understand that their catering order was more profitable than our breakfast order, however, there was nothing in place for the walk-ins that would likely keep their business thriving.   We asked for our money back. We work in their neighborhood, it was evident by our attire. They just lost the business of many workers in the hospital lane of University Avenue."}
{"text":"Our favourite eatery near hospital row. Soups are hearty, loaded with goodness. Sandwiches are delicious, love the \"build your own\" option. Staff is always friendly. This place is a haven for those looking for a home made touch."}
{"text":"Customer service & quality of food quite good, and decent prices.  I've been to this venue once, and m'lady frequents it on a regular basis. They have a soup of the day, and they seem to be tweaking which soup to have on which week-day, which is why I'm assuming they have yet to officially list the soup of the day on their website or at the store.  However, the lady who I suspect to be the owner is quite eager to help. She wrote down each of the weekly soups of the day on a note for me, which I gave to m'lady.  I've tried a few of their soups each of which comes with a roll of bread, and I must say that all of the ones I've tried have been to die for.  All-in-all, I think that if they were open on week-ends and if they had their weekly soup of the day posted in a way that I could reference easily, this place with be 5-star one in my books. None-the-less, I think it's a great place, and would definitely return there again."}
{"text":"Worst take-out pizza I've ever had. Soft, barely cooked crust, mishmash of oily toppings, and some kind of sweet bbq sauce that ended up being the only taste that survived. I was starving, so I ate it. I'd say it's a lunch that I'll never get back, but the jury is still out on that."}
{"text":"In the area for work (yup, that's my thing!), and headed over here for a healthy lunch. I had the build your own cobb salad, which did not disappoint. There are a lot of options, depending on what you're looking for. The staff were friendly, and the service was pretty quick. While this was a salad-only lunch for me, the wraps and other options looked good too. A good pick for a healthy lunch."}
{"text":"One of the best places to have lunch in the area. Everything is fresh and made in house - and you can tell! I have had the salads and the pizza (still waiting to try the soups and sandwiches) and everything is delicious and filling.  Their pizzas (my favourite) are made in front of you and seriously filling. Their meatball pizza is amazing and can fill me up for the entire day!   On top of their excellent food, their customer service cannot be beat. Everyone is nice, friendly and serves you with a smile. The gentleman who owns the place (at least I think he does) is always apologetic if the line is long and he once gave everyone in line a coupon for a free breakfast sandwich. Once the pizza line was long because they had a catering order, and while she was finishing the order, the lady behind the counter helped me figure out what pizza I would like and gave me an extra topping. You really cannot beat their service!  I highly recommend this place - go!"}
{"text":"The highlight is most definitely the curry cauliflower soup - sounds like an odd combination but is absolutely delicious!  I've had a few of their sandwiches and pizza as well, though they fall a little short given the price.   A good option if stuck at the hospitals and sick of the cafeteria food."}
{"text":"Excellent quality and healthy food. Great option for gluten free (fructans free, actually - gluten has no physical impact on anyone other than celiacs, but the fructans in wheat affect lots of people - People still use the term 'gluten free' for now though).  They finally introduced a half sandwich and half salad combo which was the one thing the menu lacked."}
{"text":"They sell muffin tops only. 'nuff said. They could be a little more crispy though..."}
{"text":"Been here twice to get food. First time I got a chicken BLT sandwich. It tasted fresh and a great mix of flavours and bun. The coleslaw on the other hand was extremely small and had a little too much acidity.   The second time I got the pulled pork pizza. It was very good and was actually loaded with toppings. You could likely split it in half for a lunch and still be full.  My gripe with this place is the price. Everything comes out to at least $10. I see the appeal, the quality is definitely there, but it hurts to spend $10 on a sandwich. Maybe all the business folks in the area can afford it, but when you have the grange food court a 5 min walk away and Chinatown another 10, it's hard to say Bread + Bowl is value.   If it was priced $2-3 cheaper, I'd give this 4 stars.   3 stars because I can't give it 3.5 and the prices are fairly high for \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"Stopped by after work looking for soup and was immediately greeted right up beside me by the owner asking what I wanted. Whoas, there is good service, but then there is a pressure to make a decision fast. Luckily I knew exactly what I wanted and got a broccoli small soup for 5.65 after tax.  The soup came 3/4 full in a paper takeaway container but on a china plate with a plastic spoon. A weird mix of materials in a single place but okay. The soup itself bland except for the large chunks of black pepper floating around. I might have still liked it if it wasn't for the fact that it came tepid. I like my soup hot and this didn't even approach the right temperature. Disappointed."}
{"text":"The salad options are great!  Everything is super fresh.  I like how they have roasted vegetables as options for toppings.   The pizzas are delicious.  I especially like the chicken one with pesto but it's really heavy.  The vegetarian pizza is much healthier and still very tasty.  The dessert portions are huge!  My colleagues like the brownies but my favourite is the lemon bars. The perfect amount of sweet and tangy."}
{"text":"Great options for vegans!   I had the vegetarian pizza with no cheese. It was fresh and delicious and came pretty quickly. Other options for vegans include custom pizzas, sandwiches and salads. There are also daily soups that change. Ask to see if they are vegan that day.  The set up is little different if you are dining in. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you. When you're done, you go up to pay. There are a lot of \"grab and go\" items prepared fresh that morning if you are in a rush.  The owner and staff were all super friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back.  Note: The location is wheelchair accessible. There is a ramp on the right side of the building and the front door features an automatic door opener. The washrooms have accessible stalls with multiple grab bars. The door to the washroom does not have an opener and is a little heavy BUT the owner and staff are so incredible that they will assist and prop the door open during your stay."}
{"text":"Out. Freaking. Standing.   I had a hankering for pizza tonight and visited the bread & bowl and was NOT disappointed.   Even better than the food was the welcome I got. The woman asked if I had been there before and when k said no she came out from behind the counter and showed me around, walking me through the menu and pointing out specials. She have me a breakfast and lunch/dinner menu and said if we call ahead, they can have take out ready for pickup.   I got the pizza on special (chicken rustica) and a greens salad with plans to share with my husband. That did not, alas, happen as it was too good and I are the whole damn thing. I will need to go for a long run tomorrow to work it off but it was totally worth it.   We will be back."}
{"text":"The wrap that I got was the grilled veggie. It was very fresh and tasty. I was however a little surprised by the pricing. Around 12 dollars for the wrap, and pricey considering it's a rather small wrap."}
{"text":"Came in for a pick up and had their chef's special; grilled chicken pasta with mushroom cream sauce. Pasta and mushrooms dominated the dish and the \"grilled chicken\" was barely visible, almost microscopic. Meal wasn't bad, the pasta was coated with the rich & creamy sauce but the chicken which should have been the star was a comedy sideshow. Staff were friendly enough. P.S. they no longer have the meatloaf sandwich (to my initial disappointment)"}
{"text":"Highly recommended by a co-worker and she was not wrong. This place has been open for about 4mths and the owner (I assume) Frank really takes pride in his restaurant & food.   His presence is really lovely and just such a nice person! I ended up having their pizza which is a decent personal size.  Thin crust and generous with toppings.  They have their own staple pizzas or you can customize your own.    Frank took our order, told us to pay and he's bring it to us.  The payment process is alittle confusing and a little TOO trusting.  You basically go to to cashier and tell them what you ordered. You could tell them anything or even walk out for that matter.  I think they should have a better way of doing this by paying then ordering or by the server giving you a paper to give to the cashier.   I sat on their little patio on the side and was even given some samples of their foods.  I definetely have to try their pulled pork pizza :)   I'll be back Frank!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place in the heart of downtown town Toronto. Do you want breakfast? Or the best lunch you have ever had well this is the place to come.   It's a little off the beaten path behind Mt. Sinai hospital they make everything fresh in house daily buy locally grown sustainable products.   Their make your own pizza is the best I've ever had. Today I have the Western omelette. It's another I'll be addicted to.   They also have many ways to pay like Foodora & PayPal."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp, had to go to the hospital, we're from Loretto Ontario . This place has great sandwiches and soups smells real nice in here, food made to order and the place is very clean. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've never had a better pulled pork pizza! The amount of toppings that they layered on it was astounding...bacon, corn, more pulled pork, and the sauce was delicious. I shared my pizza with 2 other people. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Last week I was just BLOWN away by the customer service at Bread & Bowl.  I went in there, with the goal to buy a soup to add to my rice which I brought from home. Unfortunately, their blackboard only featured one soup on it - a tomato soup, which I'm not a fan of tomato-based soups... the server then says, \"Wait, let me check if we're completely out of our other soup.\" And she goes immediately behind the counter to check. But alas, she comes back and says, \"It's not enough to fill a cup for you - sorry!\"  I smile, thanked her for checking, and started heading out the door.  But the manager (and likely, owner?) who had been close by, turns to me and says, \"Wait! You can have it. We'll give it to you for free.\"  This kindly, older gentleman starts heading back to the counter, before I could respond.  Caught off guard, I asked, \"Are you sure?\"  \"Yes, just wait.\" He personally scoops up all possible remnants of the sold-out soup. And comes around the counter, and hands me the take-out cup, with crackers and spoon.  He smiled at me and said - with complete genuine care, \"You deserve it.\"  I so was surprised, and touched by the gesture. I just kept saying thank you as I walked out the door.  If you're in the area, check out this place - for good food, and even BETTER customer service.  PS. I never even thought of asking what flavour their other soup was! When I got back to the office, I opened the lid to find my favourite soup: squash.   PPS. The cup of soup was nearly full to the brim!  PPPS. I know this is different from my usual reviews - but this experience warmed my heart so much - I just had to share!  All their food I've had there is very good, including soup, sandwiches, pizza and salad. Costs are average, but portions are large and quality well worth it."}
