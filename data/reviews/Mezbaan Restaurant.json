{"text":"I can't believe I'd never eaten there in the seven years that I've lived in the neighbourhood. Although the restaurant looks shabby inside and out with zero decor and ambience, the service was friendly and speedy, and the food (we had take-out) was flavourful and absolutely delicious. I will NEVER go to Swiss Chalet again for take-out, lol. So glad we discovered it. What a gem."}
{"text":"Not very impressed with this place.  The inside is terribly outdated.  The service is terrible.  I would rather drive a little further and get better food.  The butter chicken was curdled.  The rest of the food was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Disgusting Food.. really really bad, it tastes like a week old type a food.. I ordered beef kabob and guess what it was breheat it by the microwave plus it was frozen kabob.. we r in 2015 and this this my first time in my life eating frozen kabob... I won't eat in this place even for Free.. I don't recommend it to buy it even for your cat or dog cause they deserve better food. ..  A place like this should be close ... and am wonder how they are still open. Very outdated..."}
