{"text":"Truly a disappointment this is not the first time i.ve ordered or Been there but this place better fix the present problems before they can consider a future,  boring  menu typical  to say the least . Atmosphere OMG kill me now . And the staff as they are very polite their timing is off like an AMC pacer ,Could you ask is everything is alright after I'm cramming a quads tack burger down my gullet . 

I must admit I did take a  nap in the bathroom for a hour as it was well furnished and delightfully clean with a hint of apple cinnamon \"UMMM\" .

Prices are totally astronomical crazy 27$ for two poutine \"What the frock \" potatoes are 3.99 a pound .."}
{"text":"My brother has been going here for years especially for breakfast and always told me that i should try it. So I did for lunch and had a pepperoni sub. I would have to say definitely in my top 3 subs I ever had. Great bread lots of cheese and a whole bunch of pepperoni topped with shredded lettuce and tomatoes. The best part was their white sub sauce they put on top. It's  not like the oily Italian dressing you find elsewhere. It's smooth, tasty and gives the sub a nice flavour. So a tomato soup the sub and fries a soft drink and a piece of carrot cake with coffee for $15. That's a steal! Must try if in the area"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Hands down the best bacon and great service. we have been here 4 times for breakfast and never disappointed. I can not wait to try dinner or lunch."}
