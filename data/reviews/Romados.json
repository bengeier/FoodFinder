{"text":"I got really lost looking for this place! Directionally challenged I know. But my excuse is that I'm an international traveler in your fine city!  Anyway, I was starving and was determined to find this joint after reading all these great reviews. I had the 1/4 chicken leg combo, which was translated to me by a really nice couple (the menu is in French FYI). I watched in amazement as the cook chopped up the meat and piled it with a TON of fries!!! The meal could easily feed a family of four! It also comes with rice and a salad. But honestly you can't see what's underneath the giant pile of fries!  The chicken had a lovely taste to it. The spicy sauce wasn't as spicy as I'd like it to be. And everything was a teensy bit too salty. If I had a friend to share it with, it would have been more manageable!  All in all a great neighborhood restaurant. Seems to be hugely popular with the locals. The line was almost out the door!"}
{"text":"I don't even live in Montreal and I've been here a dozen times since it re-opened. It still is amazing good, awesome value.   I'm sure there have been other reviews of the poutine they serve up these days. But regardless... that is what I had this time around and it was just heaven. Romados chips + 1/4 chicken + gravy made from the spicy sauce = deliciousness. If you haven't gotten it yet go and do that now. Also as a word of caution - the poutine portion is enormous.  Always call ahead before coming. It's not like they take your order over the phone and set it aside; it just allows you to rock up in front of everyone and get your order in. Silly system but might as well take use of it."}
{"text":"oh Romados how we miss thee (since moving from the plateau) let me count the ways....  1. The barbecued chicken... with crispy carmelized bits that are full of flavour 2. The Portuguese spices on the chicken 3. The spiced hot fries 4. The yummy spicy sauce they will drizzle on the fries and the chicken if you want... your choice spicy or really spicy... 5. Large portions for the price 6. Yummy bread - soft and lovely on the inside... crunchy and firm on the outside 7. NATAS NATAS NATAS (need I say more? Probably not but I will anyways... if you love custard you need to have one of these... two... or 10.... if they let you pick go for the ones with lots of colour... the carmelization thing again....) 8. Salads are fresh but because they are in with the hot stuff they get soggy really quick... so I don't miss those that much...  9. I would say I miss the rice if we ever got to eat it (the one time I did have it it was yummy)... but this place is always so busy that they run out of it early and I have rarely had it.... go earlier if you want it. 10. NATAS NATAS NATAS... (and try the white bean tarts as well for an unexpected surprise... who thought beans would make a tasty dessert? )  Well worth the wait in line... but if you want to avoid waiting at peak hours... phone your order in and pick up a half hour later.... the pre-order line is always way shorter. Be sure you do so before their 6 or 6:30 deadline... otherwise be prepared to be patient. If the line stretches to the door... plan to wait at least 45 minutes... but it will be worth it...  Also note that they do have a few tables but often no room... more of a take out place at rush hour.... there are a few parks nearby - one in between de bouillion and hotel de ville streets about 1/4 of the way down and of course only a few blocks from mount royal park.... just remember to clean up after yourselves and use the garbages"}
{"text":"Pros: Excellent chicken and fries, warm and friendly smiles.  Very good prices.  Best chicken and fries I ever tasted.   Every time I visit montreal I have to drop by. I tried almost all the other chicken places in montreal and none are even close. That includes cote st luc and chalet BBQs chicken.  Get the spicy sauce  and  the fries. They are a must.  If you are visiting montreal I suggest you try this place once. It is up there with schwartz and fairmount bagels.  Cons: A taaad bit unhealthy, lol. But hey.. who can resist the fries and spicy sauce?  Sweets and pastries are not that good. Would concentrate on fattening one's self through the fries and chicken.  Didn't like the chicken sandwiches. Just some slices of chicken stuffed unceremoniously into some average bread.  Waiting times can be long. Order via phone and arrange for a pick up at a convenient time. Otherwise expect up to 45 minutes waiting time.  Small seating area. Better to do take out and gorge and wallow in shame in privacy.   Alternatives and Suggestions: No alternatives in this life time.  Learn how to say: 'Please!  For the love of god! No more fries!' in french before ordering from the nice old lady. Trust me..  For dessert, walk south on st-laurent and you will find ripples ice cream. Also, further south on st-laurent is juliette chocolate for some good coffee and dessert."}
{"text":"If you go to Romados don't wait for a fancy place but for excellent food. This is by far the best barbecued chicken place in Montreal. Saint-Hubert, Scores and other are great places for chicken but Romados takes it to a new level. If you can call before you arrive you will avoid the lineup and will get your chicken faster. The sizes of the portions are unreal and the complementary \"pastel de nata\" (Portuguese custard pie) and small bun make this meal a true Portuguese experience. I keep returning to Romados as the service is also amazing. A little trick: while they are serving you at the counter make sure you place heavy coins on the wooden tip box and your portion may even increase (ehehe) If you buy portions for parties don't be surprised if you pay for 6 chicken and they give you seven. Romados is the best charcoal Barbecue Chicken in Quebec!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken! Used to have it every Sunday, Moved from Montreal but every time we come back this is our first stop, bringing home at least 2!"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favourite places in Montreal, I find myself coming back here again and again even though I live on the other side of the city. No nonsense, just walk up to the counter, place your order, and walk away with a cut of juicy, flavourful chicken straight off the grill, splashed with piri-piri sauce (they'll always ask if you want it, but the answer should be obvious) and buried under a mountain of deliciously spiced french fries. All for about 10 dollars. What more could you need?  Sure enough, it gets very crowded here, with lines often reaching all the way to the door. It always moves quickly, but then there might not be anywhere to sit down!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Amazing Portuguese chicken. Best in the city. Good fries. But, really greasy and heavy. Be careful!"}
{"text":"A fairly long line up when we walked-in but people were willing to wait; and that says something about the food. There is an option to call 30min ahead and you can pick it up when you're there to avoid the line up (which I will be doing next time). When my friend and I got our food, there were limited seating but we found one anyway! The food was delicious! The spices were on point, fries were good, the chicken was awesome! I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I ordered from Ramados through Just Eat. When my order was half an hour late, I called the restaurant to ask about it. The woman who answered the phone was incredibly dismissive. I was actually taken aback at how rude she was. When I asked her if she knew how much longer it would be she said she had no way of knowing and hung up on me. I finally got my food and in fact, the chicken is good but my salad arrived soggy. I'm just shocked at how outrageously bad their customer service is."}
{"text":"We trudged all around the Plateau looking for a lunch spot on the day after New Year's Day, but the city's restaurant owners must have still be sleeping off their hangovers (?) because nothing was open. Nothing except Romados, of course.  The lineup was huge, but the food was worth the wait. The chicken hadn't met the dry fate of so many other chickens before it (thank god). It was spicy and moist and of course greasy, but in a good way. The portion was huge. It came with a heap of fries (crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside) and a few bites of salad. I ate so much I didn't eat dinner that night, and I still didn't finish my plate.  There aren't many spots to sit, but in better weather it's not a problem to find someplace outside nearby."}
{"text":"the chicken is tres tres bien. Especially the sauce. Definitely will be there again!"}
{"text":"Wow! Grandiose! La chair de poule juste en repensant à ces frites poivrées et ce poulet...ah ce poulet... Juteux, goûteux, épicé à souhait... Bref, le prix à ridiculement bas pour la qualité du repas. Je vous le conseille fortement 1-2-3-4 fois"}
{"text":"I only tried their Portuguese egg tarts here, but that's all i wanted and they were delicious. Perfectly flaky crust and creamy egg tart. I'm coming back here for my egg tart fix next time i'm in town!"}
{"text":"Best Chicken in Town! Smoked over charcoal with an either Spicy or mild sauce, Awesome fries spiced just right, nice little salad with a great little dressing!  Add to that some breads, desserts or beverages and you have yourself one heck of a tasty meal!  I recommend calling in advance for pickup to save the line up! No joke, if you plan on going on weekends be prepared to line up (there's a reason they are pretty long, its totally worth it!).  Bon Apetit!"}
{"text":"So far, this place has 14 five-star reviews, and I'm not going to disagree. This place is seriously as good as it gets.  Granted, I don't have much experience with portuguese chicken, but the chicken I had was ridiculously delicious. Very tender and juicy with such great and explosive flavor. The fries were well-seasoned and delicious; the rice was a great addition to balance out the flavorful chicken and sop up the tasty leftover juices; and the salad is nice to give you the impression that you might be eating something healthy. Just thinking about eating this is making me salivate.  Anyway, the way it works is you stand in line, order half a chicken (I guess you could also order other stuff, but why would you?), pay for it, then split with a friend and enjoy. Inexpensive, delicious, and filling. I don't know what more you could ask for."}
{"text":"Though I put 3 stars here, I think 3.5 would be more appropriate.   The chicken was tender and tasty, but it wasn't the the most special chicken rotisserie ever. Like it was good, solid, satisfying, delicious, but I'm not sure that another perhaps more obscure restaurant couldn't do the same? Fries were very good, though again not necessarily exceptional? Overall still a solid experience.   Portion is very generous so order less or you'll have a ton of leftovers. I think for one person 1/4 chicken is fine, and you can ask for less fries/rice and more salad."}
{"text":"Nothing to add except to say I love this chicken so much. With rice, the portions are huge so if you're interested in chicken, opt out of the rice. The 1/2 chicken dinner was too much for my SO and I to finish, but worth every second of the walk over and the line"}
{"text":"Unreal.  Amazing.  One of my top restaurants in the world (no joke). It's true...there are few seats (and even less room with winter attire making everyone twice as large) and you're served in styrofoam, but when the food is this good, who cares?  We had the Poutine Romados and 1/4 chicken (with spicy sauce) and I'm now beginning to drool as I type.  That's how good it was.  It was also the least expensive meal we had in the city.  Awesome.  Fantastic.  Love it."}
{"text":"this place is so good we went back twice in the row. The chicken was amazing and don't forget to get the custard tart. Skip the salad and just go for the whole chicken and small fries (enough for 3 people)."}
{"text":"Simply put, this is probably the best BBQ chicken in Montreal. Their fries and rolls are also really good.  It can get a little busy at times, though, so you should probably be prepared to wait in line for 10-15 minutes. Alternatively, call ahead so that your order is read in advance."}
{"text":"Best food bargain on my trip to Montreal, thanks yelpers for the suggestion. For under $20 we got two half chicken combos and enough tasty chicken and fries to feed us for two meals. I generally don't eat rotisserie chicken skin, but this chicken had me eating everything but the bones. I liked their salt and pepper seasoned fries. I guess we were lucky, we only had to wait a few minutes to order, and got a seat at a table."}
{"text":"There was a line about 7-9 deep when we arrived for late lunch around 1pm Friday.  While waiting we looked at the pastry case (there was a coconut bun, and a coconut egg custard/flan/pudding slice that looked promising...) and at the drink fridge (Sumol-pineapple)  At the front of the line, we ordered the 1/2 chicken meal (came with LOTS of french fries, a very small salad, a bun, and a fruit/almond tart) since we came before the 2pm cutoff.    The chicken was decent especially with the spicy sauce, although the breast meat was a little dry.  We had REALLY good Peruvian roast chicken in Arlington,VA (El Pollo Rico!) which had better marination- garlic, lime, cumin, plus garlic sauce & green/herb/cilantro/pepper sauce- so Portuguese chicken just DOES NOT compare.... but for the price $8, it was a decent find.  The coconut flan/custard was FABULOUS though.... very nice pronounce egg flavour and a layer of softer coconut laced pudiing--- a superb dessert for $1.70?  WOW! The experience was worth sitting right next to the door to the washroom! (There aren't many sit in spaces... maybe 10-15 only!)  Lots of people did takeout."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken!! Potatoes fantastic!! Service is fast.  Only downside side they are a chicken place that runs out of chicken."}
{"text":"Montreal de denenebilecek h?zl? seçeneklerden birisi. Tavuk oldukça ba?ar?l? sos lezzetli  Patates beklenilenden daha çok ve lezzetli"}
{"text":"Hearing great things I decided to try Romados with a friend. We both got the chicken sandwiches and fries. I would definitely recommend the food to go because this is not a sit down place. It was very difficult to get a seat and it was very busy. I liked the sandwich but I believe it is over-hyped. The line was also very long."}
{"text":"Cheap price for the huge portion. I ordered 1/2 chicken with fries and salad. Chicken was so good. Fries and salad was okay, nothing special.  I couldn't even finish half of those fries.  Great choice if you are hungry and don't want to go spend a lot of money."}
{"text":"Great chicken, great portion, affordable price. Chicken poutine from here is a boon."}
{"text":"Déçue!!! J'avais de grandes attentes en me rendant à ce restau.. Partie de Pointe-aux-trembles  pour y aller... Après avoir lu les commantaires je m'attendais à quelque chose de super... Premièrement j'ai l'habitude dans ce genre de restaurant portugais de manger un sandwich avec salade et frite.Au Romados c'est un ou l'autre ou c'est un extra $$..Ok ensuite dans mon sandwich au poulet j'ai demandé une feuille de salade et des oignons pour avoir un sandwich décent encore là un extra$&... Ok ensuite rendu à la caisse je demande un petit pot de sauce et encore là un extra$$... Wow! Extra après extra je me retrouve donc avec un sandwich sec..(photo dans l'album)  De plus, le personnel= bofff pas très souriant et pour finir la fille à la caisse à oublié la seule chose qui venais avec notre repas \"gratuitement\", le petit pain sec pour aller avec le poulet de mon copain.. Première et dernière fois! J'en ai beaucoup plus pour mon argent au PiriPiri ou au Paradis du poulet.. Breff je n'ai jamais fais d'avis de ma vie sur un restau mais Romados m'a vraiment décu..."}
{"text":"Some great Portuguese chicken. We opted for a half chicken-- coated with their spicy sauce. The skin was so good with the flavorful, salty spice coating the exterior.   The spicy sauce provided some acidity to the overall flavor.. whenever the chicken started to get old, you can dip it into the oily blend and it adds more depth.   Service was fairly fast-- and it's also extremely cheap for a good bit of protein. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I treat this place like a cheap guilty pleasure - and there's nothing wrong with that! Moist chicken dripping with spicy oil, buried in about 2 days' worth of puffy, seasoning-coated fries. As long as you're ok with a 20+ minute lineup, it's amazing - be sure to ask for extra sauce!"}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs poulet de Montréal et maintenant ils font la livraison. Le poulet avec sauce piquante est fabuleux. Nous avons commandé pour un groupe de 10 personnes (avec frites et salade) et il en avait pour 12 facilement"}
{"text":"Best portuguese chicken in Montreal. The sauce is just SO GOOD. It's worth it to take it spicy. There is always a long line up, but since they renovated, it's a lot faster and they added seats too. Definitely a place to try if you're visiting the city!"}
{"text":"Je ne comprends pas l'engouement. J'ai seulement goûté au poulet mais je m'attendais à beaucoup mieux. La sauce épicée n'est pas épicée! Le poulet n'est pas assez assaisonné la viande ne goûte rien de spécial. Aussi je trouvais que la viande ne se séparait pas aisément des os ce qui veut dire il me semble que la viande n'était pas assez cuite. Ils auraient pu mieux concevoir l'espace pour manger, c'est un peu n'importe quoi manger tassés comme des sardines à dix centimètres des gens qui attendent. Mais ce n'est pas dispendieux."}
{"text":"The Best portuguese style chicken in town. Albeit a more take out place than restaurant (few tables). Good price, good value but most of all amazing taste. Chicken comes in two flavours mild and spicy.Been going here for over 15 years (before it burned and got re-built) and it is consistently good. Wish they had good seating area but there is a park not far."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try this restaurant after reading various Yelp accounts. First, this is part bakery and part takeout joint. The staff is helpful to those of us who do not speak French.   The chicken is quite good. Not the best I have ever had, but very good. They were out of rice, so I had fries. They were good with pepper on them just like I prefer. There were so many that I could not finish half of them. It came with a small salad buried under the fries.  The best thing, of course, is the price. Drinks and three meals came in under $30.00. Quite a break from expensive Montreal!"}
{"text":"Another Montreal staple!  Here's the deal: Portuguese chicken is delicious, and Romados makes some damn good Portuguese chicken.  Quality/price: for around $8-$9 you'll get a styrofoam box with more chicken, fries and salad than any regular human should eat in one sitting. If you don't consider yourself a regular human though (like most of my friends), you'll find yourself more than satisfied.  If you're in the mood for being reasonable (or if you're just not down with a post-meal food coma), ask to replace your fries with more salad. This is also a good low-carb/slow-carb/keto option."}
{"text":"Love the chicken and desserts. Fries as well! But always busy the place so recommend to go."}
{"text":"Very very good chicken! However it doesn't touch Dinos in LA.. They should serve it with tortillas rather then bread."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, Service, Food: What you need to know.  Atmosphere: Ramados is a Portuguese, charcoal grill chicken place. No-nonesence set-up - it's made to serve people one thing: hot, juicy, fresh of the charcoal grill chicken! Very popular among the local community (and beyond) - it's often busy so don't expect to go in and get a table for two - there's barely 6-7 places you may sit.  Think the \"Soup-Nazi\" restaurant from Seinfeld fame.  You walk in - wait in line (moves quickly), order your chicken and GO!  Service:  The people that work there - Portuguese - are very friendly and best of all know what they are doing.  Food:  Ah the food.  There are plenty of Portuguese style grill restaurants in Montreal - but Ramados seems to have built a cult following due to the consistency with which they deliver the goods.  I've been to Ramados well over half a dozen times - and each time the meal is a good as the previous - not many restaurants can boast such a quality.  They have a very limited menu - mainly consisting of grilled Chicken and Pork, but if you're going there - you're definitely going for the Chicken.  They also have a glass display full of home made sausages, cheeses, and desserts!  best of all? they are VERY generous! You'll pay your money, eat, and walk-out thinking that it was the best thing you've done all week.  The Fries are to die for.  So good you just may end up going again, the next day!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! So tasty! The chicken and the fries are to die for. Very heavy and kind of hard to digest though."}
{"text":"This is now my go-to place for Portuguese chicken.  Try to go a little while after lunch - say 14h00 so you don't have to wait in line for 20 minutes...  The chicken is very good and they always have rice to go with it ;)  Personally, I find that their spicy sauce is not the best but the chicken is very good."}
{"text":"I got the solo chicken sandwich. $8. The meat on my sandwich was literally only a single chicken drumstick. Nothing else. Inside a large bun that was dry and not so fresh. The chicken was very salty. The ambiance quite subpar. I asked for glass of water they gave me a tiny cup. I wish I had gone elsewhere. Did not live up to the hype. I was left hungry, with more thirsty  and very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went in with high expectations after reading the reviews. Service was a bit slow, but I won't dock them any stars for that because I focus on the food. After reading the rave reviews, I ordered a whole chicken combo -- I thought it'd be great to have leftovers. Alas, I found the chicken disappointing. It seems to have been cooked well -- not dry and the skin was somewhat crisp. The main problem is that it had an unusual \"off\" flavor (almost like a spoiled taste), which I think comes from the hot sauce that they slathered on it. Maybe it's just me, but I find it rather unpleasant.  A whole chicken combo (which they call a family combo) includes an ungodly amount of fries (which were pretty decent) and a pretty good salad.  I'm sad this wasn't as amazing as other reviews make it out to be."}
{"text":"Je vais jouer les rabat-joie, mais au vu du grand nombre d'avis élogieux, je m'attendais à quelque chose de vraiment exceptionnel, et j'ai été déçu. On y mange bien et les prix sont plus que raisonnables ($7.75 pour le combo cuisse de poulet / frites, avec de la salade, une sauce piquante et un morceau de pain), mais ne vous attendez pas non plus à tomber de votre chaise tant le repas est merveilleux! J'y retournerai quand même avec plaisir si je suis dans le coin, d'autant plus que je dois encore me faire un avis sur leurs pâtisseries."}
{"text":"I'm a picky bastard when it comes to most things, but the chicken here is a stroke of absolute genius! To wait for 20 minutes in the Saturday lineup that extends out the door onto the corner of Rachel and De Bullion would ordinarily be an inconvenience for most people, but it's more of a calming pleasure as the smell of rotisserie roasting chicken over a charcoal fire is sure to illuminate the senses with hungry delight. A quarter chicken with a veritable mountain of fries and nice bit of salad will run you a minuscule 7 dollars and could very well feed a family of 4, though I personally like to divide it into 2 meals depending on my level of hunger.  Beyond its ridiculously tasty chicken, Ramado's is also a full fledged Portuguese bakery which offers some of the finest custard tarts in the city and really nice Portuguese buns which they will include as a compliment to the chicken meal if you ask nicely.  Make sure to lather that chicken and fries in their delicious homemade rotisserie sauce because it is such a flavourful addition to an already superb meal.  You won't find better value anywhere else in Montreal and dare I say, in the entire country for the simple reason that no other restaurant could survive offering such incredible value.  This is a must go to restaurant to anyone visiting or living in Montreal."}
{"text":"Best chicken in town! So juicy & tasty.. its fun to go in the summer so you can pick up & go to the park scross the street and hsve a mini piknik , its awesome , its very cheap snd they really spoil you with the french fries."}
{"text":"Best chicken ever. Great fries. Even the buns are rich in bunly goodness.  Not much space to eat, so plan on taking it home or heading to a nearby park to chow down."}
{"text":"I love Romados.  Have for many a year.  Until 2010 their \"quarter chicken\" trio (with fries and salad) was really 4 or 5 pieces of totally awesome chicken covered in spicy delicious portugese flavah.  So deliciously yummy.  Recently they underwent some renovations, which somehow has made their chicken slightly more dry, and the management may have changed, so their formally uber-generous portions have been reduced to more standard fare sizes.  Still delicious though, and hands down my go-to fave for rotisserie/bbq chicken in MTL."}
{"text":"The Portuguese people are known for their chicken; now I know why!   Rotisserie Romados offers the most delicious chicken. The place isn't the most attractive or spacious, but that doesn't stop people from waiting in line to get some good food.  After waiting in line for 30 minutes, I got my quarter chicken combo (chicken, salad & fries) - around $7. At my request, the chicken was smothered in spicy oil sauce which gave a nice mild spicy taste to the food. The chicken is very juicy, hot, tender and perfect! The salad was good and the fries were thick but lacked the crispiness I like, but they tasted really good too. The portions are gigantic- you've been warned.   Romados doesn't have lots of seating space and is usually crowed. The bakery there seemed nice and the staff was nice and efficient. I didn't like how my hot food was placed in a floppy styrofoam box- yuck. Although that bothered me, I don't think it's going to stop me from coming back to this place.  If you want some amazing chicken; I would highly recommend picking some up at Rotisserie Romados!"}
{"text":"Ever since the renovations, the food has changed. The chickens are tiny and not cooked the same way. Hence don't taste the same at all. Neither do their fries. The prices have gone up significantly as well. Very disapointing. There are no more reasons to go out of your way to go to this place any longer. There are better portuguese chicken places in Montreal. --------------------------------------------------- Located close to Mount-Royal park, this place is a Montreal classic.  If you're looking for take out,  finger- licking good rotisserie chicken with great salt & pepper fries at a decent price ...Romados is THE place. They also have ribs and other tasty specialties but the chicken is always a winner.  If you're in a rush, you'll want to call and place your order ahead of time. The line up is usually quite long on the weekends.   As a native Montrealer, nothing says Summer in Montreal like sitting in the park at the base of the mountain, listening to the drums, people watching and pigging out on Romados chicken with a bottle of passion fruit soft drink."}
{"text":"Sandwiche à poulet avec frite.  J'ai actuellement la bouche en feu, il y a un incendie dans ma bouche. Les frites sont beaucoup trop poivrer et salé que j'en ai perdu la saveur de mon repas. Je ne sens plus mon palais que je n'ai même pas pu savourer le poulet.  Je déconseille de commander des frites."}
{"text":"Leur poulet est excellent, le service bien organisé, agréable et les prix abordables."}
{"text":"I was in vacation in Montreal, stayed at the Plateau area. There's a lot of restaurants in this location, so I tried Yeld that indicated Romados. They have a great chicken breast, pretty wet! Awesome french fries! Good cost! I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great quality Portuguese chicken. Cannot ask for more authentic and delicious food of good value"}
{"text":"Awesome chicken! The place has no available seats ever (which somehow makes you like it more), the fries are rediculously good, and the chicken is otherworldly.  Then you can skip across the street to Cafe Neve which will rock your world again."}
{"text":"Fantastic Portuguese chicken. I have had it from many different places, but this one is different and amazing. I love the fact that the potatoes are french fries. Hot sauce is delicious. This is definitely my go-to rotisserie place when I am in Montreal. Recommend 100%."}
{"text":"The chicken is great and juicy and the sauce is tasty -but greasy-. Best portuguese chicken I've tasted in Montreal. The fries used to be amazing before they renovated but now they are just ok. I think they started skimping on the spices with the fries and sadly their fries were better than their chicken for comfort food, imho.  Plain salad and rice. The sandwiches are just the chicken in a bun. Nothing fancy.  The pastries and bread aren't worth it, to be honest.  TIP: The seating is limited and is that of a Deli. If you aren't planing on eating in, I recommend ordering ahead of time via phone. You do NOT want to be stuck in one of the busy long line on a weekend. You have your own much shorter line if you order by phone."}
{"text":"Réputation surfaite selon moi, le poulet est bon, mais pas le meilleur portugais que j'ai gouté à Mtl, et j'en ai pas essayé une tonne.  Tout est bien gras dont la sauce qui a beaucoup trop d'huile.  Un blâme pour le peu de conscience environnementale: styromousse et ustensiles en plastique même si on mange sur place."}
{"text":"This place has bbq chicken coming out the friggin walls with awesome fries straight out of heaven. Portuguese grill with pastries, bread and attitude. Chop chop!"}
{"text":"You HAVE to come here. Simply, Portuguese chicken is incredible. Or at least here. Also, they give you a huge amount of fries. They're delicious. BOTTOM LINE:If you're anywhere within a     10 mile radius, come here. I don't care if you have to make a day trip out of it, come here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ive been going to Romados for years and its    hands down the best grilled chicken you can eat...the Natas are also very good!!!!"}
{"text":"Rating: 4.25   Huge portions! I got the 1/4 chicken combo and let me say: One 1/4 chicken combo can last for 2 meals if you're not ravenously hungry. The chicken was great and the fries were okay. I liked the price points and the portions - I will come by any time I'm craving good chicken!"}
{"text":"The best chicken that I ate in a very long time. The juicy meat and the spicy sauce with the salty fresh fries are just delicious!"}
{"text":"Just went back last week to get some crazy-man-on-chicken love. The recent shout-out on Anthony Bourdain's the Layover Montreal episode was well deserved, but will likely make it harder to get a seat going forward. Damn."}
{"text":"i dont get why people said its good...its terrible...very plain, super dry, barely enough dip stuff...and the salad? what a joke...what a complete waste of money, more waste of a chicken actually...the worst chicken ive had in my entire life...joke u not, in all seriousness...i was so pissed...anyway, ull find out urself when u go there if u do"}
{"text":"Not necessarily a fancy restaurant, but one of the most memorable meals I've had in Montreal.  It's sometimes tough to find parking, and the line in the restaurant can be long, but the chicken was so tasty that it's worth the extra trouble."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood, and literally crave Romados chicken every 10 days or so! The seasoning is delicious (we prefer the spicy option), and the Natas are yummy (especially if had fresh in the morning)..We have tried other Portugese Rotisseries in the neighbourhood, but none come close..A must-visit!"}
{"text":"I've had \"Portuguese chicken place\" in my home jurisdiction and always order \"1/4 white\" - chicken breast meat, fries, some kind of salad. I ordered the same at Romados and this place met expectations. Chicken meat was juicy (I skipped the skin as I usually do); they brushed a sauce over it which was tasty (I got the mild sauce, but I believe customers have a choice of mild or hot). Fries (plain frites) are delicious. Salad was a green salad - lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, with a vinaigrette - overall good balance of flavors in the combo order."}
{"text":"There are two types of people in the world. Those of adventurous and unpretentious character who enthusiastically get their coat and shoes when a visit to Romados is suggested, and those difficult prissy ones who go along listlessly and reluctantly but secretly find the resto's downmarket appearance, long queue, and lady who barks brusquely at you whilst still referring to you in terms of endearment alarming.These are also the ones who will queasily whinge at the carbohydrate content, exuberantly massive portions of chicken painted with the deliciously lurid oily piri-piri sauce (only if one specifies- you can have your chicken piquant ou pas piquant), chips/fries, rice, salad, lovely little bread roll (and sometimes if one gets there before 2pm, a small custard pie).  These latter people are drags, and I hope if you know any you cut them out of your life. They are no fun unless they are in circumstances that allow them to pretend they are in a dull television series about lawyers or vacuous trophy wives. If you must keep them because they are related to you or they owe you favours, don't take them to Romados.  But if you are perhaps dating a manic-pixie-dream-girl of some sort for example, she will be delighted by all of the aforementioned as well as the enormous case of colourful and wonderful pastries you are pressed against as you pass ever so slowly through the queue to order. To pass the time, you can imagine which gorgeous little cake or tart you'd choose if you weren't about to have an enormous meal (which, really, anyone sensible stretches it to two or three meals), you can wonder how long these pastries have been sitting there, feel a bit less desire for them, feel a bit melancholy and hope they are being given to the poor, or perhaps wonder how thorough their dumpster protection might be.  The half-chicken is the best deal. 2 or 3 sittings out of it for a mere 7.99, and far better than any chicken in the city. Occasionally, the rice is left off, or the bread is different (and occasionally disappointing)  but it's all part of the magic.  There are drinkies of all types in the fridge case and if you are feeling particularly adventurous try the sumol. One can eat inside amid all the bustling, at small tables covered charmingly in brown butcher paper, changed after each patron's grease smeared mark is left, and once (fairly long ago) we had the unfortunate and insalubrious experience of seeing a yuppie customer with obvious entitlement issues as well as a complete ignorance of hygiene change her not very small infant's soiled nappie on the lunch counter next to the door. It was barely noticed except by our party and the poor gobsmacked bastard who had been minding his own business next to the ridiculous cow. In good weather it's much nicer to carry your meal and walk across the street or down the road to a nice park for a picnic. Romados always gives me a much happier experience than nearly any upscale restaurant in Montreal. For all the dubious princesses who are put off by the sort of food that looks as if it might make you fatter, there's no need to gorge oneself there. I eat there once a week and have never gained weight from it."}
{"text":"The chicken is amazing!  The pastel de nata is highly recommended as well."}
{"text":"This place totally rocks!  I got the 1/4 thigh combo, which was a huge portion of chicken, a salad, and an enormous amount of seasoned fries.  They pile on the fries OVER the chicken and salad-- the amount of fries is that much.  It also comes with a bread roll, which is very good-- soft and chewy on the inside, and goes great with the chicken.    As for the chicken itself, it was incredible.  Perfectly seasoned and crispy on the outside, and tender and juicy on the inside.  SO good.    PLUS, it's a really good deal.  You get ALL of that food for $5.99 CAD!  I also got an egg tart, which is somewhat similar to the Chinese egg tarts.  Compared to the Chinese egg tarts, the filling in the Portuguese style is more creamy and sweet, rather than solid and gelatinous.  Highly recommend this place and will be craving to go back."}
{"text":"Why do I try other portugese chicken places?  I should always go here. Always.    PS - they close at 8pm, and may run out of chicken before then, so get there early."}
{"text":"Yum - definitely the tastiest chicken I've eaten in North America - even without the chili sauce!  The chips were tasty, I don't know what they added to it but it was awesome!  Also came with a dessert, but I much preferred the portugese tart I bought =)  If you can't read french and are wondering why there are 2 prices for a 1/4 chicken it relates to the part of the chicken you get.  I had a 1/2 chicken and definitely recommend getting the thigh....mmmm"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and were visiting Montreal for a week when we came across Romados.  Their chicken was so unbelievably good that we had to come back three or four times over the course of our vacation.  It's rotisserie style with perfectly crisped skin and delicious sauces.  It's also very reasonably priced.  I would highly recommend this too anyone who appreciates chicken (we both agree it is the best chicken we've ever had)"}
{"text":"Bon poulet  Astuce téléphoner   20 mns  avant pour limiter votre attente  car La file d attente est interminable !"}
{"text":"Really nice quality chicken.  Mountain of fries.  Tiny but delicious salad. Big old roll. $8.  You can feed your family very affordably here!  Definitely give this place a try.  I would say that the flavour of their chicken varies but is very nice and clean.  Toooo many fries but if you are into that go for it.   I want to try their baked goods soon.  Recommended. Try maybe to call ahead- they have a separate line for those who have pre-ordered.  Might be a way to avoid the lines!"}
{"text":"I loved Romados the first time I went, but I've been several more times since and for some reason the quality seems to have fallen. The chicken was really dry the last time I had it and the flavour was not as good as it used to be. I'm not quite sure what changed but I am disappointed and likely will not return!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Portuguese chicken, but I will without a doubt be looking for a place that serves it closer to home. We ordered a whole chicken with fries and salad to split with 4 people and it was enough for a very light dinner. Honestly could have a had 2 whole chickens because it was so good. Definitely get the spicy sauce!  One warning for English speaking tourists- the menu is only written in French, but all of the people working were very friendly and helpful! There isn't too much seating inside, so I would recommend taking the food and eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pretty much the best Portuguese chicken on the Plateau. Not much else to say."}
{"text":"Holy asdfghjkl.  What is this heaven that I've found on earth?  I am a chicken lover. J'adore le poulet!! And an even greater fries lover. And this place does not kid about their fries. If there's one thing that can earn my respect for an eatery (obviously besides good food), it's massive portions. They stuff that poor styrofoam box with so much fries ohhhhhh mannnnnn. So delicious. AND free Portuguese bread-- not sure what the proper term is but it's fantastic.  I was heart broken when I found out that there wasn't a Nando's here but brahh, this is arguably better.  I think they only take debit/cash which doesn't really affect me so 5 freaking stars for you Glen Coco."}
{"text":"If you're visiting Montreal like the wife and I and trying to find this place, just walk down Rue Rachel and let that wonderful sweet smoke guide your senses.  That delicious smell wafting through the air will lead you to some tasty Portuguese comfort food.   Plain and simply . . . Just order the chicken plate!  You can order it with a 1/4, 1/2 or full chicken. It comes with a crispy on the outside, tender on the inside rotisserie chicken slathered with a spicy, citrusy Portuguese barbecue sauce that'll make you say, \"Thank Goodness we came here after that 2 hour hike through Parc du Mt Royal!\"  A salad, rice and some of the best seasoned fries I've tasted is literally piled high on your plate.  I'm glad the wife and I shared a plate because I had just enough room for that Portuguese egg tart and coconut flan.  The egg tart was flaky, chewy and creamy all at the same time.  And if you like flan, just imagine flan with a little coconut rum like twist . . . Miam!  Excellent food . . . Happy wallet!"}
{"text":"Restaurant staff were extremely helpful and friendly, but food was not that great. Chicken was dry and Portuguese tart was cold and overly sweet. Fries were nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, but were extremely salty. Rice was bland, but salad and dressing were ok. Food did not live up to the hype on this visit."}
{"text":"used to live in MTL and this was a staple of the city... A fire closed their doors for a while and they took the opportunity to give it a facelift. Chicken is second to none. Order for pickup to avoid crazy lineups mid day."}
{"text":"Loved the chicken, deserves the hype, price is good. Would definitely go back. Place is on the small side, be prepared for a bit of a wait to sit down."}
{"text":"I didn't like it and even my husband He tried the chicken and I tried the chicken sandwich. I don't know how does it get this high rank? and even the place is very narrow to eat  we couldn't sit together, so my husband and my daughter together in a table and I was alone in other one I tried an egg tart and it was good"}
{"text":"Went tonight for first time it was amazing i got half chicken combo amazing bun great fries and best chicken ever and great price 7.99 the you get salad will go again asap"}
{"text":"L'essayer c'est l'adopter!"}
{"text":"Wow!! The chicken is sooo good!!  The fries have this special spice which makes it really good.  Get the hot sauce on you chicken and dip your fries in it.   This is food porn!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Portuguese chicken in town! You just wait in line and order a quarter, half, or whole chicken (do get it spicy!), plus salad and fries on the side. At the cashier, you pick up bread and order dessert from their glass counter filled with delectable treats, and sit at one of the bars-tooled tables and dig in. The chicken is crispy, well seasoned, and cooked to perfection. The fries are fresh, sweet, and crunchy; you can dip them in the chicken's spicy sauce. And the salad dressing is just perfect!"}
{"text":"Très bon poulet avec la petite sauce piquante c'est succulent . Beaucoup trop de frite dans les assiettes . Il n'y a pratiquement pas de place dans l'établissement et il faut souvent faire la file pour commander . Mieux vaut prendre en take out . Jai pas goûter à la Poutine mais ça va l'air intense . J'ai eu envie de donner trois étoiles étant donné la file et le peu de place , mais étant donné qu'il s'agit d'une des meilleures rôtisserie portugaise ( oublier l'infâme Piri Piri ) je lui en ai mis quatres ."}
{"text":"This place is great. Food is excellent and I love taking take out and walking to the mountain to have a picnic in the parc."}
{"text":"J'avais entendu mille et un commentaires concernant la rôtisserie Romados avant d'y mettre les pieds et je n'ai vraiment pas été déçue! Le poulet rôti est aux Portugais comme le vin est aux Français! C'est vraiment une de leur plus grande spécialité et les Portugais de chez Romados savent comment s'y prendre. Lorsqu'on vous sert votre poulet, vous avez le choix entre une sauce douce ou épicée. Pour ma première fois, j'ai pris la douce, car je voulais goûter toutes les subtilités des assaisonnements du poulet. Quel délice! Le poulet est juteux et tendre à un point qu'on ne peut se l'imaginer... C'était un plaisir à chaque bouchée.  Les frites assaisonnées sont bonnes; croustillantes et chaudes, mais étant très difficile concernant les frites, je ne peux pas dire qu'elles étaient à se \"pitcher\" dans les murs!  J'ai aussi beaucoup aimé le fait que ce soit un petit restaurant qui semble banal et sans artifice. Montréal est génial pour ça: l'extérieur ne reflète pas l'intérieur!  Romados, grâce à toi, je vais faire aimer le poulet rôti à mon chum, j'en suis certaine! ;-)"}
{"text":"Not the nicest decor. No place (almost) to sit but the best chicken I had, punto. Read the reviews and all but nothing better than give it a try. I highly recommend it and I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"The first time I try to eat here. The chicken is plain not taste marinade or hot sauce . To much oily.  The price is very good. The place to seat is very tight"}
{"text":"The best value-for-your-money Portuguese place in Montreal. Great chicken and friendly service. A must-see."}
{"text":"Great chicken and fries. (deserts are good as well!)  Huge portions - low price. What else could you want?"}
{"text":"Really average chicken the sausage is good  but nothing crazy the best thing on the menu. the frites they are really good."}
{"text":"Needed a quick, kid-pleasing dinner while we were staying with friends, so we popped out to grab a chicken from Romados. SO GOOD! We live in a very Portuguese neighbourhood in Toronto, so we're no strangers to churrasco, but this stuff was awesome. The piri-piri sauce had me licking the container. We didn't get any sides, since we already had enough at home to make a meal, but I'm sure they're just as tasty."}
{"text":"En fin j'ai compris le pourquoi de la popularité de Romados, Deli!!.. Le seul detaille que  je n'ai pas aimé  sont les assiettes et emballages  en Polystyrène, pas amical avec l'environnement."}
{"text":"very average pastry shop  with chicken  ff only"}
{"text":"We found this place through Yelp.  It is out of the way but not too hard to find. Chicken was like crack! (YAAAAS) Fries (YAAAAS)  Half chicken with a ton and a half of fries with side salad for under $10!  The only down side to this place is that it isn't a sit down place. Only had 6 small tables on the side with such a small place. Fast service ad good price for the amount food. Would Recommend!"}
{"text":"FREAKING AMAZING!!!!!!!!  Absolutely LOVE this place! And would come back to Montreal just to eat here again.  The portions are huge, the price is very inexpensive ($12 for all that you see pictured), and the food is heavenly.   I had the quarter dark meat, without any type of sauce. It doesn't need any sauce as far as I am concerned. The meat was juicy and extremely tasty. The fries were perfectly seasoned and they were really nice and crispy. I am a big fan of crunchy textured foods and these fries were perfect. The small little salad on the side was good, wish they would give you more, as their homemade dressing was delicious!!! The drink and pastry were really great as well, both were not overly sweet.  The staff were really great, friendly and nice. I do not speak a word of French and that was no problem. They took their time explaining the menu and answered all my questions. I got there late afternoon on a Thursday in late October and the place was not full at all, had no problem snagging a table.  I ate absolutely every last morsel of what they put in front of me. Absolutely amazing, hands down one of the best chicken I have ever tasted. This place is awesome and I cannot wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Really great Portuguese chicken, fries are soooo yummy and the natas are the best in town! Best to call ahead and put in your order as the line ups are nuts at peak times. Also you'll get better service if you speak French...just sayin'"}
{"text":"2nd time around, romados did not disappoint. I brought some friends with me and they enjoyed the chicken poutine. I however got the 1/2 chicken with fries and the chicken was well worth the 1.75mile bixi ride. The fries were fried accordingly and not gressy. My only issue was that no roll was given out like how it was on my last visit. I will be returning here in August when I come back to mtl"}
{"text":"Horrible chichen sandwich full of bones and the spicy sauce and fries are loaded with salt. I'm not going back anymore. This place is not as good as it used to be. Desert was undercooked such a big disappointment"}
{"text":"Chicken made with crack.  THE FOOD I have never had rotisserie that was so compelling, this is something else. The chorizo is excellent too. The fries are not bad either, and they also have a pretty amazing bakery section.  THE SERVICE Pretty friendly and efficient.  THE ATMOSPHERE Busy, hip, bustling."}
{"text":"This place is worth a stop.  We split two 1/2 chicken dinners for two adults and one child and as others note there were fries left over.  I wanted to try their caldo verde soup but they were out by 7:00pm.  The spicy sauce was really quite good not searingly hot but rather piquant.  My 4 y/o went though the mild chicken with a smile.  Make sure you look at the pastries before you finish paying.  We almost missed dessert!"}
{"text":"I felt like I was joining a club. There are rules and regulations, but luckily my brother knew them. You get in the long line, you scope for hints that people are leaving one of the three tables, you figure out what you're ordering in advance to getting to the counter, you get it spicy.   It's not really much of a task to figure out what to order; besides the baked goods at another counter all they do is chicken. And my, they do it well.   I ordered the quarter chicken meal: chicken, salad, rice and French fries. The chicken was so tender, so fall-off-the-bones, I didn't want to use any cutlery. Spicy wasn't spicy, just spiced and just right.   I didn't get the rice, still not sure whose fault that is. The salad was unnecessary. A lot of it just got soggy and cooked beneath the chicken. The fries on the other hand were great. A bit over-peppered at times, but still rank A.   The portion was HUGE. $6.99 for a Styrofoam meal box. And then they give you a bun at the cash register too! I guess it's like them giving you a business card to try out their bakery. I say take the plunge, the roll was a nice addition and all the treats on display looked really good.   Four stars for the fries (I'm disregarding the other sides), five stars for that chicken. So I'm rounding up. Oh, that chicken.   If you can get past the dozens on rotating chickens, the black gloves the intense looking men use as they wield their meat cleavers and that long line then go.  Join the club."}
{"text":"When I was really young I remember my dad bringing us home Ramados chicken for dinner sometimes when he had business meetings downtown. The taste of Ramados chicken is really nostalgic to me since I've been eating it since I was a little girl. I went back yesterday with my partner, I had the 1/2 spicy chicken with fries, salad, rice and a nata on the side, while they had the chicken poutine. We both loved it, I was in heaven eating the delicious food after waiting something crazy like 3 years. Still as good as I remember!"}
{"text":"Tres bon poulet...prix abordables et assez bonne quantité. Un bon rapport...profitez pour manger votre plat au parc mont royal qui est a 3 min a pied"}
{"text":"came here for the authentic Portuguese egg tarts, they are sooooooo gooood!!!!  also got some of the pastries here, they are so so, but most of them are under $2, so i would not complain.  the chorizo here is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Love the Portuguese chicken, fries could be a bit crispier on the edges. Good natas for dessert."}
{"text":"Best Chicken in Montreal! and in the whole world?  I love this place: huge portions, amazing fries, delicious flavourful chicken, all that for a very cheap price. It's always packed, which is a good sign! A downside is that it'll be hard to find a seat, but you can walk to Mont Royal park and eat there if you have the patience!  And if you order a meal deal at the weekend until 2pm, there's bread and a pastry included... if you can eat them! I always make sure I save space for dessert!  Go, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The chicken is made to perfection and the fries are excellent.  One of the best places to get amazing Portuguese chicken.  The pastries are excellent as well.  Furthermore, this place is not expensive.  I suggest you call ahead of time to order your meal, because you could be faced with waiting in line when you get there, although the line is never a long wait.  Don't forget to ask for an extra helping of their amazing sauce, which can be served spicy or not. This sauce goes well with their fries.  Yummy !!  Definitely a 5 star !!"}
{"text":"pretty tasty chicken and fries! they ran out of rice when i was there.  we also had a tart pastry i forgot which one, but it was pretty good ! overall a rather heavy meal."}
{"text":"Best chicken I've ever had. EVER. It's also an incredible value. It's fairly priced and more than anyone can eat. I wish I lived in Montreal just so I could eat here daily."}
{"text":"Don't go in here expecting a dining experience. It's pretty much a fast food counter that delivers. Not the fastest as there are tons of tourists that don't know what they are getting, but the line moves. Do yourself a favor and call in your order before hand to save time.  The food is excellent! For $11 bucks total, you can have half a chicken and a ton of fries(you can opt out from the salad and get more fries). Everything is seasoned really well and you have wonderful flavor in each bite! The food will definitely hit the spot if you come in hungry.  For global customers, this would be one tier higher than Nando's in taste!"}
{"text":"I don't quite understand the hype Ramados receives. The wait is always very long and I've been disappointed with the food.  The chicken cooked in charcoal has a nice flavour. It would be so much better if they basted it while cooking instead of drowning it in piri piri sauce after cooking. I find the skin often comes out soggy. Their fries are well seasoned but frequently undercooked. When all you serve is fries and chicken, you have to deliver it to perfection every time.  There are so many choices for Portuguese chicken in Montreal, it's a question of taste but Ramados is far from toping this list in my book."}
{"text":"Oh Romados, how much do I adore you so - let me count the ways:  Location - Rue Rachel and Rue de Builion in the Plateau-de-Mont-Royal. Yeah, it's a 7 minute walk from the Station Mont-Royal on the Orange line, or the STM 55 (St. Laurent/St. Urbain) bus line.  You got your OPUS card, right?  Good.  Rue Rachel is also bike friendly, so Bixi over.    Service - self service counter.  Wait on the long line for your shot of chicken rotisserie goodness, we are all equals here (unless you call it in for take-away in advance, get ready for the icy stares from lesser men and women, or has the tragic distinction of being a vegetarian...in which case, I pity you).  After you are done, take your chicken-y goodness to the Parc De Mont-Royal, or sit down on the bench outside.  Francine (I think that's her name) would come out once in awhile to greet you and ask you how you are doing in French (I think she is the wife of Fernando, the owner).  Merci beaucoup madame, le poulet est superb (sorry, my middle school French from NYC never really developed beyond this point). It's good to have the wife of the great patriarch of Montreal chicken ask how you are enjoying yourself in their presence.  Food - yeah, as if you need to read my reviews to know that they are good.  Look at the satisfaction ratings - it's 90% above 4 stars as of Fall 2014.  But just in case you don't pay attention, here are the facts:  a) Chicken - juicy tender and flavorful with that smoky flavor, the peri-peri based spicy sauce is downright addictive  b) Fries - plentiful, crisp yet soft and savory, salty like the way it should be  c) Poutine - see fries.  Now add a healthy (to the cuisine, not to your heart) amount of cheese curds, properly set up so it's not cold, and then add some very warm and spicy chicken gravy on it.  It's Poutine as it was meant to be at the good places - it's pure and well crafted.  No silliness like guacamole, no bell pepper sauce, no hot dogs, no smoked meats like the has-beens at Resto La Banquise.  Just good, crispy soft greasy salty spicy dirty mess.  Like embarrassing good sex that leaves you itchy and sweaty all over.  Yes.  It's that good.  d) Sumol - I know it's not an exclusive of theirs, but shots of Sumol should be poured while enjoying their chicken.  It's citrusy, it's effervescent, it's cheap(ish), won't give you a weird buzz like Guarana, and it's not coyingly sweet like those godawful American sodas.  Just do it.  e) Pasteis de nata - the quintessential Portuguese custard/egg tarts.  There's a reason why they are ALWAYS sold out by 7p.  It's soft, it's crispy, it's savory, it's better than 90% of the tart practitioners in North America (and I should know - I hit the joints in Newark often).  Just buy some, and then try the other places in Montreal (a certain stall in Marche Jean-Talon comes close, just like some of the Chinatown bakeries on Rue De La Gauchetiere, but it's just not quite the same).  You'll see WHY it's better.    Value - $9.50 for a half-chicken meal, served with fries and tasty fresh salad.  Piri piri sauce optional (but highly recommended), or just fine by itself.  I dunno, the last time I ate at a Yelp 4+ stars rated place in MTL I had to fish out at least a Borden (AKA the Canadan Benjamin).  Here I whip out three Macs and got me some loonies and a toonie, that's good for me and the lady, plus we got leftovers good for breakfast the next day.  How about that.  If that's not value for the Canadian dollar, I don't know what is.    So yeah.  If you are in Montreal and just so happens to be in the Plateau, GO.  Pick up a Turkish coffee from Cafe Replika nearby, savor the evening, admire the street murals and await your turn with chicken goodness."}
{"text":"I've been getting the half-chicken combo for more than 10 years and just ordered a chicken sandwich thinking it would be a filling snack. Nope. A .50c bun and a leg's worth of chicken for $7.00 + tax. The sandwich looked pretty bare and I asked for lettuce & tomato and was told it would be $1.00 extra. Come on guys! Definitely stick to the combos for the best value."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this spot for a while now.  Finally decided to go and try it. We couldn't really find parking so we took our order to go.  The place was pack no where to sit, and the line up was bit long. All good signs for me! I wanted a chicken sandwich, but unfortunately  they didn't have any sandwiches left.  We opted for a chicken poutine and a side order of fries. Chicken poutine : Huge portion! Alot of cheese Lord knows I love me some cheese!!!! They could have added more chicken, but I'm not complaining. My friend really enjoyed it , thought it was one of the best he ever had. Personally I tried it and didn't really like it. In my defense I'm not a  big poutine fan.  Fries : Well i cant really describe them  much. Plain ol french fries.   Our total was 14$   Overall this place was worth going to. I will be going back, in hopes to finally try their sandwiches.  The service was fast and the cooks were super nice. Price wise very cheap, it wont make you go broke.  Romados you got a fan!"}
{"text":"This place serves Portuguese specialities and you can find everything there: bakery, grilled food, grocery shop, restaurant, etc. Why should you visit several businesses if you can find everything there?  If you want to eat everyday dishes with a different taste, spend a good time there and order some roasted chicken with fries and salad (vinaigrette) and you won't regret.  Save some space for desserts! The meal would look like a traditional 'Poulet Rôti' but it will come with exotic flavors, not to mention that is roasted in charcoal BBQ."}
{"text":"For a chicken breast, salad and fry combo - priced at $10 - can't go wrong.  Can upgrade fries to poutine for extra $3.  Chicken could use A little more seasoning or smoke flavor., but Servers are great - gave me a sample of hot sauce before I ordered.  Huge selection of pastries.  Minimal seating.  Bring a big appetite."}
{"text":"We went to Romados shortly before we left to the airport to go back to NY. There was a short line that moved along pretty quickly towards the back of the store. We ordered a chicken dinner platter to share amongst the three of us and it was the perfect amount! The platter came with chicken, a nice salad, and fries. We upgraded our fries to poutine fries for a couple of dollars and it was well worth it. The chicken was nice and tender with a crispy skin and had a nice spicy sauce to it. The fries come well seasoned with herbs and spices and taste even better when you upgrade it to poutine. This was a pretty delicious quick meal and relatively cheap too! Definitely a must try if you're looking for amazing Portuguese  chicken."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.. it was a long wait to order, but the chicken was good. I would not order a combo again because of the over load of fries."}
{"text":"Heard many good reviews for Romados and must say that I was neither impressed nor disappointed. The chicken was moist, not dry at all, but not particularly unique in flavor. Perhaps I should have ordered the spicy options. Fries were good but overflowing in the plate while there was a minuscule amount of salad; seemed imbalanced."}
{"text":"I don't know WTF happened but I can tell you this:  1) The chicken is still good, but it wasn't as good as before  2) The salad was pathetic and I didn't eat a bite of the limp, nasty wet, water-laden salad  3) The fries ruined everything for me -- excessive amount of them, dry, brown, soaked in dirty oil, DISGUSTING  4) The natas they used to give as a freebie, are now a hybrid tart custard piece of crap  5) The owner and his kids aren't really working much any more which has contributed to its decline  Know what? They're coasting on their name and fame. I'm not going back, except to buy natas once in a while.  Not worth it any more to wait in line and then fight for a crappy seat that 50% of the time is not available."}
{"text":"Grateful this place exists and is so close to home. If you like Portuguese chicken, than you will love it here.  The chicken is cooked rotating on coal stoves, and always comes out perfectly juicy on the inside, and crispy on the outside.   Two half chickens, is more than enough for a family of 4, and includes fries, salad, rice (if you come early enough). Definitely get the spicy sauce, it's really not very spicy, just tasty!   This is a must try spot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great good and excellent service for the price. Yumm yumm. Always a huge line for dinner!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best cheaper lunches I've ever had! Since the bulk on Montreal restaurants are on the pricey side, we needed a few lunch options on the lower cost side to balance things out and this was one of the places I had bookmarked. And it did NOT disappoint. it's a short simple menu. it's literally chicken and fries, some poutiness and a few sandwiches. that's it! We split a half chicken with fries, rice and salad, a small poutine classic and this beef sandwich. Total bill was maybe $30. I can't explain how much food it was, will add pics to this review soon! the quality was insane., the chicken and fries were out of this world. The gravy in the poutine was just perfect and the beef sandwich was one of the best things I ate the whole weekend!"}
{"text":"Guys relax... maybe in Montreal you have St Hubert and that is why you give this place 5 stars...  the chicken is good, ok, but that's it. We tried the calamari and it was suspiciously huge pieces and very salty... the sides are absolutely loaded, too much... so much it is kind of grotesque... So...  get two chickens for a party of 6-8 and then ask for the smallest side of salad and the smallest side of potatoes and that will be more than enough for all your party..."}
{"text":"amazing portuguese-style slowed cooked (smoked) meats and fries. get there early for the specials, which sometimes include rabbit or lamb. and don't ignore the displays: baked goods are good, chorizo is incredible. there are a few places to sit and eat and no table service - only a takeout counter."}
{"text":"Amaziiingggg piri piri chicken !! Their piri piri sauce is amazing !!! The pasteis de nata are suupperr good. Everything is always fresh. One word: AMAZING"}
{"text":"I love chicken so I had to try some Portuguese chicken at Romados. I've had Peruvian grilled chicken, Southern fried chicken, even Filipino chicken. Loved them all!  Sadly I wasn't impressed. Although the combo portions are huge here, especially the fries, the flavor was nothing special and the leg quarter I received was slightly burnt. Still a good value for $9 (combo with fries and salad was enough for two people) but nothing I would have a craving to return for.  Everyone was drinking what looked like berry soda with the word Antarctica on the green can. Never seen it before but I'm guessing it's a Portuguese thing.  Cash or debit card only."}
{"text":"My new favorite fastfood joint.  I dropped by here with a friend that wanted some good poutine and decided to trust the yelp reviews.  I was BLOWN AWAY. 9$ for that huge ass delicious poutine?! Dear god. That was the best chicken I have ever tasted in my life. It was cooked to perfection and the fries were also incredibly good. The gravy seemed spicy but not nearly enough to create discomfort. (to yelpers reading this, I normally can't take spicy.)  My friend couldn't even finish her poutine and I was filled for the whole day (rare feat for a 215lbs 6'2 guys).  ABSOLUTE.MUST.TRY.   They don't have much selection food-wise though but the taste and price make it up by far. Incredible selection of Portuguese drinks and well-priced deserts as well. The only bad thing is that there is no place to sit.  The tables and chairs are practically all squeezed in and it is kind of uncomfortable especially if you're taller.  GO HERE.  Edit: Still freaking out at how good the damn chicken is. If I wouldn't be 400lbs by the end of the month, I'd eat here everyday.  P.S. Everything else on the menu is also well worth it like the half-chicken."}
{"text":"So glad we decided to try this place while we were in Montreal! Delicious, cheap, friendly and with a unique cool Portuguese vibe. Best neighborhood chicken spot ever? Quite possibly! Portuguese passion fruit soda went really well with the food!"}
{"text":"Let's talk about their chicken. It is the most moist and delicious Portuguese style chicken I have ever had. The chicken is tender and falls right off the bone. Their fries are hand cut and so tasty. They are seasoned with the perfect amount of salt and pepper. Their pricing is very reasonable for the amount of food you get. A combo of a 1/4 chicken leg, fries and salad is plenty for 2 people or 1(if you want to have a very hearty meal) and it only costs $8 before tax! Their Portuguese tarts are very good as well! I tried their almond tart and it was good. Not too sweet which was a plus."}
{"text":"Très bon poulet BBQ à la Portuguaise. Assurez-vous de prendre avec sauce piquante ai vous aimez un peu de piquant, vous pouvez aussi en acheter extra. Les frites maisons sont super, ainsi que la vinagrette de la salade maison! La meilleure valeur si vous êtes deux c'est de prendre le demi poulet en combo avec frites et salade, versus deux repas individuels. Le chorizo grillé est très bon aussi"}
{"text":"Romados was probably the first restaurant I ever remember going to as a young Portuguese girl! To this day my Avo still buys her natas from Romados, which truly speaks to how authentic they are. They also have specialty Portuguese products you can't find anywhere else, like the real deal chorizo and massa de pimentao. They are famous for the portuguese chicken but their baked goods are made fresh and I highly recommend ordering pao seco or natas (or quejiadas if you are from the Azores) next time you visit."}
{"text":"Chicken was amazing. Barely had any fries because they were all eaten by my friends when I finally had a chance to grab a plate. The Natas (sp?) are to die for!!"}
{"text":"Recipe for a perfect summer picnic:  Line up at Romados for a combo per hungry person. You will get a huge heap of chicken, hot off the charcoal grill (my \"cuisse\" combo had at least 2 thighs in it), peppery golden fries, salad, and a roll for about $8. Say yes to the hot sauce. Grab an interesting-looking drink from the cooler and lots of extra napkins, then walk over to Park Lafontaine, sit by the pond and gobble it all up. Even after eating your fill, you will probably have enough leftovers to make yourself a sandwich using the yummy bun.  Catch a show at Théâtre de Verdure in the evening as the sun goes down. Walk back to the métro in the twilight, eating your sandwich as you go.  I hear there are great desserts at Romados, too, but I honestly don't know how anybody could eat dessert after that big dinner. Maybe a separate trip?"}
{"text":"Bon vieux  Romados.  Valeur sûr pour du bon poulet portugais on es assurer  de ne pas être  déçu.  Les frites  sont tres bonnes  bien épicées et le poulet viens  en portion généreuse également  accompagné de salade. La poutine au poulet et bonne aussi , immense portion mais on vas là bas  pour le poulet a la brasa.  Bonne bouffe pas cher un classique."}
{"text":"Famous Portuguese chicken done right.  The spices and sauce give the chicken a distinctive flavor and the fries are also delicious.  There's also some interesting (international) bottled beverages to choose from (whether cola or juices).  This place can get busy and often has a line but I think it's worth it for the rich flavorful chicken for a cheap and quick meal."}
{"text":"Excellent poulet, mais les frites étaient un peu molles. La sauce épicée était également très bonne. Menu très abordable. À essayer absolument."}
{"text":"The best poutine I've ever had (and I had a lot)! A friend of mine introduced me to this awesome place and I want to go back there badly. The fries, cheese, sauce and chicken are perfectly cooked and seasoned that when it mixes in your mouth it's sunshine for your tastebuds. No 5-star rating because they don't deliver in the Sud-Ouest yet. Soon, maybe? Please?"}
{"text":"La réputation de la rôtisserie Romados n'est plus à faire. Allez-y sans hésiter pour cet incroyable poulet frites avec un surplus de sauce piquante (c'est leur spécialité).   Aussi, commandez un poulet entier à emporter pour un apéro de dernière minute: vos convives vous remercieront!  Je recommande d'aller chercher vos commandes au comptoir et de ne pas tenter l'expérience de livraison dont l'attente est bien trop longue et le plat, lui, beaucoup moins ultime..."}
{"text":"We ordered the 1/2 poulet (chicken) and salade and a   single 1/2 poulet. The combo came with a roll and spicy french fries they're were plenty  The meat is so tender and juicy it comes with the skin on bones. They cut it into small portions making it easy to eat. So good it smokiness and flavor is so good! The salad came with a honey mustard vinaigrette which had a couple slices of tomato and slivers of red onion. For dessert the double pastry case was full of delicious Canadian pastries. We bought 6 of a custard favorite because it was a better buy. If you like tiramisu they have that as well. We brought them back to our room and had them with sparkling wine. The restaurant is located on the corner and was not hard to find. We will come back to try more pastries!!!"}
{"text":"Pour environ 7$ par personne, vous pourrez déguster un poulet tendre et juteux, badigonné avec de la sauce piquante. Leurs frites sont exquises, croustillantes à souhait et parfaitement assaisonnées.  La rôtisserie est également une pâtisserie, et sert une variété de gâteaux, ainsi que les fameuses Pastéis de Natas, ces petites tartelettes aux oeufs typiquement portugaises. On y vend également des charcuteries et des fromages.  Prenez le en take-out, et passez votre commande 30 minutes avant d'aller la chercher."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get a heaping pile of greasy, delicious chicken and fries. As American tourists, we found the menu (which is mostly pictures) very confusing, but in the end it didn't matter. Go up to the counter and ask for half a chicken. They'll put it in a box with a huge helping of fries and a salad. Throw in a drink for around 14$ Canadian.  Once you sit down to eat, you'll have to excavate your chicken from under the fries and it'll be an oh-so-delicious process. The chicken juices and BBQ mingle with the fries and make everything taste that much more delicious.  PRO TIP: The first night we went, the place was super crowded and we tried to eat standing up. A helpful local suggested that we take our dinners a block (north)east on Rue Rachel to a neighborhood bar. The bar was next to a bike shop and had absolutely no sign on it, but was a fantastically chill place with a sort of 60's vibe to the decor. Perfect spot to enjoy some beer with our chicken and fries."}
{"text":"With a 1/2 pound of chicken in piri sauce that melted in my mouth, a light salad, and crispy, flavorful fries all for $6, I felt like I was walking out of a rotisserie in Lisbon. \"Muito bom.\""}
{"text":"Oh yum. Bonjour to the best chicken I've ever eaten. Lately, I'm just so bored with chicken. It's like the white bread of meat. boring. overdone. everywhere. Kind of like how my vagina used to be before I quit whoring.   And then I met Romados. The shop is on the edge of a sweet little neighborhood. Parking is plentiful or you can easily ride your bike here. Great bike lanes all the way down Rachel. Ordering was funny. For me. Not for my mom who fumbled her way through that only written in French menu. She tried to order by the price. I'm laughing now only because it was so damn cute. I love my mom, even moreso when she tries to speak French with her sweet southern twang.   The chicken is moist. Juicy. Delicious. Spicy.   Just like something else I know.   It's kind of indescribably good. Really. It comes with a MOUND of french fries, so you're better off just ordering a whole chicken platter. Split it with someone and you have a delicious, filling meal for under $15. Order it spicy. Eat it there, although the space is a bit uncomfortable. I just cannot imagine it would be as good later on."}
{"text":"The half-chicken is an amazing deal! Comes with fries and salad, and the chicken itself is very well seasoned and full of flavor. The seating space is a little bit limited though, and the pastry section's desserts seemed not very fresh. Altogether, a great experience because the chicken was top notch. I will definitely revisit this place, but I suggest to avoid the desserts section in the evening."}
{"text":"Oh Romados. I miss you so.   I remember that first time when I had walked through your doors and headed straight to that line formed outside the food-serving window. I had just gotten the last chicken of the day, and the guy behind me had turned away all upset. I don't blame him. I would be mighty upset too if I had missed out on the heavenly chicken that you cook. I remember, that greasy-and-delicious-barbeque-chicken smell coming out of that window was INTENSE. It was a hurried experience. The sweet young lady standing on the other side of the counter shouted \"PIQUANTE?\" when I ordered the chicken and I wasnt sure what was happening, but 'piquante' is always a safe bet for me so I said \"YES\" and bam! She had the chicken legs in a little container, grabbed her brush and basted that piece of chicken with this greasy delicious-looking sauce before handing me the container and shouting \"NO MORE CHICKEN SORRY!\"  I felt like a little kid who had just gotten the last ice-cream from the ice-cream man. I hurried off home clutching the precious container in my hand. As soon as I got home, I opened the container, took in the aroma wafting from the chicken, and dug in. I took the first bite, then the second, then the third... and I knew.   You were irreplaceable. I would search far and wide, but nothing would ever compare. Its true, Romados. I might have to come back to Montreal for you."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place other than it's the go to place for Portuguese chicken in Montreal.  It's been around for a while and locals and tourists alike love this place.  The service is pretty much cafeteria style and there is a seating area, but it's very small.  The line ups are fairly long and this place is busy until they close up in the evenings.  I suggest coming here grabbing take out and eating in the nearby park or on the hood of your car if you want to enjoy this chicken action.  They give you a massive amount of food with each order.  You get your choice of chicken quarter or half, a ton of fries, a salad and a bun as well.  You can also choose to get hot sauce on the side or drizzled all over your chicken if you like.  I suggest on the side, as the chicken has plenty of flavour as it is.  Overall a great spot to grab that Portuguese chicken you've been craving in the Montreal area.  The price is right and the chicken is juicy, what else can you ask for right?  Oh yes and try their custard tarts too, so delicious!"}
{"text":"I had no idea Montreal had such a thing for Portuguese chicken. Romados seems to be the most popular place to go for Portuguese chicken, it was recommended to me a dozen times. I had high hopes based on the extreme hype I received and I was mostly satisfied.   I got the chicken sandwich and fries, my boyfriend got the 1/2 chicken and fries. I also got a Portuguese egg tart. The fries were solid, hand cut and tossed in a tasty salty seasoning. The portions were generous. The chicken sandwich itself was tasty too, the chicken was very juicy and tender and I like the hot sauce they put on it, so much so that I bought a little container of it and poured it on everything, it kind of reminds me of chili oil more than any other hot sauce I've tried. I actually didn't like the bun they put it on, I'm not a huge fan of crusty bread, I ended up tearing a bunch of it off. The skin on my boyfriend's chicken was mindblowing, much better than kfc's. mmmm.  The real star of the show was the egg tart for me oddly enough. They're sooo good. They're just tarts with custard in them, I'm not sure what makes them so delicious but they're creamy and flaky and amazing. I bought a box of 6 on my way home to Halifax.   Try the Portuguese sodas. They're great. They have tons of different baked goods, and different items on the menu besides chicken that I'd love to try. Not to mention its very reasonably priced. If I lived in Montreal I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Yummy chicken! Really good food. I have nothing bad to say about their food. I loved it. I would only say, at least have one person behind the counter, serving food, that speaks english! I don't eat beef and couldn't get anyone there to tell me if the poutine broth had beef in it. It was hell for those few minutes i went back and forth with them. I understand you are in Montreal, and you mainly speak french here, but how can you ignore the fact that it is a big tourism city. And, the international language happens to be english. I wish I could say I was the only one it happened to. It happened to another person as I was paying. Any who. If you eat everything and don't care to find out what else could be in their food outside of chicken, it's a great place. Food is good."}
{"text":"Been meaning to return to this place. Actually, my first time doesn't really count because I was in a rush and got the sandwiches without the hot sauce. Big no-no. Anyways, happened to be strolling around the neighborhood and decided to give Romados a solid try.  I arrived at a good time (hardly any line) and got my order in relatively quickly (a chicken leg combo with fries and salad, WITH hot sauce). After the grumpy guy behind the counter gave me my food, I paid, and vultured around for a table to eat. Luckily, I found a nice little window table and set up shop. Let's see what this place is all about.  The chicken was nice and juicy, but sadly, the sauce wasn't to my liking. Seemed a little more on the grease side as opposed to the sauce side. It wasn't horrible, but not what I was hoping for. I tried, but I just didn't taste a whole lot of spice. The fries and salad were solid.   Would I return here? I suppose if I was in the area, but it isn't a spot I'd go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"So good! This is the best rotisserie chicken I ever had. So so so much better than swiss chalet or KFC or Popeyes. And it's pretty cheap. You can smell the good chicken even from far away. Strongly suggest going there."}
{"text":"Always a line so call ahead and save yourself some time.  The chicken here is legendary, it's like a flavor grenade went off in your mouth. Crispy skin, juicy, juicy chicken and nice spice.   I can eat and I usually split a half chicken meal with my partner. It's a half chicken with a salad and a boatload of fries on top.   Get the spicy sauce- it's not super spicy but it's very flavorful. Oh, and grab an egg tart for dessert.  You must try it!"}
{"text":"Honnêtement, je ne comprends pas pourquoi ce restaurant est si achalandé et si bien coté...  D'abord, le poulet n'a rien d'extraordinaire et la sauce piquante très grasse, les frites, mis à part les petites épices sur le dessus, n'ont rien de spécial non plus, sans compter le manque d'espace pour manger confortablement sur place. Les cheveux du monde dans la file d'attente presque dans nos assiettes et tout, et tout le monde qui attend qui te regarde pendant que tu manges... Bien bien bien ordinaire, je ne retournerai jamais là-bas, même pas pour un take-out!  Seul point positif, les sucreries et produits de boulangerie avaient l'air bien."}
{"text":"Wow, I just popped in here to take a look, and found these Portuguese egg tarts which I haven't had since my trip to Lisbon.  They are great, in Lisbon I was eating 2 or 3 of them a day, I liked them so much!  So at this wonderful bakery on Rachel Street I bought two of these lovely Pasteis de nata and ate them for a treat.  They were delicious!  A taste just like I remembered from Portugal!  Obrigado!"}
{"text":"Their chicken is best! But make sure you go before the peak times as the line ups are really long. Reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Yet another Montreal gem.   Hands down the best Portuguese barbecue chicken Montreal has to offer, every other restaurant that is remotely good will still come AFTER Romados. You can smell it from down the street, it is inexpensive, and absolutely delicious.   Whether you are ordering the perfectly cooked and spiced chicken, fries, salad, or pastries, your taste buds are in for the ride of their lives.   Do not miss out on this place!"}
{"text":"Love the fresh grilled chicken (and you have to adore the scene with a whole row of the little birds being flipped together over fire) but the egg tarts fell pretty flat."}
{"text":"I shared the 1/2 chicken and fries + salad with my husband for lunch and it was plenty of food.   Humongous pile of delicious food for just $10. You won't find anything this cheap and tasty around here. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"First and only time i've had portuguese chicken and I was not dissapointed. The chicken was very flavourful and juicy. You get a huge box of fries and chicken for about 10$. Would visit every time i'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The smell you get from this place as you walk up to it is enchanting. Being Portuguese i basically took the reigns for ordering for my friends the chicken was amazing perfectly tender with crispy fries and an awesome spicy sauce. If I lived in Montreal this place would be the death of me. I also bought 6 Pastel de Nata (custard dessert with a flaky crust) by far the best version i've had in a while. I usually get them in CT but these were defiantly memorable. BTW  you get a 1/2 chicken fries and salad for 9.95 theres no beating that."}
{"text":"Great prices, so make sure to go early to beat the lunch / dinner crowd.  Dark meat was good, but the white meat was slightly too dry.  So-so rice. Get some other side.  Not so good Pastel de Nata. Made off site and was delivered very slowly. It was also too sweet.  Still To try:  piri piri chicken, Chouriço, fries, less time sensitive pastries"}
{"text":"People of Montreal seem to love their rotisserie chicken so of course I made a stop at the most famous place to see what the fuss was all about. While certainly not photogenic at all, I know now why people are so crazy for this place. Quite possibly the best rotisserie chicken I have ever had! Incredibly moist and seasoned perfectly with crispy skin, what more can you ask for from chicken?! So good that I went twice in my short trip as well.  You can cancel getting the portugese tarts. They are NOTHING like the ones in lisbon, so don't get excited."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese chicken in all of Montreal. Almost no waiting even in busy hours, as a tourist in Montreal I was sooo happy to find this local jewel."}
{"text":"Good priced, not too sure what the hype is about the chicken, it didn't taste out of the world to me. Definitely seems healthier than other options, doesn't leave a greasy feeling in your mouth."}
{"text":"Good food + generous portion = Woohoo! As good as it gets!  It was freezing & we were starving! We stopped by this place because we saw this place was crowded. We thought, this place has to be good & YES! THIS PLACE IS GOOD!   We got the poutine with shredded chicken & the half a chicken. The poutine is definitely different than most of the poutines that we've tried. Poutine mixed with shredded chicken is definitely a great idea. It was definitely a great combination. The chicken itself is flavorful, delicious!   The half a chicken with fries & salad is about $7.40 & the poutine is $9. We spent about $21 with a drink. It was definitely worth it.  Great value!   Friendly staff!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  The menu is limited, but the chicken is tender and flavorful and you get far too much food for your money.  I got the 1/4 chicken which came with rice, fries as well as rolls.  I got my money's worth and then some."}
{"text":"Superbe adresse pour les amateurs de poulet ! Et que dire des frites ... Un régale. Et tout ca pour un petit prix !"}
{"text":"I live in the US now and this is one of the places I always go back to when I visit family. Best BBQ chicken I've ever had, no doubt about it."}
{"text":"Three words for this place: grub as feeze! I ate here only once on my very first visit to Montreal, and I still think about my meal that day and salivate just a 'lil.  I saw a few different establishments advertising \"Portuguese Rotisserie Chicken\" in Montreal, and decided that I would do some Yelping to determine the best location to ingest aforementioned chicken (which was new to my quarter-Portuguese heritage self -- is this a Canadian thing?!). Yelpers did not fail me -- my two-piece chicken meal with fries and side salad was tha bizness! I was even able to procure a grape Fanta as my beverage -- what?!  Seating is indeed a problem though -- I got my meal to-go and walked the block-and-a-half up to the small Parq des Ameriques, and consumed this meal-from-the-Gods out of the styrofoam box on a park bench.   And when they ask \"Spicy?\" Say yes. Or, sorry -- \"Oui!\" Or \"sim!\""}
{"text":"The chicken is sooooo tasty!  Place is crowded, loud, and hot to eat-in during the summer, but it is DEFINITELY worth it. Line was long, but moved quickly. Order the spicy sauce for a real kick. Meal comes with fries, salad, and dinner roll (we opted for more fries over rice).  Chicken falls off the bone and is quite tasty. Very greasy, but hits the spot. And super cheap considering it's so much food!"}
{"text":"Meilleur poulet à Montréal. Les prix sont excellents. Le sandwich au porc A++. Service rapide malgré les longues files.  Si vous prenez un repas, la portion de frites est ÉNORME et se partage très bien!"}
{"text":"Large serving for the price paid. The food was extremely good just like how other reviews mentioned. I got a 1/2 chicken combo with frites and salad and three pasties de nata. It was well with the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Ramados serves hearty food for hungry souls, no doubt about that. My friends and I made this our first stop after driving 5 hours from Toronto. The fries and chicken went a lot way to fill our empty bellies and warm us up on a cold night.  For three people, we ordered a Poutine with pork, a half-chicken with fries, and two soups of the day (veggie). Ramados' generous serving sizes meant this was more than enough for us.  The chicken was flavorful, but a bit dry. The fries were very delicious. I actually disagree with other reviews that said the fries here are greasy - I detected no unusual amount of grease with mine. The Poutine is mediocre. Flavorful gravy, but no squeaky cheese curds, which signals a quality Poutine. The veggie soup had good flavor. It was quite thick and seemed to be made with a potato base.  Seating was a nightmare, even around 8-9 pm. Order yours to go or be prepared to get aggressive. No Canadian kindness from me. Hangry Emily was prepared for battle."}
{"text":"I would have loved to give it 4.5 stars. The chicken is excellent. The salad is good. The bread is not really required.  The place where it loses half a star is the fries. I love the spices on the fries but there's just to much salt on them. With a little bit less salt they would be perfect and it would be a 5 stars."}
{"text":"I saw the raving reviews and am staying right across the street from this food joint, so, I had to stop by. The setup is pretty much made for a quick food grab. The staff was kind and the service was quick. I ordered a chicken combo that comes with chicken, fries, and salad. I also got some rice. The seasoning on the fries and rice really helped bring the quality of the meal up because I really wasn't shocked by this meal. I was expecting amazing chicken and was let down. It was alright, but definitely not what some of these reviews make it out to be. The salad had this weird mustard flavored dressing that I was not fond of."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not much to add except that until my last visit last week, I had tolerated the fries as a simple accompaniment to the star (the chicken with amazing spicy sauce!), BUT on my last visit, I decided to stray from ordering the usual $9.75 plate of half-chicken/fries/salad. I ordered a full chicken and the fries for 2 people. This time they put the fries separately, in a bag, and this allowed them to be way less soggy. I was able to appreciate their seasoning for the first time this way. Anyway, no matter what, it's a win-win going here! And pick up some sweets from their bakery section while you're there, some natas or the cookies and cream type dessert (called something like Cream from Heaven). Yum!!"}
{"text":"Love the grilled chicken and the poutine simple. Small place with a few seating. Overall, we had a great experience and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Super moist chicken, and great desserts! Protip - dont take pics of their chicken behind in the kitchen i was yelled at in french by a very angry lady.   We ordered half a chicken and sides to share with some friends. The spicy sauce was really tasty but not quite spicy so hot food friends might be disappointed. I'd come here as a regular for sure if I lived nearby!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best cheap meals involving chicken I've ever eaten.   There are two lines, one for order and the other was for pre-order. I had to use Google translate to figure that out. My gf and I got there around 7PM and the line up was long but moved steadily, took about 15 minutes to reach the front with around 8 people ahead of us.  Ordered the half chicken(spicy) with fries and salad for $9.75. Got to the hotel and opened up the container and was in shock at how much fries there were. The chicken was moist and flavourful and the fries were a bit soggy but pretty good over all. The hot sauce was not spicy but had a nice taste to it.  Overall we were very pleased with the meal and would definitely go there again when we get a chance."}
{"text":"Best chicken combo! I ordered the 1/4 chicken and you get a choice of salad, rice or fries and you can get any combination of these which is helpful. There is a sweet or spicy sauce that come with it but you can have it on the side. French bread is given too. The portion is big and the price is right! Chicken was flavorful enough for me so I didn't need the sauce. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This chicken must of had voodoo performed on it because nothing can be this delicious. I went with half a chicken and it still wasn't enough. I'm officially on the quest to find chicken that can top this but I think I'm just being delusional."}
{"text":"This place bases it's success on good quality food and fast service. That's all I really want."}
{"text":"Saltiest chicken I've ever had. Literally burned just to eat but I had showed up at the end of the day so maybe it was just a bad batch."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday hoping to get a tasty meal on an empty stomach. Sunday night around 6pm. I waited in line 20 mins, and a third of the line had passed. I still had 2/3rds in front of me, so I left, I couldn't wait another 40. I wish I could speak for the chicken, but it looks like not. Looks like they need to rethink operations."}
{"text":"A Montreal staple, Romados serves up some damn good Portuguese chicken along with other bar b q specialties. The fries doused in herbs and spices give the meal a nice side piece.   Romados doubles up as a bakery serving fresh baked breads and pastries for ya sweet tooth. Finish off the meal with a refreshing drink that you can't find at your local grocery store.  Spacing is limited during busy hours but take out makes for a nice little picnic at the park down the street (Mont-royal and Parc Jeanne-Mance to the west and Parc Lafontaine to the east)."}
{"text":"This is a must-go-to for me when visiting Montreal.  It is simple, delicious and very affordable!  As a supreme lover of all things Anthony Bourdain, I discovered this spot on his short lived show, The Lay Over, and boy am I glad I followed his recommendation.  It is absolutely fast food, but incredibly good, well prepared fast food.  The long is line and there is limited indoor seating, but there is a small little park kitty corner across the street where I take my plate and go picnic.  The line moves very quickly and I always get the same dish:  1/2 chicken that comes with a small side salad with a simple Italian dressing and a mound of fries on top of it all.  You can vary the heat of the sauce the chicken is brushed with and I opt for medium that has a good bite.  There is nothing like eating the fries at the bottom of the container soaked in that dwindling chicken sauce, I can hardly do it justice!  The bakery offerings are unusual and fun while still offering all the basics as well.  Even though the chicken is amazing, the fries are my favorite and I keep telling myself I need to try the poutine.  It hasn't happened yet though, I need that sauce on the chicken!"}
{"text":"Small, local shop known for their chicken.   We came into the shop around 9pm. There was still a line and the place was super stuffy. It was already hot outside, but the heat from the grills made the store even warmer.  Came here to pick up a 1/2 chicken combo plate. It comes with their famous Portuguese chicken, salad and a ton of fries on top. I really mean a ton of fries. For ~15 CAD it's a ton of food.  The chicken was really good and tender. It had tons of flavor and the sauce/juice makes for a great dipping sauce for the fries.  Overall a cool place to go to get chicken. Side note, it's cash or debit only!"}
{"text":"I am a BBQ fanatic (smoked stuff) and love anything on the grill, too.  I just got back from eating Romados' chicken.    I ordered a half-chicken platter that came with fries and salad.  The first words out of my mouth when I smelled the chicken were literally, \"holy cow!\"  After I parked my car half a block away from this gem on the corner, I knew what I was getting myself into.  I immediately smelled the charcoal!  And after walking inside the establishment, heaven.  The chickens are spatchcocked and are rotating as they are cooking over the charcoal.  I've never seen that type of roasting/grilling setup in my life, especially at a restaurant.  So, there I was with chicken-in-hand and about 1/2 lb. of fries!  The woman at the counter (cashier) then gave me a piece of freshly-baked Portuguese bread and a small tart.  This was free.  The dude that took my order was a bit rude.  I guess that happens when I don't speak French?  But other than that, no complaints.  This place rocks."}
{"text":"Worth the hype; Ramados offers authentic Portuguese style rotisserie chicken with addictive sauces and good service. The chicken is butterflied and chopped into finger food sized pieces. The skin is very crispy and beautifully seasoned.   Order ahead to avoid lines. However,  we showed up to a lineup that stretched to the door and did not have to wait long as the staff bagged chicken after chicken with surprising speed.   If you're hungry; get the whole chicken for two. Fries are also delicious from here. The salad is nothing to rave about but then again this place is not about eating salad. Staff is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"What Montreal is all about: you bike, far, up in these neighborhoods where everything may look so common to you and then you end up spotting the place that will make your day. So simple and so unique.  Rotisserie Romados will surprise you. Make sure you get the chicken. A \"1/2\" will surely fit two starving stomachs and get a good load of spicy sauce. You may ask for breasts or thighs. And by the way, yelpers perhaps do not highlight it enough but the fries are excellent: crunchy and tasting like potatoes. Drinks wise, I recommend the imported Guarana soda and the Portuguese bottled orange soda. But Romados is also a pastry and will serve you creamy egg-tart and cappuccinos (or might be as well-off going to Neve right in front of it).    Furthermore, given quality and quantity, prices are unbeatable. 1/2 Chicken + 2 sodas + Dessert = $15. Bread comes free.  PS Does NOT accept Credit cards but Debit ones."}
{"text":"We walked here from downtown and it was as good as advertised. Huge portions of freshly made chicken (I got mine spicy), fries, and a side salad. No one I was with finished their container of food even though we walked in hungry. Delicious!"}
{"text":"My well anticipated visit to Romados! Having heard so much of this rotisserie, I arrived with high expectations. We each ordered the 1/4 chicken meal, which comes with a side salad and a mountain of fries. Gosh. If you are craving fries, these will have you satisfied for weeks to come. Apparently you can ask for rice too (50/50), which I regret not doing because the meal gets quite dulling with only fries. OK, now about the actual food. It was good, but not enough to leave me breathless. Now I gotta say, the chicken was well cooked and very savoury. The side salad stole the show for me. Fresh, crunchy, aromatic. I need their salad dressing. It balances the dryness of the rest of the lunch. Fries were slightly cold and not crispy enough, yet the spices generously coated on the fries still leave you wanting more. Tip for those who still haven't visited Romados yet... Get yourself something to drink !! or bring a bottle of water with you. The amount of salt you ingest is crazy! VERDICT: I liked their food, everything was very flavourful, but sometimes a little bit overwhelming (saltiness). Price is very reasonable considering the abundance of food served. 1/4 chicken is definitively more than enough for lunch. Location is not optimal and it's a hassle to find a place to sit. Good idea as takeout to go for picnic. I will return if ever I am by the neighbourhood, I am intrigued to try their poutine!"}
{"text":"Yes, portions and prices are fine and chicken cooked on charcoal enhances flavour- that is assuming the chicken is decent quality. Anyone raving about the chicken at this place has never eaten chicken that hasn't been pumped with hormones and god knows what else. There is a distinct difference between this and organic farm raised chicken. Yes, you get what you pay for but after trying it a number of times and being consistently disappointed about the taste and texture, my friends and I have vowed never to go back. I guess they are able to offer the prices they do due to the sheer volume of mass produced chickens they sell. If only they used a higher quality product...and were still able to maintain the necessary supply and prices. Then again, finding unadulterated food these days is becoming harder and harder and more and more expensive. Enjoy the assembly line chicken."}
{"text":"It is good, the line is long (call ahead) and it is cheap! Fries are sweet, did not see any rice maybe it was under the pounds of fries! I am not sure I would do the line again unless I was short on cash. More of a value than a virtue."}
{"text":"I don't know if I can add anything new that hasn't already been said, but basically all you need to know about Romados is that you're going to get delicious, rotisserie chicken seasoned to perfection with a side of equally tasty salt & pepper fries and you're gonna walk out the door with a feeling of both glee and guilt - wait, did they undercharge me? How did I get so much food for less than $10? But those worries will quickly melt away as you take your first bite of chicken.  Needless to say I'll be returning, and if I'm in a rush I'll take advantage of the shorter line up for those who have called their orders in ahead. And yes, go for the spicy sauce. Yummmmm."}
{"text":"Can't add much beyond echoing the other positive reviews. Portions are large. The fries have an excellent flavor, the chicken is great, and the sandwich roll complements the bird perfectly. Great combination there, with the mildly spicy sauce, charred chicken, and great Portuguese bread."}
{"text":"The french fries are SO amazing! Seriously one of my favorite fries I've ever had and they give so much! BF got the 1/4 chicken, which he also was raving about. The line was a little long on a Saturday around lunch time and there was no where to sit, but it was totally worth it. BTW - some egg pastry custard thing looked good, but was kind of gross - and I LOVE dessert."}
{"text":"First thing you need to do IF you decide to go by this place. Call and put in the order or you will be waiting in line drooling for 15-30 minutes.  My GF and I order 1/2 of poulet combo. It came with Fries and Salad. The bill was around 10 bucks or so.   The bird was bar b q really well. They give you a big portion. We try not to order big meal because we want to go to as many places as we can when we were in MTL. We were in Montreal for 3 days we ate here twice and it was well worth it.  Remember look up the # and call first before you go. Check out the menu online. Or take a bib with you. :-)"}
{"text":"One if the most fun stops in our trip to Montreal. This place was a true local experience. Located in the Rachel St. Laurent area, we were trying to decide which Portuguese BBQ place for dinner and we're really glad we decided on this! Unbelievably seasoned rotisserie chicken with piles of amazing fries dumped on top, and a delicious but simple salad on the side. All for about $12 each, and the two of us probably could have split one order. The place was packed and deservedly so. Seating is limited as a warning. But what a nice way to warm up on a cold night than feasting in savory chicken and hot fries."}
{"text":"I've had this chicken a couple of times now and it's good! Just not the best. I've tried the sandwich and the normal chicken with fries.  I think they have great prices and combos. The service is amazing. The restaurant is nice and spacious.   The chicken is very seasoned which is great except I'm not a huge fan of very seasoned chicken.  In the sandwich, it tasted slightly vinegar-y which I didn't like that much and they don't add any tomatoes, mayo, lettuce. So it's truly only chicken.  The fries are also doused in herbs which I like but only for a while before I get tired of them.   I am a bit bias though because Serrano bbq has my heart."}
{"text":"Perhaps this was highly reviewed for the amount of food you get for your dollar.  If I lived by here I'd probably eat here quite a bit, but overall, we were not impressed.  Chicken was fairly dry.  Perhaps we came at a bad time, check it out if you're in the area and are looking for a cheap filling meal."}
{"text":"So I was expecting quite a lot from all the positive reviews I have heard about this place. Finally managed to get here on a quiet Thurs night where we didn't have to wait in line but most tables were still full. I opted for the 1/4 chicken breast and my boyfriend got the 1/2 chicken both with spicy sauce, we also got 2 drinks and 6 custard tarts and it came to about $27 which is reasonable. I was expecting a lot from the chicken and it wasn't up to what I expected as I make Portuguese chicken at home and I have eaten it in Portugal and it doesn't really compare and was a little dry. You also get salad and a lot of chips with it, dip the chips in the spicy sauce to make them taste better. Overall, it is a lot of food so a couple could easily get a half chicken and that would be enough. The Custard tarts were probably the best thing but you don't get any free with your meal anymore but they are still worth a try.  Overall, worth a visit for quantity but far from the best chicken I have ever eaten and definitely not worth waiting for a long time in line."}
{"text":"OMGGGGGG mon poulet portugais préféré au monde! (Sauf au Portugal) je pense que je louerais un appartement juste au dessus à cause du Romados. C'est idéal pour les étudiants car c'est pas cher et les portions tu en a pour deux personne avec 7$. Que dire de la Poutine! Meilleure adaptation ever de leur poulet! Oublier pas de bien tiper avant qu'il finisse votre plat! Votre portion sera encore plus énorme! Chaque fois que je m'y rend je devient nostalgique et ça me rappel le Portugal et leur Sumol (un MUST a prendre avec votre commande)! À quand le 24h et saviez vous qu'ils livrent maintenant? :D"}
{"text":"Romados? Romados!!! How have I not reviewed Romados yet? This is a Portuguese chicken Makkah for BBQ lovers from all over town and the world!  There is always, always, always a line. The first time I went there I looked at the line and kept on walking, but then I passed by the window to the kitchen, took one look at the rotisserie and went back to the line... I was not disappointed, and I keep coming back again and again.   There is a line for spontaneous people, and a line for people who pre-order on the phone, but most people just don't do that.  However, don't worry, the line moves steadily, and sure enough, you'll get there - and get to ask the servers for what you desire. They have all kinds of combos - 1/4, 1/2 or whole chicken with fries / rice and salad.  Sometimes they will make you choose between rice and fries and other times they will give some of both, depending on the server's mood. When they are in really good mood, you will get extra pices of chicken as well (happened to me once!). The portion size is huge though, and I was never able to finish. I always have leftovers for the next day.  Other times I just come in to get a whole chicken to take home, and that keeps me going for a few days! They also have sandwiches, but the Bifana (pork sandwich) is not nearly as good as the chicken. The quality of the chicken is consistently superb. It's super tasty and I personally prefer the spicy sauce.  The down side to this place, other than the line, is that the servers just throw the food in Styrofoam boxes, and their way of chucking lots of everything in there unfortunately extends to the the salad dressing as well... the box is always overstuffed with goodness, but it's more of a take out thing, and for those who want to sit down and eat there, it's kind of a bummer to be eating out of Styrofoam... (no plates! or non plastic cutlery). While their prices are very reasonable, sometimes you can get coupons that will make it even cheaper!"}
{"text":"Obviously their famous chicken is to die for! but dont miss out on the ginormous amount of fries and the natas (get there early to get some!). And what also sets the restaurant appart in my opinion is the amazing staff! The people there are so nice to their customers!  Its a great place for any time of the day!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken with poutine. It was my first time trying poutine, and I'm so happy I listened to the yelpers. It was delicious, portion was pretty big too. The restaurant was busy but the line moved quick. We got the pasteis de nata to go. They were also very good. Wasn't an issue for us, but we almost didn't get a table. I would definitely return to this spot!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I get a major craving for this chicken, on a portuguese bun or with fries and the homemade hot sauce this little 3 foot women slathers on with a paintbrush. I lived next door to it for twelve months and she made me dinner 5 days a week. I will never forget that place."}
{"text":"Montreals classic spot for Portuguese chicken.  Great food, wonderful service.  Avoid the rush times (noon on weekends or from 6-8pm to avoid the line ups)... but it is worth the wait for good quality/price meal."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese chicken in town imo. Great price. It gets crowds fast and often have to wait in line up. Not much places to sit to eat cause it is mainly a take out restaurant. The desserts offered in the bakery are also really good and the price is honest."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken! Their spices and sauce are simply addicting! The fries are delicious as well. The chicken is very oily, which gives it the great taste so I don't suggest eating it on a daily basis, but for a spur of a moment meal; fantastic!"}
{"text":"C'est La place pour manger du bon poulet. Les portions sont très généreuses, les frites savoureuses. Les pasteis de nata sont à goûter également car rien de mieux qu'une touche sucrée pour finir un bon repas. Pour deux, nous en avons eu pour moins de trente pièces et à Montréal, c'est assez rare de bien manger pour si peu."}
{"text":"Love this place! Probably the best Portuguese chicken I've had. The seating is not the most comfortable nor is the most spacious  but who cares really... the chicken is on point. Please order it with the spicy sauce, it's excellent!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here on our way to the park, and as usual, there was a pretty long lineup. Fortunately, the lineup moves pretty quickly. Overall the food was pretty good, especially the fries, and the prices are great - $10 for a meal. That being stated, we weren't happy with the portion size of the chicken breast - just too small. Also, maybe we were unlucky, but the chicken was a touch dry. I've been to other Portuguese rotisseries that I thought were better, but I would still come back here if in the area."}
{"text":"Good a bit over hyped but solid chicken nirvana.  Wish they provided more salad rather than cover everything in French fries.  Not sure why a dinner roll goes with the meal too many carbs. My total with a vitamin water and $5 of their magic spices with half a chicken was $21 or around $15 without the spices."}
{"text":"The chicken was not good!!!the meat is too dry..and the service is terrible!!!!!you delete my review?i can give you just a bad review again!!!"}
{"text":"Romados, Montreal's legendary chicken spot. For so long, this place has attracted praise, excitement and, reverence from all roasted chicken lover. As a chicken aficionado myself, I went to this place many times. The pastries and bread are always delicious, I love the small fruit tarts, but everyone here comes from one main event, the chicken.  I really love the way they plate their chicken here. They put fries until it covers, well everything. I always ask for spicy sauce on both my fries and my chicken, and I always say yes to the amazing Portuguese bun they distribute. It is one of the best bang for the $ in the city.  However, sometimes the chicken is a tad on the drier side, so come during the rush hours. It's never that bad."}
{"text":"This was the best meal I had in Montreal. I ate at Joe Beef, and all the top restaurants in old town and Rotissire Romados kicked them all to the curb.   1/2 chicken with spicy sauce, fresh fries, and salad... all for under $10? You seriously can't beat that. The chicken juices and hot sauce seep into the fries if you let it sit for a few minutes. Take yours to-go, walk down to La Fontaine Park and enjoy the best chicken while sitting on the grass.   I wish we had a restaurant like this in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"There is usually a line but they process very quickly.  We tried the spicy chicken and it was kind of dry.  They give a lot of french fries so we didn't need to order two entrees with fries but instead ordered one entree with fries and added additional chicken pieces and it was enough to feed three of us.  It's a cheap meal located in a residential neighborhood.  Definitely off the beaten path for us tourist.  The nata was ok.  It would have tasted better if they served it warm or at least at room temp."}
{"text":"Saw this place on yelp and on a cooking Chanel so I decided to try it. I got the 1/4 of chicken with fries and it came with this hot sauce. The mountain of fries were so tasty ( specially at the end covered in sauce and that's if you get to that ). I'm pretty sure there are some onions with the fries seasoning....yum. Now the chicken, it was so full of flavor you could really tell this was no ordinary rotisserie chicken. I would definitely recommend this place. The portions are huge and it was only 8$. I give this place a 4 star because  sitting there was really uncomfortable and if you take it to go and wait to long it's not the same so eat it fresh you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Si tu veux faire un diner avec ta belle-famille sans trop te casser la tête, va chez Romados prend un poulet complet bien épicé comme il le faut et le tour et jouer!  Ps: évité les longue file en commandant"}
{"text":"Overrated chicken. I got the one with spicy oil on it. Honestly I was underwhelmed. The portugese egg tart on the other hand was the BOMB, nice crispy skin and firm filling, so much better than Chinatown egg tarts. I give 5 stars for the pastel de nata, 3 for the chicken."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with ordering the chicken from here. Always a line up. Always fresh. Fries are really good. One chicken can feed my whole family of 3 and we have left over chicken for the next day."}
{"text":"Quelle délicieuse découverte !  À mon avis, c'est en tout cas le meilleur poulet que j'ai jamais goûté. Situé sur la rue Rachel Est (non loin du parc Jeanne Mance), Romados est un restaurant proposant des spécialités portugaises. On avait commandé avec des amis un menu chacun, comprenant un quart de poulet (à vous de choisir entre une sauce douce et épicé), suivi de frites, à emporter (vous pouvez aussi manger sur place, mais beaucoup de personnes étaient présentes). Service rapide et efficace, on a eu notre menu très vite, pour un total de 10$ il me semble (sans boisson et avec du pain), sur place ou à emporter donc.  Face à nous, des frites excellentes : croustillantes bien comme il faut et fait maison. Mais c'est surtout le poulet qui, avec sa sauce, est un véritable délice ! Autant vous dire qu'on a pas pu finir notre plat tellement il y en avait ! Heureusement que la boîte fait doggy bag, pratique pour le rapporter chez soi !  Pas cher, consistant avec un service rapide. Un conseil : allez-y !"}
{"text":"I was so hungry from not eating all day and would have been pissed off if the food here wasnt good.It was yummy.I loved the chicken,salad and fries(Im not a french fry person).I even likex the dressing on the salad...im picky as hell.Ill be back to sit down and eat.I brought the food home and it reheated nicely but the salad got a bit soggy in transport."}
{"text":"Not as impressive as the lines would have you believe, but it's ridiculously cheap and huge (at least, the amount of fries are)! Hubby and got the half chicken platter to share - half a chicken, small salad, and an insane amount of fries (greasy, heavy, soggy) on top. I like that they give you a little tart to have as dessert! We also purchased a portuguese egg tart which was creamy and sweet and delightful. NOT someplace I'd recommend to go as a tourist as it's more of a grocery store/deli with only 2 tables, but it's good food."}
{"text":"C'est vraiment the place pour le poulet! Vraiment bon, pas cher, et la quantité est énorme! Un conseil : évitez la Poutine et prenez un vrai morceau de poulet!"}
{"text":"This is the best Portuguese restaurant in Montreal. It has a great atmosphere and I love the fact that the chickens are made fresh and so spicy.  I ordered the fries and burger combo and my take out box was so full with their fries which is so delicious!! It's perfect. I'd recommend it to all as it's authentic and give you a great Portuguese fix! In addition, I also had their egg tart which is my fav. Loved it all. No bad reviews on them for sure. I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty much unreal! You walk in, actually, before you even walk in, you can smell the barbeque down the street. You can fully see what the cooks are doing. You can see the food roasting over the open pit.  Incredible eats. The portions are more than enough to fill an average person up. I ordered half a chicken, with salade and frites. It was bursting out of the take out container. AND it the meal comes with a homemade bun. Will definitely need to return to this place for another feed."}
{"text":"Romados was fantastic. Super quick, fresh and clean food. Lots of portion for the price we paid. We paid about $12 dollars for two of us and still couldnt finish all the food. Chicken was really good. Tender and falling apart from the bone and very tasty. It should be must when visiting Montreal :)"}
{"text":"Just insanely good chicken and the poutine is even better. Like (American) Thanksgiving in one dish. Weird reference, I know, but really tasty. Go get cookies at Cafe Neve next door to polish it off."}
{"text":"The best Portuguese chicken in town, period.  If you go during the week, try out the chicken sandwich, it's pretty fantastic but not available on the weekend. :("}
{"text":"So disappointed in my experience today. I've been to Romados several times before when the food was decent with generous portions but today was not their day. First off, if you've bought a Groupon, they don't tell you to first head to the cash to validate it. So we waited in line to order food only to then be told to go line up at the cash before coming back to order our food. Then we go back to the guy prepping the food with our validated Groupon who's fulfilling our order and he hands us a bag of fries. We're hungry, we've been waiting for a while so we start eating them until he says \"no, you don't get fries, only poutine\" and takes it back only to throw the rest in with the large batch of fries for other customers. How DISGUSTING and unhygienic. Finally (to put the cherry on top), we decided at the last minute to take a small bottle of coke instead of the 1.5L water bottle included in our order. The old woman behind the cash literally opens the door and is ready to chase us down the street, which almost gets me run over at this point, and rudely tells me to return the coke that I stole. I explain that I took the coke instead of the water but at this point, the experience had deteriorated to a point of no return. She grabbed the coke, returns it to the fridge, and doesn't even bring me my water. When I ask her for it, she tells me to go get it myself and won't even look at me. Congratulations, you really stopped someone from stealing(!) I will make sure to try every single one of their competitors instead and never return. Word of mouth is a powerful tool and you've just lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I have had their Portuguese rotisserie chicken combo with fries and salad several times now and the taste has always been great.  However their quality is inconsistent making it a hit or miss place. The last time I picked up food for dinner from there, the chicken was undercooked and the skin had a jelly-like texture, which has turned us off this place entirely. The same thing happened to my friend. I hope they work on maintaining their standards as I love their fries and sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Meilleur poulet de Montréal, meilleur rapport qualité/quantité/prix! Belle illustration de la richesse et de la diversité de Montréal, du QC et du Canada!!"}
{"text":"Romados has some of the best chicken I have ever eaten. When I think about Montreal I think about Romados. They're synonymous. It's that good. Combined with the fact that their sides are also the bomb, this is easily one of my favourite spots in the city.  You're probably thinking a 1/4 chicken meal wouldn't suffice a hungry stomach, but Romados gives you a ridiculous amount of sides, and good ones to boot.  Their chicken was incredibly juicy and the skin with a reasonable crispiness. The chicken was on the saltier side but that's where all the flavor is. You can also taste many spices and it's amazing. They give you their chicken 'gravy/spicy sauce/oil' which is heavenly when you dip just about anything in it. The fries, the rice, and the chicken, and the result is a flavor explosion.  The fries were full of garlicky and herby goodness although they weren't the same as the last time I had them which were the clean hand-cut fries. Regardless, they were crispy and delicious. The salad was a necessary component, and the rice was perfect. I really appreciate that they give you all these sides (including a bread roll). It just completes the meal experience.  All this for around $10 tax included. How is this possible?!"}
{"text":"THE BEST CHICKEN I HAVE EVER TASTED!!!  If I were on death row, this would be my last meal request...  The fries are amazingly good, the salad is tasty and the chicken is delectable! Fall off the bone, perfectly spiced with some form of piri-piri sauce, it may be very salty, but totally worth it...!!!  Prepared fresh, you see the chickens preparing, cooking, waiting, and being cut and served to you. There is no guess work as to where your food comes from or what is being done to it!!!  Extremely affordable, quick service (but be prepared to wait around 15 minutes anyways...there are always people!) I wish they had more tables so we could enjoy this at a more leisurely pace. If you get a spot, be kind and don't dilly-dally, there are people who are waiting to eat!!!  Excellent custard tarts (pasteis de nata) and I;m sure everything else is great as well. I will never go to another Portuguese chicken place so long as Romados is around..."}
{"text":"You can get more than portugese rotisserie chicken here: There is a bakery, patisserie, deli...  My sister and i shared a 1/2 chicken  combo And got an extra helping of fries! Seasoning in general was heavy handed. We needed more than one drink. Some pieces were extra salty while other pieces were fine. The chicken was moist and flavourful with some charring. Spicy oil was poured on chicken. It gave the chicken a subtle spicy flavour that was like a slow burn, not very hot though. The Salad wass small and drenched with dressing. The food was made ready and Warmed up. The salt and pepper fries were naturally cut."}
{"text":"The chicken, the chicken. I know everyone in Montreal is gaga over the Portuguese style chicken here which is flame broiled and shellacked in a savory basting sauce. It's then served with garnish portion of a salad and a mountain of pomme frites (French fries for you anglophones). For $8, it's a meal that can possibly serve two.   While the chicken was great and one can't go wrong with too many fries, the real winner for me was the nata pastries they serve here. Flakey cups of puffed pastry filled with caramelized rich custard. Delish! I was even willing to forgive the guy at the counter who excused my nervous broken French with \"Bro, I speak English\" after one bite of these delights."}
{"text":"Did not disappoint! Had poulet frites avec salade; tre bien! Ok my French is weak but the food was not! The chicken was moist and the sauce was just the right amount of savory and spicy. I had the rice (passed on the fries as I had A LOT of poutine recently - that said the frites looked very good) with my chicken. As a first time visitor to Montreal, I was told by friends to visit Romados; you guys did a great job! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow, the reviews did not disappoint! The chicken here is charred perfectly while being tender, and adding the spicy oil on top takes it to another level. Goes perfectly with rice! Good value for the price...will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Romados used to be this great Portuguese chicken store but lately the quality of the food has been very unstable. Sometimes, I will get a nicely grilled very flavourful chicken, sometimes, the chicken lacks seasoning and sometimes, the chicken is way too salty. However, I am glad to that their portion size are just as huge.   Romans is a decent place to grab a quick dinner. However, if you are looking for the best Portuguese chicken, I would suggest ma poule mouille down on couple of blocks on rachel."}
{"text":"Romados has started doing delivery service and it's not amazing.  I love their food (I wish I could love their sauce, but it has gluten in it) but Romados is really awful if it isn't fresh.   My fries came cold with a lukewarm chicken carcass.  Dry and inedible.  Maybe you should stick to in-store or figure out your takeout containers!"}
{"text":"MUST try. Famous Portuguese chicken spot. The chicken was amazing. Some of the best I've had. The fries were seasoned with salt and pepper and were really good. The dressing on the salad was also really good. 2 1/4 leg dinners with water and 2 buns for $20. Very affordable. Their natage must be very popular because they sold out."}
{"text":"Too many other places beat this one (such as Sparta). Fries was perfect 5/5, chicken 3.5/5."}
{"text":"Yum and a great deal!!  Finger licking good chicken!  And give the Portuguese egg tart a try!  The super flaky crust with rich custard filling was delicious!"}
{"text":"J'ai appris l'existence de Romados le lendemain de l'incendie en janvier 2013 et depuis ce temps j'avais hâte dy a?ler. C'est fait et ils ont dépassé mes attentes. Meilleur poulet grillé et meilleures frites en ville."}
{"text":"Update - I returned after 5 years. It's still the same deal: plenty of fries, chicken, and a homeopathic dose of salad. But that's OK. You're not going there if you're vegetarian or on diet."}
{"text":"Poulet: Piquant. Cuit aux charbons; cuisson toujours parfaite. Tendre. Excellent! Sauce de cuisson...miam!!   Poutine au poulet: la sauce est excellente. Vraiment très rassasiant!"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken for the price your paying ... Always a line up in there so you cannot be in a hurry when going there"}
{"text":"I firmly believe that this would be a top chicken experience for anyone who tries it. Fries are excellent. Chorizo is good not great. Custard pastry was top notch as well. Get there early, order a chicken and enjoy. Definitely roll."}
{"text":"very good place for roast chicken,  half chicken combo is enough for two person. The price is also very good. I will try their other food next time."}
{"text":"Wow. I've never seen reviews like this! And I believe they are deserved. You can eat yourself into yummy obesity for only 10$ a day!"}
{"text":"Hi everyone ! Here goes my  first review... I am a big foodie and my craving for spicy Indian style grilled chicken brought me to Ramados ( after extensive search online - Portuguese chicken). I ordered a half grilled chicken (spicy) for a take away. I was really surprised to see the large portion of fries with the three large pieces of chicken. The meat was falling off the bone and had all the flavors. The fries and the salad soaked in those flavors gave an added taste. Really tasty and absolutely delicious. Reasonable pricing.  Though I would prefer more spice in the chicken but I have no complaints. I loved the food. I would surely visit them again."}
{"text":"Portuguese Rotisserie Chicken from Ramados on Rue Rachel. I'll admit I don't know much about Portuguese food, but their thighs are LEGIT. Thighs and Fries, you can't go wrong.  I still dream about the seasoning on their fries, and would drive the 7 hours north just for a nibble."}
{"text":"We were starved by the time we got here. The smell permeates the cold, winter air at least a block away from the entrance. You walk in and you see pastries to the right and a nice selection of beverages on the left. Rarely, do I see Guarana being sold in a large bottle, so I was already knew I would love this place once I saw that. There was always a line, but it moved fast.  I'm sad that I missed out on the rice. That would have been great with the chicken. I went w/ the quarter thigh combo. The chicken is so tender and the skin is thin and crispy. The flavor was great and solid throughout the whole piece. I only regret not getting a whole chicken lol. At the counter, they'll brush the chicken off w/ either spicy or hot. I opted for the former and it wasn't that spicy, but still good. Haha the salad I found funny because it literally gets overshadowed by the excess of fries on top."}
{"text":"This review is for the chicken (I'm a big protein fan). I wish this was in NYC. The chicken was moist, perfect spices, and the hot sauce had a good amount of heat. If you want more heat, ask for more sauce.   Surprisingly, the side salad that came with it was perfect to cool off the heat from the hot sauce on the chicken.   Fries were good, but I can't say I remember too much about it.   Service is fast and the place really seems more for take-out or eat and run. Use your fingers when eating this chicken and eat everything off the bone.   I didn't try the pastries, but maybe next time when I return to Montreal.   Simple (protein) food, decent price.. I can't find anything wrong with that."}
{"text":"As far as portuguese chicken goes in Montreal, this is definitely my go-to place. I usually take it out since it is not the greatest restaurant to it at. Even though I've tried a bunch of place in Portugal, this is still my top place. The waiting line is usually not bad, employees are usually friendly, and it is perfect to bring back at home and enjoy with a cold beer."}
{"text":"What hasn't been said? Nothing. Simply great chicken at a great price. There is a line for a reason. Every time we come the husband gets a half chicken and I get the sandwich. The half chicken is a massive amount of food and the tiny salad hidden under the fries is hilarious. The chicken is tender and the spice is perfect. Making conversation with the cooks is easy and well worth it. Small seating area so if you go as a duo, scout one for a table and one for the food."}
{"text":"Great traditional  chicken  ! if you take the full plate, prepare to get full for a very decent price. Get the potatoes on the side and the spicy sauce. Wish they were more generous with the spicy sauce!"}
{"text":"Some call chicken \"the tuna of the turf.\" I don't, and I tend to avoid those people at social events. They have names for everything and it gets annoying. Where's the boy's room? \"The Throne Zone\" is upstairs. \"The Piss Palace\" is down the hall. Ugh, shut up.  That said, I call Rotisserie Romados \"the purveyor of the single greatest roasted chicken dinner I have ever had in my entire life, based on my level of hunger, state of sobriety and availability of Five Alive juice drink.\"  From the millisecond we stepped through the front door, the unreal aroma of those no-longer-egg-laying, piri-slathered, fire-kissed birds and fresh baked bread had us throwing 'bows to skip the line. In our minds, anyway. Other Yelpers talk about the pastry counter that tempts the poultry patrons, but I cannot comment. I wanted - nay, NEEDED - chiggin.  A mere 15 minutes and 18$ CAD later, we're presented with Styrofoam go-boxes overstuffed with tender white and dark meat, a mountain of crispy crinkle-cut fries and a surprisingly fresh salad of mixed greens tossed in a light (mustard?) vinaigrette. We sat, transfixed. I took a picture of chicken for the first time ever. We ate. My soul took a picture of chicken for the first time ever.  Remember those people that name everything? They might also be the type to talk about fleeing the States in times of political strife. \"Can you believe Congress?,\" they'll say, \"That's it. I'm moving to Canada.\" Whatever. Rotisserie Romados, though? Totally worth revoking your US citizenship.  Did I mention they have Five Alive in a can? The Québecois need to adopt me, stat. I'll do windows!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Romados is Romados, and even after I've gotten their roast chicken multiple times during my studies here, I never get tired of them. My go-to order is the half roast chicken combo with salad and fries, and they always give you so much for what you pay for. It's impossible for your mouth to NOT water while the wafts of savory, juicy chicken reach your olfactory receptors. And once you bite into it - my personal favorite parts are the legs and thighs as I think breast meat is somewhat bland - the collective harmony of crispy and peppery skin, spicy sauce, and bone-licking good meat all seems to make sense. Served superbly with a fresh salad and vinaigrette along with crispy, yet soft-on-the-inside fries, it will always be a hit. I can never pick between Ma Poule Mouillée and this place as they both hit the spot. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went twice in two days with my wife, once for dinner and once for lunch. On both occasions we shared the 1/2 chicken combo, which was filling for the two of us. The chicken was a little dry when we went for dinner but still enjoyable. Great value and great taste."}
{"text":"finally I went to Romados with my friend who were visiting Montreal from Toronto. \"It's really famous and really good.\" this is what I told him. we really like the huge amount of frites and delicious chicken and the salad.  I would love to visit again, when it's not crowded!"}
{"text":"I am blessed to be near the best Portugeuse and Azorean food one can find, but this experience has not been found in the 02116 surrounding area yet!  You go here for the chicken and the chicken, and the chicken....and the sauce on the chicken.  Oh, and those fabulous petite custard pies that they throw in your bag!  Opens up for Lunch at 11.30 a.m.  We got a whole chicken, rice, fries, salad and drinks for about $20 CAD.  Picnic over in Mt. Royal= Life is good!  I will be looking forward to going here again le prochain temps je serai en Montreal!"}
{"text":"Love the Portuguese chicken here. My husband and I each got half a chicken with spicy sauce and fries with poutine sauce drizzled on top. The chicken was very flavorful and juicy. The fries had a good texture, not too soggy and loved the poutine sauce. The sauce was not too heavy.  The line is out the door here so expect a wait. Additionally, not a lot of seating room so get your food to go. There is a nice park a couple blocks down and we ate our meal there.  There is also a bakery but they give you so much food, we did not get any dessert."}
{"text":"Best deal in the plateau. Get the half or quarter chicken plate. The chicken is juicy and they fill your box to the top with fries. I swear the woman who serves you is a saint. Call ahead to avoid the line. Also if you go before two it comes with free dessert."}
{"text":"This place is good. I mean who doesn't love chicken. I got the dark meat. I just wish the chicken had a crisper skin and the sauce had more spice to it. The fries were very salty in my opinion. They were super salty, and I love salt. Maybe whoever was making them was a bit heavy handed with the salt shaker this time around, I don't know. I also wish there was either more of the sauce for the fries or some other condiments. It's still a good restaurant. They move through orders fast. They have a good system down. There is not a lot of seating here by the way, but if you've got hankering for chicken, you'll still probably enjoy it."}
{"text":"Dropped by here during a lunch a few weeks back.  Let's be honest. The chicken in this place is probably the best you'll probably get in Montreal. It's tender, juicy and flavorful and comes with side orders that are equally impressive.  I need to visit this place someday soon with friends and experience it all again.  The price tag? Completely reasonable and in fact, another attraction to come eat at this fine establishment.  The service is about as solid as it gets.  If you have never eaten at Romados... why are you depriving yourself such an experience?"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch during our Montreal trip. It wasn't too busy on a Tuesday afternoon thankfully so we got our food quickly and found some open seats. Their seating is limited but there is a park nearby so that wouldn't have been a bad idea to take it to go and eat there. We got the half chicken which came with so much fries. The chicken was seasoned so well and the sauce is very good. I thought the half chicken was more than enough to share between two people."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best rotisserie chicken in Montreal. Being Portuguese this says a lot. When I lived in Montreal I loved coming here. It has an authentic atmosphere and no frills attitude. Get your chicken, eat here or get out. Done. Its one of the places I miss the most."}
{"text":"Yes the chicken is good...great even. But what they excel in food, they more than lack in service. As I mustered up the courage to order in French, the guy behind the counter asked for our order in English. Great, I thought. But he kept questioning our order in a dismissive, impatient tone (1/2 chicken + 2-person salad), and ultimately gave us a whole chicken - a mistake I didn't realize till the cashier rang up over $20.   We accepted the mistake, chalked it up to bad communication on our part. But then were told cash/Canadian debit only. \"Well, we COULD take credit card if you don't have enough cash,\" she said, while watching me fumble for cash.   Why the rule of cash/debit if you're wiling to concede? More importantly, why no sign of \"cash/debit only\" anywhere? (I looked - none in English or French) Meanwhile, the cashier turned to her colleague, rolled her eyes, and chuckled her look-at-these-dumb-tourists chuckle. How un-Canadian! ... I can say this because I'm Canadian, and we'd experienced great service everywhere else in Montreal as tourists.  I came up 65 cents short in cash, apologized, and thought she'd simply let it go given the total amount. But she stared at me, shrugged, and repeated \"cash or debit card only.\" No mention of credit card this time.   We gave up a drink to reduce the bill, and bought the whole chicken - the leftover of which still tasted good the next day, but not enough to rid of the sour taste left in our mouths."}
{"text":"HM not quite sure if i went on a bad day..but my chicken was SOOOOOO salty and therefore the poutine i ordered was salty as well because they put the same chicken on top. I couldnt finish it.   The only thing i would give 5 stars to is their egg custard pies..they were DELICIOUS! i went back later that day just for another."}
{"text":"Would give them 1 star but that's not fair as I'm obviously in a hole in the wall joint and shouldn't expect a gourmet meal... So this review is solely based on the fries and service. I ordered a small fry to go and noticed they scooped the fries out of a metal bowl that wasn't even being heated.. The fries were dry and barely warm. I requested gravy but they said they didn't offer it except for with poutine?!?!  But I don't really eat dairy so I just wanted gravy and would pay extra.. Nope they refused to sell me gravy.   I only had a few bites as the fries were dry and then when I got home (TMI sorry) I rushed to the bathroom. I guess my system rejected this crap.  PS- no A/C during 33 degree weather.  My tip to you: Go here when it's busy and make sure there's a bathroom nearby."}
{"text":"No doubt the best Portuguese chicken in Montreal. The chicken is grilled to perfection. The meat is moist and tender, not to mention juicy. Served on heap of golden crispy  fries. I can go on and on about how good the chicken is, but there are almost 150 plus reviews about it. Another thing no one here mentioned are the chouriço's. They are really good. Spicy sausage Portuguese style.  Lines are REALLY long, but they move fast. You place your order, pick it up and go to the cash register and pay by Cash or Debit. No credit cards accepted. Did I mention the food here is very cheap??? And yes, Their Nata's are good too.But you have to visit this place mainly for their chicken.   P.S. : Definitely NOT a good place to visit if you are Chicken    Food -  Really Good Service - Fast Ambiance -  What Ambiance??? Worth the money - Sí"}
{"text":"The chicken is tasty but my review is mainly focused on the packaging received during delivery. We ordered a delivery directly from Romados; 4 chickens, fries and salad with extra sauce. They charged us for the additional sauce and for the delivery (which they notified us about ahead of time). We were shocked by what we received! It was a big deception! When opening the bag, there was sauce everywhere specially the extra sauce. Additionally, the bag in which the chicken came, got perforated and the chicken fell out of it. They fell everywhere. That's really unprofessional! Specially from a restaurant that has years of experience. They don't care about the packaging. When you are charged extra, your expectations are higher."}
{"text":"Meilleur sandwich au poulet jamais goûté. Les frites sont toutes aussi excellentes, le tout pour moins de 10$. Si Romados est recommandé par Anthony Bourdain dans The Layover - Montréal, ce n'est pas pour rien!"}
{"text":"Not sure how we found out about this place, but I am definitely glad that we did! It was absolutely amazing and worth the trek.   For $10, you get 1/2 portuguese bbq chicken, a salad, rice, a mountain of french fries and a dinner roll. Definitely enough food for two hungry tummies!   We're not the spicy food type, so when she asked if we wanted it spicy we were quick to say no! I kid you not, she gave us a look as if we were weenies :[ so we hesitantly changed our minds and asked for it spicy. Let me tell you that sauce is phenomenal, it would not have been the same without it! Its vinegary and sweet with just enough kick. By the end of the meal, we were soaking up the spicy sauce with our fries just to make sure we didn't waste a drop of it. The fries are delicious on their own. just the right seasoning.  Such a great deal for a great amount of delicious chicken and fries heaven! I wish they had a place like this in LA.   I must warn you though, its a small corner establishment. Not much room to sit and eat. So do figure out other places you can park it and enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"This place serves crack -- in the form of rotisserie chicken and french fries. This is easily the best combo of the two that you can get on Planet Earth. No joke."}
{"text":"Quite simply: Kick-ass Portuguese chickens.  Get the spicy Peri-peri sauce!  The fries are a tasty side dish.  Great value!  Be prepared to wait in line, but it's worth it, and you can peruse the pastries behind the counter to buy some dessert or breakfast for the next day.  Perfect for the first night in our vacation apartment, when we weren't ready to cook or go out to a nice restaurant yet.  Will return this summer!"}
{"text":"Chicken lovers beware! This place got one of the best bbq portuguese chicken in Montreal!!! Price is great, service is fast and it will fill you up! The staff is just amazing over there! Always happy to serve you!"}
{"text":"Hot restaurant served hot food but cold tart.... It seemed to be lined up all the time because the price was very reasonable for such large portion of chicken. I had 1/4 chicken with half rice and half fries(Thank the friendly staff for meeting my requirements :) . But honestly, I expected to taste much flavourful chicken not just salty. Even all the side dishes, salad, rice and fries are better than chicken. The bread was good but the tart was not crisp at all!! The cold stuffing was too sweet. So, I only can give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"About a 2-2.5: Romados is a Portuguese bakery and grilled chicken place that is considered to offer one of the best grilled chicken in the city of Montreal.  The menu offers different parts of the chicken as family packs or as combos, coming with a bed of rice, fries, a side of salad, as well as a large bread.  You can opt for the chicken to be 'spicy' or 'regular,' which is a brushing of a sauce.  The hubs and I shared a 1/4 white-meat chicken combo, which came with a breast and thigh.  I was slightly disappointed, as the chicken itself didn't look like how many had described it to be, with the skin being nice and crisp.  It was definitely juicy, but it was lacking in the flavors, as even the 'sauce' didn't help much.  I'm sure you could request for some extra sauce on the side or some extra brushing, but I wasn't much of a fan of the sauce any way.  The bread, I didn't care for, as it was pretty dry.  Service was super friendly, and there's limited seats within.  Just note that there are 2 lines - one for walk-ins (on the left), and one for call-aheads (on the right).   +friendly staff +complimentary bread with meal +juicy chicken, but still flavorless (?)"}
{"text":"I ordered the quarter chicken breast with fries -- simple and delicious. I want to say that the fries were perhaps the best I've ever had. They were perfectly seasoned hand cut fries --some very crisp and others pillowy in texture. The seasoning on the chicken was great. I thought the chicken could have been a bit juicier. That's my only critique. If you're looking for a big meal that will keep you full all day (and for a good price) this is the place."}
{"text":"The chicken is so juicy and moist.  Amazing.  Was not disappointed even after reading the reviews.   Also, the fries were perfectly crispy and even more perfect with the chicken jus."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Super moist and fresh chicken and good prices. You should be aware that fries for 2 is literally enough for 6 people so go hungry."}
{"text":"My second time eating here and this time I tried their poutine, the chicken and the poutine were delicious! My friends fell in love with this place and it was their first time eating poutine and they screamed out more poutine on our way back to New Haven! Craving for more delicious chicken & poutine from this place!!!  Be aware they do not take credit card. Cash or Debit only!"}
{"text":"Well, nothing's perfect. On the one hand, the food here is consistently delicious and cheap; the kind of feel-good food you treat yourself to on a weekend or a busy weeknight. You've seen the reviews.  On the other hand, ordering from here is a huge pain. Ordering in advance serves no real purpose (I've ended up waiting longer than the walk-ins every time) and the line system is confusing and poorly laid out. For instance, there's a reason every fast food place ever has you order and pay at the start : it avoids the type of checkout bottleneck that is at this point a staple of Romados. Another annoyance is the two side-by-side order lines with no divider; a solution that would be much more elegant and effective than 3 different signs above and below customers' line of sight (cue arguments with other patrons). And another: no credit card and no paywave payments make payment unnecessarily slow every time. I could go on.  But when all is said and done, the chicken is so good that I still end up braving the crowds and coming here nearly once a week. Problem is, Romados' management knows it, too."}
{"text":"It was an amazing experience to try Portuguese cuisine in Montreal. We had the chicken and fries. Their menu is thin but they are all delicious food nonetheless. Their bakery have few different tarts authentic style for Portugal. A must try place!"}
{"text":"The Portuguese chicken from this place is fantastic. If you go with one of their combos, you get a large serving of chicken and fries with a side salad. I ordered a chicken sandwich with spicy oil on the bun. Everything was delicious, though the place itself wasn't very welcoming with very little seating."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot , the chicken had a lot of flavor and I added spicy sauce . The rice was mediocre, fries crispy and not greasy at all . They also sell pasties for a nice dessert !"}
{"text":"Portuguese chicken!! BEST. AMAZING. OUT IF THIS WORLD. SUCCULENT. And on and on and on.   This place came up when I did a general search on things to do, see and eat in Montreal before leaving. Bookmarked. Also came up, while on the Mile End Food Tour.   This was my first soirée with Portuguese chicken, so I had no idea what was entailed. The place doesn't have much seating, but that didn't seem to deter the long line of faithful locals.   Got here around 7:30, and they had a few massive orders before us in line, so it took about 30-35 minutes from front door to table. No, there's no waitress. Seating is free-for-all.   We saw how monstrous the servings were, so we went with one 1/4 dark meat chicken meal and a quarter piece extra. The meal combo has a massive heaping pile of fresh made French fries that were seasoned so perfectly, I had to remind myself to slow down and really savor the flavors.   And the Portuguese seasoned chicken? Yeah, it was unbelievable!! It's roasted over flames on a caged spitfire rotation. And this is the whole dang thing roasted. None of the proportioned crap. The whole enchilada. They slide the puppies off, then BAM BAM BAM! The chicken is chopped into pieces right in front of the patrons using super sharp knifes. They do it in about 4-5 loud bangs. They bast on there special liquid seasoned rub, and end of story. Done.   Chicken portions are put in styrofoam to-go container based on what you ordered (no plates and metal silverware). Chicken put in first. Then a hujass clump of fresh hot fries cover the gobble-gobble, along with the side salad and dressing in the small corner compartment. Container closed, and your handed your boxes to take to the register to pay.   The whole chicken chopping process is pretty cool. And everything is made right in front of you, so no questionable practices. I absolutely, positively can't wait to go back. One of the top meals I've had in my life!"}
{"text":"If I had to base this review just on the chicken, it'd be 4 stars.  The chicken is indeed phenomenal, and the hot sauce and fries are pretty good too, but the rice is pretty bland and dry, and I wasn't a fan of the pastry that came with the meal either.  As far as a value meal goes, for $8 you get a ton of food.  Stick to the chicken and you'll be just fine here."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch and we thought of Romados. This place is packed at all times (I'm not a fan of eating at the restaurant cause it's not always the cleanest)  We ordered the half chicken plate, asked if we could exchange the fries for more salad but they said no.  1. I don't think this place understands the concept of too much. I almost experienced 'death by fries'. I can't imagine someone would be able to eat that much fries. I literally had to dig for my chicken in the plate  2. I liked the chicken, it was however dipped in the chili oil. The portions were too big.  I probably wouldn't go to this place again, cause I feel it's not worth the wait.  However, price wise it is very reasonable.  The salad is very basic, nothing special.   Do not recommend this to others, unless you feel fries is life.   P.S- some of us are trying really hard to be healthy, let us switch salad for fries! (Just saying )"}
{"text":"A must go place in the plateau! The chicken with spicy sauce(which isn't that spicy) is definitely one of the best chickens I've had. They load up your plate with more fries than you can eat and some of them end up soaking up the spicy sauce, which turn out to be the best ones.  If you're getting it with someone else, you can get a half chicken with fries and there will be plenty for both! Also I know that their combos are salads, fries and chicken but you can also ask to get just chicken and fries and end up with more fries.  I live in the area and always end up going at least once a month if not more!"}
{"text":"This is the best Portuguese chicken in MONTREAL. This is the best Portuguese chicken in QUEBEC. This is the best Portuguese chicken in CANADA.  Oh, the Portuguese tarts are rather awesome as well :)"}
{"text":"One of Montreal's finest rotisseries. Their secret family recipe is divine. And it's so cheap. Should you want to bring home a family meal, grab a chicken or porc sandwich with fries, or taste some traditional Portuguese pastries, Romados is the place to go. Just be aware that you may have to brave a serious lineup."}
{"text":"Even an ever-mooching girlfriend couldn't help me finish the cavernous bed of fries on which my amazingly spicy pork lay, and all that for a mere 8 bucks! Go during off-hours when it's quick."}
{"text":"Romados have redeemed themselves. My wife was at the church (Santa Cruz) a week ago and decided to give them another chance. The chicken, although small, was spot on and tasted like the usual excellent flavor - their fries were also delicious. That one bad experience last year with quality must have been a one-off."}
{"text":"Après avoir mangé plusieurs fois à Ma Poule Mouillé je me suis tenté à Romados.  On est sur le même principe au niveau des plats. Je trouve juste qu'il y a moins de choix que à Ma Poule Mouillé. On est principalement que sur du poulet, pas de plat mixant poulet et chorizo. Le poulet est très bon et la sauce bien goûteuse. C'est sensiblement le même prix. Il est possible de commander par téléphone et de venir chercher et aussi de prendre à emporter.  Je dirais que c'est une valeur sur en rôtisserie portugaise. Vous ne serez pas déçu de manger un bon morceau de poulet en y allant !"}
{"text":"Order the 1/2 chicken with fries and salad. It was good but the sauce they added was just oil. The bottom of the container was full of oil.  It was delicious though."}
{"text":"There's some really good chicken places in Montreal, but Romados might be my new favorite. When we grabbed an Uber from the hotel, our driver said we're going to a good spot, so that's a plus. My original plan was to go to Coco Rico, but they're \"only\" 4 stars and Romados was 4.5*, so I figured I'd try a new place. So glad I did!  There wasn't much of a line when we showed up, and I think we were lucky. Guy at the counter was friendly, letting us try the spicy sauce for the fries to make sure it wasn't too spicy for him. We ended up splitting a half chicken and a small poutine and it was plenty for us. Cash only, but both dishes came out to under $20 I believe.  Seriously this chicken is amazing, and makes me wish we had better chicken shops like this in San Diego. I guess I have to head back to Montreal with haste!"}
{"text":"Very good price for quality , although the dish is not beautiful and french fries look messy but it IS delicious. Yummy."}
{"text":"So I wander into this Portuguese chicken joint (after some Yelping) for a late breakfast and stand in line as I watch the chickens on the rotisserie.  I see the big takeout containers and I'm hungry so I order the 1/2 chicken combo for a whopping ~$10 - which comes with a boatload of fries, rice and salad and spicy sauce on the chicken.  For some reason, they also threw in a dessert tart and a dinner roll at the cashier station - I must have nodded at some prompt when I wasn't really paying attention.  (I do that often...)  I think I paid a total of $13 with a pop.  With my chicken box in hand - I realized my first error.  This tiny space had no more 'real' seats with tablespace.  So I walk over to the little mini-bench, give PersianDude a nod, he shuffles over and I squat down beside him and we both each chicken off our laps.  For some reason, this somehow enhanced the experience.  Don't know why.  First off - the amount of food you get is huge.  Take a look at my pictures.  The fries are damned good and are completely mounded on top of the chicken.  It took a good 5 - 10 minutes of eating and maneuvering before I got to the chicken.  The chicken is delicious and moist - wished the sauce was spicier but this was damned good roasted chicken.  Seriously - I should have probably stopped eating about 1/3 the way through because I was just full of fries and chicken grease.  This is coming from a fat bastard.  But I watched PersianDude demolish his chickenbox and I didn't want to spend the rest of my day carrying a box of chicken with me.  So I willed my way through the chicken - it was good but if I was to cry, chicken grease would have came out of my eyes.  After about 40 minutes of focused eating, I polished my box off.  I threw the dinner roll which had a density of a hockey puck away and wrapped up my dessert tart.  I didn't know it at the time - but this chicken box at 11AM was the last thing I would eat for 24 hours.  Fast forward to 10AM the next morning and waking up hungry from a night of drinking, I rediscover the dessert tart on my nightstand.  Wow - Romados - you know me better than I know myself."}
{"text":"Romados c'est ma place!!! Le poulet, les frites, la salade... Je salive juste à y penser :-P  Petit conseil d'amie, la file est toujours bien longue, alors soyez prévoyant et appelez pour réserver... Comme ça, pas d'attente!!! Vous e remercierez plus tard!"}
{"text":"I was told to eat two things while visiting Montreal: bagels (from whoever your allegiance is to) and portuguese chicken from Romados. This was probably the juiciest chicken I have ever eaten, and it was perfectly paired with bread. I literally teared up."}
{"text":"I found this place here on Yelp and it did not disappoint.  I was a little confused at first because I didn't realize this place was not a typical sit down style restaurant.  I came with a group of 4 people and we had to split up in two's to eat.  If we would have know in advance, we would have planned it different.    Nonetheless, the chicken was delicious.  The meat just fell off the bone and it had the just right kind of spiciness to it.  It was definitely some of the best barbecue chicken I've ever had.  The sauce on the chicken made the fries that come with it much better too.  They were just sitting in the juices and the sauce adding flavor the perfectly done fries.  The price was pretty reasonable as well.  If I lived here, I would definitely visit this place often."}
{"text":"The line moves quick and the chicken is delicious, perfect, moist, magique. The hot sauce is important. The pieces of meat are quickly cleavered for you as they are taken off the grill when you order so watchout for little bits of bone.  Order in advance to skip the big line and walk right up to the counter on the left hand side. Natas are one of my favourite foods ever so I always grab some of those as well. The staff are funny and at least trilingual, the Portuguese patter keeps the place running and I love seeing the patient smile when the old folks come in."}
{"text":"Don't let the line up scare you, it moves quicker than it looks. This is hands down the best chicken you'll find in Montreal. The poutine is great, and boy I'm glad they now do delivery. The staff are nice which is surprising considering the volume they deal with. NOTE: Have your order ready by the time you arrive to the front, otherwise the crowd of people behind you might string you up by your toes. It doesn't matter what you order on the menu, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Incredible! Chicken is fantastic. So tasty! Their chicken poutine is absolutely fantastic. Deserts are great too.  Custard pies are excellent. Prices are incredibly reasonable. Everyone should try this place"}
{"text":"What happened? This place used to be so good! Now it's not really worth going all the way to the plateau for it. Ever since the fire the taste and quality has gone downhill. There are 2 sauces now that don't taste anywhere near as good as the old sauce. Also they have changed the fries, they're more like McCain super fries now. Not great and there's very little seasoning on them as there was before."}
{"text":"Meilleur poulet portugais à Montréal. Les frites sont délicieuses. A deux, on commande le demi poulet avec extra sauce piquante à côté. On peut acheter leurs épices piri piri pour cuisiner chez soi: j'en mets sur le pop corn c'est vraiment bon !"}
{"text":"Romados has amazing Portuguese \"crack\" chicken as well as desserts all at an excellent price point. Cuisse 1/4 combo comes with a big piece of dark meat (leg/thigh) and a side salad and ton of fries.  The restaurant has a divey vibe and is great for a quick dinner with friends or family or even takeaway because it is a lot of food for your money.  I recommend Romados, especially the chicken with the spicy oil marinade."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. If food was cheap but really heavy so it wouldn't be a place I would come very often.  Service wise, it's food court style. You place order, pay, grab food when it's ready then find a table or take it home."}
{"text":"Sorry, but i really don't get it. The chicken is greasy and the fries so-so. It's like the Portuguese-style junk food. I would not recommend it.  Clean place and nice people though."}
{"text":"Two visits in one trip pretty much sums up how much I enjoyed Romados. The thing I love about this is the chicken first of all and you get a complete meal for a very reasonable price.   Let's start with the chicken. The chicken is marinated in their special blend of Portuguese goodness. It's then butterflied onto their rotisserie racks which is cooked slowly over a open flame. While the racks turn, the fat renders from the chicken and juices from the chicken drips onto the neighboring racks causing each chicken to base it it's own juice. This process keeps the chicken from staying moist and tender.   To order the process is quite simple. You can either order the chicken by itself or combo meal which come with fries, rice, small salad, and roll. The chicken comes in the following sizes, from 1/4, 1/2, to full, and spicy or not. If you order 1/4 chicken, you can either request leg or breast. The fries are enough for 2 to 4 skinny people or 2 fat people. In other words, they give you a lot of fries. The fries are piled on the whole plate covering everything so you have to dig through the fries to get to the chicken. The rice is not so great. It doesn't have much flavor and pretty dry for my taste. The side salad is pretty much that, a side salad topped with their dressing.  In addition to having great chicken they also have a variety of baked goods. I do not know the name of these wonderful delights, but the egg custard thing was awesome. It reminded me of the the Chinese version that I see at dim sum and Asian bakeries. I also had their chocolate eclairs. I'm guessing it's more of a french thing than Portuguese, however the eclairs were delicious. Each eclair cost 1 Canadian dollar. Normally you find eclairs for 3x as much and much smaller.   Seating is very limited, but from my experience, it seems like most people order their food to go."}
{"text":"A Portuguese chicken staple that I love and frequented often back in the good 'ol days. I haven't been back to Romados since they had a fire but I like the upgrades they've done to their place since then. There's a couple spots to eat in now although it would be nice if they had expanded on that more.  We came on a Wednesday after the lunch rush so there wasn't a lineup at all, a beautiful thing. The menu is small but there's actually more options than I thought. Honestly, I've only ever ordered the chicken combos.  - 4x 1/2 chicken, fries and salad ($9.85) - the 1/2 chicken combo with comes with a mountain of fries, side salad and rice. They also throw in a white bun. Anyways, what to say about the Portuguese chicken? Delicious. ENSURE you get the spicy sauce because it makes all the difference in the world.  - Natas ($13.00 for a dozen) - no trip is legit without an order (or dozen) of natas. It's $1.45/each but gets cheaper the more you buy. So light, flaky and creamy.  It's hard to pick a favourite Portuguese place in town these days but I'll end with saying Romados is cheap, filling and satisfyingly good."}
{"text":"We ate here 3 times during our 6-day visit, and for good reason! The chicken sandwich is amazing. The answer to \"Spicy?\" is a clear & resounding \"YES.\" The fries are ridiculously good; even the salad was delicious! Don't be put off by the seemingly long line--it moves fast and is well worth the wait.  In my opinion, this was the best value in Montreal."}
{"text":"Excellence nourriture n'égale pas toujours à un bon service à la clientèle. 2h pour la livraison..."}
{"text":"A cold snowy night in Montreal and the most important question pops up....what do we eat?! My friend suggested we take out from Romados so we did. I will admit, I wasn't too excited for just chicken, but omg it was so worth it. We split a meal of a whole chicken, fries and salad. The salad was huge and I swear the fries were never ending and they were REALLY good fries too! The chicken was moist and spicy and so delicious, I now dream of it."}
{"text":"Often imitated rarely (but many places are trying) duplicated. Romados is the benchmark for Portuguese chicken and fries in Montreal. It's been a while since I've eaten here and can't believe I haven't reviewed it but here we go.   Came here with out of town friends on a Friday night to explain this joint is a staple in Montreal dining. We arrived at near 8PM and the line was almost out the door. I explained to my friends the wait was well worth it. 20 minutes later we were eating delicious tender succulent charcoal grilled chicken. The flavour is really out of this world. The mix of the spicy sauce and grilled flavour is 7th heaven. The fries are light and heaping in serving. Also provided was a small salad. My friends had to try the chicken poutine and it came as a massive serving with a heap of chopped chicken.   Words that come to my mind about Romados:   sublime, delicious, light, flavourful, spice, seasoned, fall off the bone tender, huge portions, tasty awesome and inexpensive!   If you don't eat here you are missing out on one of Montreal's finest dining experiences!"}
{"text":"Came here mid October. It's probably off season for tourists right now so we're lucky to have no wait in line.  Decided to try the Portuguese chicken from here since it had good reviews. We ordered 1/4 chicken combo. The chicken is juicy. The skin was the best. They give a lot of fries (nice & crispy). The food is good but it isn't the best we've had compared to New York food..  Don't expect something fancy. This place is more like a fast food place. The meal comes in a takeout box."}
{"text":"Worth the hype is right... I think this was my highlight of eating in Montreal.  The sauce on the chicken is some kind of flavour explosion.  The portions are huge the atmosphere of get in-get your food- get out is really fun (seriously it's like you're on an episode of seinfeld but the staff are SOOO warm and friendly!!).  There is NO OTHER CHICKEN like this in THE WORLD! YUM! GO!"}
{"text":"It's worth all the hype !! Cheap, delicious, spicy, it can't get any better than Romados.    I don't know what they put in that spicy sauce they have on their chicken, but god damn is it addictive!   Their egg tarts are also excellent but you probably won't have any more space left after you're done with the chicken and huge pile of fries!"}
{"text":"For 9 $ I had half chicken, salad, rice and an insane amount of fries. It's a good option for not too much money"}
{"text":"My first meal in Montreal and this place didn't disappoint.  The address on the door says 123, there isn't another place around but I was a little confused. The chicken meal was huge and I definitely couldn't finish all of the food I had ordered with the half chicken meal. The chicken itself was delicious, particularly the skin and the sauce that came with it. The chicken didn't ruin chicken for me, as there were some pieces that were far less moist than others, but overall, it was a delicious piece of chicken, perfectly complimented by the soft but flavorful french fries."}
{"text":"Chicken was too salty.  Ask for the hot sace.  Though it's oily,  really helps mediate the saltiness of the seasoning.  The combo comes with a small salad, fries (too much), and bread roll.  If you come you must try their Portuguese tarts.  Limited seating. If you can't find any, walk down the street to a public park with benches and enjoy there."}
{"text":"Of all rotisories tasted so far, definitely the best! Take out gives you extremely generous portion of fries/salad to enjoy while taking in the comforts one of the nearby parks or even the mountain ;). Oh! Don't forget to get a few natas for dessert (traditional Portuguese sweet egg tarts) enjoy!"}
{"text":"All Portugese chicken places are born equal, but some are more equal than others.  Get the chicken in any shape or form...if they made chicken smoothies, I am sure I would order them as well."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. They do three things (mostly): chicken, frites, and salad. I think there's also sausage. But they do really good chicken and frites. Salad was mostly onions. We got 1/2 a chicken, fries and salad for 2, plus 2 desserts and a drink for $35. Super quick, not a lot of places to sit down. More to go style. Big bakery case with lots of goodies that are indeed tasty. One of our best meals in Montréal,  especially after we've had so many more expensive misses."}
{"text":"So.  Mindblowingly.  Good.   I don't even like chicken and I'd eat Ramados every single day for the rest of my life if I could. WHAT ARE THEY DOING to this meat?? What is that miraculous basting mixture being slathered over these rotating birds?? Why, after all of this time, am I still craving Ramados??!   The fries are whatever, but the chicken - ohmydearlawdinheaven, the CHICKEN! Seriously, it's so good that when a couple of my friends were debating whether to move from Montreal to Korea, Ramados weighed heavily on their decision. No joke. It's that freaking phantasmagorical.   Don't walk, don't wait, just go - GO to Ramados. And thank the poultry gods for making such a deliciously greasy bird."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Portuguese char-grilled chicken.  I didn't really have any preconceptions; the closest comparison I have is Peruvian chicken a la brassa.  Major differences? The Portuguese chicken tastes like there is wine in the marinade, and the skin is not nearly as crispy.  It also comes drenched in a pretty bland piri piri chili oil rather than being served with flavorful dipping sauces.  The chicken was also a little flabbier than expected, as though the fat needed to render more.  Overall, I liked but didn't love this style.  We sprang for a papo seco (fluffy, crusty Portuguese roll), which was a good call dipped in the chicken drippings. I also enjoyed trying a passion fruit soda -- not something you find every day.  Maybe one day I'll have the chance to try a competitor's chicken to see who best represents."}
{"text":"1 word: delicious!!! The portions are just right & the prices are even better. My bf picked this lil Old Montreal gem & I'm glad he did. He had the 1/2 chicken & I had the 1/4 leg. We had 2 sauce options - he chose spicy & I chose sweet. Amazing!!! Each option came with fries (the sauce was added to that as well) and salad. Both our meal with 2 sparkling pineapple drinks came to a whopping $25!!!!!! I'm rounding up by the way. This place is a MUST when in Old Montreal. Little hole in the wall but absolutely delicious food. Next time we may try the pastries."}
{"text":"Youri's comment (below) sold me on this place so I decided to check out the \"Best Portugese Chicken\" west of Portugal.  I walked with two other friends and was surprised to see that it was more of the take-out style feel with only minimal number of tables to really sit down.  Fine by me because the moment I stepped in, I was captivated by the aura of chicken grilled over the fire.  Amazing.  I ordered the 1/2 chicken and this was definitely more than enough.  Despite the line, the service was really fast once I placed the order.  The woman behind the counter kept piling on the amount of fries while having a conversation, a good sign already.  I had this with the spicy sauce - wasn't really that spicy to be honest, but definitely had a small bite to its flavour.   The chicken though was amazing.  It was succulent, it was juicy and it was delicious.  Too bad I'm leaving for Montreal tonight but if I were to come back to Montreal, I would definitely drop by for some chicken at Romados.  Til next time."}
{"text":"Yelp Montreal led us here to see what all the 5 star reviews was all about..  From my analysis of devouring chicken, my conclusion comes down to some points about Romados...   ::PROS:: Cheap for a half chicken ($7.5ish) HUGE ass portions Family ran, no frills what you see is what you get type of spot.. The chicken breast was pretty tasty TONS of fries just flopped over blanketing the chicken Salad as a healthy garnish along with their vinegar dressing Did I say a LOAD of fries? Spicy oil based hot sauce  You walk out full, and not hungry They give you a huge bread to chase with the chicken Bakery, for the dessert lovers afterwards  xx-CONS-XX A little dry on the half chicken I ordered Fries were just ok. It was seasoned but not that good. The wings were not SO tasty. It kinda lost some of the OoompH in taste.   I would definitely come back and try it again. A good spot to just munch down on some rotisserie chicken. Originally I wanted to give this spot a 3.5* stars, but the pros out weight the cons.."}
{"text":"some of the better rotisserie chicken that i've had. didn't really know portugese chicken was a thing in montreal. glad someone told us.   $9 for a 1/4 chicken and giant pile of fries + salad.   one of the better meals we had on the entire trip."}
{"text":"Good grilled chicken and salad. The service was helpful and friendly. It was inexpensive for our family dinner. I love the fact that every time we go to Montreal, we always have to stop by here for the chicken, a side of sauce plus salad and pastel de nata! Perfect stop everytime"}
{"text":"This place is NOT closed, for one. The roast chicken is good but not something really extraordinary. But it's a good eat for families."}
{"text":"There is a reason that there is a line out the door every time I've been here- it's great!  Grilled chicken (spicy optional), salad and natas...a perfect meal."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars. A crowded and small resto, a bit chaotic if you're trying to place an order... The staff is all about business and will put you in your place if you try and cut the line... but the chicken!!! HOLY CHICKEN-NES!!! and the fries!!!! Every bite was better than the last one. It took all my might not to finish my half chicken plate (I stopped myself solely because I wanted to have it for lunch the following day as well).. A MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"Such a massive!! amount of food for such a reasonable price. The chicken is really done to perfection. This place is a stable in the area and for good reason"}
{"text":"Portuguese Bakery & Chicken shack that also sells local beer? WHAT?   This place is  on Rachel E in a nice, leafy part of the plateau and yet one can fill one's stomach up to the brim for under $20. Not just with moist and lip-smackingly salty Frango e Batata along with a cold Belle Guele Pilsner, but also still-warm, delicate pastel de nata just out of the oven;  gooey and creamy on the inside and just barely crunchy with a kiss of caramelized powdered sugar on top giving the custard a crunch almost akin to a Crème Brûlée...I'm almost drooling from the memory alone.."}
{"text":"Quarter leg meal with one of those guarana antarctica sodas.  why order anything else anywhere else?    Bring it to the park (cross Rachel and go down Bouillon for a minute), and clean up after yourself!    If you're worried it's going to be busy, call ahead and pick it up from the right side of the window where you usuall place your order."}
{"text":"Does live up to the hype, but certainly does not stand out on its own in this neighborhood.  Chicken was great (as has been heavily stated)! But the breast was a little dry.  Also wasn't a fan of the fact that the spicy chicken is a regular chicken with chili oil added after the fact.  Portugalia (down the street at the intersection of Rachel and Clark) puts the chili oil, etc. on while they grill the chicken.  Fries are ok, but both the chicken and the fries seemed to be much better with the added chili oil.  Bread was great and $10 for 1/2 a chicken, salad, and a ton of fries was more than enough for 2 people.  Food was extremely quick, despite other reviews that had a long wait.  Not much place to sit and eat, and no drinking alcohol in the restaurant.  All in all, a fantastic place to grab great Portuguese chicken and fries (maybe some beer) to take home.  But if you want equal quality chicken with crispier fries and the ability to sit and enjoy the food with a beer and a few olives, give Portugalia a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and I treked to Romados and I was in sad that they didn't offer sandwiches on the weekend and I was about to leave, but I regressed and got back into the 10 minute line for the chicken plate. My wife said, \"You have to at least try this place\" So I ordered the chicken breast plate with only salad. He looked at me kind of weird that I didn't want a pound of fries and 600 calories of rice with it.  The chicken was roillng on about 12 sckewers over coal in the background.   The chicken was juicy and the salad was wonderful with the dressing they put on top.  They had huge bottles of water for $1, which was awesome. We were happy!  Everyone there was super happy, they were eating 3,000 calories of food, no problem, so I am guessing all the walking in Montreal keeps these people fit.  Overall, a great place, but I really would have liked to try the sandwich.  I am glad my wife made me stay and try their classic food instead of moving on."}
{"text":"Was great before the renovation, now it's all hype and pure salt.  Unfortunate."}
{"text":"Such an important institution in the Montreal good eats scene, the December 2012 fire generated waves of \"Oh my god NO!\" amongst its disciples! Fortunately its back....with a vengeance (before it was Romados 2: Romados harder)  My first foray here was in 2005, I just moved to the hood and was getting to know the area better. Walking along Rachel, there was that unmistakable smell, that scent of grilled portuguese chicken. (Note line ups here are not just insane, they are UNSANE! Best to order for pick-up ahead of time)  Back then there was this tiny adorable Portuguese lady who took your order from the window (a really really tiny window before they renovated). From personal experience and observation, this lady would flirt with every man, young or old. I would order in my bad portugeshe - \"Peito du frangu avec fritash et salada\" to which she would respond with an impressed \"bravu\".   There were times when i would just order only the chicken, she would ask in a disappointed tone \"pas da fritash?, but when no one was looking, would sneak in some fries for me!!!!!  She doesn't work there anymore, but the quality of this place is everlast.   I do however miss the soccer club scarfs that adorned the walls. Now I am unsure if I should be pro Benfica or Porto or Sporting Lisbon when i enter this place!"}
{"text":"Yay finally got to try Romados.. Really loved it.. Simple portugese chicken per quantity or in a sandwich. Nice big servings. Excellent crispy french fries. And a real feeling of experience and systematic quality to the place.   I really loved the food. Simple, but nice and clean. I wouldn't cross down for it, but have found a favorite chicken place in the plateau."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, I used to go all the time during my days at McGill. The must have menu item is of course the rotisserie chicken (actually grilled over charcoal) doesn't get any better than this, best I've had or probably will have. Comes in many forms, if its only one or two of you go for the plates (quarter chicken, breast or leg, or half chicken, mountain of fries and small salad, rices occasionally available.) Chicken is perfectly cooked, nice and juicy and well seasoned. You have a choice of spicy sauce or mild, word to the wise, go with the spicy (it's not spicy at all actually). Fries are pretty good. Prices are even better. When I started going there it was $4.75 for a quarter chicken plate (enough food to feed a small family). Prices have gone up recently but still absurdly cheap.  You should also know that chicken isn't the only thing Romados makes. It's also a bakery! I recommend the rice flour cupcakes/muffins. Awesome, nice and dense but with a fluffy texture.  Highly, highly recommended to the Montréal native or visitor."}
{"text":"I never thought I would compliment a 'fast food' joint's chicken this way - juici-cious, tender, flavorful with a mesmerizing chili sauce to die for. This is the place to go for Portuguese chicken in Montreal.  The place has gotten quite the following, the never ending line that goes straight out the door right up to closing time is evidence enough. Their chicken entrees, comes in all sizes in multiple of 1/4 with tasty crunchy fries and salad, comes out to be under $10 or an entire chicken for sharing between four people for $24, what a steal. The chicken itself is extremely tender, every string of meat down to the last of breast tastes juicy, no evidence of dryness at all. The sauce was delicious, it reminds me a little of the flavor from China's smelly tofu, slightly spicy and full of flavor. The accompanying portion of fries has an rustic and chewy flavor, resembling the richness of the skin of potato wedges. We inhaled the meal in under a few minutes.   If you are at or around Mont Royal, do stop by and grab a meal from this famed place."}
{"text":"I guess it's not Romados, it's me. My friends dragged me to Romados on a whim, because the day was so beautiful. I wasn't familiar with the place before, and neither was I familiar with Portuguese cuisine, so I didn't know what to expect. I thought this would be a full-blown restaurant with all sorts of Portuguese specialties. This is more a hole-in-the-wall sorta place: you order at one small counter after waiting in line, and choose from maybe 6 different meal options written above the counter. The Menu is fairly small and as the \"Rotisserie\" part of the name would suggest, consists mainly of chicken. I usually don't go out to eat chicken and ordered a pork escalope sandwich and a custard bun.  Judging from all the reviews before me, I guess this is where I made a faux-pas. The sandwich was good. No more, no less. The bread was fluffy and bland, the escalopes a bit overcooked, what really bound everything together was the fat. Full-on fat, everywhere. The fries certainly benefit from all that fatty goodness and the next time I stop at Romados I'll gladly order a side of fries: they are well-seasoned and delicious and I promptly finished my friend's portion.  The pastry stand is gorgeous to look at but nothing is named, and I always feel a fool trying to describe what I want. What is Portuguese? What isn't? I'm looking for something authentic here! My custard bun was good as well, with a hint of artificial processing in the custard's taste.  The prices are so low I'll probably be back a couple more times and see what exactly it is I seem to be missing out on."}
{"text":"Forget all the other chicken places when in Montreal.  Romados hands down has the best chicken in the city.  When you come to Romados, you will notice that they have classic Portuguese fair on the menu, bifanas, fish, etc, but I can't stress it enough, ORDER THE CHICKEN.  You won't be disappointed.  It comes with seasoned fries and a little salad.  When the person at the counter asks if you want sauce, say yes! Sauce on the chicken but also tell him or her to put on the fries.  Trust me.  As you sit down and open the box, just be careful.  The fries might be overflowing.  When you will bite into the perfectly cooked chicken, you won't be able to help but notice how crispy the skin is and how juicy and smokey the meat is.  It literally falls off the bone! Just make sure you lick those bones clean, I sure know I do!  I don't live in Montreal anymore, but when I do come back, I make sure I make a pit stop at Romados.  Every time my friends tell me they're going to Montreal, I tell them they have to go to Romados.  They come back thanking me and telling me that it was the best chicken they have had in their lives!  YES, I'm serious!  Once you're done, if you still have space left, get one of their pasteis de nata (Portuguese custard tarts).  Simply delicious.    By far the best place for Portuguese chicken, or any chicken for that matter, in Montreal.  There's a reason that there's always a line up."}
{"text":"Romados has the best facade. It also has very good chicken. But the service is tremendously bad - as if they knew they were a local institution anyway, so no need to be nice to customers. The cooks / cashiers don't say hi or thanks, there are signs everywhere that you are not allowed to drink anything else than what you buy here, and your chicken is thrown in a plastic bag with about as much care as Trump discussing women's rights.   Also, prices make no sense - it is more expensive to order 4 portions of chicken and fries than 2*2 portions. How?!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best chicken places!  My sister and I can't stop thinking about it!  The spicy chicken is juicy and flavorful, the salad (what the heck is in the dressing? It's magical!), the rice was sooo good, and the fries were perfect. It was a great flavorful, hearty meal for a great price. I am salivating as I type this right now.   The only negative is the limited seating. You need to be a hawk and grab seats as soon as you can."}
{"text":"I just don't understand what's so special about this place. The food was extremely greasy and the chicken wasn't anything special.  Maybe I'm being a little harsh because the place was extremely overhyped. Not a good location to sit down and eat."}
{"text":"Really good food - some of the best chicken I've ever had!  It was seasoned really well, and very juicy, but might be a little greasy for some tastes.    The chicken dinners come with fries and a salad.  The salad was simple with a really nice mustardy dressing.  The seasoned fries were plentiful and had the potential to be amazing but they were a little lame.  I feel like they maybe they were prepared in advance.    Not a lot of seating, so you may be better off taking it to go.  Service was fast and friendly.  Romados was a good choice for a night out on the town."}
{"text":"$11 or $12 gets your SO MUCH food. I always get half fries and half rice and they basically give what any other place would consider a full portion of each. Then you have a roll, some salad, and of course their delicious chicken. This is chicken exactly the way you want it prepared. It's juicy and well seasoned. The only thing that I would have preferred would have been a more salad. The give so many fries and very little salad. I guess I'll have to try and ask for that one of these days when the place isn't so busy (which is extremely rare)."}
{"text":"I first went to Romados two summers ago and I have been craving it ever since.  The service is very quick and the staff is VERY polite and friendly- you feel like you've been friends with them for years.  As for the food- I LOVE chicken and this is some of the best chicken you can find anywhere in Montreal.  The prices are unbelievable with the most expensive menu item being a large side portion of rice for $13.50.  We got the meal combos that included the 1/2 chicken, fries, salad and rice and it was under $10!!  You can decide if you want the chicken to be spicy or not too.  I got it spicy and it was the perfect amount of added heat to add a real kick to the meal. We then walked down the street and enjoyed our meal at the small park that is close by.  It was perfect and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very delicious chicken. They ran out of bread when we were there (...it's a bakery...?) but we got the chicken plate (which came with a massive sub roll on the side so we ended up with sandwiches anyway. Very good food, good value and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The most renowned Portuguese restaurant for rotisserie chicken in Montreal. It is a staple in the area that you must try. I enjoy it and have it regularly but I'm not sure I would call it THE best but really really good. The taste, price and speed are a great option for lunch break. I'm a regular and happy with the food, it lasts days. Try it for sure. Enjoy."}
{"text":"one of my favorite bbq chicken place in montreal...i actually dreamt of it when i lived in LA! Stay away from the fries ...they are so awesome you can't just eat a few!!! Romados for me is to chicken what Shwatzes is to smoke meat!!!"}
{"text":"Incase all the other 5-star reviews weren't enough, let me add my own:  This chicken is the bomb. The end. That's all she wrote.  Seriously though, when my mate was visiting from Calgary we ate here every week for 3 weeks, and in between visits we thought about coming to eat here. It was good all the times we went.  The chicken is crispy, but the key is the sauce. Make sure you get extra sauce, 'cause that's where it's at. The fries are herbed, and cooked to  If you order a meal (chicken, chips) before 12 or 1pm you also get a free bread roll and a Portugese tart (!). Needless to say, this place is Legit Portugese, so they know how to make a tart.  If you're in Montreal, want some good chicken, want to try a local institution, or any of the previous, just go here already."}
{"text":"The chicken comes in huge proportion compared to the price! please do check it out with an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken spot in Montreal.   They give you the option of spicy or regular.  The difference is not in how they prepare the chicken but rather or not they pour the spicy sauce on top.   To quote one of the cooks there, \"it's all in the sauce.\"  If you want rice you have to get there early as they run out everyday.   If they don't have rice you have the option of more fries or salad.  Portions are generous.   We ate at a table there;  its not the most comfortable as none of the chairs in the restaurant have backs.   I use the word restaurant loosely as it feels more like a deli.  You order over the high counter at the kitchen and you pay to your right at the register.   Service was friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"What can I say, Romados Romados. You're a tasty lover ;)   You're not coming to Romados for the ambience. In fact, I've never actually eaten at Romados. Sometimes the lineups are very long. The wait is worth it though because the BBQ chicken is that good, hands down. Big portion, little price. Fries are nicely seasoned but VERY greasy. Romados is best with a side of Netflix or the park when the weather is nice!   Outside of that: great meal, great value, and great BBQ chicken. Once the fries get cold you should throw them out because they won't be edible anymore.   You'll know when you're in a Romados kinda mood."}
{"text":"This place has a long history. How come it's my first time being here. We two shared a full chicken, with fries and salad, two soups and two drinks. Very reasonable price. The seating area is so small and people took some stood for their coats. So be here early or be prepared to eat without seat. We ordered more than we can handle. Great chicken, and the spicy sauce was essential.  The soup was a creamy potato soup. Very bland and thin, nothing special.  The fires was not crispy. I like the spices and coating in the fries.  Next time I will have a whole chicken only, as a take out, only 13.5$. The dessert looked so delicious but I didn't get a chance to try them. An extra reason for me to come back."}
{"text":"Not too bad for Portuguese roasted chicken although i remember it being much more tastier a few years back. Definitely add the poutine option on top of the fries if you get the come and get a egg tart as well."}
{"text":"Everyone here is so nice! They let us try the spicy sauce with a couple of fries so we knew how hot it was. The chicken is moist, the buns are crispy, it's all just excellent stuff"}
{"text":"It's a fast food place. Almost feeling like a cafeteria. Friends and I came in for dinner and the line was pretty long, so you know, it's good. If you don't get chicken here, you shouldn't have gone here in the first place!  Anyway, I split with a friend half a chicken combo with fries. Warning, they DUMP tons of fries on top of the chicken/salad. The chicken was juicy and the sauce is really nice and a kick to it. The fries are really good. It's the way I like it, lots of pepper. The lady at the cashier offered bread, and i said yes. This is a lot of carbs and it's gonna be a pretty heavy meal.  I really wish that they had egg tarts at the time. But they an array of desserts next to the cashier. There are some seats and tables along the window. If you're with a big group, it would be better if you went to a park to eat and have an impromptu picnic."}
{"text":"This place is a Montreal classic. My husband is from Portugal and trust me when I say they have the best pastéis de nata in the city. Best Portuguese chicken! Can't go wrong with anything in this place"}
{"text":"Portuguese rotisserie chicken and fries done right.  The aroma of chicken fills the arondissment with a delightful aroma that is matched by the flavor and juciness of the meat.  This place is also a full bakery with tasty pastries,  and a free nata comes with the chicken at lunch.  Make sure you get the sauce piquant on the chicken for extra delisciousness.  Call in your order before going to cut your wait time down,  or expect a long line of people waiting for their chicken,  especially on Sunday's."}
{"text":"One of my absolute pet peeves is going to a restaurant and being served dry chicken. Fortunately, this is not the case!  This used to be one of my favorite places to grab lunch in Montreal. The chicken is very juicy and tender. It is seasoned perfectly with tons of flavor from each bite. Everything is fairly priced and the portions they give are reasonable. Definitely a great place, unfortunately it is a bit far and inconvenient to go.Very satisfied and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"During my week-long vacation in Montreal, I had a sushi buffet, an expensive French dinner and large amounts of poutine. Yet, the meal I would have again in a heartbeat, the meal that highlighted my stay, resides in this amazing and humble establishment.   For a light lunch, my parents and I split a half a chicken and fries. The chicken was perfectly cooked: mind-blowingly flavorful, juicy and enveloped in the crispiest, tastiest skin. Also, the chicken had the perfect level of spiciness, whetting the appetite with each bite.   On top of this, the fries were a mountain of pillowy potatoes which I would say rivals if not tops Pommes Frites in New York. Once you put one of these babies in your mouth, you can forget about that diet you've been trying to keep because you will not be able to control yourself!   I have to stop now because I'm literally salivating too much. Rotisserie Romados is definitely worth it in every sense of the word!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I am remembering the chicken and fries right now and I just want to salivate! We came here based on Anthony Bourdain's visit and I was determined to try. So tender, so flavorful! The chicken and fries were fully drenched with that \"crack sauce.\" When I say crack sauce, I mean it is so addicting you don't want to stop eating. I don't recall the exact price of the meal but I shared with my boyfriend and it was more than enough food! There was a long line but it moved quickly and especially so when you know what you order. The seating is really small but you can easily take it to go at a nearby parks (seems to be parks are a plenty in Montreal). Luckily we found a table and chowed down! There isn't much space but you begin to forget about it once you eat. It is definitely chicken and fries to try and I can see myself coming here again!"}
{"text":"This is pretty well THE BEST chicken place west of Portugal. Every minute you wait in line just build the anticipation until you finally get your platter from the nicest woman in the world (who always hooks you up with extra) and then that first bite... oh that first bite - it's the most satisfying feeling you've ever had. Oh, and what is usually good for two meals will only cost you about $8.00. Well worth the wait, but call in advance if you can't stand the lineups."}
{"text":"This is easily one of my favourite spots for Portuguese chicken in the city. This isn't really a sit down restaurant although there is some seating inside. You can get a great meal of delicious grilled Portuguese chicken with salad and fries for a very reasonable price. I don't have a whole lot to say about this place other than the fact that it's a must try for Portuguese chicken in Montreal , I always find myself comparing other places to it to see if they can match the deliciousness that is Romados!"}
{"text":"Lorsque je travaillais en Centre d'appel, mon collègue portugais m'a fait connaitre ce restaurant. C'est devenue ensuite un lieu de pèlerinage tellement c'est bon !"}
{"text":"We screwed this dinner up twice.  Here are some essential tips so you don't also: 1) Go no later than 630.  The line explodes after that and you may not get chicken. 2) Two people should get a whole chicken meal to share.  Don't fool yourself thinking you'll only eat a quarter.  This chicken is the crack of the North. 3) When they ask \"spicy?\" say yes.  The sauce gets sopped up by the seasoned fries. 4) Feel free to use US dollars.  We got 1-to-1.  Miss this place at your own risk."}
{"text":"I love the fries, and the sauce on the chicken was great. The juiciness of the chicken was very good, but couldn't match the splendidity of the sauce. I wouldn't say it's a be-all-end-all or can't miss, but it's definitely a good stop - very popular with locals. The baked items seemed doable too.   I liked how casual this place was, how your order from the cooks, who stand in front of the kitchen. I didn't see many take-out joints in my time in Montreal, this was a good one. Dig it."}
{"text":"This is it folks.  You won't find better Portuguese chicken than this in Montreal.  In fact you'll probably have to go all the way to Portugal for better chicken.  Romados is an institution here and it has rightfully earned its legendary status.  It's a fast serve place so you order at the counter and once you get your food head over to the cash to pay.  You can call ahead to order so you can skip the lines which is wise since this place can get long line-ups.  They are prepared for the crowds though so things move along quickly.  There isn't much seating so if the weather is nice you can always take your food over to nearby Parc Lafontaine for a picnic.  Now let's talk about the main attraction: the chicken.  Romados claim to fame is their Portuguese-style rotisserie chicken and it is so delicious.  The chicken is tender and juicy and the skin is nice and crispy.  I like to get it with the spicy sauce because it adds a little hint of zing without being too intense.  The fries are also excellent being thick-cut (my preferred style of French fry) and seasoned to perfection with herbs and spices.  They are wildly addictive and you won't be able to leave any behind even if you're full.  Also let's face it, leaving behind Romados' chicken and fries would be downright shameful.  In case the promise of Montreal's best Portuguese chicken isn't enough to entice you it gets even better.  In addition to being wildly delicious the food is dirt cheap.  A 1/4 chicken thigh with a MASSIVE side of fries and salad will only set you back about $8.  My meal in total came to $10.50 and that was because I got a drink with it.  So now that you have plenty of reasons to go what are you waiting for?  Get down to Romados now!"}
{"text":"If you are in the area and hungry, there is no better option than to order a quarter chicken and fries and Ramados. Montreal is home to some of the best Portuguese rotisserie restaurants, but none offering charcoal-fired chicken at affordable prices like Ramados. The combos are packed with generous servings of chicken, fries, and salad, so there are no worries of leaving unsatisfied. Don't forget to order some natas to finish your meal!   Ramados is a take-out restaurant, but there are two or three tables inside. However, there is no better place to enjoy your saucy, charred chicken than the nearby park on a sunny afternoon!"}
{"text":"//Vibe|Wait\\ Although in a hipster area, this place isn't hipster at all. Has that classic neighborhood bakery look/feel. There are two lines, if you're only ordering bread/pastries/stuff from the freezer, get on the bakery side. Chicken is the left side.  Rotisserie doesn't start until 11 am. So if you show up early and there's no line, that's because only the bakery is open. Once lunch time rolls around, no matter what day of the week, there is a wait. We queued up at 11:30 and even though the line wasn't out the door, we still waited maybe more than 30 mins. So if you live in the area, call ahead. Limited seating, but when we went, not many people were sitting to eat, so you might find an open table during lunch time so long as your group is small.  //Food\\ Very reasonable prices, generous portions of fries (short, thick cut). For the popularity and wait time, I just didn't get the hype behind the chicken. Maybe I should've gotten the spicy seasoning, because beside a strong taste of wine, the chicken didn't taste that special to me. It's not bad, but not a taste I'd wait so long in line for. The seasoning on the fries are good, but a little too sweet for me. You get a lot of fries for what you order, so think twice before placing a separate order or even going for the medium or large fries.  I really liked the egg tarts.The crust itself was thick, chewy, layered, and flavorful. A good pastry base, which isn't always present in most egg tarts. Although the custard was much too sweet for me (with a smooth and non-curdled consistency), I was pretty impressed by the crust, and my kids thought these were the best they'd ever had."}
{"text":"It's a classic. It's not like innovative, they have had the same menu items forever... but they deliver, the chicken is good!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and we ordered the thigh combo. It was good, but I've had better Portuguese chicken at Nandos to be honest. The chicken was covered in a huge amount of oil. It was pretty good value however I definitely expected more. We thought the thigh combo would come with salad, rice and chips however I think it is only if you order a certain cut you get the rice."}
{"text":"My fiancé had the 1/4 chicken with spicy sauce and I had their poutine with chicken. It was AMAZING!!! I love their poutine, it was delicious and worth the calories!"}
{"text":"No visit to Montreal is without a trip to Romados. The line ups are long but definitely worth the wait. Chicken is to die for.... This place has to have the best tasting Portuguese chicken I ever had. Fries are golden and tasty and comes with a Portugese style roll. Drown it down with a sumol and you're good to go.  Tip: they have two lines \"avec commande\" (with order) and \"sans commande\" (without order) the avec commande line is for folks who has called in for a order and is generally a bit faster. Sans commande line is for folks who did not call in and usually has the longest line ups."}
{"text":"The chicken is good. But the expectation was so high, the reality doesn't keep up. So nah."}
{"text":"Bargain deal for a family meal for three.  One chicken combo with fries and salad, soda $28.  The line goes almost to the door which is an indication that this is a Montreal favorite.  The chicken was smoky, tender and with a mild spicy sauce.  We ate all of it.  Fries were the one disappointment - huge serving and a bit soft and oily for my taste.  they also have chorizo sausage, but most come for the chicken.  They also serve pastries and cake which we didn't try, but looked good."}
{"text":"If you like chicken, then this place should be on your list of best roasted chicken in Montreal. It is a popular place, so there will be a 10-40 minutes wait depending on how busy it is on that day. Their chicken is perfectly roasted and a perfect amount of sauce and you can either eat it right there or take out to have it at home. The price is affordable and the service is great, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"We were overwhelmed with how delicious and cheap the food here is. A chicken leg is only 3 dollars if you are a meat lover.  The poutine sauce is also great. You should get the combos with the poutine sauce! We also like the fast turnaround that the counter and cashier. Hence, it never takes us more than 10 minutes to get out of the long queue. Do not let the queue discourage you from trying these fantastic chicken! We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is yet another establishment which makes Montreal Montreal. Nothing fancy, no gimmicks, no attitude and amazing prices. Just roasted Portuguese chicken, fries, sauce, salad and a bread and Portuguese and French pastry counter.  There is absolutely nothing more that I can add except to say that if you are visiting Montreal or a naive Montrealer who has never gone then GO. Like NOW. Chicken roasted to perfection, juicy and yet still practically falling off the bone. So good that you're going to use your hand to get right into the bone as well.  And then the fries. These are perfect salt and pepper fries, which reminded me of the salt and pepper chips which the Kettle brand makes. Try to get them slathered with the spicy sauce and it's a joygasm in your mouth. They also sell homemade Portuguese sausages, buns and of course natas, their sweet egg custard cups which are probably the best in the city.  For $13 bucks for a whole chicken, it's worth your while to pick up a bird or two, a large order of fries and take them home, keep them in glass containers to keep them fresh, and you have a great lunch meal to take to work for a couple of days.  While you're waiting in line, it's an interesting place to people watch. Everybody seems to come here, I saw Portuguese aunties, guys from the hip hop crowd, snotty Westmount chicks waiting in the Land Rovers outside, professionals coming from work and everyone in between. That's the thing about great food; it brings everyone together."}
{"text":"The line is long, but the wait is worth it.  This rotisserie chicken is so juicy and greasy. Yum. I got the combo with fries, rice, and salad, but you can ask for the combo any way you like (just salad and rice, etc). Sauce is excellent (perfect level of spiciness). There is also a bakery here and some authentic Brazillian products, but I didn't have any more room in my belly after I consumed half a chicken. But if you go, you gotta wash it all down with a bottle of Guarana.  Tips: Figure out what you want before you get in line. There are people waiting."}
{"text":"Chicken is great... Charcoal taste without being burnt or dry. Fries are delicious: great colour, great texture and seasoned with steak spice.   Line is long, but moves pretty fast. Even faster if you call ahead. Service is efficient and friendly.   Negative points: The spicy sauce is more of an oil than a sauce. Bifana is also too oily."}
{"text":"First meal in Montreal was a success!  Ordered a whole chicken and poutine, which was way more than enough for 2 people.  The chicken was very flavorful and moist.  The poutine was similarly delicious. My first poutine so I can't compare to traditional versions (this had chicken, fries, gravy and cheese - what's not to like?).  Loved everything about this meal!"}
{"text":"Stopped here from the great reviews on here and didn't regret it.  A pretty unique experience for me to be able to get the poutine (which was made with the fresh rotisserie chicken, cheese curds, and brown gravy-- And was absolutely delicious). I also got the 1/2 chicken meal, which included a salad and A LOT of fries. Everything was incredible and I would recommend this to anyone.  If you want a unique(ish) experience in Montreal, PLEASE come here (you won't regret it)."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer because there is is nothing like this place where I live. This is a take-out place where you can sit down - a lot of high top tables and chairs, but they are still usually jammed a meal times. This place has a system - 2 different lines, one for pick-up and one for ordering then a line to pay. The lines move well, could be faster with more staff. The pay line was kinda a mess. However the chicken was very good, I found the rice ok, nothing to rave about, and the fires were okay too - a bit salty. If I could grab and get home in a reasonable amount of time it would be a perfect take-out joint for me!"}
{"text":"Luckily we went there several times but no need to wait in a long line every time. The problem is if you'd like to eat there, there's no much seats. We two shared 1/2 chicken with fries and salads and finally got quite full. I like this Portuguese chicken, the sauce is good, although I think the texture is soft but not tender enough. The tarts is a little bit sweet for me, and I supposed it would be served freshly baked as bagels but not. Anyway, it's recommended! Chicken is good!"}
{"text":"Stellar service and chicken sometimes the cashiers can rush but it's ok I get the hustle they are always busy and for good reason.  Always get the chicken spicy, the salad is always delicious, and the fries are so well seasoned. I wish I could've gotten a sandwich either way no regrets and I'll be back !!   Also pastries are delicious the egg tarts, coconut custard and almond desserts are all outstanding and the bread always delicious.   Bottom line: amazing Portuguese chicken and pretty much everything else they make, charming service, and great prices!  Just try it out for yourself."}
{"text":"I think its really thanks to leaving Montreal and coming back that I appreciate its Portuguese food so much.  Even if you pay double the price, you still can't find delicious grilled chicken or nata outside of Montreal!!  Well, except maybe in Portugal, duh.  What do they put on the fries?!? Sooooo good the spice mixture!!!  Addictive!  This is my favorite place in Montreal for take-out grilled Portuguese chicken.  I used to live in Montreal so I love to come back when I visit.  Cheap, delicious and made right in front of you.    Omg, can't resist that huge counter window full of pasteis de nata!!!  I want to buy and eat them all!!! But no sharing. ;-) lol, haha!  There are tons of good Portuguese places in Montreal, especially on the Plateau.  I certainly wouldn't say the other places are bad, there are so many good ones.  I say, go try them all!  But maybe just start with this one.  Its my favorite.    Oh, and yes I agree 200% with the other Yelper.  After you eat here walk across the street to Cafe Replika and grab some coffee!"}
{"text":"okay so, again guilty as charged for only finding out this place from The Layover, but I did do some research and was able to get a TeamBuy coupon for this place.  The place is on the corner of a building. I think you just have to listen to your nose and also look for the line of ppl that are going inside. Sometimes there is also a line out the door!  This place is pretty much the staple of every Montreal visit including Schwartz Deli. So what you order is the Roast Chicken with fries, extra extra hot sauce, egg tart for dessert & your soda of choice to wash it down. The  chicken is delicious, perfect, moist and all types of description for amazing Portuguese chicken! Dont get me started on the price, for what you get its a great frickin deal! I would probably eat here once a day if I could!  LIke what Ryan T said, \"Just writing this review makes my mouth water and brings back fond memories of my trip to Montreal.\" and this is soo true!  Trust me on this, Romados is a MUST hit up spot when your in Montreal. Do not leave MTL without trying it!."}
{"text":"We were directed to this place for quick pick up and go dinner for the family. You walk in then order from the cooks what you want. The cook we spoke with spoke very little English but after a few finger pointing we were good to go. We got 4  chickenbreast combos which came with half a roasted chickenbreast a small salad and a ridiculous amount of fries. I have two teanagers. That was a hit with them. You are asked if you want spicy or regular sauce poured on top. I went for spicy and it was awesome! Not too hot for you novices out there. You move to the right to pay but they should move the cash register to the right of the pastries!  There were some incredible looking deserts that I would have gladly inquired about had my wife not already paid for our meal! I guess I'll just have to come back for desert!"}
{"text":"Mmm chicken. Said to be an institution in the heart of Montreal's historically Portuguese neighborhood, the menu of the day featured both chicken soup and BBQ Salmon. Both options made my mouth water but seeing the dozen or so BBQ chickens in the background grilling, not to mention the aromas of chicken from block away, I really couldn't bring myself to try the fish.   Ordering: This is not a traditional sit down restaurant. To the right are pastries and bread you can order at an walk up counter. To the left are some tables to eat at should you decide to eat on site. And down the middle are two line ups, one for preorder pick up and one for ordering.   My girlfriend and I opted for a large chicken poutine to share along with a chicken soup and a traditional Portuguese dessert, pastel de nata.   The food: First - A large chicken poutine: It's literally assembled in front of you. The staff took our order and grabbed two chicken thighs from the grill, stripped the meat off the bones and packed it into a Styrofoam box - I dock of points for Styrofoam  - with gravy, cheese and fries. There was so much food; between us we could have easily shared a small.  The chicken was so delicious - moist bbq chicken cooked and flavoured perfectly -  though with the fries, gravy and cheese it was salty for my taste.   Second - the soup was also generous in proportion.  I can see myself needing/wanting/craving it on a cold day or if I had the flu. The chicken melted in my mouth, but the noodles were soggy.   Lastly - among the wide choice of pasties, the pastel de nata is definitely the way to go. It was a nice way to end the meal, not too sweet, the pastry flaked off nicely and it's making my mouth water now thinking about it.   Overall - the value for money is unbeatable. It's totally possible to have dinner with leftover for lunch the next day on ten bucks per person."}
{"text":"BELIEVE THE HYPE!  The fabled line is totally worth it. My guy and I will spend 12 bucks splitting a whole chicken (spicy, duh) for dinner and I'm seriously knawing the marrow out of the bones and eating the spinal cord at the end of the meal, it's soooo good.   WARNING: If I eat the potatoes and the bird at once I go into a serious chicken coma so I advise only a side of salad if you actually want to do something with your day."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet, step aside.  Kenny Rogers chicken, step aside. This is the best rotisserie chicken you'll have in your life, and paired with the seasoned french fries, this place earns it's consistently high rating.   A combo consisting of 1/2 chicken, salad and fries with spicy BBQ sauce (for only $10, extremely reasonable for the quality) is enough to feed two very hungry people. It's cost effective, it's delicious, it's Rotisserie Romados! :)  P.S. Don't forget to pick up a Portugal custard tarts in the neighborhood! It's as authentic as it can get in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Half chicken under 12$ with a mountain of fries. Hell yeah! Need I say more? Ok.  Considered one of Montreal's best chicken an establishment that has been serving locals and visitors over 20yrs and yet have i hearf of a complaint about their chicken. Its a must if you are around the Platteau area. St-Hubert and Scores can suck it, this is where its at. Take it with the hot sauce gives it an amazing kick."}
{"text":"Quand on se promène dans la Plateau et qu'on arrive aux environs de l'intersection des rues Rachel et Saint-Laurent, on commence à sentir le fameux poulet de Romados.  J'y suis allée avec mon copain et un de ses amis qui étaient très excités de me faire découvrir le meilleur poulet du monde selon eux. J'admets que le poulet était excellent, et la sauce piquante sur les frites y ajoute un goût qui sort de l'ordinaire. Les portions sont énormes, donc pour ceux aux petits appétits, partagez avec vos amis!  La seule chose que j'ai moins apprécié de l'endroit est le manque d'espace pour y manger, mais au moins, plusieurs parcs dans les environs sont facilement accessible."}
{"text":"The most delectable, moist(sorry - hate that world but it's truly the most on point description) chicken you will EVER have!  Yes that is a sweeping statement and I have nothing to back that up besides my personal opinion. But take it as you wish.   I came here with my boyfriend around 1PM on a Saturday to no wait. We had no prior knowledge of this place and both ordered a 1/2 chicken. He got rice as a side, me the fries. Neither of us got it with the spicy sauce so I can't speak to that.   He finished all the chicken but had loads of rice left. I clearly overestimated myself and definitely should've gotten the 1/4 as I couldn't even make a dent in the meal. The fries alone will make you put on 400 lbs. Absolutely note that the portions here are crazy massive.    The pricing was on point for what you get, seating is very limited, and be careful because along with moist chicken there's a lot of sauce leftover that can easily spill."}
{"text":"Stopped by Romados to get some take out lunch. I heard about this place through Anthony Bourdains show \"The Layover\". Usually most of my experience of finding places to eat through TV shows have been pretty good. Sadly this one wasn't one of the good experiences. The portion was great and the price was reasonable but the quality of food wasn't anything special. It was just plain old chicken and rice with fries and salad on the side. I was expecting something great but I guess my expectations were too high! Overall it was an ok experience, it's not like the food was bad or anything. Check this place out if you want a reasonably priced chicken place!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an affordable meal that has huge portions--this place is it. I would say you could definitely split the combo in two and be content. Generally being an excessive eater, I managed to finish everything but my friends could barely finish half of their meal. The chicken was tender and well cooked but wayyyyyyy too salty, and so was the salad dressing. The portion sizes are great for the price (understatement: HUGE) but I just wish they would add less salt to the chicken and maybe not overly dress the salad--or even better--leave it plain since everything else is salty and oily? The service was a bit questionable--we had an incident where we were refused tap water even though we were customers? Otherwise, it was a decent meal, and I definitely think you're getting a pretty good deal, but not really worth the hype."}
{"text":"great place!!! i go here all the time ... i make a 2hour drive to get here :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant BURNT DOWN recently (January)... I was devastated! They will reopen but didn't announce when..."}
{"text":"I came to Romados quite a few times, always leaving satisfied. The chicken meals are packed with flavours. The spicy sauce, the salad dressing, the fries seasoning, everything is perfectly done. However, the chicken itself is a bit too dry for my liking. And the dining room is too small for the number of diners."}
{"text":"Ate here twice on our 5 day trip! Once for lunch and once for dinner. The food is absolutely amazing! I got a 1/4 dark meat with rice and salad along with a Sumol drink (orange soda) and it was so lovely. The meat was tender and flavourful and the staff were very friendly. The one problem was that when they asked to pay debit or cash, I asked if they took credit and the lady responded \"we do but I prefer debit\" was sort of odd... but the nonetheless everything else was great!"}
{"text":"**NOTE:  There is a pastry shop in the same building as the rotisserie chicken but the hours seem to pertain to the pastry shop FIRST since we got here at 10am on a Sunday expecting to grab some hot chicken but we had to wait until 11 for the actual restaurant portion opened up.  Yelp doesn't quite reflect this so if you want to be safe CALL! **  If you like roasted rotisserie chicken then you can do no wrong by coming to this place.  Is this going to be the very chicken you've ever had....EVER?  No but for the value and the sheer quantity of chicken goodness then look no further.  I came here with 3 friends and after working out the hours of operation snafu, we were first to enjoy the chicken!  We wisely decided on getting TWO 1/2 orders of chicken instead of 3 1/4 orders and we think that it was a wise decision as the portions of sheer STUFF they give you can be ridiculous (see photos).  If you like a slight kick make sure to have them apply their hot sauce onto the chicken for maximum flavor.  Each combo came with breast and thigh meat, a side salad, rice and a BOATLOAD of fries.  Seriously, it's crazy.  The fries themselves aren't bad (should've asked if they had ketchup), the rice was well seasoned though nothing out of this world.  Salad was...salad with a vinaigrette type dressing and the chicken was quite tasty.    I personally prefer the thigh meat but my friend (who prefers white meat) liked it especially when soaked in that delicious spicy sauce.  The chefs there were super friendly and the overall vibe of the place was pleasant.    There are quite a few tables to sit at if you want to enjoy the piping hot chicken immediately so go for it!"}
{"text":"Update: April 2016  So I walked over a mile to eat here this chilly late April afternoon and was not disappointed. Even better than the last time. Yes, great chicken and very nice staff helping this non-francophone.  This is a great place just beware that they do not accept credit cards, only debit cards or cash."}
{"text":"Good price value. Everything on the menu is pretty good, but they are competing with a lot of good Portuguese places in the area. The service could be a bit more friendly."}
{"text":"Not all that impressed here. The food is good but nothing I would come out of my way for.   Eats: - whole chicken which is the only reason I would come back. It was juicy from every bite. Skin had great flavor and was cooked just right - French fries.....ehhhh it was ok but I wouldn't order it again - Salad.......just lettuce with some onions and dressing, yes I know it's a salad but I would pay $3.00 for what was given.   Dislikes: - employees are not that friendly. I was a bit rushed which I don't like. I also needed to take something to go and took one of the white paper bags located on the counter and the woman behind the counter snatched the bag out of my hands and told me i can't use that bag......some advice it's a bag and if I can't use it for my \"to go\" things don't leave it out!!! - see top for French fries and salad - limited seating - no soap in the restroom - a little pricey   I would not come back.....sorry yelp reviewers I was misled this time."}
{"text":"Another must-visit on a trip to Montreal. This chicken is absolutely fantastic. The place is small with tables kind of crammed together. Get the chicken and eat it in the park a block away. I am not overly crazy about the enormous serving of fries dumped all over the chicken, but after awhile, they do grow on you."}
{"text":"It is horrid trying to get through traffic in Montreal just to get to Romados, but it was worth the frustration when we finally got our food. Rue Rachel was closed down and St Laurent was packed but we finally found a parking spot and made our way to Romados.  The place is pretty small and there was  a LONG line. The line on the left is for people who haven't phoned in an order and the line on the right was for people who had ordered by phone and is coming by for pickup. In my honest opinion, both lines seemed to be going at the same pace. There are also sodas on the side - I recommend the pineapple soda.  We ordered the $20 family meal which can easily feed a family of 3-4. A whole chicken chopped up, drenched in sauce, a HUGE bag of poutines, and a box of salad. ALL FOR $20. It is a cheap meal and fed my family of 4 pretty well.  The chicken is moist and the sauce goes really well with it. The poutines are AWESOME and are well salt and peppered. The salad has a vinagarette sauce which makes you less guilty for eating something that is so greasy. Overall, a really good meal that is flavorful.   There is limited seating and the place gets pretty packed. Most people were taking their food to go.  The servers were super friendly. Then again, most of the people that I've met in Montreal are super friendly.   Bottom Line: Traveling around Montreal? This is definitely a hole in the wall to try out!"}
{"text":"Another place that ppl are crazy about but it's always crowded and the \"spice\" is more just salt. I would recommend, the next time you feel for this, turn left off St-Laurent on to Rachel instead of right and go one block you will fine a much smaller little shop (Rotisserie Portugalia) turning out the same if not better tasting Portuguese chicken.  Just my 2cents"}
{"text":"Wow get your rotisserie on here! This spot is very popular so order to go or come off hours as there's only 5-6 tables.  Be sure to order as much as you can to avoid wishing you had more. I got a 1/2 spicy chicken combo covered in fries and small side salad for about $9. Whatever that sauce is I've got to get my hands on it! It's spicy sweet barbecuey sauce that got me feenin."}
{"text":"I'm dying after eating the half-chicken combo with fries, but it was definitely worth it. See you at the other side."}
{"text":"My heart (and stomach) is wavering: who has the better chicken in town? Romados or Coco Rico?  Romados' chicken is a bit smoky and has different layers of flavor (tangy. spicy) I'm literally biting and chewing on all the bones. Fries are delicious with the spicy sauce...And do they serve them by the bucket or something?  Coco Rico's chicken is a different specie. Bigger, juicy, and meat falls off the bone. It's less flavorful in terms of spices but it's so tasty. The potatoes melt in your mouth.  Finish off with a Portuguese egg tart :)  Romado's is better... No Coco Rico is.... No Romados... No Coco Rico... you get the picture!"}
{"text":"After watching Anthony Bourdain's Layover episode on Montreal, we found our way to Romados and were not disappointed. This place is seriously good. Huge portions at a very reasonable price makes this place a must visit while you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"So I have nothing to say against the food. The chicken is always super tasty and well cooked. My chicken sandwich was excellent and my salad was good. The only thing is I wish they put a bit more love in their service. I mean the lady literally throw a huge handful of salad in my styrofoam box, add way too much dressing and force the cover to close. So I'm walking with salad hanging out my box and dressing dripping all over...not the end of the world but I like love served with my food. That's all."}
{"text":"Their portions are HUGE! For under $10 you get a 1/2 chicken, salad, rice, french fries and a dinner roll. I could easily eat this for 2 maybe 3 meals. The chicken is quite delicious, very tender and juicy. The french fries are yummy and I don't know how they make their rice but there seems to be some seasoning infused in it which makes it quite yummy too! I had wanted to try their portuguese tarts too when I first went in but I was too stuffed by the end! It's usually pretty busy but the line goes pretty fast. The space is okay, the seating is a bit close to one another and can feel a bit cramped and sometimes all the seating it taken, but the food is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"This is the heaven for budget eating. The most delicious chicken in town + great fries and not to forget amazing salad sauce!   Tip: don't fill yourself with the fries at the beginning. Focus on the chicken. If u are not extremely hungry get the quarter + salad and fries. Half would be too much. Enjoy!  Tip2: don't forget to have a cup of coffee just across at cafe neve. Espresso will help to digest this food :)"}
{"text":"When I think of Montreal, Portuguese cuisine is not the first thought that comes to my mind.  Smoked meat and poutine may be the dishes that Montreal may be best known for, but you can add Portuguese Roast Chicken to that list.  At Rotisserie Romados, their Portuguese Roast Chicken is right up there with some of the best grilled chicken that I have eaten.  How good was the chicken? This was by far the best meal of my trip!  Located in The Plateau neighborhood, Rotisserie Romados is about an 8-10 minute walk from the Mont Royal Metro station.  Upon first glance, I honestly thought that the outside facade of the eatery reminded me of a church.  That being said, this \"church of chicken\" is a fairly small eatery with a few seats if you choose to eat in, but primarily a place to order take out.  Besides the roast chicken, Rotisserie Romados also has a bakery that serves up a pretty respectable selection of mouth watering Portuguese pastries.  As far as the food is concerned, let's just say that something is seriously wrong with you if you leave here hungry.  Eager to feast on some chicken that I had heard so much about, I ordered the 1/2 Chicken Plate that came with a salad and was covered with a  mountain of fries.  At only $8 CAD, this was such a great deal especially with the portions being so generous.  Grilled over charcoal, the roast chicken was extremely moist on the inside, but still retained a crispy crunch on the outside.  Although the chicken was probably tasty enough as is, I decided to have my chicken slathered with a spicy Piri Piri Sauce to get the full Portuguese Chicken experience since I had come all the way from Hawaii.  The spices from the Piri Piri sauce and the drippings from the chicken were the perfect sauce to dip my fries in to scoop up all that yummy flavor.  If this were not good enough, the lady at the register also added in a free dessert to my lunch.  This would be more than enough for most people, but I always have room for dessert.  I do not speak any French or Portuguese, but I made sure to remember the words \"Pastel De Nata.\"  This Portuguese Custard Tart was the perfect end to my chicken feast and just blew my mind by how creamy delicious it was.         Just writing this review makes my mouth water and brings back fond memories of my trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Même pas ce populaire rôti avec le coq qui sert lui même du poulet (!?!?) peut se comparer à Romados! no no no! La rôtisserie Romados est maintenant reconnu dans le monde de la restauration montréalaise comme une destination à ne pas manquer! Appelez d'avance pour éviter la file et optez pour la cuisse de poulet ÉPICÉE, c'est même pas discutable.  Les épices du poulet combinées avec celle de la sauce crée un party pour les papilles! La sauce est follement savoureuse et imbibe la montagne de frites incluent avec le poulet! Les frites sont croustillantes à souhait et déborde du plat! Pour se déculpabiliser un tantinet, ils servent également le tout avec une simple petite salade! Et surtout, n'oubliez pas d'acheter des petites tartelettes à votre sortie! Un must dans ce restaurant portugais! Et allez prendre un verre au Lab pour digérer ;)"}
{"text":"Good Portuguese chicken. Well done. Huge portions and the prices are reasonable. I usually add a couple of natas to my order (Portuguese egg tart). They are really good! Expect to wait in line during rush hours. The staff can sometimes be rude and cold but it's nothing against you. I guess if's because they've been doing this for so long that they're just bored! Lol! You know, \"been there, done that\" type of thing. ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing quarter leg with there special fries and a fresh salade. Sitting in restaurant next to window with the wonderful smell of fresh chicken cooking on charcoal grill."}
{"text":"Local renové , file d'attente plus rapide, prix plus elevé aussi mais on se bourre avec les frites qui debordent de l'assiette :)) Always good after a bike ride or after weeds at tam tam ;)"}
{"text":"Since this place is a few blocks from where I'm staying, I decided to give it a try. When I went inside there was a long line. I feel like when there is a long line it shows that the food is good and people are willing to wait for it.   I chose the chicken style meal. It came with fries and salad. The chicken was amazing! It was soft and the skin was crispy. It was also spicy which added extra flavor. I also tried the Portuguese egg tart. It was sweet and cold. I prefer egg tarts coming straight out."}
{"text":"WOWZA! Who would've thunk it that there were so many awesome ways to flip a chicken over a fire! I love Huli Huli (Hawaii), Peri Peri (Peru), Rotisserie Tandoori and just plain old BBQ Rotisserie!  Now I can add Portuguese chicken to my list.  Carnivores, Romados is a must eat when you are here in Montreal!  Like most great foods Romandos is located in a skech neighborhood (I was later informed that it is in fact a sought after neighborhood to live in so my bad! ) about .2mi away on a side street off of the post St. Denis but man it was worth the risk! As soon as you veer off of the main drag you can smell the chicken! Just follow your beak (no pun) and it will lead you to the spot.  The place looks fresh and remodeled. Judging by the setup, they are prepared for insane lines. Luckily for me there was no line at 8pm and I was in and out in less than 5 minutes.  I got a 1/2 chicken and some unnamed desserts; one tart and another thing that looked like an ice cream come.  Dude the chicken smell filled up my car and turned me into one of those eating and driving people that we all hate.   The chicken was awesome! No need for sauce, ketchup or any other dressings. It was nice and juicy and even glazed the fries with some of its awesome. The salad was a bust as the chicken was hot off the fire and caused the greens to wilt before I could eat it. Keep the greens and give me more chicken!  One last note: Cute Portuguese girls that speak French: Mind Blowing!!"}
{"text":"Grosse déception... Premièrement, je suis entré là un samedi vers 16h00, c'était bondé. Arrivé à moi et mes amis, plus de sandwich au poulet ni au porc effiloché disponibles, plus de riz, etc. Finalement, il ne restait seulement que la poitrine ou la cuisse avec frites. J'ai demandé pour une poutine sauce à côté, car je la voulais pour emporter, on m'a répondu que c'était impossible, politique du restaurant, de même pour la vinaigrette à salade. Même s'ils avaient les \"cups\" pour mettre la sauce à coté, ils ne voulaient simplement pas, même en insistant, ils n'ont pas pliés pour le client. Je me suis donc rabbatu sur la poitrine, comme le reste de mon groupe d'amis.  Le restaurant sais très bien que leur grosses journées sont le vendredi et la fin de semaine, alors pourquoi je gardent-ils pas un inventaire assez élevé pour fournir à la demande? Déjà qu'ils n'ont que 3 choix sur le menu, svp arrangez-vous pour au moins les avoirs toujours en stock.  Donc, pas de choix et un service assez médiocre. Je n'y remets plus les pieds."}
{"text":"Arriving at a good time, the lineup behind me got massive!   We only had 4-5 parties in front of us, and the line moved quickly.  The chicken is divine.   It is cooked on a rotisserie with a dry rub, and you can add a spicy sauce to it - which wasn't spicy at all, but very tasty.    They toss the chicken bits into a bag, and off you go.   There is minimal seating inside so plan to eat elsewhere - there is a nearby park with picnic tables we found.   Service is quick, and this place is popular for a reason - great chicken."}
{"text":"We had a rough idea of where this place was, but actually found it by following our noses. This was our first stop after rolling into town. We made our way inside and got in line with only a few people ahead of us. Once we took a good look at the menu, we noticed that the line behind us was out the door.   We picked up lunch, which was so delicious and filling that we didn't need dinner that day. For ~$8 for a half chicken, special sauce, small salad and boatload of fries it is a real bargain! It's a ton of food (especially if you aren't bashful with the fries) that remarkably leaves you feeling full in a good way.  The meal also came with a huge Portuguese-style roll that I didn't eat until the next day at breakfast.  The chicken was excellent - wings and legs were perfect, though the breast a little dry. The \"spicy\" sauce was a perfect touch, more an addition of flavor and moisture and a gentle hint of spice. It was a perfect dipping sauce for the fries at the end. The fries themselves were outstanding - seasoned to perfection with a hint of aromatic sweetness that seemed like celery. Yum!"}
{"text":"I love chicken any way you serve it, so when I saw this place on Yelp, I had to make it a stop on my food crawl. We came in around 9:30pm on a Saturday night and the place was pretty busy. It's order at the grill and pay at the counter type of establishment. Perfect for takeout! I ordered a 1/4 chicken meal which you have a choice of white or dark meat for a $1 difference. They only have two sauces that they slather on your chicken, mild or spicy. I highly suggest that you go with spicy. It's not incredibly spicy but it is extremely tasty! The meal comes with delicious, crispy fries (have them put a little sauce on that too), and a side salad (so you feel so bad for eating all of those fries). With a drink, my total came out to just shy of $10. Though, the amount of food I received could have fed me for 2 meals. They also have pastries and baked goods, which I wish I wasn't so full after the meal or I would've indulged. Overall, it's delicious, fast and affordable food and I'd happily eat there again."}
{"text":"Not much to add about this place which has not already been said, I had my first chicken from here when I lived on DeBullion over 15 years ago, at the time it was more of a grocery store but they made the chicken to go (you had to call to order for same day, or wait at least 45 min to an hour), now it is more of a take out food and bakery/deli.  Their chicken is very good with a smoky flavor and is home seasoned a la Portuguese, the fries are very good and try the grilled sardines, which are also very tasty.  The price is so affordable it is a must for students, and a score no matter what.  Hopefully they will keep making it as there seems to be a new controversy about the smoke emanating from places like this and the neighboring residence are complaining.  enjoy while you can this could be the end of an era.....to be continued"}
{"text":"Top notch Portugese chicken perfect for a picnic at nearby Parc Jeanne-Mance! The 1/4 chicken combo (with fries and salad) is my go-to. Portions are very large--for a meal under $10, it's really great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"It's just plain chicken with a pile of French fries - flavorless .  No chimicurri sauces.  Bland no paazing.  Yawn.  Guess it's considered cheap though for Montreal."}
{"text":"Romados is essential to anyone on a budget in Montreal. It's such a good deal that buying chicken alone here, already cooked and seasoned, can be cheaper than buying a chicken at the supermarket. The fries and salad are mediocre and I think the chicken is really the highlight here. You can reserve your chicken ahead of time to avoid waiting in line, so make sure to do that if you go during busy hours. Romados is simply the best budget meal you can buy in the area. Highly recommend."}
