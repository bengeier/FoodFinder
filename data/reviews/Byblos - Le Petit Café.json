{"text":"Pour gouter à des saveurs venues d'orient, venez tester ce petit restaurant très hors du commun :) Goûter le brunch omelette/feta, c'est un vrai délice !"}
{"text":"I loved the decor, ambiance.. Not overpowering.. but authentic, friendly and genuine...  The food is good, and has a homemade taste. I dont think they use many processed foods while preparing their dishes, which is great.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Byblos in years and was very happy to try it again. The menu is quite extensive so watch out if you have decision-making issues like me who just ended up ordering a bit of everything! I love their yogourt dips (especially the eggplant one) and their sweet bread and hummus- everything on the menu is a hit. Cafe-like atmosphere with lots of tables and room, very family friendly. Great tea selection. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We went here for a brunch, and it was so fantastic that we came back for dinner a few days later!  Unbelievably delicious food, friendly service, beautiful location in a cool neighborhood - I could not recommend it more highly.  I will definitely be coming back next time I am in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Terrific ambiance and a lovely option of foods and teas. Unfortunately I thought the young waitresses were rude and unhelpful."}
{"text":"Byblos is a charming cafe with wooden tables, a profusion of plants in the window, and assorted Persian art. The location is several blocks from a metro in a peaceful area filled with old trees and young professionals. The service was a bit slow, but it's a lovely place to linger if you have the time.   The cafe has a menu of daily specials and regular sides and appetizers. The servings are small, and a soup and salad might be delicious but they won't be filling. I loved the tomato barley soup and grilled eggplant salad I ordered - they were flavorful and light - but I would have loved more hearty veg options. A meal of many sides would have surely been both delicious and filling had I wanted to spend a more significant chunk of change.   There are a lot of vegetarian sides and omelettes, but all of the main dishes of the day had meat. There are a number of vegan sides and appetizers too, including what I ordered, but most of the veg options are heavy on yogurt and eggs."}
{"text":"Good, simple brunch in a sunny and cozy restaurant.  My boyfriend and I came here two days ago on Saturday at noon on a recommendation from a friend from Montreal. It wasn't our first choice, but by the end of our meal we were glad we came here.  After a 10 minute wait, we were seated and given some English menus, which was nice since we were coming from out of town and didn't know much French. The food on the menu looked really simple - sweet bread, eggs, omelettes, jam... But as I've often heard, a good meal doesn't have to be complicated, and that rings absolutely true for the food we had here. The feta cheese, nuts, and fresh herbs paired really nicely with the different breads they served on the side. The feta omelette that others have written about previously is also really unique and delicious. We also enjoyed the Iranian tea that came in individual teapots. For two, the bill came to just under $25.  We came in only for a quick breakfast before doing some sightseeing, but Byblos does seem like a place to read, relax, or have long conversations with friends. The restaurant was bright and nicely decorated with blankets over the benches, plants near the windows, and books and artwork on the walls. Service was nothing special, but we'd definitely come again for a relaxing meal."}
{"text":"Not outstanding service (pretty cold), the pastry was awful (pie). For that price I would have expected something much better...."}
{"text":"Had a delightful breakfast there. I ordered the feta omelette, which is made with plenty of feta (but not overpowering) with a great saltiness, garnished with dill. It came with pita and sesame and poppy seed bread and included a beverage. I had Iranian tea and sweetened it with cubed sugar.  They make many delicious varieties of jam, including rose petal. There were 5 of us so we were able to try 5 different types.   Overall, fine service and nice vibe. We went at 10am and there was space. By 11:30, there was a long lineup."}
{"text":"Best Iranian food in eastern North America. Ambience is lovely - simple but contemporary interior. Dinner was an hours long affair."}
{"text":"A bit overrated and overpriced. Food is good but not mind-blowing. I've tasted better persian and middle eastern breakfast/brunch food."}
{"text":"I did not like the brunch; the plate was stricly made of mashed eggs with feta. No fruits or sides. Only some dried bread that didn't feel fresh. Its quite disappointing, en also expensive for what you get. The tea was good though."}
{"text":"One of best tradition persian resturants in Canada. They have the best staff and the best selection of rare persian foods in Montreal. Try their \"Dizi\" on Sunday afternoons :)"}
{"text":"Endroit parfait pour un dîner à la fois simple et suffisamment sophistiqué. L'omelette feta et les pains orientaux sont délicieux, l'endroit est vaste et le service sincère. Les prix sont absolument adéquats. Convient tant à un repas en famille qu'en couple ou seul."}
{"text":"Love this place! If you go for breakfast, try the feta omelette. They make it the persian way and it is absolutely delicious. Their jams and marmelades are awesome too and come in different exotic flavours. Lunches and dinners are good too, but i prefer the breakfasts. Deserts are also unusual and to die for! Service can be a bit slow sometimes though, so don't be in a rush when you go there."}
{"text":"I like this place; have been there a couple of times; good quality food at a reasonable price"}
{"text":"After walking by this cafe a number of times and then reading so many great reviews on here, I made an in-person reservation for my birthday dinner. I love Persian food, and it had been years since I'd been to a Persian restaurant. I loved the decor and thought this would be a great place to enjoy my birthday. Sadly, it didn't deliver.  For one thing, the service was awful. The server pretty much ignored us, and the movement from course to course was so slow we wound up there for two and a half hours. That's a long time to be sitting in a restaurant if they aren't keeping you busy with multiple courses. The server offered only basic descriptions of the dishes available and wasn't able to answer my questions about how dishes were prepared. She kept saying \"I don't know,\" but she never offered to go to the kitchen and find out. I wasn't sure if it was simply that she didn't know the English words for some foods, but she knew that my companion spoke fluent French--as she chose to speak with him only in French-- and didn't attempt to answer my questions with his help either, so her inability to describe the food remains a mystery--and a shortcoming-- to me.  We ordered an appetizer and a salad to start. The salad--red cabbage and apples in a vinaigrette--was really more like a coleslaw. Uninteresting and just okay. The eggplant appetizer, a kind of pate similar to baba ghanouj in texture but flavored with pomegranate juice, was delicious, the standout of the meal as far as I'm concerned.  My companion's chicken entree was okay, with a nice sauce, but my lamb stew--which didn't come with any rice, though the menu had seemed to imply that all entrees did-- was flavorless and the lamb, tough. This stew didn't have any seasoning that said \"Persian\" to me. It was cooked in a sauce with a tomato base and some vegetables like carrots and potatoes. I didn't taste any spices, not even salt. I stole some of my companion's extra sauce that had come on the side with his chicken and poured it over, just so I could enjoy some flavor; at least that sauce was flavorful and delivered on its Persian roots.  The fruit compote dessert was nice. The tiny apricots--about the size of gooseberries--were infused in a rosewater sugar syrup. It would have been nice if the pits had been removed, but the fruits were served whole and were nevertheless enjoyable.  Overall, I was very disappointed, as I had looked forward to a special birthday meal. I don't see the cause for all of the high praise for this place here on Yelp, and I surely won't be back during the remainder of my monthlong stay in Montreal."}
{"text":"Food was so so and I was pick-pocketed while eating. They stole my money, credit cards, passport. Waitresses didn't really care..."}
{"text":"Everyone at our table enjoyed the Persian twist on breakfast at Byblos.  I had a meat roll as my main dish with a few purees as a compliment, but this is certainly a place where vegetarians will feel at home.  Service was very good and the decor/colors were very inviting.  This restaurant was recommended to us by a local whose flat we were renting around the corner and we were very glad we listened to her!"}
{"text":"Met two gal friends for weekday brunch.  Warm welcome and lovely service.  Since the feta omelet received such raves, this was what we chose. We were not dissapointed. Creamy, salty and delicious. Served with and assortment of breads (the sweet one is delicious!), homemade jams and Iranian tea (black tea with cardamom), it was the perfect meal for a chilly winter morning. This is a popular meeting spot for young moms and babies. Their sweet faces delighted us older women. We will definitely return to try many other dishes."}
{"text":"Alors au menu de notre brunch: jus de cactus et de raisins, pain oriental avec de la marmelade de fleur d'oranger à étaler dessus, et une préparation avec des oeufs! Là je peux vous dire qu'on sort des brunchs traditionnels, vraiment! Expérience à tester et à savourer!"}
{"text":"Un peu par hasard nous avons finalement pu tester le restaurant réputé de la rue Laurier en fin de semaine. Oui réputé! 27 ans que cette enseigne se trouve au coin Laurier-Fabre!  Déjà, j'adore l'ambiance et la décoration, les immenses fenêtres ouvertes par cette belle journée ensoleillé m'ont totalement enchantée.  Les plats iraniens ont l'air tous plus bons les uns que les autres, beaucoup de viandes grillés mais aussi leur fameux omelettes et quelques plats végé à base de légumes prouvent que ce restaurant sait ravir une clientèle diversifiée!  Les saveurs sont là dans mes aubergines grillées farcies aux poivrons, le tout accompagné de pita et d'un houmous délicieux!  Voilà un repas parfait, équilibré et original."}
{"text":"A great option off Laurier with unique eats. Brunch can get really busy, and service is often slow or can even forget you at times. Be assertive, and you will have an incredible meal. When in doubt, always order the house-made and seasonal jams. The feta omelette is not what you're used to, but absolutely delicious. It's also a popular place for families with young kids, but be prepared for a leisurely meal."}
{"text":"This petit café has been there for so long... And there are good reasons for this. I went again yesterday and as I was eating my feta with fresh herbs, halva, fresh bread, and rose petal-pistachio home-made jam, I felt I had a foot in the Middle East. The decor certainly helps to give this impression! It's quite popular but although we were third in line, we waited for less than 10 minutes and had a spot for the stroller as well (it was about 12:30pm on a Sunday). Speaking about kids: they are welcome there, high chairs are available as well as toys. Usually I have the feta omelette breakfast (delicious) but everything else I have tried is good too."}
{"text":"Depuis des années, la recette reste la même pour ce brunch apprécié du Petit Laurier, et c'est tant mieux car cela fonctionne et on en redemande !   À chacun de mes passages, j'opte pour la formule brunch n°4 :  - un thé iranien qui me transporte bien loin, - un assortiment de pain pita, pain sucré et pain fourré au pavot prêt à accueillir mes tartines de confiture et à aller jusqu'à saucer le pot, - une confiture à tomber : entre la carotte-orange-cardamome, la rose-pistache et lime-nectarine, mon cur balance (venez donc à plusieurs pour goûter à différentes saveurs) (la prochaine fois, j'achète quelques pots pour ramener chez nous !)  - une omelette au feta crémeuse et fondante à souhait avec ses morceaux d'oignons de printemps croquants et son aneth parfumée  Tout ça est tellement bon que je ne peux me résoudre à essayer autre chose !"}
{"text":"Loved the feta omelette! It has a creamy texture with lots of dill. Wifey got the tomato omelette and it was also excellent. The omelette is more like traditional scrambled eggs than the western style fold over omelette with items in the middle as popular in the US.  We had great seat next to the open window on a beautiful fall day.  The service was very good. Prices are reasonable. Located in a charming Montreal neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food here is made with love. It's so wholesome and delicious. We had the lamb strew and chicken with lentils. We also tried the assorted dips and tabouleh. Everything was fresh and delicious. Great service - everyone very friendly."}
{"text":"2 glasses of dirty water served in dirty glasses. The food could be served as a tourist attraction at the bland canyon. Seriously guys a few spices never hurt anyone.   Just because its \"authentic\" or \"traditional\" doesn't mean its good."}
{"text":"Un incontournable pour le brunch. Un peu coûteux mais j'ai bien aimé l'omelette au feta"}
{"text":"Decent food, decent prices, good service, wonderful tea, great ambiance and overall a lovely restaurant.  Come here if you're looking for a relaxing place for afternoon tea and snack.  Bring a book or read from their selection of books or magazines (recent National Geographic, for example)."}
{"text":"Such a disappointing dining experience.  Pleasant waitstaff and mellow vibe, but dull/bland/uncreative interpretations of otherwise delicious-sounding menu items.  For example, a flatbread sandwich listed as coming on \"pain oriental\" or \"oriental flatbread\" came on a tasteless whole wheat tortilla.  I was excited that they'd be whipping something fresh and interesting out of the oven, but instead, the breads, including the pita that accompany the meal, are nothing you couldn't find at any neighborhood grocery store.  The spinach roll was bland and the texture rather mushy.  The eggplant, spinach and garbanzo dips were each very underwhelming.  Definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I went to meet a  filmmaker friend at this cafe in East Laurier.  It was my first time in this part of town. It's located on a quaint part of the street with small shops, unlike West Laurier where it's much tonier.  The cafe is a hangout for many locals including artists, writers and filmmakers. The owner suggested I have the feta omelette. I never had anything like this before, but it's one of the most popular dishes. Hard to describe.  Similar to a creamy scramble eggs, but sweet with feta.  Great ambience and vive."}
{"text":"Nice nice place, service is quick, meal very tasty. Located in the middle of the \"petite france spot\" in the Plateau, this place will definitely charm you. Excellent service, friendly atmosphere and again great meals"}
{"text":"J'adore l'omelette qu'ils y servent, les confitures sont incroyables, mais le service est lent. On oublie les cafés à chaque fois, on nous sert tous à différents moments et c'est extrêmement long se faire service. Des fois t'as l'impression d'être complètement oublié dans le resto, les verres d'eau sont vides et on ne remplit pas les cafés. Par contre, la fameuse omelette est excellente."}
{"text":"I've been there only for breakfast. They serve you what they call Feta omelet: a secret mixture of, well, feta, eggs, butter and dill. Sounds ramdom, but tastes like no eggs you've ever had before.  You can also choose to go with the date omelet, or the oriental one. If you order the \"combo\", you'll get a coffee, homemade bread and homemade jam (the waitress will overwhelm you with her rose-carrot-ginger-orange-pistachio-lime - and it goes on...-  list of possible flavors) for about 9$. A deal.Very exotic, all of it served in a beautiful place, all of wood, with windows wide open during the Summer.   The only downer: the service is kinda slow... It's usually because the owner and her daughter are fighting about something, which is actually worth the wait.  Plus, the neighborhood is great: young and familial, with cheese and bread shops, organic and clothes stores. Everything you think Montreal should be!  Keep your eye out for all the Québec celebrities hanging out in this joint!! Not that you will necessarily recognize them if you don't live here, but anyhow, they usually wear sunglasses at night. Like our very Corey Hart."}
{"text":"Located on a quiet block in Montreal, Byblos has plenty of local business. We walked into this spacious, family-owned restaurant only to be greeted by friendly host.   Then, the owner himself came out to give us a rundown of the menu with passion and of course, thick Persian accent. He recommended we ordered the set menu for 4, which includes appetizers (bread and 4 dips), 4 entrees and 4 kinds of desserts. We accepted without protest.   The dips are outstanding with flavors including yogurt with cucumber, beans, garlic and another meaty one. They go perfectly with the warm house pita bread. For entree, we got chicken, lamb and beef and they all come with different style of rice. I love lamb the most because the rice is the tastiest but also the lamb is cooked to tender and flavorful.   We ended with 4 types of puddings and sorbet in a martini glass. I really enjoy the cucumber sorbet because it is truly refreshing and unique.   The restaurant is lovely with Persian arts on the wall and you don't feel rushed or too loud dining inside. I enjoy the food and company here and would recommend to tourists and locals alike."}
{"text":"Delicious food for a reasonable price. Really enjoyed our dinner (lamb, lentil soup, spinach/feta bourekas) and the atmosphere. Can't wait to try it for brunch!"}
{"text":"Très bonne place pour bruncher. Le classique est l'omelette au feta, bien sûr. Ce qui est plaisant de ce restaurant est le choix de confiture que vous avez pour vos pains. Je dis vos pains en plus, car c'est une bonne sélection de pains qui arrivent à votre table. En plus, c'est la propriétaire avec son accent qui vient prendre votre commande dans la majorité des cas!  Situé sur Laurier, loin des touristes de Mont-Royal, c'est parfait pour une petit brunch relax entre amis.  C'est aussi la place à bruncher préféré de ma blonde, c'est pas rien."}
{"text":"On a quiet saturday morning, I got transported magically in the Middle Eastern part pf the world through delicious plates filled with flavor.  Byblos offer a variety of middle eastern dishes that will leave hanging. Only thing is that I wish they would offer more fruits options like dates, \"figues\", etc....no fruits to the menu.   Great atmosphere / great for groups / great for singles!  ---  Un samedi matin calme, je fus transportée dans la méditerranée au travers de plats délicieux, remplis de saveur.  Byblos offre une variété de plats méditerranéens  qui vous laisseront l'eau à la bouche. Seul chose est que j'aurais voulu voir une variété de fruits tells que dattes, figues, etc... Pas de fruits au menu.   Belle atmoshpère / parfait pour groupes o personnes seules!"}
{"text":"Quel bel endroit lorsqu'on a envie d'un brunch original! Je me suis gâtée avec un #4: une omelette au choix (j'ai choisi l'orientale, qui était a base de pétales de roses, cardamome, lait et noix) , un panier de pains, confiture et café. On dit que l'omelette au feta est fantastique, mais je feelais sucré ce matin là. Comme de fait, j'ai adoré la légère touche sucrée apportée par le goût de rose (je pensais jamais dire ça mais ces temps-ci je trippe à manger des choses aux arômes de fleur, c'est normal?), c'était original et la texture n'a rien à voir avec nos omelette québécoise! C'était crémeux et délicat, un vrai délice. Pour la confiture j'ai opté pour pétales de rose et pistache (on sent un concept ici), mais ils ont une variété vraiment impressionnante, toutes faites maison!  Le panier de pain était tout aussi intéressant, je ne m'attendais pas a recevoir un panier plein! Ça nous donne aussi un indice sur l'ambiance de l'endroit: parfaite pour se retrouver en famille ou entre amis et choisir des plats à partager. Mais j'ai aimé la diversité du panier, il y avait du pain pita grillé, du pain au sésame et une genre de brioche sucrée, mon coup de coeur. Pour l'ambiance, c'est très \"cozy\", les murs sont tapissés d'une déco orientale charmante, et la musique n'est pas trop forte mais présente. Mon seul point faible est au niveau du service; les serveuses n'étaient pas très souriantes, et on m'a presque jetée dehors quand j'ai eu terminé de manger; j'avais dans l'intention de lire un peu en buvant la fin de ma tasse de café mais on a commencé à me demander si je voulais commander autre chose ou si je m'apprêtais à partir. Fine.  Verdict: Parfait pour se rassembler en famille ou entre amis pour jaser et partager un bon repas qui sort de la routine! Mais on n'y passe pas des heures à lire ou faire des devoirs; le wifi n'est pas disponible, ça lance un petit message je crois."}
{"text":"Des plats cuisinés, plein de finesse, des saveurs à découvrir. Les desserts aromatisés à l'eau de rose valent le détour, jusqu'au thé. Tout cela à des prix tout-à-fait accessibles, dans un cadre qui vous fait voyager au Moyen-Orient. L'équipe et la chef vont vous décrire avec gentillesse les plats iraniens."}
{"text":"Bon... comment dire. Déception? Disons que mes attentes étaient élevées, parce qu'on m'a dit tellement souvent que c'était l'endroit le plus génial de la rue Laurier (bon, ok, c'est mon ex qui disait toujours ça).   Les - (parce que c'est cool, finir sur une note positive): espresso correct, sans plus, chocolat chaud fade, attente très longue pour recevoir nos commandes (environ 25 minutes pour 3 breuvages chauds en milieu d'après-midi pas très achalandé), serveurs visiblement blasés (mais je leur pardonne, on est des humains après tout, ça arrive des journées dégueu).  Les +: le thé à la menthe est excellent (on comprend que c'est davantage dans leur palette que le chocolat chaud), ambiance agréable avec une clientèle variée (c'est très famille-friendly, on dirait!), emplacement intéressant, café lumineux et spacieux.   C'est sûrement un des endroits les plus géniaux de la rue Laurier, mon ex n'est visiblement pas la seule à le penser. C'était juste pas génial cette journée-là. J'y retournerai peut-être pour l'ambiance et le thé.. et pour essayer la bouffe que plein de gens semblent adorer. ;)"}
{"text":"When the elegant Persian woman approached the table to ask what we would like for brunch, her beautifully aged face did not hold back a single expression of her true feelings for our silly questions. For what some may perceive as attitude was in fact, pure glorious charm. The authenticity of Byblos runs through the hands of the cooks to your plate, as a gift to you.   For brunch, a spread of jellies was suggested to share with the table. Sharing is encouraged with all plates so get ready to grab and dip, don't be shy. The jellies ranged in flavour from rose to orange and cardamom to date. They're more drippy than traditional British or French jams you might have in mind. Be open.  The feta omelette was heralded by the group so if you're a first timer or haven't adventurered that way, might I suggest it.   Cactus grape juice, oh baby yes. Go for it."}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch a few times and agree with most of the Yelp reveiws that this is an unusual resto. If you are not a local it is a great place to people watch the Plateau Montreal scene.The menu is very interesting and requires a bit of study if you are not familar with the Persian food. The Feta omelette is a standout, creamy and flavorful and prepared like no other omellete that you may be  accustomed. The many other items that we tried were all tasty and \"exotic\",but, I must say nothing to write home about.The portions were plentiful lots of bread to fill up on and reasonably priced. So while overall its four stars its only three stars for the food. BTW its often crowded for brunch so its usually 20 -30 minutes to get food on the table, but the wait is so much fun checking out the peeps in the room."}
{"text":"L'endroit est beau et spacieux. Le service familiale et agréable. Les plats, typiques de cette cuisine, et le choix est cornélien. Les jus de fruits originaux et maisons (mangue raison, ananas et pomme). Lorsque l'on reçoit nos plats et qu'on les goûte on ne parle plus et on finit avec un sourire aux lèvres nos assiettes. Ça y est l'expérience est déjà terminé et on pense déjà à ce que l'on va manger la prochaine fois. Car oui il y aura une prochaine fois dans cette institution de la rue Laurier."}
{"text":"Let's jump right into it, I'm not Persian but I am no idiot either.  Byblos makes yummy dishes that allow us to experience textures, spices and flavors that you commonly wouldn't otherwise.   First, you want to get there early enough so you don't have to wait.  Unless, of course, you don't mind that part, like me.   Second, sit near the windows on a summer day.   Lastly, get a spread of items.  Don't do the American style of one HUGE dish of one item but rather get the small plates of sides/mezzes and share them.  It's likely that you haven't tried any one of them before.    Sip tea, eat soft breads with tantalizing marmalades, chat, laugh, eat slow and leave wanting to keep strolling around the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Such a perfect lunch  I was going with Kabab Toursh, my wife choose 3 small meals but with rich taste(pirashki,tourshe tare and chicken koko) The environment was great and unique ."}
{"text":"Premiere experience et je me vois plutot deçu. Le service est ennuyant et lent .( un jeune homme n y connaissant rien et perdu) Pour un petit dejeuner , et par rapport a la qualité, quantité, 70$ pour 4 j'ai trouvé ca bien trop cher.  C est un peu on vous amene la nourriture et apres, si tu veux d autres choses ou meme ta facture ... Et ben tu vas toi meme les chercher !  Pas impressionné du tout."}
{"text":"After Safran, in Nice (France) this is my second favorite Iranian restaurant outside Iran. Of course I still prefer my mom's dishes when it comes to hedonistic pleasures, but Byblos is not only about eating. You have to understand that Byblos is a concept restaurant: restaurants in Persian culture are strictly in a diners style. We go there to eat, which is fine... But, one goes to Byblos to meet friends, have a nice conversation in a cozy environment over a pot of finely brewed tea, pick up a book about Middle East and leaf through it, even work, and have some Mezze-like or snack-like light/raw meal and eventually, if one still feels lacking on sensorial pleasures, goes for a main dish.   The meals are by no means the most authentic, most delicious, or most copious Persian dishes you can get for your money in Montreal, but they taste homemade and real. I agree with the other commentator that they use more natural and less processed ingredients.   I give four stars over five to their food, but overal I love the experience, whether it is for a get-together, or a date, or just having a cup of tea while checking emails.   By the way, the patron is quite friendly and keeps checking on the tables to see if they miss anything, just like a Persian host."}
{"text":"Une bonne petite adresse bien dans son jus. Même le service un peu ronchon est charmant !  La cuisine est simple et bonne avec des plats du jour qui changent régulièrement. Prix très raisonnable !"}
{"text":"Même depuis qu'on est déménagés en banlieue, on continue d'y aller fréquemment (pour déjeuner). Leur omelette au féta est absolument incroyable (on a essayé à plusieurs reprises de la reproduire à la maison, mais rien n'y fait, elle n'est jamais aussi bonne). On se partage toujours à deux une assiette d'omelette au féta avec confiture à la pétale de rose et à la pistache et une assiette de féta crémeux avec herbes et halva. Chaque fois, c'est un petit festival dans ma bouche. Tellement, tellement bon dans sa simplicité. On voit que les ingrédients sont d'une qualité admirable : les olives, le féta, les noix de grenoble (tellement fraîches!). Le genre de place qui nous fait remettre en question notre connaissance de ces ingrédients. Un vrai voyage culinaire."}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable brunch with our baby and toddler at 9am on a Sunday morning. There was a baby or toddler at every table that they seated between 9 and 10 and the waitress (who I think may have been the owner) was just great with each family. She made sure all the littles were comfortable and happy. There's a great stash of toys you can bring to your table to keep the kids entertained too. My son was in heaven.   I haven't even mentioned the food yet! We had a traditional Persian breakfast with halva and sweet breads and rose petal jam. It was a great way to start our day."}
{"text":"What a lovely place. I love Persian food done right- and you'll definitely find it here."}
{"text":"Such a gem! Beautiful, authentic decoration and delicious food!! Cuisine is north Persian fusion. I had a rice and meat dish that was tender and moist. I would recommend forgoing the $20 entree-main-tea option and just sticking with the main. Recommend the specials. Really enjoyed this place and happy I went. Perfect for date night or to get some work done -- plenty of seating  to accommodate all. Half star off because I would have preferred some cheaper tea/dessert options."}
{"text":"À éviter pour le brunch. Le menu est assez limité et les omelettes ressemblent plutôt à des ufs brouillés. Dommage parce que, sur le papier, l'omelette orientale (avec pétales de rose, noix, etc.) et celle aux dattes semblaient délicieuses! Les portions sont aussi très petites et le service laisse à désirer. Décevant. Le décor a toutefois le mérite d'être original et \"authentique\". Il y a plusieurs autres restaurants sur Laurier ou Mont-Royal qui vous permettraient de mieux débuter votre journée!"}
{"text":"The service here is not great. They are friendly, but disappear for long periods of time. We stopped in for a small snack to hold us over before dinner. It was okay. The yogurts looked amazing and I'd recommend you give that a try. The juice is very fresh. My son had the mango grape. Get the iced coffee if you come!"}
{"text":"This place cozy and serves delicious Iranian cuisine!  The owners were friendly, and we enjoyed the trio of yogurt dips with flat bread to start, and split the Dizzy stew, which they only make on Sundays.  The owners were eager to show off the Dizzy and explain how to properly serve and eat this delicious lamb stew.  Very affordable, and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place. Delicious food, nice staffs. It is a unique restaurant because it keeps the axiom and root of itself. It does not a modern place but friendly and  lovely"}
{"text":"Un brunch dans un petit coin de paradis en Orient ! Si le lieu est joliment décoré, très lumineux et apaisant, il ne vole pas pour autant la vedette aux assiettes. J'y suis allée au mois de fevrier donc j'ai un peu oublié exactement ce que nous avions pris... Si ! Une omelette à la feta! Olala à se damner ! Le tout accompagné de pains orientaux avec un choix de confitures tout sauf traditionnelles !  A retester le soir !"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants close by. Have been here for lunch and dinner. The cucumber soup is fantastic and the restaurant is truly authentic. Try the dizzy on Sunday's if you have a big enough appetite. It's an amazing lamb stew. Even if you have something else, it's really neat seeing how the crowd changes from 20 something hipsters and young families to little old middle eastern men and women. Almost always the same people on Sunday early evenings.:) never been for breakfast  but after reading the reviews I'm definitely going to give it a try. love, love, love."}
{"text":"One of my top 3 breakfast/brunch spots in the city, this place has the most original and delicious omelettes I've ever had and it's pretty inside too with big windows and middle-eastern art everywhere.   My boyfriend and I order this exact thing every time we go: 1 feta & dill omelette, 1 date omelette with pastries and sesame buns, and an order of the feta, nuts & fine herbs with pita and rosewater jam.  Kapow! So good.  The only things that I do not love about this place are: a) that's it's a little tough to get to by metro and the parking situation is terrible, and b) the service is never great. The servers tend to be really busy and on the verge of grumpy but the food is so good that I still give it a 4 on 5."}

{"text":"Definitely order the tea and the feta omelete!  You will have a much more authentic experience if you share the dish with a group of friends. The big window gives a lot of light in the restaurant and simply make you feel wonderful. Food is amazing and I am here at least once a month religiously :)"}
{"text":"Sur la rue Laurier, Byblos est un restaurant qui sort de l'ordinaire et qui en a beaucoup à offrir! Le décor est rustique, en bois avec des accessoires rappelant le moyen orient.  Le soleil plombe sur les tables à travers les grosses fenêtres.  Le menu offre des plats en plusieurs chapitres avec des explications claires sous chacun des plats qui peuvent paraître inconnus pour plusieurs. Si vous y allez pour un brunch la fin de semaine, assurez vous d'arriver tôt puisque la file d'attente est assez longue. Les confitures sont faits maison et sont les unes plus créative que les autres (pétales de rose, ananas et gingembre...). Dans le brunch, ils ont également des omelettes... mais pas comme ceux que nous connaissons. Non non non, davantage comme des oeufs brouillés mais oh combien plus savoureux.  Le plus populaire étant omelette feta accompagné de pita et de pain soit sucré ou iranien.  Des omelettes plus surprenantes tel l'oriental (pétales de rose, sucre et cardamone) et celle aux dattes sont également à essayer si vous osez l'inconnu et vous avez la dent sucré.  Si vous aimez le gruau, optez pour le halym, une crème de blé onctueuse servi avec de la cannelle et de la cardamone. Et sirotez le tout avec le thé classique iranien servi dans une très jolie théière! Une merveilleuse façon de commencer un matin de fin de semaine quoi!"}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Byblos on a cool Wednesday evening and the place was relatively quiet based on what I've read from other reviews- though definitely not dead for a standard weekday night. The service was relatively attentive although, as others have noted, they didn't seem impressed with my ignorance of the menu.  For a shared and tasty appetizer plate, one pot of tea, two hot pockets and a pudding each we walked away from the resto having each spent $30. Ouch. I will say that the flavours and textures experienced throughout the meal were rather special, despite everything.  Moral of story when visiting Byblos: get the table d'hôte or go for breakfast (it seems?)-otherwise the portions are small and kind of expensive. I'd also go, when you can, with the Dizzy meal- that looked like way more fun."}
{"text":"Un endroit différent pour se donner rendez-vous. Petit déjeuner magrében. Décor et ambiance qui inspire la conversation et la détente."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch and had the shakshuka with minced meat. For those of you wondering what a shakshuka is... basically it's eggs sunny side up prepared in a delicious tomato sauce and well spiced. I have had  shakshuka at other restaurant and can say this one is pretty legit. I never had it with minced meat and really liked it.   I would recommend this dish to anyone who wants to try something more exotic than pancakes and basic eggs and omelettes :-)  As for the restaurant itself it is really cozy and they offer a great selection which makes it hard to make a choice. I will definitely go back for dinner and try their other items."}
