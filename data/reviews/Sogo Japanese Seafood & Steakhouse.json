{"text":"We too got banged for 18% because we have a lot of kids.  If you have a big family figure on the added cost of gratuity which unless you look at your ticket prior to paying they will not tell you it is added.  Then you turn around and tip them again on the total since they don't return the original ticket just your credit card reciept.  I would say it is boarder line stealing.  The salt added to the food is way to much.  You need to bring a gallon of water for the ride home and plot out the pit stops to use the bathroom from drinking so much to counter act the salt.  Do yourself a favor and skip this place.  No need to dine with thieves. These people have another yelp with may more reviews talking about similar issues. Be sure to check those reviews out also."}
{"text":"We brought our kids here hoping that the showmanship involved in the Hibachi experience would entertain them enough to save me a night of cooking. I'm happy to say my kids - ages 6 and 3 held it together through the meal. In fact, they did well enough that this frazzled mom actually got to taste the food. This is not good news. Husband and I ordered the steak and shrimp hibachi.  The kids each got the kid's chicken hibachi. We start with a bowl of soup.  No mystery to the recipe on the soup.  Open can of chicken broth.  Put in tiny bits of chicken, some dehydrated mushrooms and a few scallions.  The broth isn't even seasoned. Next comes some wilted iceburg lettuce smothered in whatever dressing you choose.  I asked for mine on the side but apparently the waitress wrote it down  on the side as \"swimming in dressing' and that's what I got.  inedible. When it came time for the grill our guy was decent.  He nailed the egg in the hat routine but failed at getting rice in anyone's mouth so instead he just sort of threw rice at us.  The shrimp appetizer actually came towwards the end of the meal.  The steak we ordered medium rare was well done.  The shrimp were rubber.  the only seasonings used were a giant vat of butter, oil, salt and pepper and an insane amount of soy sauce..  The noodles were actually straight-up inedible.  Another woman at our table ordered the filet and she sure wasted her money. Smalled filet I've ever seen and cooked all the way through despite her asking specifically for medium rare. Dinner here is expensive at nearly $20 or more for a plate.  The \"Japanese' chef (definately and amigo) did a good job with his knife show and was attentive to the kids.  Unfortunately the food was below average and if we're going to spend $75 per meal for a family of 4 then I'd like something better than chicken broth, iceburg lettuce drowning in disgusting salad dressing, over cooked steak and shrimp and low mein noodles so soaked in soy sauce that we couldn't choke them down. I'm afraid this place was a miss for us.  We'll avoid it for a while.  Hope it gets better."}
{"text":"Looking for quick, good Japanese? Best place for that, friendly people great location and best shrimp sauce other than the sit down version"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant and it will be my last time.  A group of us went there after church.  The host at the front was nice and we were were seated within the 15 minutes he told us upon arrival.     So why two stars... 1. The guy on the hibachi grill threw rice at us.  Ok, I've done plenty of hibachi and people should be asked before throwing rice for them to catch in their mouths.  After witnessing our situation the other side of the hibachi told their cook not to do that.  2.  After initially two in the group getting drink refills (at the start of our meal), our waiter played a disappearing  act and cups ran empty.  3.  Our bowls from the soup and salad remained in our tables the entire meal! 4.  We had to track the waiter down to get to-go boxes.  5.  We had to track the waiter down to get our checks.  Why was the table next to us getting their checks at the same time as us when their cook showed up 10 minutes after ours was done!   Habachi elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"My mom and I were excited to try a hibachi restaurant we had never been to. It was our first time there. It took a while for us to get seated: no problem -you do have to wait sometimes for a full grill. My mom ended up having to go to the bar to order another glass of wine and tell the bartender that no one had come to take our drink orders. It had been about 30 minutes at the time she went. The service over all was very slow. The food was average. I'm not sure if we'll be back or not."}
{"text":"Standard hibachi affair - nothing differentiated or special here. Very predictable."}
{"text":"Food - really good. Above average compared to other hibachi restaurants I've had. I got the hibachi chicken and steak. The ginger dressing for the salad was below average though.  Drinks - the cooler was apparently broken the day I went in so the beer selection was limited. But other drinks they were able to serve cold so I'm not sure what's going on.  Atmosphere - the place was really busy and live when I came in on a Thursday evening. Either a lot of people do their birthdays here or a lot of people said they had a birthday so that they could get some cake and have some staff members sing to them.  Service - the wait between us being seated and us having a hibachi chef at our table was almost an hour. We had salad and drinks in between but that wait was really long."}
{"text":"Most of the cooks are amazing! The best time to come is between 5-6 when they have the early bird. It's usually not as crowded and it is still great food and great service."}
{"text":"As always it was SO MUCH FUN! We  always go for my brother's birthday and it's always delicious and entertaining for everyone. Great vegetables and steak and seafood. The staff was very accommodating with all of the special dietary requirements.  We always get more food than we can eat so big score for next day lunch!"}
{"text":"I get heart palpation's and clammy when someone suggests that we go here and almost always the green apple quick step after we eat.   Food is generic, over salty and cooked by folks that aren't Japanese (possibly from me-hi-co amigo). It's so far from authentic hibachi it's laughable. At least kabuto and tsunami make the attempt of being Japanese with their sushi offerings, asian chefs and making you sit on the floor.   Sogo is a honkie generic stirfry joint with overly large portions. If you like that kind of thing then this is the place for you. With that said, its not horrible if you eat here for lunch on sunday but the wait is excruciatingly long.   I would have given one star but they get an extra from me for the wait staff. Drinks were kept full the entire time."}
{"text":"Saturday night so we expected a wait to be seated. We were pleasantly surprised when we had to wait only 20 mins. to get a table. Soup was as expected, should have ordered the shrimp sauce for my salad dressing because the ginger dressing was gross and dumped on wet lettuce like vomit.  That's when the fun began. From the point that our salad bowls were removed to the time our chef came to the table was one solid hour. To add insult to injury, our chef came to our table ready to cook, only to realize he had another table ahead of us! The waitress did not come back to check on us until about the 45th minute at which time she told us that there were only 4 chefs there tonight and that they were all still cooking. Once our chef did arrive, the performance was okay and the food was not very good. Needless to say, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff and food is below average. They made us wait over 30 min for others to join so they could justify getting a chef to the table. We got up and left after half an hour of waiting for more customers to come through the door, and we heard the staff tell the other staff we left because we probably coudn't pay."}
{"text":"First time getting take out. My husband ordered then sat at the bar for 45 min waiting on food. Not a single bartender or server asked him if he would like a drink. Once he got home they gave us the wrong appetizer, salad dressing and included two shrimp in our hibachi chicken. I am deathly allergic to shellfish and couldn't eat any of it. $35 down the drain. Never again."}
{"text":"Went to lunch for my birthday with my family. After 30 mins they still had not closed the table so that we could eat. We had to leave without eating. The manager still almost made us pay for our drinks and salads. I loved this place when it first opened, but it has gone down hill since it went under new management. Neither I, nor my family will be going back. We had had enough of the down grade in service, entertainment, and quality of food. I hope this helps in your decision NOT to eat here."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in our experience at Sogo.   They provided lots of rice that filled the plate.  Skimped on the vegetables.   The shrimp appetizers were two small shrimp.  They brought take home boxes to our table before we were finished eating followed by the checked.  They included 18% gratuity for parties of 6+ but when you got your credit card slip there was nothing shown in the tip section.  If you weren't careful you could easily double tip.  The chef was good and entertaining."}
{"text":"I use to come here often, food was great etc. Then one day the hostess was very rude to my family. Then would not seat us after we waited. We always liked coming here cause it was a nice place and they were friendly. I would recommend Kobe's Japanese Steakhouse for better service."}
{"text":"My son asked to eat here for his 15th birthday and we had a great experience. Our hibachi meals were great - salmon, scallops, shrimp, chicken and steak were all very good. The cook was fun and the portions were larger than Tsunami, so we'll probably go back. It was a busy Sunday night there. Apparently it's a popular spot."}
{"text":"Usually eat here quite frequently and while getting drink refills and such is usually slow the food is good. After tonight never again! Ordered chicken and steak with carrots and zucchini. Both the vegetables were undercooked and the carrots placed on the cook top where the shrimp was cooked. The cook never trimmed the streak of any of the fat and then like an after thought asked how we wanted it cooked. My dinner was inedible and I will not return."}
{"text":"Love, love, love their food. Food is very tasty, prices are excellent. Love the coupons as well. Don't live in Concord anymore, but always make it a point to stop here when in town."}
{"text":"Met up with some colleagues there. It was...meh..nothing special, the seating was a little crowded. Nothing about the food stood out. I did however, get my first taste of Sapporo and it was pretty decent considering it was from a can..worthy of at least one star in its own right. If someone else chooses to meet up there again I won't put up a fight, but it wouldn't be my choice!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever tonight !  When we checked in at 5:20pm on a Saturday the hostess said \"20 minutes\" as we continued to check in with estimated wait time the response was always 15 minutes! After 60 minutes my husband learned that the manager told the hostess to tell everyone it was 15 minutes.  WTF?!?? After 90 minutes of waiting and knowing 3 names were still in front of us... We walked out! Will not return again."}
{"text":"I'm a delivery driver and I delivered to someone who works in the restaurant and they didn't leave a tip. Not sure how you can work in a restaurant and not know how to tip. Can't trust this place."}
{"text":"More of a 2.5 than a 3, but a 2 seemed cruel. Nice place, but solely, 100% hibachi only. Also, they rely very heavily (ok only) on soy sauce and butter for seasoning. And the salad, as it is with any hibachi place, was terrible-looking. The miso was solid though. A very typical hibachi place, seen it before in many variances. Still, if you're looking for this act, the tables are not all crammed together and the atmosphere is fine. And if you're looking for quantity versus quality of food, you'll be very happy."}
{"text":"We visited Sogo for the first time this week. What a fun place to eat. There are several around this area, but this one is the only Teppanyaki style. What a great place to eat and entertain. Our kids loved the show, and I loved the food. We will definitely come again and recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Floors were so sticky that my flip flops got stuck to the floor more than once while I was walking. Came to celebrate a birthday but had a pretty terrible experience. Ordered shrimp hibachi and the appetizer shrimp were delicious. Unfortunately that was the only thing that was good. The main course shrimp was not the \"same shrimp\" according to them and I'm pretty sure it was rancid. Complained to the chef who seemed like this was a common complaint. They should get rid of whatever that horrible main course shrimp is and stick with the jumbo shrimp for all food served. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Ok. Let's start with the good:  Ok, moving on to the not so good: Service is slow, servers are not knowledgeable of their menu, and the hibachi steak taste like old dairy cows...if you live in the concord area do yourself a favor and drive the extra 10 mins to Tsunami-much better service and food. Each piece of sushi was about the size of a bojangles biscuit...maybe that's just a preference thing but I like smaller rolls. Food came out incorrectly 3 times-one person in our party has food allergies and they almost got him sick after we explained exactly how he needed his food prepared. I think it was the owner who we spoke with and he is about the rudest person I've met."}
{"text":"This place is probably the WORST all around restaurant I have ever been to. I actually created my yelp account due to the fact that I wanted to make other people aware and hopefully they will heed my warning.I doubt anyone will see this since I think I am the 5th review which means word is out already about how bad this place is...Where to start. Gave the lady at the register my order. Hibachi chicken/steak, no rice, add extra mushrooms and broccoli to sub for the rice. Cook steak to medium. After about 25 mins (no one else was in line or eating here) my bag of goodness shows up. Get home, and I was giving steak cooked to beef jerky, chicken so dry u poked it with a fork and it crumbled, no rice (they got that correct) and exactly 3 pieces of broccoli/mushrooms. The cheap US Foods horse carrots from china were bruised and black. Not edible-I called to let the lady know...her response was \"u can bring it back up to us and we will see what we can do.\" We'll-it's 7:00pm at night, I'm 15 mins away and trying to feed my kids...\"that's the best u can do\" I ask....she says \"we have policies\" lol ok Sogo-how bush league are u....EVERYONE WHO READS THIS GO TO HOKKAIDO UP THE STREET AND STAY AWAY FROM SOGO."}
{"text":"So I have heard about this place forever, but had never actually been there until last week.  I really enjoy Sogo express and figured It has to be good.    Our hibachit \"master\" was very nice, but was far from the best I've seen.  He tryed catching the egg with his spatula three seperate times and dropped them. Once on the floor and twice on the grill.  I felt bad for the guy but was thinking, \"please stop trying, you are just making it worse.\"  Then he tryed the same thing with throwing rice into peoples' mouths.  I could have thrown better than him.  But just like the little engine that could, he just kept on a chugging, throwing rice through the air until every single customer caught rice in their mouthes.  When we ordered, we asked for no vegetables.  ( I know, we are weirdos). Yet they still plopped heaping piles of vegetables on our plates, not just in the corner, all over.  Either way, we made due, brushed vegetables off to the side and dined.    The food was really the savior of the experience.  Their shrimp sauce is grade - A fantastic.  My fillet, shrimp and chicken were all cooked perfectly, and I left with one full, happy belly.  I would probably come back for the food, but will definitely hang out at the express a little more."}
{"text":"Great family owned place. Chefs are entertaining.  Filet mignon is so tender and the scallops are fresh and large.  The kids enjoy the fun as much as the food."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times and I've never been disappointed. I know the owner and he takes great care to ensure his customers are satisfied and full. And watching the cooks is a joy in its self , they do things with knives that I would not even try. If you want to have real Asian food from authentic cooks, you gotta go to Sogos. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I would say the performance before the actual food is much better and interesting. The food is not so delicious, only soy sauce flavor, could be better.  The rice is actually the best part, the others are just too salty."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here regularly because the food is fair and the kids like the hoopla that is Japanese Steakhouse dining but after our last visit we not be returning and are considering filing a lawsuit.  At my daughters 5th birthday we came in for dinner.  The meal was typical. For my daughters birthday they sang the song and gave her a cupcake but instead of a candle they put three large tip matches on the cupcake, lighting them just as we finished singing happy birthday.  My daughter blew them out and grabbed on to lick off the bottom, as kids commonly do, and the matches gave my daughter 2nd degree burns on her thumb and finger.  We paid full price, did not receive an apology.  I cannot get the owner on the phone and will not return my calls or refund any portion of the $200+ that we spend on our dinner.  These people are negligent and do not deserve to operate in a fragile market like Cabarrus Co."}
{"text":"Another year, another friend's birthday and another dreaded Hibachi dinner. Many Hibachi places all fail with epic proportions. For the price you pay, they fail with the food, the service, the chefs and last but not least, the portions. They all appear to operate in the same manner with the same bland seasonings and strict itinerary. My experiences have all been similar to the Coop; get in, get your food and get the F out!   Sogo is no different; no surprise here. They serve the standard iceberg lettuce salad with some type of shrimp sauce variation as dressing. A very strange miso soup with chicken (if you can call it that) and lastly a chop shop trained hibachi chef. Now our chef was actually good and pretty entertaining, but the poor saps at the table next to us didn't even get the \"egg roll\" joke. I didn't hear one peep from their chef; he was strictly business, like the repo man.   Sogo did have good service though and I applaud them for that. The filet was good, all else just average. The restaurant is somewhat small and you might be rubbing elbows with the table across the room if it's a full house. With the dining space being less then expansive, small tables come with the territory. So small in fact that our chef knocked over my Kirin Ichiban (oh hell no).  On the bright side though, sub par food can sometimes be compensated with large portions. In that respect, Sogo is a winner. Additionally if you tack on the restaurant.com coupon, we actually have a worthwhile dinner."}
{"text":"Take Out Review:   I had a Restaurant.com certificate to use and decided to cash in at Sogo. I'd never really heard of it but Japanese is my absolute favorite and IMO is pretty hard to mess up simple Hibachi, so I decided to give them a try. They do have online ordering, however, since I was using the certificate, this wasn't an option for me so I called it in. I was pleased with placing my order because it was quick and the man on the line understood me & vice versa, was friendly & repeated my order back to me correctly. When I picked up my order the Host was friendly and quick. I was very happy to see him handle my certificate so perfectly from my phone. A lot of times, using those things can be a hassle.  I ordered the Early Bird Special which was a Combo for 2 for $23.95; and the Seafood Tempura. For my combo I got the Steak & Shrimp. It comes with Soup, Salad & a Shrimp Appetizer. Instead of Salad I got double soup. The soup is basically the same broth you'd find at any Hibachi restaurant. But theirs was very flavorful. It had mushrooms in it and what looked/tasted like bits of chicken had sunk to the bottom. I can't be sure if it was chicken or not but it was good. I couldn't really tell what the shrimp appetizer was other than 1 bigger shrimp than what comes on the plate.   The Seafood Tempura's description only listed Scallops & Shrimp so I was pleasantly surprised to see veggies included as well. Broccoli, Mushrooms & Zucchini. I threw one in my mouth thinking it was broccoli and loved it but thought it had a weird texture. I grab another one and inspect it and found it was a mushroom... I hate mushrooms, But I guess not when they're tempura fried! lol! The tempura batter was delicious! They fried it nice and crispy. No mushy veggies. I'm sold!  I requested Mustard Sauce and was surprised when he said they had it. I always get it from my favorite Japanese restaurant & I hadn't found another place that tasted like that, until now. I can do without that white sauce, but it's normally my only choice unless I make that drive to my fav. I dipped the tip of my fork in it to verify the taste before I poured it on my food and got excited. It tasted just like my fav! I couldn't believe it. I got up and did the Money Dance. I don't bop, I do the money dance! Ayyyy! (Google It). But this seriously made my night. Everything was delicious! The steak was tender, the veggies were cooked nice, they gave me plenty of Rice. I'm not used to getting noodles, but they were really good as well. A lot of flavor. I smiled the entire time I ate and called at least 3 people to tell them about it. I. Was. In. Love!   The location of this place is going to be dangerous! It's wayyy to close to home! I'll definitely be giving dining in a try! Being as greedy as I am when it comes to Japanese, and as excited I was about my food, I ate my entire plate AND the appetizer. I was miserable and uncomfortable the rest of the night, I didn't go to sleep until around 1am, but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese steakhouse around, in my opinion! The chicken and steak are both phenomenal. However, my absolute favorite here is the rice! Yes, simply the rice. I don't know what they do but it is the best thing to eat here."}
