{"text":"I am NEVER EVER coming in this establishment again! Since changing the name from Floyds the service has been horrible! The food may be the same but the customer service is atrocious. The front counter staff look unhappy and more importantly treat the customers with disdain. I am not a person who spends my money anywhere that custom service is not a priority!"}
