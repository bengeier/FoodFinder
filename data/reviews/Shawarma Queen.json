{"text":"Love this place. Only decent shawarma place I've found in Brampton and it has never disappointed. I noticed a few bad reviews and honestly don't know what these people are comparing it to or they didn't bother to get any sauces which is the only explanation for the reviews claiming food has no taste. To the guy asking if the HOT SAUCE is spicy... really?? Lol anyways I usually get the Falafel Plate... falafel is dropped into fryer fresh upon order and I get all the sauces plus the spicy hot sauce. They have two types of rice to choose from... I'm personally not a big fan of the brown one because I don't like the cinnamon flavour but the yellow rice is deelish. The portions are big and I leave stuffed everytime. It's family run and the owner is super nice... the other two that are usually there while I don't find them rude like some other reviews mentioned they aren't necessarily the most outspoken friendly personalities out there but I'm not there to make friends. I get my 7.99 plate and leave satisfied every time!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great portions. 
Try the falafels.  If you want kebab, you'll have to wait, but it is well worth the wait. 

The plates are generous portions, and they are succulent!

I really enjoy this place, and keep coming back. 

Pretty sure this is the hidden gem for this type of food!"}
{"text":"Okay so I wanted to try this place out because I heard good reviews on it ! But I got one word to describe the food. SALTY!! SALTY SALTY SALTY SALTY SALTY. Everything from the chicken to the sauce to the pickled vegetables was salty. Maybe I came in on an off day, or maybe that batch of food was salty but I didn't like it. My biggest pet peeve about food, is it having too much salt, so this place really let me down. I got the chicken and beef shwarma plate. If you guys want amazing shwarma go to OSMOW's instead !!"}
{"text":"Shawarma Queen serves the best shawarmas I've had anywhere. Average prices, excellent quality. It was not yet listed on Yelp, so I just had to add them!"}
{"text":"Best Shawarma in all of Canada, try the falafel it is so fresh! And the owners are so friendly"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!
I go out of my way to eat here!

The owner is a veryy nice guy, and always a pleasure seeing him.
I used to go to osmows a lot but since they franchised its just not the same anymore.

This is BETTER! They really put a lot of thought and effort into the quality of the food.
it is in no way a high end ambiance, but great if you want some amazing tasting fresh food with friends.

highly recommend! we keep going back!"}
{"text":"The food was okay I got a chicken shawarma and it was ok I said I wanted everything only the first bite was spicy and the rest wasn't.  The only thing was good was the portion size it was pretty filling.  But I have had much better shawarma would I come back here? No unless I was in the area and there were no other options"}
{"text":"Best shawarma in brampton for me. Plenty of chicken in the pita wrap. Seems like double the chicken  you would get typically at other places. Nice and juicy"}
{"text":"Quaint, cosy, with delicious Mediterranean food. What more do you need? Authentic food, done fresh on the spot! Try the shawarma wrap with some falafel on the side. Careful you may end up becoming a regular here. shawarma is queen!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, and they're open a bit later than some other Shawarma places. To keep the review simple, it's fairly fresh and good quality; but there's not really a wow factor . The meat could use more seasoning and the sauces could use more punch too. But it's still okay, and open until 10, so not a bad option if you want Shawarma if you're nearby or it's after 9."}
{"text":"Best Shawarma I've ever had. Ordered the Chicken Shawarma dinner for around $9.99. Most delicious thing I've had in a long time! Huge portions."}
{"text":"A must go for middle eastern food lovers!! I ordered a small portion which was loaded with pickle , lettuce , hummus , chicken and sauce. The price is very reasonable at 5.99$ and 6.99$ for the large portion. 
Chicken is properly cooked and gels wonderfully well with fillings. Will love to try the plate next. 

Definatley coming back!!"}
{"text":"Decent shawarma plates. The chicken was okay but the beef was overly seasoned with cinnamon or whatever it is they use. Other then that, this place is alright"}
{"text":"Best Shawarma in the GTA. I grew up in Saudi so I have a pretty high standard when it comes to shawarma. Soooo good."}
{"text":"Ok I'm here to update my review, they actually have some really good shawarma my sister bought me a shawarma from here and it was sooo good compared to the on I had at pita pit, which made me really sick. But I highly recommend the shawarma's it's worth it!!!!!"}
{"text":"My go to place for shwarma. Really love the flavors. In both the rice and the meat. What I really like about the place is that the servers always make sure you know what youre getting. If youre ever unsure, be sure to ask them!

I'm not really a big fan of the wraps so I end up getting the rice dish instead but boy do they pack enough toppings and everything in there! You sort of forget that theres rice beneath everything including the meat and all of a sudden everything is gone!

Great place to eat at, despite the fact I don't always eat there, but when Indo, the quality is very good!"}
{"text":"Friendly owner, clean place but the shawarma not very tasty. It just taste bland. But not a bad place overall"}
{"text":"Best Shawarma in Brampton, hands down!! One of my most favorite places to pick up dinner for home (when it's daddy's turn to cook, hahah). I don't know how they do it or with what, but it seems to me their flavors in the meat and the rice (LOVE their yellow rice!) has me addicted for more. The kids love their shawarma plate with fries. No matter how many times I've been there, the experience is always the same...AMAZING FOOD AND STELLAR PEOPLE!! 
I can only recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Worth the money. They may not be the cheapest in price, but you do get what you paid for and maybe a little more. I actually think is a okay shawarma place in to check out"}
{"text":"Your food is terrible. Your rice tastes like cardboard and your chicken lacks flavour. Nothing special over here."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great service! We brought our hungry and slightly fussy toddler and the staff were so accommodating and friendly. The fries are tasty. The rice was really yummy. The chicken dishes are very moist and flavourful. Love this place and can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"This place is great, you get a good amount of food for the price. The owners are very friendly. Chicken shawarma plate is what I usually get and I can barely finish it with how much meat they give you. Only thing I wish they had was whole pickled peppers but they have banana peppers and a pepper puree so not a big deal."}
{"text":"I'm quite confused by the good reviews this place has gotten so far. I ordered a chicken shawarma and was surprised that it didn't taste authentic at all. Coming from a Egyptian background I'm extensively familiAr with Middle eastern food. Firstly I didn't like the way the chicken was seasoned and the humus and Tahini had no taste which overall made the sandwich have none. I felt more like I ordered this sandwich from pita pit or people who don't know what their doing. I think the people that eat here and like it don't come from middle eastern background and have nothing to compare it to."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Shawarma restaurant I have been to, based on all the reviews I have seen online; they must have all been written by the owners themselves. There is a total disregard for any form of customer service which starts with the attitude driven person who prepares your order, and gracefully ends with the rude woman who takes your money. Now if the food was any good I would forget about the service because I didn't go there to make friends, I went to have a good Shawarma. But sadly this wasn't the case, all the food they serve is a total joke and lacks any sort of flavour. After being hastefully told that their hot sauce was \"good\" when I specifically asked if it was spicy threw me off because it seemed that the guy himself was aware of the dog food he was/is serving to people. Nevertheless, I don't like to waste food no matter how bad it is, but this was a unique exception as I would't even serve what I ate there to my worst enemy (and even their worst enemy)! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best shawarma around! The mix plate is fantastic. Veggies are always fresh, and the hummus & chopped jalapenos are great! Recently tried falafel for the first time and it was amazing! The seasoned rice is REALLY good too; tastes like a hint of cinnamon or something. Would definitely recommend this place if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Oh man!  Holy macro talk about freshness! I had a great experience at this spot, great food and friendly service. Check em out, can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Really great Shawarma

food is high quality and there is a made at home flavour that you just won't get a big chains. 

Tahini can change the world... trust me"}
