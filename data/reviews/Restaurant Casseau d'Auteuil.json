{"text":"Really nice find in Vimont if you're a sub fan. This resto is easy to miss on a busy Laurentides boulevard unless you're really looking... and are looking at the right time of the year! They only operate during the summer and they've been open for decades.

I've been here a few times and I did not get any attitude from the staff. They were always friendly and efficient. Then again, i tend to treat folks who plaxe my order with kindness knowing full well they play a key part of delivering a positive food experience. In fact once they gave me an extra hot dog and when I nicely pointed it out the gentleman told me, \"I felt like giving you an extra one! Is that so bad?\" Absolutely not my man. Thanks!

The subs run a little different than the norm we tend to see. First of all, they only come in one size, 10\". Which are cut in half and toasted after the sub is ready so it really compacts it.... but it's delicious! The fries are good. The onion rings are great.

Price-tag is about normal. Will definitely be back!"}
