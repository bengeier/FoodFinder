{"text":"Great stuff. A good local business to support. The malt is wonderful, the service is quick and friendly. Thanks for being there! Have went back several times since first trying it.  They use Babcock Hall ice cream."}
{"text":"Great Ice Cream & Great View! They have old school candy for sale too that you can't find in other stores. Nice to have a local Ice Cream shop around Monona. Just a little Mom & Pop place. Fun!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable! So conveniently located across from the beach. Makes your day lounging or paddling complete!"}
{"text":"The cheeseburgers were great and the mocha macchiato hot fudge sundae was awesome nice small town charm with a 50s feel."}
{"text":"Old school ice cream and bait shop right on Lake Monona. Cycle, run or drive on over. Black and white tiled floor, old counter, and delicious ice cream and malts. Don't miss it!  Seasonal hours, Loo is tucked away and has steps so not for the handicapped."}
{"text":"COME ON!!  Your profile says you take credit cards.  You don't.  Now, I admit we came here because we live in Monona, heard about it as part of the lore.  So, my daughter is psyched, we walk in and see the NO CREDIT CARD sign.  I refuse to pay a fee they get to keep to use their ATM.  I would have gone to get cash, but when I factored in their choice of Babcock Ice Cream, which has just a few more chemicals and preservatives than Cedar Crest, I opted to head over to Michael's and grab a custard.  I'd love to support them, I'd love to try the place, but frankly the cost of doing business should be borne by the business owner, not me.  And, it's just not that expensive to accept plastic people, you have to factor in the increased volume of business you'd do, like mine."}
{"text":"Monona Bait & Ice Cream is the kind of place I imagine  my parents and grandparents went to a lot as a kid. Shop is set up right in the guys house and filled with ice cream (UW!) floats, sodas, shakes, malts, sundaes and sandwiches too! (Which by the way are gigantic and delicious!)   Aside from the cold treats, it has all kinds of retro 50's candy to buy. Takes you back to a different age.   If you're coming with kids, which I'm assuming a lot of you are, it's conveniently located across from a park on lake Monona with picnic tables and a playground. The ice cream shop has tables to sit at inside, on a screened in porch or outside.   I come here a lot with the little girl I nanny and the owner always remembers what she likes to eat. It's the little things :)"}
{"text":"Right out of Norman Rockwell painting, this place is Americana and wholesome and 1950's all rolled up in one. Great food, especially hand made sandwiches. Get a fizzy soda, malt or shake. Take a break on your bike ride.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Little ice cream shop with specialty sundaes. Very adorable, its a welcoming little house. Try the banana split! It has homemade hot fudge and caramel-mmmhmmmm."}
{"text":"Great local color in the Madison area. Out for a day on/around the lake? Come here, as the locals have been doing for a while. They feature excellent small-batch ice cream from UW Madison and it is a great summer experience. I was with a Mad-town native who insisted we had to go there after we got off a day on the boat on the lake, and she was right. Try one of the special sundaes."}
{"text":"Expensive but worth it! Perfect midway stop on the Lake Loop bike path. Really friendly staff! Love that it is UW made Ice cream - go badgers!"}
{"text":"This place is such a great find to stumble upon! It's so cute, we should support local businesses. The ice cream is great obviously and the view of the lake is wonderful. If you walk out on the pier, you can see the Capitol."}
{"text":"This is one of the best-kept secrets around. An old mom and pop soda jerk counter, ice cream, and true to Wisconsin, bait shop all rolled into one. Quaint, comfortable, and with a decent selection of lunch items including a daily soup. Nothing fancy, just lunch counter fare. And what's wrong with that?  The hours are seasonal, from mid-April until about the first weekend of October. So if you want get in before the season ends, make tracks!"}
{"text":"The cutest place to pit stop on a bike ride. Great service-had a young gentleman take our order and he was very pleasant and you could tell he enjoyed his job! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool! A hidden gem, really. There's not enough establishments around town to take advantage of the lake view, but luckily this quaint casual (seasonal) joint is one of them. I've had several different flavors of ice cream and none have blown me away. That's my reason for 4 stars. But I'll definitely be supporting this family owned business for years to come!"}
{"text":"Perfect lazy summer evening ice cream shop.  Love the old fashioned soda jerk counter (as a former junior member of the Nat'l Assoc of Soda Jerks, I'm obviously an expert! :P ) and classic ice cream sodas, although I remain a total sucker for the vanilla malt.  I have no experience with the bait shop, but they appear to have 5-7 worm varieties to choose from, so... there's that!"}
