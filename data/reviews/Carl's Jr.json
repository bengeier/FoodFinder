{"text":"Pretty eh.  I've certainly had worst fast food burgers, but given the relative wealth of burger options in Tempe, I can't imagine why anyone would stop here."}
{"text":"Yummmmmy, a little pricy folks but the toppings on the burger, the bun, those fry things, etc all very very good. Still mayhem with the new store in town but wow yum!!! I tried Carl's in Idaho a  few years ago & Penticton a couple years ago and very good burgers. You order your burger exactly how you like it including toppings and then find a place to sit if you can and they bring it out to you - it's as fresh as fresh can get, no sitting under a heat lamp here! Yummy :)"}
{"text":"This is not only the slowest drive thru EVER, they don't care a bit about customer service. They put barbecue sauce on ALL of their chicken sandwiches, or so they claimed, when I called to complain about my low carb chicken club being covered in sugary barbecue sauce.  (This is offered as a low carb menu item on their website). Instead of offering a refund they just acted like I was crazy for expecting what I ordered. Who doesn't love to wait absurd amounts of time in a drive thru to get something they didn't want!?!?!"}
{"text":"Pathetic service. This place is the worst run restaurant  I have ever been to. 20 minutes to get thru the drive thru smd then they got my order wrong. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Worse Carls Jr ever, what ever genius opened this spot didn't hire the right people!TERRIBLE SERVICE!! I'll NEVER come back here! I'd rather eat at the chevron and get food poisoning! At least the staff is nice and friendly there! Terrible CJs!!"}
{"text":"Went thru drive thru ordered the #3 Western Bacon Cheeseburger Combo, Upsell is something they don't lack on. From  upsizing to adding a cookie. Fries were nice and hot but the burger lacked presentation. Looked like it had been smashed down to fit in the bag. Taste was where it should be. Service is spot on."}
{"text":"I just tried it for the first time in YYC ....MEH!  The shake (choc) was kinda bland and watery and the whipped cream on it has no flavor, the onion rings were average - certainly not hot or that fresh.  The signature classic 6 dollar burger was actually more like $8.50 (grin) and it was a decent size half pound patty and the flavor was OK, but when you look at it the meat on the outside and when you bite into it  - its meat is grey!!  Kinda reminds me of White Castle's Rat Burger appearance.   That's pretty bizarre for a \"Charbroiled Burger\" ..... All in all it wasn't worth the $16.16 I paid for everything that's for damm sure.  I'll stick to Peter's."}
{"text":"I have made only one visit here, but I was impressed with the service and surprised by the quality of the food. Yes, this is a fast food place (or the  technical term is \"quick service\") and I would not try to convince anyone that it is something more. However, I ate at the Carl's Jr in the Vegas airport waiting for a flight to YYC and the food was somewhere south of good.  The McLeod Tr location was a different story. I ordered a Big Carl that arrived quickly. It was hot, fresh and flavourful. Fries were also hot and crisp. The Big Carl matched any of my other fave burgers from 5 Guys or Fat Burger."}
{"text":"Will not go here ever again and my family of 4 went between us 9 times a week. The manager did not get back with me after 2 wrong orders and he promised he would. SHAME of him. The workers are nice at this location. I know mistakes are made. He could of fixed it and blew me off."}
{"text":"This location is a hit or miss. I use to frequent almost daily, but the service and quality of the food is never the same. This morning I decided to give them another try after 4 months and they failed me once again and for the last time. I ordered biscuit and gravy and was give a spoon when I should have received a steak knife or a mini chain saw to cut through the biscuit.  The gravy was not hot, but not cold either.  I am not sure what is so difficult about the fast food places these days, but it seems most are going down hill and nobody cares. Tired of hearing \"what do you expect, it's fast food\". Be better and care about your job people."}
{"text":"Sitting in the Drive Thru so long I was able to do this review. This is ridiculous, over 10 minutes! Now I remember why I have not been to this location for 6 months.   The manager or franchisee should have more than 2 employees working. It's definitely not the employees fault. Saving money on payroll while giving poor customer service is not a sound business plan.   Not that it matters what my opinion is. Maybe I will try again in 6 months, or not."}
{"text":"Fast food my ass took forever to get our foods, service suck!!!! Employees doesn't understand English. I would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Good food but my god the drive thru is so slow. Ive sat there for 10 minutes waiting for a basic order."}
{"text":"Just a short note. Had several of the free coupons for food and decided to try the teryki burger. Went inside - server Lluvia - check # 0316-Tues May 6-5:25PM - I couldn't tell the name of the supervisor/shift mgr or whomever the \"gal in charge\" was. (she wasn't facing me but had a nametag on)I am assuming she was in charge as she was within earshot of customers asking another crew member if she would be the \"shift mgr\" - the other crew member(female)was reluctant-the mgr kept trying to convince her \"you can do it\" then going on and on abt how SHE herself did it in California - the server was polite but I did not care to know all the \"behind the scenes\" info going on. I come to Carl's a lot. I take advantage of all the great coupons you send me in the mail and I get with my order. Teryki burger was ok but we don't really like the bun - its hard.It seems like its wheat. Liked the regular old soft white ones. Turkey burger was good - again do not like the dark bun.  Do not mean to rag on Carls - just seems this visit wasn't the usual great customer service experience I usually have at this one."}
{"text":"They take foreverrrrrrrrr everytime! First time actually going in and it was super dirty!"}
{"text":"Attn: tourists, commuters and locals. It is not recommended that you stop here if you are on the clock, especially the drive through service. The staff are mostly apathetic teens. It doesn't appear that customer service is too high on their priority list. I have given this location the benefit of the doubt and have gone at different times of the day. No change."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE AND FACILITATION.  Not only was my food delivered to my table cold, but when it was remade the general manager handed me a tray very non apologetic (in open toed sandals might I add), and had no regards or one care in the world for what my family and I were experiencing.  I wouldn't recommend this place to my worse enemy."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. The times on yelp are incorrect and it is open.  The food was good and the people working there are friendly and helpful.  Def stop in for some grub!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and dirty facility. They always mess up my order and give me the wrong food. Poor customer service. I don't recommend this location."}
{"text":"I waited at the drive thru for a couple minutes for someone to greet me then I finally said Hello?  When drive thru boy finally helped me he was talking really fast & tried rushing me.  He kept in interrupting me every time I tried ordering something too.  Then waited literally 10-15 minutes sitting at the drive thru for my food.  Got home and looked like they just hurried up & slapped everything together.  Won't go here again.  Will go to Wendy's or Jack in the box instead.  Don't take it out on your customers because you suck at your job."}
{"text":"A couple of months ago, after waiting weeks for the long line ups around the block to taper off, my family finally had an opportunity to try Carl's Jr. Our first order, while quite expensive, was great. The Cris-Cut Fries were crispy and tasty. Our burgers and chicken sandwich were fresh, hot, on fresh buns, and looked as though care had been taken assembling them. The quality made the order worth the price.   Sadly, the inconsistency noted by another reviewer has become an issue. Out first few orders were great...then we began having messy, sloppy items, stale buns, cold food, and our last order was by far the worst! My Cris-Cut Fries were mixed with regular fries, and looked like I had the last dregs from the last of a bag - basically little broken pieces with only 2 whole fries?! My burger was lukewarm and while it was assembled a bit better than my last order, the bun is dry.   For the prices charged, I had expected the quality to remain consistent, but it seems either the staff are different or sick of having gainful employment. Since Arby's, Wendy's and Subway all seemed to have given up providing quality food, I was hopeful that Carl's Jr. would be a good alternative and continue to offer the food they started our serving. Apparently, I was wrong. I think today was my last Carl's Jr. order."}
{"text":"I had only gone through the drive through at this location. The food was decent enough. Made the mistake of going inside and used the restroom first...Horrible! It is said that you can tell how clean the kitchen is by how the bathrooms are maintained. I really hope that would be untrue - but I seriously doubt it. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Only come here when i am in a hurry, and need food(i work across the street). Food a lot of the times looks nasty(i know its fast food) but i have returned food a couple times... But the worst part is the customer service just sucks completely!!! I have been there through many of their employees and they are all miserable and rude..."}
{"text":"I love this place the staff members are great I come here very often the food is amazing and my Order always is ready in around 3-4 minutes"}
{"text":"The burgers here are yucky! The meat was tough and if you do go there don't look at the meat. The meat looks so unappetizing, I can't even describe how gross it looked. It was hard to eat the burger because it was sloppier then any other burger I have ever eaten. They put the veg on the bottom and the whole thing slips around and falls apart. The taste was similar to a Whopper, but Whoppers taste better. I had the Oreo milk shake after and it was a good milkshake. I would go there to get another one, not because it's anything special just because it's convenient."}
{"text":"I have come here a few times and each time has been hit and miss between items on the menu. Service was usually decent. Wait was usually long in the drive-thru.  Tonight was the last time though. I only went there because I got a coupon here and there.. no more. The dude was rude on the intercom totally rushing me and being annoying. I get up there after waiting forever and he only gives me half the discount because he swiped my card before I gave him the coupon. He didn't tell me either he just tried to sneak it. I had already told him when I ordered that I had a coupon and he could have asked a manager for help. He was still rushing me out of there even more since he knew he was being sneaky.  So my wife got the 5 piece chicken tenders... I only thought it was chicken because it was labeled as such. It smelled like straight up chemicals. It tasted the same. Like urine chemicals........  I wanted to get my money back but didn't want to go in there and I was just over it. I am pissed to have wasted $6 on chemical chicken and the loss of coupon though.  Then I had 10 mins to shop at SuperTarget because Carl's Jr took so long and it was almost 9pm.  Done."}
{"text":"The burgers still ok now you can get bigger size on the meat but I don't recommend the salads not good  I rather buy lettuce and make own salad than buy another from there From now on I only will buy burgers!!!!"}
{"text":"This location is horrible. .. the longest waits ever!! I have came here several times an each time is the same. I just ordered 2 chicken strip meals an after waiting at window for 10 min they asked me to pull up an park in front because they just dropped my chick3n strips.  Wow really what were they doing for the 10 min I was at the window.. iv been parked for 7 minutes an still no food. My baby is crying , im hungry, an this is just dumb..... I didnt even see a manager..."}
{"text":"I have been to this store 3 times... and each time, I was greeted by slow, unfriendly, and apathetic cashiers. They literally act like they are doing you a favor by taking your order. I will never patronize this store, again!"}
{"text":"I went to this place on 12/14/15 and a worker by the named of Jesus was making racial comments as I was ordering. And to top that off after I paid for my order and left, somehow they charged my card for another amount. Now I have to go through the hassel of trying to dispute this with my card. I will be filing a complaint on this restaurant and finding out who owns this dump."}
{"text":"10/17/17 Yelp Review Car's Jr 5378 S Power Rd Gilbert, AZ (480) 279-1743  Based on my recent visits, if I could rate the Carl's Jr on South Power Road off Hwy 202 lower on this website, I would. Their drive-through service is slow and disjointed, their food is unfinishable, and the overall atmosphere inside the restaurant is dirty and unwelcoming. My wife and I sometimes like to deviate from the normality of cooking at home and 'splurge' for quick and filling fast-food. From our choice of menu items, we usually decide on hamburgers and fries to scratch our itch. Over the years, we have satisfied our cravings from local Carl's Jr restaurant close to where we used to live. We have recently moved into the Mesa area and have found that, unfortunately, the Carl's Jr in Gilbert does not live up to even the lowest of meager expectations.  First of all, the service is extremely disappointing. Whether a customer is going through the drive-through or braves the inside counter, the result is the same. Expect long waits, incomplete orders, employees that could care less of having gainful employment, and poor management. The speaker equipment at the drive-through has seen better days and does no favors to the staff or the customer trying to decipher each other's garbled voices. Once a patron has finished the monumental task of placing their order after correcting numerous errors, the wait staff has spent an exorbitant amount of time convincing the customer he has caused an inconvenience and is somehow responsible for wasting the time of the person behind the cash register.   Next, the food requires immediate improvement. My favorite hamburger is the boneless pork rib hamburger (recently made famous by Shark Tank). As you take your first bite, you will unfortunately find you can't decide whether the pork tastes like bad beef, or the beef tastes like bad pork. The normally crispy onion rings have the consistency of caramelized onions. The barbeque sauce slathered in-between the dried buns are the only redeeming quality (probably because the staff doesn't make it), but cannot save the overall product. Being a believer in second chances, I have tried to consume this product on two occasions, throwing away large portions of both before finished.  Finally, the choice to dine inside the restaurant is one a customer will instantly regret. I'm no expert, but I generally believe patrons would rather not sit and sweat while waiting to eat. The napkins dipped in cold water that you use to wipe off your table (because no one else seems to think that fits into their job description) provides little relief. Also, I can provide great assurance that no one should follow the '5-second rule' if they manage to drop a French fry. It would be best to leave it on the floor with all the other fries, dirt clumps, and generalized litter.  God knows you have a choice of places to eat comfort food. Whether your choice is a restaurant that serves a hamburger and fries, tacos, or chicken (or anything else for that matter), the Carl's Jr on South Power Road should not be included."}
{"text":"WORST experience EVER!!!!! never have i ate anywhere to the level of grossness this place offered. They actually served me garbage for food. I ordered a chicken sandwich i got to work took the bun off put some ketchup then took a bite of my burger it was so stale and hard i immediately spit it out. So after being in shock of what just happened i took the bun off once again and saw some of my lettuce was black. And the worst part it that the chicken patty was grey with some spots of meat missing inside its really hard to explain when i called the manager she really was not too concerned with the quality offered me to remake the burger . I couldn't possibly eat at that location again. She then offered me a free burger coupon i had to go and pick it up at the carls jr. So when i got there i went inside for my refund and it was not the best looking inside either all the employees seemed to not even care that they served me that and they gave me a small fountain cup while i waited and the soda was flat. I then realized the problem is with management and not running that location right.  Lack of employee quality.   you can even see how  stiff the chicken looks on the pictures i took."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a track record for getting the orders wrong, and also for serving them way too late. The service is worse. The staff will quicker make fun of you than help you out. There is another Carl's 15 minutes down the freeway on Dysart, it's worth the extra trip."}
{"text":"This is the conversation I just had at the drive through: Carl's: would you like to try our all American burger? Me: no thank you. Can I get two all natural burgers, one with no tomatoes? Carl's: ok, so two all American burgers? Do you want those in a meal? Me: no, I want two all natural burgers, one with no tomatoes. No meal, just the burgers. Carl's: ok. Do you want 1/2lb or 1/3lb? Me: don't they come single patty or double? Carl's: yes we can do single patty on those. Me: ok, both single patty then please. ...then I ordered a kids meal... .......then I waited in the drive through behind only 2 cars for about 15 mins. I know the car in front of me only ordered a kids meal because it was on the screen when I pulled up, and I had to sit and wait for carl's to take my order for about 5 minutes, so I had plenty of time to notice....... ...........THEN when I got my food and got home and my husband opened the bag and unwrapped his burger, we realized we did, in fact, end up with two all American burgers instead of two all natural burgers. They have hotdogs and potato chips ON TOP OF THE BURGER!!!! Can you say disgusting?? I won't be going to that Carl's again. I'd rather go out of my way and stop at a different one!"}
{"text":"Don't go here. The drive thru staff is incompetent, and no matter how simple your order is they will find a way to screw it up. I live right around d the corner and this location is CONSISTENTLY a let down."}
{"text":"Get your orders right, or quit.  This is the 2nd most horrible place in peoria to eat.  They never get the food right, they don't speak english.  Arpaio, if you need a place to check out, this would be it."}
{"text":"I have been to Carl's Jr. a few times but this will be my first official review of the restaurant.   A colleague of mine told me that there was a new fast food joint from the United States that just opened in Calgary and my first thought was the famous In-N-Out but boy was I wrong when I found out it was Carl's Jr. - another powerhouse fast food restaurant from SoCal (slang for South California). Now I've been to Carl's Jr. in the States but rest assure my experience here cannot compete to my experience in the States, yes they great you with a \"welcome to Carl's Jr. may I take your order?\" followed by an employee delivering your food to your table but in the States they take it up a notch. I won't go into detail because I'm not reviewing an American experience but a Canadian experience.  Did you know.....that the building Carl's Jr. is in was an old Arby's location? Besides Carl's is Starbucks then a few steps away is Earls followed by SAIT across the street and Sushi BBQ Inn just going north on 16th Ave. I think the location is perfect since there's not a local burger joint competitor within a 5 block radius.  The menu consist of a variety of burgers to choose from, salads, sides, beverages and dessert. I had ordered a double teriyaki beef burger with a medium size choose your own fountain drink and medium size \"naturally cut\" fries. I'll be honest for a combo that's $12.75 after tax I would think it would be money's worth but to me it looks like a basic combo that I can get from any competitor, what I find odd is that I had two slices of pineapple in my burger...since when do you have pineapple with teriyaki or let alone in a burger? The sauce was decent, the fries on the other hand looked store bought as if you can just go to Walmart and buy a package of McCain's straight cut fries - nothing special to it. The presentation made up for it though. If you want money's worth in just a burger alone from Carl's Jr. then I recommend any burger with \"1/2 lb\" labelled on it if not there's always another burger joint just driving distance away. Maybe the next time I swing by and write another review it will be better."}
{"text":"So happy that a Carl's Jr is now in Surprise.  The location is clean and nice inside. There hamburgers are good and shakes are too.  We like the fast food chain out of all the others that are in the area."}
{"text":"I live Carl's Jr. I went through the drive thru so I can not mention what the inside of the store is like but the drive thru was okay. The staff at least got my order right which is not happened at other drive thru places.  I would go here again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Food good, but stingy with the condiments and don't expect fair portions... It is like the lady manager never wants anyone to get a good deal with a coupon or even get ketchup packets.... very weird the stinginess.  Very good food, clean enviroment including restroom, staff was very friendly, except when we asked for more than two packets of ketchup. overall it was excellent, next time we go we are gona bring a bottle of ketchup from home, mano mano"}
{"text":"We will probably never go again.  It seemed to take forever in the drive thru, but by the time we decided to leave we were blocked in. 45 mins later we got our food, no ice available for the drink and they charged our card twice. Unreal."}
{"text":"I will never go back to this sad excuse of a restaurant! Ordered my food and was given a bag containing half of my order. Plus when ordering breakfast who orders french fries? And yet that was what i was given. Plus when i went to the counter to try and get the rest of my order i was ignored. When the guy on the counter finally realized what was wrong he told another girl to finish my order. She the proceeded to hand out four other orders and take the orders from three other people. During all this my food was sitting on the warmer. Finally the guy running drive thru got the rest of my order and handed it to me.  No sorry or anything."}
{"text":"I'm giving this Carl's Jr. one star for every Carl's Jr. out there.  Back home, Hardee's is THE place for breakfast.  The best biscuits in any fast food chain for sure (even better than Bojangles!)  I pull up to Carl's Jr. this morning expecting to be greeted by a menu chock full of delicous, biscuity breakfast goods.  No dice.  I told them I hated them and drove off, vowing never to return again.  And I still haven't gotten my fast food buttermilk biscuit fix in Vegas."}
{"text":"So i went here one late night freaking starving! So I decided to get something real quick. This carls jr was the first fast food I spotted. And my experience in this particular carls jr drive thru was theee worst service I have experienced in my life! First of all the woman at the drive thru took at least 3minutes to even respond and she got my order wrong twice! I actually had to pull up to the srive thru wondow because she could not get my order correct. Finally she gives me total with a rude tone and slams the window in my face while Im asking very politely if she can repeat my order. And to believe it or not that was only strike one for me! so finally she gets back to the window 5 min later (and I am not stretching the truth at all when I say she took 5 min) literally snatches the money from my hand (strike 2) and again slams the window in my face! Ugh! I was really getting to my very last nerve at this point. So she takes awhile to come back my food and of course she gets my order wrong. (strike 3) she over charged me! And surprisingly I kept my cool. So I drive away and get get home and she totally skimped me on my fries!  I dont know if this lady was out to get me or if someone is trying to test my patience! who knows! Maybe she was having a bad day and decided to take it out on me? But this is THE LAST TIME im ever eating carls jr EVERRR!"}
{"text":"I ate here on new years eve 2013, i were on a roadtrip from San Fransisco- LA- LV.  I had just arrived at Stratosphere from Los Angeles. So i looked at my yelp app to find the closest restaurant outside of the hotel so i saw that Carls Jr was close. We were met with a friendly face and even though we were tired and typical tourists(in my country a friendly face in a chain restaurant is VERY RARE). I had tried eating a Big Carl burger during my first stop in San Fransisco and liked it quite a bit but was a little bit decided because the atmosphere at the SF CJ was stress filled and a guy was arguing with the security guard for my whole stay.  There is something special with the burgers from Carls Jr and i can't figure it out. It basically tastes like a fine dining burger but is half the price of the ones you find further down the strip or at fine dining restaurants. My favorite is The Big Carl, i've also tried the Famous Star but i prefer the Big Carl.  During my American visit i had decided to try out all the larger chains and then sort of find my personal favorite. If i had to choose one chain for the rest of my life it would be CJ."}
{"text":"One of the worst quick lunches I've ever had.  I come in and order to someone who literally does not know english, and I speak no spanish.  My order was simple, a #7 no lettuce, and a honey mustard wrap- not lettuce.....guess what LETTUCE on both..amazing...  and, the chicken wrap (took picture) had a piece of chicken the size of a chicken nugget.   On top of the no english, and my order being wrong- they are ketchup nazi's...  they ask if you want ketchup for your fries and burger---they will give you a grand total 2 packets, if you ask for more they look at like your stealing and appear that they are offended you would ask for such a thing......star rating will drop to a 1 star if I poop my pants......."}
{"text":"This Carl's Jr. has gotten my order wrong or given me poor product the last three visits. First, three of the four sandwiches we ordered had the wrong toppings on them. Next, orders of zucchini came back as fries. We were still charged the higher price. Finally, today I ordered a shake. I got a small cup 3/4ths full with chocolate Milk in it!  All for $4.   I'm given up on this Watson road Jr. Three strikes are up!"}
{"text":"Food was alright, but with only 1 person ahead of me, it took 25 minutes to get my order... Not sure what happened... They were not sure either... I would be still waiting if I had not inquired... Offered a token apology and still took another 10 minutes to get my food"}
{"text":"Two of us went to Carl's Jr for lunch today and got the Bacon Thickburger, Guacamole Bacon Thickburger, and Chili Cheese Fries. I wanted to get the CrissCut Fries as well but didn't realize the girl misunderstood that I wanted the Chili Cheese Fries in addition and not instead of so she didn't put in the order.   The burgers were a lot larger than I expected and the toppings all were really fresh. There was a lot of guacamole which I loved. The one thing that didn't stand out is probably the most important, the patty. I really couldn't taste any beef and it reminded me of firm mushed tofu that's been grilled. I don't think I could tell the difference if you gave me that or a veggie patty. The chili fries were average and nothing to write home about.  Overall it wasn't a bad experience but I don't think I will be back with all the other options in the area."}
{"text":"It's your typical CJ's. I've giving it two stars because they didn't include a Green Burrito. Shame on you."}
{"text":"Service is always fantastic. The food is incredible. This place makes the best chicken. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Pros- tasty buger, nice atmosphere, large portions Cons-price, inconsistency of food  I had a six dollar burger meal with a medium combo and it was more th an enough for myself due to the large portion and cup size. The burger itself was very tasty, but still seemed like a fast food burger, just a higher quality one. For the price of 11.50 or so, i enjoyed a nice lunch."}
{"text":"Service was great, price was super expensive for only two people, and the assembly of my burger was extremely sloppy everything fell off of it and it got everywhere. I probably will never go back to this Carl's Jr. and I remember why I don't eat at fast food restaurants"}
{"text":"Okay, this is the worst!!! Went through the drive-thru 1:00p.m.  Only one there. Ordered a famous star 'no cheese'. Because I am allergic to diary products.  Order was ready the second I pulled up to the window to pay.  Hamburger was cold and was covered with cheese.  Didn't find out till I got home ( right around the corner). My fault for not checking it before I left the window.  They should repeat your order to you every time!  You shouldn't have to ask!  But no, I ordered fries as well, the only thing fresh!  My lunch was completely destroyed, had to throw the cold hamburger out, tried to remove the cheese but stuck to the cold burger.  Tried to call them to let them know and no one answered( about twenty rings, twice)!  My lesson make them repeat your order and double check everything before leaving that window, Take the wrapper off the burger and check it out!!!  Just shows they really don't give a shit!  Too much competition and they play it stupid!  No wonder I am the only one in line and the burger was cold!!!  Oh and by the way this was on a Saturday!  Go figure!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Carl's Jr in Calgary only deserves a 3 star review.  As an avid fan of the US chain restaurant I was excited to see them finally make the move to Calgary.  But like most American companies that migrate up North, we seem to get the \"light\" version and not the full experience. (places like Taco Bell and Target come to mind)  I would estimate that the Calgary location offers only about 80% of the full menu.  And that's not including the fact that they don't even serve the breakfast menu like the restaurants in the States do.  The biggest mistake they make is that they don't give the option of having your burger made with grilled Sourdough Buns.  This is one of biggest factors that sets them apart from other burger joints.  When I asked for my Western Bacon Burger to be made with a sourdough bun the cashier had no idea what I was talking about.  I found this very strange since even the location in Kamloops, BC offers sourdough buns.  Overall, them having a location in Calgary is better than nothing I guess.  But I live 25 minutes away so until they start offering the full Carl's Jr experience, I don't think I will be making the road trip very often."}
{"text":"I just ordered 4 of your new items \" California Classic,\" and after opening the bag it looked as though no care or attention were placed on my food. The burgers all of which were smashed and seemed to be thrown in as if in a hurry. It is now 9:18pm my time which means about 8:50 or so is when I picked up and ordered the foodZ this is absolutely ridiculous. I have no receipt as well and at this point I'm throwing the food away because it doesn't look appetizing and now I'm wondering if the same care that went into the packing went into the \"COOKING ???\" And no was not busy."}
{"text":"Had the place a few weeks ago. Was pretty good. Tasty burger, though the toppings I asked to be removed weren't, which included condiments, so that did knock it down a bit. Also was disappointed to discover no breakfast, as that's what I really wanted from this place. The location is out of my way as a transit user, so not sure if I'll be back without the breakfast offerings"}
{"text":"An upscale A&W.  This restaurant is free-standing, located where there was an all-you-can-eat Sushi bar.  Lots of staff, all of them doing everything else, except look after the customers.  They were friendly, though.  These guys have something a little different on the menu, besides the usual hamburgers.  At least something I have never seen before.  Instead of a beef or chicken paddy on a soggy bun, you can also get it wrapped in iceberg lettuce leaves.    It was damn good.  Although I thought the price was on the high side."}
{"text":"This place is DISGUSTING. I was craving a milkshake and it took 109 years to make it thennn when I finally got it, I kid you not, it had a FINGER NAIL CLIPPING in the whipped cream. I was so mortified and disgusted that I had to pull over on the side of the road and puke. I'll never eat at a Carl's Jr. again. THIS IS HELL FOOD!"}
{"text":"5 stars for Jordan...she as good as any restraunt server or better than. I dined in and and. was greatly suprised at the service. She even offered to refill our drink several times. Great change of pace for fast food.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever experienced in my life ever. Naomi needs to be either trained or fired. Completely unacceptable, been trying to reach the GM and DM(since the GM is conveniently on vacation) for 2 weeks now... no answer. Even Facebook and company hotline won't return any messages. Just give up Carl's. unacceptable."}
{"text":"Drive thru person was very sweet. The food, however was horrible. A $7 burger looks like that? Even the patty itself was off flavored. Where's the rib? Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Carl's has good variety for a fast food restaurant and the food is tasty. Every time I have been there, it has been very busy so expect a bit of a wait but they do a fairly god job getting orders out. My main complaint is that when it is busy the drive through line goes through the parking lot and onto the road blocking traffic. It can make it difficult to get in and out."}
{"text":"I came in for a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised to see a very clean store with a friendly face greeting me at the register. The order was delivered to my booth as I was waiting only minutes. I appreciate the atmosphere not to mention the men's room was clean. Thank you for a cool place to sit and eat my lunch."}
{"text":"Worst service  ever. They were so rude and un apologetic. I would say there young people  need to be re trained and the food was subpar."}
{"text":"After much anticipation and missing Palm Springs, CA Carls we were extremely disappointed to get 2 Cold hamburgers at 10:30am when it should be made fresh.  When the wait time for Cold would be the same amount of time we should have waited for fresh.  Also who wants a head of lettuce on your sandwich?"}
{"text":"this place is disgusting. My burger looked like it had a bunch of growths on it and it was the most disgusting thing to discover on my burger."}
{"text":"The worst carls jr. I have been to in the Pacific time Zone.  Welcome to whale-burger.   The service is slow and my food was cold.  If I wanted to reheat my food I would've bought it yesterday!  In the drive-thru there was only one car before our 3burger and 2side order, order and it took longer than 15mins because there was an issue with their order and the Carl's jr operator had to explain the situation to the other fat-neck turkeylegged-forearm smoking female customer why changing her order at the drive-thru window takes longer.  Hurry the famous-star up you double patty neck thickburger. Carl's jr operator, make that beached whale pull her smoking blowhole around so other people can get their already made food that's already sitting there getting cold which is all ready to be paid for and eaten.  There is a drive-thru line waiting to poach that humpback Honda accord and sell her to the Spring Mountain markets of Chinatown.  People are starving !  After expressing my displeasure, they acknowledged their mistake and tried to rectify the situation by offering a free drink and a cookie and then asked if we wanted any condiments and we requested ketchup and ranch for the fried zucchini.  Still displeased by being nurtured with sweets for our time from sitting in a \"fast food drive-thru\" we paid form our cold food and drive three major streets over home to eat our food.    The fried zucchini was cold and I had to put it in the oven.  The burgers were smashed and slopped together in such inattentive mess that there was sauce all over the wrapper coating the outside buns of the cold burgers.  As if the Carls jr food assembly line took their frustration out on the successive cars who's only crime was paying for food behind a bad customer's poor order.   The food literally looked like garbage.  Pieces of lettuce soaked in condiments sliding around inside a wrapper slapped together with squished tomatoes and a smashed bun made the food very unappealing to taste.   The only thing that wasn't cold was my shake which melted from waiting and is now sitting in my freezer to be frozen again."}
{"text":"I just went to this Carl's jr.  And Thomas cought us at the drive through and he had a great attitude was a pleasure to come across. Even though it was late and we did not have change for a $100 he went the extra mile and got change out of his wallet.  If you are out off trop & the 95 and need some late night munchies i suggest you go to carls jr n get a $5 all star meal."}
{"text":"One of the better fast food chains in Toronto. Burgers are a lot bigger than their competitors and taste better too."}
{"text":"Late night, heading back to the hotel and decide to try Carls Jrs. I got my food and headed down the road taking bites here and there in the dark, and the burger had no flavor, like it lacked seasoning or something. Get to my room and pull the burger out to finish it and find I'm eating RAW MEAT!! The burger was brown outside but RED inside. Fries were just \"alright\", so you can believe I won't go back again.."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure these guys made my hamburger and then smashed it with a hammer before placing it into the nag and handing it to me. What a mess. I think they also substituted the bacon with bacon flavored strips of rubber. I know it's fastfood, but have a shred of pride in what you do. People have to eat this stuff, make it presentable."}
{"text":"Close to work I come here often, however price has gone up $3.00 in two months If I am going to spend this kind of money I'll go to five guys"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Quite eating area. Average food.  Bathrooms were extremely dirty. Very slow drive thru service."}
{"text":"Took my husband to Carl's Jr this week. I was starving and ready for a great burger experience. On previous trips I've tried the Western burger (too much BBQ sauce), chicken strips (good), but I was looking for something better so I tried Dallas P's suggestion and got a Guacamole Burger and Waffle/Crosscut fries with a strawberry shake.  The guacamole burger was delicious, with a better taste than many I've had in higher priced restos.  The fries were too soft for my taste and the shake was good, but very sweet - I'd probably skip that next time. My husband got the Western double burger and it was a bit too much meat after all, and after tasting my guac' burger, he would get that next time.  Now we know where to go when we are craving a really tasty burger at a reasonable price - and we'll skip the sides/extra meat as you don't really need them.  The resto is amazingly clean and has a great diner feel. The booths are actually comfortable. The service was friendly, helpful and fast.  Well done!  Atmosphere *** Service **** Food ****"}
{"text":"McDonald's needs to take lessons from this Carl Jr's location! Customer service is truly superior! Don't know about you, but I'm tired of paying to be degraded by employees that are supposed to be courteous. I will gladly drive a few miles out of my way to go somewhere that treats me right. Your staff are all greatly appreciated by me, please don't lower your standards."}
{"text":"Come to ft his Carl's Jr. 3-4 times a week. And the past few times my breakfast has been horrible. Today my biscuits and gravy we're ice cold, hash browns old as if they we're sitting all morning. Took forever to order, and then took extra long to get my order. On top of that didn't get a receipt. To add to that service took so long I missed the bus.... might as well just go to McDonald's if service is this horrible. At least there food is hot......."}
{"text":"Lizafe was so friendly her Aloha spirit was so welcoming being we are new to the state...  she really knew we was local like her."}
{"text":"Counter Service was exceptional. I was blown away. Milkshake kick ass. Really Weird atmosphere, maybe because I used to go there a lot when it was an HMV."}
{"text":"yuck.  i remembered today why i havent eaten here in 10 years!   There is also nothing natural about that burger... dont walk... RUN the other way."}
{"text":"Called yesterday to ask a question, busy time of day, no answer. Approximately 6 minutes later, received a call back apologizing and asking how they could help me. OUTSTANDING service. Many restaurants that are not classified fast food could take a lesson from them"}
{"text":"This location is terrible ! I applied for a job at this location and they just kept giving me the run around.. I went in as a customer and got some food. I got a Super Star with cheese and it came with no cheese. I spoke  the manager about it and she didn't even show remorse. I'll never come back to this location. If they keep screwing up peoples orders they will be out of business."}
{"text":"Worst cjs in vegas..dont ever go drive thru i could not eat any part ...cold burger cold limp fries and for a long wait in drive thru whole experience has made me pass by every carls jr in nevada"}
{"text":"Got the big bag deal.  Not a bad deal.....2 cheeseburgers, small fry and small pop....PLUS a chocolate chip cookie.  Just right........cookie was phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"Well...this Carl's jr, seeing as it's in Vegas...is in the desert...lol no, not a mirage, though it might as well be. That desert sun is hot as h-e-double..you know the rest. So I get in there(I was meeting someone) and I ask for a water cup. I was responded to with...\"Yeah, we can't just give you one...you gotta make a purchase...\" Now mind you I was sweating, and so was the baby...yeah..that meant nothing, because I said...\"I will be making a purchase, I'm just waiting for someone\"...I was hit with a very haughty, \"Yeah, our manager just doesn't allow us, to just give you water without you buying something...\" I thought..\"eh whatever\" and was very tempted to respond with \"Yeah, well your manager is a schmuck\" in the same tone they were using, but I'm trying to grow my person, so I just walked away. The person I was meeting arrived and we ordered. He had a Memphis BBQ burger(with pulled pork, and onion strings on it) I ordered a teriyaki burger(has a fat slice of pineapple and teriyaki sauce on it) we ordered a criss cut fries to share, and the baby had a kids meal....and while i was filling the baby's soda cup, the soda fountain cut off. I told them, and they flipped a switch and it came on.(later as i was getting a refill, the machine was just plain off...they flipped the switch again) Now, I know that some places track the use of their products...but really?...do you really have to monitor the soda usages like THAT?...if I had come back for say a third refill on a kid size soda, would you have cussed me out and told me no? Look..it's really not that crucial...I did the math. It costs about $1.04 for 1 bag of dr. pepper syrup, and about $0.50 for a thing of carbon water. So that's $1.54. that makes about 500 sodas. plus you factor in, that they have about 10 different choices...all in all, they turn a huge profit on sodas alone...so I know they are not going broke. but whatever. Let's get down to business  THE SERVICE  Other than the Manager's cronies at the front, the lady who came to the table(Ms Unity) was very nice and helpful, and had our interests, and not the managers at heart. So I would give half a star to the cronies, and 5 stars to Ms Unity.   THE FOOD  The baby's food was hot, and she didn't complain, my burger was yummy, and so was the memphis bbq...although saying this...my personal opinion is this...heavy pork(bacon excluded) and burgers do not nutritionally go together.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! just saying..."}
{"text":"I have lived in this area for 20 years and this Carl's Jr. was not the best in town but sure wasn't as bad as it is now. How it is still in business is beyond me. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger today and buns was  not toasted and the burger was cold. This place is going to get someone sick. Take the drive to Jack in the box or Taco Bell around the corner."}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow to the point where you just want to give up.  There is a Taco Bell next door and a Jack In The Box across the street.  Will probably head to one of those places in the future.  Ordered pretzel breakfast sandwich and diet coke no ice.  Ended up with a pretzel sandwich that was so tough it could have passed for a tire tread and a diet coke with extra ice that tasted like pure chemicals and it couldn't be drank.....it probably could have been used as paint stripper.  Needless to say I definitely won't be back!!!"}
{"text":"First time going to a Carl's Jr. As per the first review for this location, I concur - staff were super-friendly - a thumbs up to them! The restaurant was spartan and modern looking in that franchisey way.  I had the 1/3rd lb Original Six Dollar burger combo ($14) - tasty, and certainly had a little wow factor. Burger had lettuce, tomato, onion and cheese, and the size was probably more than I needed. Fries were decent - maybe a notch on the McD fries. I enjoyed my meal in general. However, following the meal, I had that uneasy fast-food feeling of it not sitting quite right, but in general, I can't complain too much for a fast-food joint.  For a franchise burger place, I would say certainly operating above a McD's and BK, and coming in around an A&W's. Hero Burger certainly pips it with the quality of the food. However, with places like Holy Chuck across the road (Yonge & St Clair) for maybe the same money or a little more, Carl's Jr cannot compete with the gourmet burger scene popping up all over Toronto for freshness and taste. If it's niche is to muscle out the McD's and BK's, then it'll certainly achieve that!  One comment though on their marketing - although the sexy TV adverts for Carl's Jr appeal to the adolescent boy in me (ooer!), this is the 21st century and we should be beyond this sort of schlock!"}
{"text":"Just had the Big Country Breakfast Burrito. Great taste. Not big at all. Value for your dollar not so great. This is the second Carl's Jr I visited this week and portion sizes seem to be getting smaller and smaller. Not sure why Carl's Jr thinks this will get return business."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need to escape the glamour and the crowds of the strip and eat at somewhere cheap and easy. Now I'm not saying you should go out of your way for this place, but it was a great grab and go. The staff was nice and helpful and the food was very quick. It didn't really feel like we were starting to get into the unsavory parts of Las Vegas. For a Carl's Jr., you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A friend and I just had a western bacon cheeseburger, fries and a drink. The only thing that was fresh was the ice tea. I think the fries and burger had been in a warmer for a few hours. Well not be back too this Carl Jrs. I only rated it a one star because I can't leave it black."}
{"text":"The staff is great. The pre recording is ridiculous.  Showed up at 10pm not knowing what time they close (doesnt show on ywlp)...pre recording asked to order when i was ready. Not getting an answer back, i pulled up to the window. Dude didnt even bother to open the window, which i get. He said \"we're closed! Sorry!\" I told him the girl asked what i wanted. He said its a pre recording. What a joke. Robot customer service. Thanks guys that were here tonight (not your fault). Your pre recording is not a good idea."}
{"text":"I have been visiting this restaurant for 4 years now.  The employees are very courteous and the food is of good quality.  I have had very little problems aside from verbal communication issues with some of their employees that don't speak English very well."}
{"text":"I showed up at 5:45 for a breakfast burrito, and the people inside just kept walking around and watching tv. I waited for about ten minutes thinking they were just finishing something before taking my order. If you're notactually open 24 hours a day fix the hours online."}
{"text":"The food is alright. Nothing too special or different really.  The staff are friendly, bring food to the table, and clean the tables up after you leave or sometimes while you're still at the table they will ask if they can clear anything off the table. The milkshakes are good. The only thing that really bothered me is that the staff members took their breaks where the public sits and eats and they took up some of the nice two-person booths. When we were there, at least 2 staff members sat in these booths while on break, in two separate booths too not the same. Was kind of frustrating because I felt like the staff should have their own lunch room and not take up customer seating."}
{"text":"Ordered a Mexicano burito it got to me cold on once side and hot on the other.   Seriously they microwave their burito's? ?    Another complaint....their AC stinks.  It's always warm in there.   Come on guys this is Vegas... today was 111 degrees and this restaurant was barely 91 inside.  Don't come to this location..your wasting your time."}
{"text":"Slower than molasses. We ordered a four piece star chicken for our son. It took twenty minutes in the drive thru line just to get it. Good thing we didn't order anything else. This place is horrible. It's not like they're actually cooking anything inside... Don't understand why it's always consistently so slow."}
{"text":"I have been eating at carls jr for 30 years. Their restraints have always been good or bad, meaning you know which ones to eat at and which ones to avoid. This place was one of the good ones but appears to be making the move from good to bad. Yesterday, the food was horrible and incorrectly made, the restaurant and the bathroom were both dirty, and the service was not good. It was as if the manager was AWOL and the workers did not care about their jobs enough to step up and run the place correctly. I don't know if I'll ever return to this carls jr. Looks like we are going to have to find another one."}
{"text":"The new sliders are a great deal! Service here is always great and the 5 dollar boxes are an unbelievable value!"}
{"text":"2 people working the night shift.  Kid makes my food right after sweeping or something and doesn't bother washing or putting gloves on.  Food went in the trash and Carl's Jr will never get my business again.  Not surprised Dateline found them/Hardee's to have an insane amount of health code violations."}
{"text":"Wonderful burger, very lean.  With such a lean patty, there is a dryness associated and a good sauce is a must.  I tried the el diablo and found the jalapenos too briney.  The poppers were also not very tasty and more gooey soft bits in the burger.  The bun was awesome very fresh and soft and didnt disintegrate immediately while eating.  The bacon was rather thin but cooked nicely soft and helped provide some juice for a lean burger.  Another downside is the coke. The flavour is off.  The first try was because it was empty.  The second gave me the taste of american coke which is different than what we get here in canada.  This was very disappointing.  Overall not a great experience but I would go back foranother burger."}
{"text":"Food not all that good at all and they don't get your order right. I will not be coming back to this one. These must be privately owned because this is the worst Carl's Jr I have ever been too."}
{"text":"The drive thru is horrible they can't here u and u can't here them don't waist your time here. I have asked for no cheese more than once. I'm never spending money here again."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new American fast food chain here in Ontario, but I wasn't impressed. How are Americans so fat? I ate this once and I won't go back. Bland gigantic beef patty that is super messy to eat as it falls apart. Cross cut fries were soggy. They were also missing key ingredients for two specialty burgers which they could not make for me."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews, but I've gotta be honest. The sandwich was over cooked and dry, and there was so much grease in the fries that it leaked thru the bag...   At least the soda was good, I guess..."}
{"text":"This was the best Carl's Jr I have been to in a while. The wait was a little long, but I'm ok with that if I get fresh food ( and it was).   The chicken sandwich was cooked well but not dry at all, and the sauce was really good. It's not quite Chick-fil-a, but still a solid sandwich."}
{"text":"Homemade Biscuit Sandwiches are the BEST breakfast sandwich by far. Fresh biscuits are made by hand and are baked fresh every 12 minutes.   Their burgers are higher quality than any other fast food operation. Quality rivals and exceeds many sit down Burger Restaurants.  In a city that gets $10-$15 for Burgers this Carl's Jr is well worth the stop."}
{"text":"Probably the worst fast food experience I've ever had. Walked in to grab a burger with my wife. The dining room was empty except for 2 employees who saw us walk in. They completely ignored us. The employees behind the counter did not acknowledge us. We stood at the counter waiting to order as the two employees in the dining room continued their conversation and those behind the counter continued to stare. Nothing was on the grill, the parking lot was empty as was the drive through. Needless to say we walked out. WORST SERVICE!"}
{"text":"This carls jr is on the corner of tropicana & mtn.vista...the dining area is huge...I come here for lunch sometimes,and get the dbl.western bacon cheese burger...I give this one 4 stars"}
{"text":"I only ordered two sandwiches to go and it took forever to come out . then they walked around with it on a tray calling out a number for an order I never received because they didn't give me a receipt. They finally bagged it up and sent us on our way with a 'sorry bout that'.Our sandwiches werent hot but they were,luckily, delicious."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Extremely disappointed. I sat in the drive-through for nearly 7 minutes without being greeted. I finally pulled up to the window to give my order. Last time this place will get my business"}
{"text":"This location in particular is the worst CJ I've been to. They always seem to mess up an order. Foods the same though as every CJ."}
{"text":"This was a treat for my 5yr old because I stopped giving her fast food for approximately 2months. I ordered a cheeseburger kids meal with no pickles, added mayo and ketchup. Once we got home, she stated it was to hard to bite. I opened it up and I couldn't believe what I was looking at. Two burnt buns and a burnt patty. The lady in the drive thru was extremely nice! Far as the cooks...They should be ashamed of themselves. Why would you think it's ok to serve something like that ESPECIALLY A KIDS MEAL! SO SAD! Makes me wonder if the kitchen would pass inspection!"}
{"text":"Great service & food was on point. The staff is extremely friendly & they are hiring if anyone is interested."}
{"text":"Food quality is as good as any other Carl's Jr but the service is slow and is always full of homeless people."}
{"text":"Some employees speak such bad English that you can't get your order right using the terrible drive thru speaker system.  IF you walk to the counter and speak to someone, chances are better but still not great they won't mess up your order.   Broken toilets with pee sitting in it adorned by incorrectly spelled apology;   Broken menu display lighting;   Door to chaotic office propped open.   We still go there simply because we like Carl's Jr burgers best. But this location is embarrassment for the brand."}
{"text":"One of the sad, little fast food joints that is still kicking...  I had to go here yesterday because I did not have time for wait for 40 UNLV students to get through the Chipotle line next door.     I ordered a Guacamole Bacon Six - Dollar Burger small combo.  What I got was something like a burger with cheese and a slice of rubbery bacon.  It was not good, but was sustenance so it did its most base of jobs.  The taste however was not great, I should have waited the 20 minutes for a 1+ pound of tasty burrito...  Oh well.     AND - the paper towels were gone in their sad, pathetic excuse of a bathroom. No one likes washing hands and then having nothing but toilet paper or your jeans to dry your hands on.   Listen to me -  go to Chipotle and save yourself the trouble of Carl's JR.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Last two times I went to Carls Jr.  They screwed my order up.  This location offered to fix it.  I brought the sandwich back.  Explained to the manager that they repeated it correctly just didn't get made right.  He also offered to have me come back anytime for a free sandwich.  Didn't need that just wanted the order corrected.  This is the Carls Jr I go to now not the one on rainbow."}
{"text":"I visited this location on 3-11-2018 at 1:03pm and had horrible customer service from the lady manager. My order came out wrong and she told me that I never asked for it that way. I showed her the receipt and she totally flipped out. She told me very sarcastically I could have my money back but I just wanted to eat. Instead of her admitting that she made a mistake she just flat out lied and tried to make it look like I was the one who messed up. Geees just give me what I ordered. Why make a huge deal about it? She kept making a huge scene in front of the entire restaurant. What is wrong with this manager Carls Jr?"}
{"text":"Disclaimer,  I'm not a fast food lover so if you like fast food for the sake of fast food, feel free to skip my review.  We ordered a super star burger, a ranch chicken burger and a portobello mushroom burger with coke.  The Super star burger meat looked as if it was thrown into the microwave and had an awful taste. The chicken burger was mostly breading and a tiny bit of fatty chicken. And worst of all the coke, tasted like bubbly water with lots of lots of sugar - nothing like coke.  I've tried a&w, McDonald's, etc before but none of them were as gross."}
{"text":"The owner must've sold this place because it has gone to total shit!  The staff is full of kids that don't even know how to pour a soda, they changed the menu and it's total garbage. Demanded a refund and the shift leader had the nerve to get all kinds of attitude and even flipped me off when I told her how her acting super ratchet was a terrible example for her team. Mind you, I've been eating here since I was a kid and NEVER had a problem. There should always be a manager present if you hire a bunch of dumb, immature kids. She's lucky I'm pregnant."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave an additional star was because I was greeted as I entered and the employee opened the door for me. The food was pretty good.  The bathroom was utterly disgusting. The urinal was bagged and labeled out of order. The remaining stall in the men's room was just horrid. I took a picture for reference."}
{"text":"Horrendously badly managed even by Carl's standards. Service friendly but always undermanned inevitably leading to unnecessary delays and spotty quality. Avoid."}
{"text":"After waiting in the drive thru for 15min, you'd think I'd get some hot fries (cold & old) & more than 1 dang rib on my baby back rib burger. At least the girl Serena working the window was a sweetheart. Not her fault, she's new. Fast food, means fast & hot!!!"}
{"text":"Some dude took away my big carl and I got his six dollar burger. The cashier didn't even check his receipt and checked mine which is when the order screws up. Clearly I was given a number and was staring at it almost all the time. The cashier was wrong but instead of making amends, just frowns and push that wrong order to me. Didn't even look me in the eye when I ask if it is a big carl. That really pisses me off. I had to google to confirm that I got the wrong burger and oh yeah, I was right. Don't wanna make a scene, so I just swallow my pride as I swallow the burger. The only reason why this is not one star is because the burger tastes decent. Just come here for the food, don't expect anything from customer service and fingers crossed for a smooth order."}
{"text":"I have only been to this location a couple times, but every time I have my food has been cold and hard. I do love carls jr and have never had an issue with this other than at this location. Though my fries came out hot, my chicken sandwich would have shattered if I threw it at the wall. Lol for $8 I would hope it would be a little more fresh! Come on carls jr!! You can do better than that! :)"}
{"text":"Turkey Burger + Why are they being so nice to us?   Best customer service experience I've had at a fast food place. The cashier actually waited on my boyfriend and I, as in brought the food over to our table and then came back to check if we enjoyed our meal and then refilled my drink and brought more condiments to our table. When did Carl Jr's become a restaurant with actual servers and a wait staff? Whenever this happened, I'm just glad they didn't increase the prices.   We were staying at the Stratosphere across the street and didn't go here until our last night on vacation because I don't eat red meat and didn't feel like having a chicken sandwich. I didn't know that they also sold turkey burgers. Well to my absolute surprise, they do!!   I ordered an all white meat turkey burger (aka the Southwest burger, substitute with a turkey patty and added bacon). It had a really nice flavor. Certainly not the best turkey burger I've ever had, but definitely better than most fast food joints that just throw it on the menu. Wish we had one like this in Chicago. I usually have to go to more expensive burger places to get a turkey burger and not so great service. Thanks for flipping the script Carl's Jr."}
{"text":"WARNING: THE BURGER IN THE COMMERCIAL AND IN THE PICTURE DOES NOT EXIST AND YOU WILL NEVER RECEIVE ANYTHING REMOTELY CLOSE TO IT.  The new California burger is an attempt to copy the In & Out double double, and it fails. I ask at the counter and point to the picture \"Is it gonna look like the picture?\" SHE LITERALLY LAUGHED. I said \"No, really. Could I have it look like the picture?\"  Well ---- green lettuce doesn't exist there so get that out of your head. At least the fries tasted good.  Ever see a Whataburger commercial? What you see on TV is REALLY what you get!  Very first visit I order the new burger with the onion crispies and TWO GIANT TOMATO SLICES according to the picture - and get back this irritating sad sack of a burger with a single small end slice of tomato. OH how I was looking forward to that picture in the window.  last week I get the Famous Star burger, order extra tomatoes. I get my drink. I spy my burger being made. She's putting an inch stack of WHITE lettuce on it. WTF. I pipe up NO LETTUCE. At least I got my extra tomato. Apparently these people don't care what a real burger is supposed to be. Carl's used to be the best with FLAME COOKED burgers, now I just watch my sad patty come out of a yellow McDonald's plastic heat box.  Don't worry Carl's workers, you'll soon be relieved of this miserable life when your location closes and someone worthy moves in. You're one step away from Jack in the Box for the worst burger ever.  WHOPPERS RULE!"}
{"text":"Poor service.  Trash was over flowing.  Soda machine was down behind the counter and the machine used by the public.   No one cleaned the tables the whole time that we sat and ate our meal.... Mr. Carl would turn over in his grave with disappointment"}
{"text":"I was in the drive through today. They put a teriyaki chicken on my chicken club. I've had it before, it's not supposed to taste like that. Went all the way back only to be told \"they all taste the same\". Poor customer service. Will not return."}
{"text":"We ordered hot ham and cheese sandwiches and the lady had no idea what that was even though we were reading it right on the menu. Eventually, after waiting out front for our food they brought us ham sandwiches with ketchup, mustard and pickles without cheese. Tasted so bad! Then our teas tasted so spoiled and had no sugar! One of the worst meals!"}
{"text":"This place is such a disappointment. We come here because it's Green Burrito and offers things other than burgers. The service suck. Each time we come the workers are slow or forget part of your order. Can you hire people that can do their task correctly?"}
{"text":"I would give negative stars if possible.  First off its far from fast the restaurant was pretty empty and it still took nearly 15 minutes.  First they ran out of coffee.  Its Sunday morning. Then we ordered a sandwich just egg and cheese.  The a breakfast burrito just egg, cheese, and potato.   NO MEAT.  However apparently no meat means full of Ham.  I tried calling but the phone would ring once and then beep and hang up.   This is not the first time this Carls has messed up my no meat order.  I think its time for a re-train at this location."}
{"text":"The worst store in Las Vegas I have tried to go so many times I am done everytime there is a issue tonight the girl Jennifer was laughing saying the chicken is frozen so no chicken last time there was no breakfast only French toast and then time before that store was closed cause there was not enough workers yet I will never go to this store again ever I ended up at canes next store the best customer  service and food the girl Jennifer was sitting there texting on her phone where camera could not see her also then touching no way."}
{"text":"The six dollar burger is pretty good I had it a long time ago. They have now changed the bun it is sweet kind of like the sweet Hawaiian rolls which took away from the burger rather than add to it. Compared to other fast food burger the six dollar burger is better than averge."}
{"text":"Went to Carl's Jr again today, it will be the last time. Three strikes you're out. First time, I ordered something, got something totally different. Had to go inside and wait ten minutes. Second time, got the order wrong again, had to go inside and they handed me the wrong thing... again.  Today I thought I'd keep it simple. I ordered a milkshake. I waited at the drive up window for almost five minutes. Finally the girl hands me something that looks like milk. I tell her I ordered a milkshake and she says, \"Yeah, all the freezers are broken and nothing is working. The ice cream and everything is all melted\"  I handed it back, asked for my money back and left . I know things happen from time to time, but I've been there three time, bad experience three times. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Awful!  Yes, greasy onion rings. The cheeseburger was terrible also. I think any other fast food place is better."}
{"text":"This is where real men go to get a burger. Add you can't go wrong with the Chili Cheese Fries either. Actually, last time I went, I tried to convinve myself not to order the Chili Cheese Fries. About five minutes after I completed my order, I saw a picture of the fries and changed my mind. They are good. Got a shake too. Those pictures get me every time. I also liked the banana shake and the mint oreo shake."}
{"text":"This place has really good burgers a nice quick service as well as tasty fries. I really enjoyed how we could be seated and they bring your food to your table it's nice having a nice friendly service. I came here when it first open and they have so many options for burgers. They are a pretty decent place to try out and would go again to eat."}
{"text":"Worst location ever! Their drive thru is always extremely super slow. When I come on my lunch breaks I'm the only person and the drive thru and I still have to wait more than 15 min it's rediculous and the staff is so rude as hell. Customer service is really poor."}
{"text":"Food is always burnt their employees always have a bad attitude towards helping customers. Corporate never answers their phones and gives you a shit attitude when they do answer the phone."}
{"text":"Yay! My criss cut fries were hot fran crispy deliciousness and my western bacon burger was fabulous. The drove through guy was super nice also. Thank you for fresh, hot, delicious food!"}
{"text":"There lunch is gross, period.   They have a decent Bacon egg and cheese bisquit. I got there at 10:46 c'mon... it's 10:45 am somewhere. ... and I couldn't get breakfast. ...& really what's a 30 Oz cup?  The lady working there was rude, and I did order fries... yuk Mcd's is the fast food fry champion. ...  Cj's needs to get with the program, even McDonald's is breakfast all day."}
{"text":"Slow, slow, slow! Drive thru ridiculous. Could have went for sit down food and it would have been faster!"}
{"text":"Maria is rude and should be fired for taking employee food orders in the middle of a customer's order!"}
{"text":"I went here because of long line at IN n OUT across the street...It took 5 minutes to take the order of the car in front of me,and10 minutes for me to get a FN Berger! this Place is SLOW!  I should have waited in line at IN n Out"}
{"text":"I very rarely give one star reviews but this place is taking forever.   it's been 25 minutes from one hamburger!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered zucchini and I got 6 pieces in half of a small fries container. They are cheating customers on food quantity."}
{"text":"I went there today and the food was pretty good, but what grossed me out was the fact that the lady taking orders and bringing out food was also cleaning the bathrooms they should have a separate crew for that! eww"}
{"text":"This carls Jr has by far the best service ever!"}
{"text":"Carl's Jr. is a decent fast food restaurant, but I try to limit my trips. I don't really care for their french fries, but their burger is not too bad. I like that they have cheap soda and most of my visits are usually because I am looking for somewhere to get a quick inexpensive soda."}
{"text":"It's possible that this is the WORST carl's Jr in their system. They hire punk foul mouth kids with no sense of professionalism.   Their drive through window is the worst because their speaker doesn't work nor does the person who listens to the order listen to what you say. You'll end up repeating yourself multiple times and only getting the wrong order.  We went into complain after going through the drive-through and the manager said it's not his fault that his employee swore at us because they got frustrated.  I wrote to  Carl's Jr. corporate about this and I have yet to get a response. This shows that it's beyond this location and actually extends to Carl's Jr. corporate office as well.   Do yourself a favor and avoid this at all costs"}
{"text":"So I paid about $11 for a combo meal which in itself was a shock. Then I get it back to the office and my chicken sante fe sandwhich was a big sloppy mess and also had a complimentary hair in it. So, In a nutshell it was expensive and disgusting. Threw it out. It has been a while since I had Carl's Jr. But now I'll definitely steer clear."}
{"text":"So here's the thing, I have not been to a Carl's Jr. in who knows how long. Primarily because I actually didn't really like the taste of their burgers. However, now that I am in a city where you have to drive everywhere, I've decided to revisit fast food. Yes I've seen fast food nation. Yes I know that it's bad for you. But c'mon, it's convenient!  This review is primarily for the item that I have been consistently ordering here: the Cranberry apple walnut salad with bleu cheese (instead of the balsamic because, really, you can only be so healthy here). Let me preface this by saying that I love salads and I would happily eat a salad for every meal if I could. This salad is a must-have. Thank God I decided to come back to Carl's, because this salad is bomb-dot-com. Like seriously. It's savory, then sweet, crunchy and delicious.   The place isn't too shabby either. It's clean and it feels fairly new. As a side, I forgot that when you order food they bring it to your table. Always keepin' it classy Carl. I can definitely appreciate that."}
{"text":"I hate that airport make everything so much more expensive. Ordered two spicy sandwiches and some chillicheese fries. Got charged 22 dollars. I was so confused until I noticed they gave me a more expensive burger. We ate them anyway because we were starving.  The chili cheese had absolutely no cheese. And they burger was meh and mostly lettuce. No refils.  SO expensive. Stupid airport making everything so expensive."}
{"text":"Cleanliness is next to cleeeeeannlinesss lol... this place is kept tidy, the cashiers and managers are friendly.  They are always making sure everything is ok.  The food is ok, nothing out of this world.  But I like this place because unlike most places (Jack's, MickeyDs, or In N Out) the charbroiled taste really does it for me.     I could never give a fast food chain a 5, all honesty, fast food is not a this taste so great! type of joint, but 4 of 5 will suffice.  Place is well maintained, has fairly good food and the workers there make for real enjoyable experiences.  It's funny cause since their opening they have some workers that been there and they've befriended my dad and I.  Sometimes I'll get a, \"Dude it's been a while, where have you been?  You don't like us anymore huh\" greeting and so that's nice cause they know us, always trying to make for chit chat and I'm the same way... bar none best service of burger joint tbt I've come across."}
{"text":"Good staff good food and convenient location for downtown residents. Opens early and stays open late nights. Nice to have them in my neighborhood as an option."}
{"text":"Said I had to buy something if I wanted a water cup and that it was new corporate rule. Imagine the greed to deny someone tap water in the Arizona weather."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I could here the manager yelling at the staff to hurry up. 10 min for a crappy sandwich ."}
{"text":"The service here is always horrible which is sad because I love Carl's Jr! They always get my order wrong, my good is cold when I get it because they take forever bringing it to you,and the staff is always super rude."}
{"text":"Sat in the drive thru with 2 other cars for over 10 minutes & not one word came from the drive thru employee. I had to get my ass out of the car to walk up to the window to get an employees attention & let them know there are customers trying to order...... Then all I got was a \"uhhhh my bad, I just put my headset on.\" Well why the hell was it off anyways???? You're open right? Just stupid! I am so sick of going places & having to tell people to do their damn job! This was my first experience with this location & it will be my last......"}
{"text":"The absolute worst service in the world . Idiots or just the incompetent of employees.  I can not tell you how soon this crap hole should close down."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to give this fast food resto a try after a game of soccer. He ordered a super bacon burger and i ordered the portabello mushroom burger. Kudos to the fast service. We were barely settled in our corner booth when they burgers were delivered. A lot ledt to be desired though for the food taste and quality. The burgers were not juicy and there was very little sauce in on the buns so all you can taste is meat and vegetables. A bit pricey too for a 1/3 pound burger. We then decided to order one more time. I was next to be served when i realized that i was at the wrong end of the line up. The sign did clearly say where to line up but the cashier still took the lady who was behind me and stayed in the wrong. I got served next which wasnt a big deal but its very confusing to people. The highlight of it all is yet to come. I ordered  chicke  strips with crisscut fries and a drink. Got charged $12 for it and the first thing my bf says when it got deliversis \"are those nuggets?\". They were pathetic excuses for a chicken strip. More like a chicken cube. Fat Burger charges the same for a combo and they give you your money's worth. It was so disapponting. My bf finished them all in four bites. And the crisscut fries were not very good. They were not hot nor fresh. For the sake of the employees there, I hope quality gets better at this location. They had a friendly staff so the 2 stars are for them and their speedy service. At the rate they are going, they are going to fail at attracting repeat customers and might end up like the previous establishments they've replaced. I've eaten at the sushi restaurant that stood there before and wasn't impressed either. Maybe it's the location???"}
{"text":"Lazy and rude. The last three times I tried to come here after work (I work at a bar and get off late) they will tell me their system is down or their broiler is broken. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I went there the other night and the woman said \"I can only do fried foods as the broiler is not in service\" I said that's ok just some zucchini is fine then two seconds later \"oh our system just went down\" like really how convenient for you guys. Get a different job if you don't want to be there, all I wanted was some f$;@(&ing zucchini you lazy POS you get paid to sit around and do nothing. Mind you each time I came here were at different times, the night crew does not want to do their jobs. I called her out on it and just went on to say it was their nightly update. Don't be 24 hours if you have an hour delay then. ?"}
{"text":"The decor is decidedly \" upscale \" for a fast food joint but the burgers are unfortunately MOR at best.  Flavourless patties, nuclear processed cheese, wilted lettuce.  Way too much fat and salt, but then what do you expect from a burger joint???"}
{"text":"I dont know what happened to Carl's Jr.....I have been frequenting Carl's Jr locations since I have been in AZ over half my life.  I have watched them go down hill and it really is a shame because I thought they had real good burgers, now they seem to be close to the bottom shelf to find a burger.  I gave them this one last shot and drove 3 miles to grab a double western cheeseburger,  it was just awful and the prices are even worse!!  I got the double western and a famous star....i left 13$ in the hole!!!   I found this to be very pricey because when I take the WHOLE family to other burger joints I get out of there for 20 - 25 feeding 3 and that is meals, fries and drinks!!  The burgers were were horrendous and it is now safe to say that Carl's Jr have seen the last of this guy."}
{"text":"The girl at register messed up with my order should make two different sandwiches not the ones I ask and then she was laughing!!!! No respect for their clients"}
{"text":"You'd think with In N Out across the street, they'd try harder! I got in the drive through and I was told to wait. I watched the cars at In N Out moving, and there I was, waiting to place an order. Finally, I decided to go across the street, where a young girl was outside taking orders, and these idiots never returned to the speaker. So I drove forward, to get out, there was ONE car (not 100) in front of the window. Luckily I was able to back out, as there was no one behind me. The ONLY reason I ever go to them is when I'm in a hurry and don't want to wait at In N Out. Now I won't even try them then!"}
{"text":"Waited until we got to window and took our money to tell us our diabetic relative couldn't have wheat bread. Order was cold, soda flat. Worst Carl's Jr I have ever eaten at. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"The food was good but the girl working the register named Juliette  doesn't belong talking to guests, she's very unfriendly and seems like she hates people. I will not be back to this location"}
{"text":"This is by far the absolute worst late night drive through around. They closed in 20 minutes and still would not let me through the drive-through. I will never ever be back to this piece of shit hamburger place again"}
{"text":"slowest fast food EVER!! they NEVER pay attention to the diners inside of the restaurant. stood in line for over 10 mins before I walked out."}
{"text":"Shame on the owners of this establishment! My family and I went in for lunch today and the air conditioner was out! Not just for today but for the past week the employees have worked AND patrons have ordered food here with the owners acknowledging the heat but still keeping the doors open because instead of health and safety reasons they worry about that dollar!? My service was excellent although every employee in the building was overheating and the ice cream was melting they served us with a smile and apology for the hot environment. I will be contacting the department of health on Monday since they have no way of getting in contact with them either until then. I hope others report this as well! 120 degrees out. Shameful!!"}
{"text":"I love this carls jr location the customer service is good and the food well the day I came here was fresh and melted in my mouth especially the burgers as they were really juicy."}
{"text":"Friendly morning staff. Quick and easy to read menu. Delicious breakfast burger (ends at 10:30am) for 5.49 (tax included). For the Chicken charbroiled club burger, the meat was good but the burger had too many sauces, so over saturated. Right now, I'm still recounting the good taste of the breakfast burger. I crushed these two burgers in minutes!"}
{"text":"I'm not making this up, one afternoon after shopping at Office Depot, I had the sudden urge to use the restroom. So I went to the closest food place which happened to be this Carl's Jr/ Green Burrito. Anyway, I go into the restaurant and their only like 3-4 people in the restaurant, and they all just look \"shady\". But when \"nature calls\" you try to look past that. So, I go to the restrooms, and the entire restroom is empty, and I handled my buisness. I heard someone come in, and I opened the door to go wash my hands, and I swear there was a kid who looked 6 or 7 years old, and she turned around and looked right at me and she looked normal except she had an eyepatch that looked like it was made out of metal. I thought I was in \"Children of the Korn\". Anyway, this review is not about the food, and I will never eat at this Carl's Jr, because of this experience."}
{"text":"Nice clean location. Fast friendly service. I've gone quite a few times already. I enjoy the .69$ drinks plus we had lots of free coupons from opening day. The zuchinni is really good."}
{"text":"Food was made good, service could of been a little faster. I could barely hear the drive thru guy."}
{"text":"Carl's is one of my favorites.  I remember in my home town this was the first fast food eatery I used an ATM card in to purchase a double bacon cheese burger with fried zucchini.  This location is indeed interesting.  Very clean for an establishment in the area of the 15 & Charleston.  Service was friendly.  Food was I a sure to Carl Karcher's standards.  Just beware of zombie's that might wonder in from time to time.  With that said...be sure to lock your vehicle."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, staff arguing with each other. Slow slow slow!!! 20 minutes to get 3 cheese burgers and a small fry. It wasn't that they were overly busy, there might have been 10 people total."}
{"text":"Who ever is the owner of this franchise doesn't realize or care that this place is very very SMOKEY all the time!!! Vents don't work, fix it!!!  Is this a health hazard? That's my question. Employees breath this all the time, every day, for many hrs at a time.  Just saying."}
{"text":"Oh good laaaaawd, Carl's Jr can shove itself in my face hole anytime.  I have had a love affair with CJ since I was a little kid when I would fly down to Santa Maria from Seattle to stay with my Nana and Tata for the summers.  Sadly, this was due in part to the fact that my Nana cooks with gobs of lard (as some of your Nanas and Grandmas might also do - all old school style.  Yeah, you know those green and white Armour Lard boxes...) and CJ's was probably a healthier alternative.    Yeah, I said it.  I know I am going to hell but when you have to scrape off about two inches of lard to get to the pinquito beans underneath, while yes they are nom, they are not making you a shining example of nutrition and health.  But, as I am prone to do, I digress...  Oh Carl...sweet, sweeeeet Carl's Jr.  I had two burgers the week we were in Phoenix.  One mammoth burger was The Guacamole Bacon Six Dollar Burger.  Per their website:  Charbroiled 100% Black Angus Beef Patty, Guacamole, Two Strips of Bacon, Two Slices of Melted Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Two Slices of Tomato, Red Onions, and Santa Fe Sauce on a Toasted Sesame Seed Bun.  I swear it probs had about 9 days worth of calories and I didn't eat again for about 15 hours but gawd was it heavenly and spicy.  I wasn't expecting it to have such a hearty kick but my lips were a bit chapped and they buuuuuuuuuuuurned so good.  The bacon wasn't flibby, which is a hazard with fast food bacon.  It was crispy and chock full of bacon-y goodness.  The guac was spooshing out every bite but it was so tasty I would smear my fries through it.  Note - I ate only as many fries as I could slather with their guac (7 to be exact) cause the burger was so gynormo-pants and I wasn't about to waste space on their fairly nommy fries.  Super tasty red onion and fresh lettuce and tomato made my burger pretty dang yummy.  The day before we left we went back and this time my SUPER picky nephew (god love him - he's a-frickin-dorable) was delighted with their chicken strips and fries.  I had the Western Bacon Cheeseburger® which was MUCH smaller and probs only killed 4 days worth of calories.  Again, the bacon was nom and the onion rings and bbq sauce really hit the spot.  I didn't get fries with this burger but did try a Crisp Burrito from Green Burrito which is attached a la Pizza Hut/Taco Bell.  The crisp burrito was like a shorter, fatter, better Taco Time Crisp Beef Burrito and is served with their uber delectable guac.  All in all, I am VERY glad there are not Carl's Jrs in Seattle or I would be about 9 billion pounds.   ***Update***  There are *THREE* Carl's Jrs in Washington.  DAMMIT ALL!  I will just forget that I know this...one in Marysville, Renton and Covington...I can never go to those cities again.  Drat!"}
{"text":"Didn't have spicy chicken sandwich for the meal 4 that comes with a burger and spicy chicken. Asked if we could have just a regular chicken sandwich which we were told no. So they gave us another burger. Asked is what sauce we wanted we said bbq. Which they said they don't have. Been waiting for our food in the drive through for way too long. Awful."}
{"text":"We tried to go through the drive-thru after picking someone up from the airport. It was about 1:10 am, so it was one of the only places open. We sat at the speaker for 5 minutes before yelling and whistling into the speaker to see if anyone was even there. At that point, an employee came outside through a side door to tell us that the cashier was in the restroom and they were going to take 10 minutes. He has a headset on, so I can't fathom any reason he couldn't have taken our order. Like really?? You'd let your only order-taker spend a quarter of an hour in the restroom and have NO backup? Just stupid. This place has 2 stars for a reason."}
{"text":"Even through all the crazy menu items CJ has had over the years, the taste is still the same. The burgers are consistently good. I miss the days when you could get a Famous Star WITH cheese for just .99! The fries are horrible sice they changed them. My favorite fries were at CJ but not now damn it. I came the other morning for breakfast with a coupon and tried the Maple Sausage, Egg & Cheese Biscuit. The sausage was freaking good. It reminded me of the Johnsonville breakfast sausage my wife cooks. The biscuit was hot and damn good for a fast food place. The hash browns are nuggets and surprisingly not too greasy. Now if I could just get them to bring back their baked potatoes and original fries all would be right."}
{"text":"Loves Carl's! Do not like this location at all... Buffalo/Vegas. Two customers in front of us had issues. One the food was not made like he asked and the second was a customer that was over charged. Our situation was no different. They made a sandwich wrong and we mentioned we wanted cheese. Instead of pointing out that we just didn't see it, the last in the back made a nasty comment in Spanish and threw it away. Spanish class came in handy today! I won't be repeating what was said. My biggest issue is that every single table is filthy. We cleaned our own table lol!"}
{"text":"Got a drive thru order that was wrong due to alergies i was told to come back and they would take care of me next time. Well I came back and they took care of my order. The manager didnt seem hapoy about it but they finally did the right thing. As for the quality of tje product...I cant say it was outstanding. Its certainly not the cheapest fast food place and to be honest some of the cheaper places like Wendys are better in my book. If you feel like being treated rudely and getting overcharged for a below average burger Carls is the place to be."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. I came today because I thought they had tacos & I wanted to try them. This location does not! The guy working the drive-thru was friendly & patient with me. I tried the Santa Fe Chicken sandwich & it was pretty good. The drive-thru seemed a little slow but I wasn't in a rush. I haven't had any big issues here & will probably be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly and fast.  For those waging a battle with wheat flour, they can make any burger wrapped in lettuce."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a burger person so the place has to be REALLY good for me to give it anything more than 3 stars.    I will say though, their Oreo shake is delicious and I highly recommend it.  Their burgers (I had the Original) is a step above McDonald's but comparable to a Wendy's or maybe even a Red Robin.  I still prefer a 5 Guys or In N Oubt.  This particular location, I thought the service was 2 stars, maybe 2.5.  Our dinner cost $21.34 but the debit card receipt said $21.44.  I know it's only 10 cents but it's the principle of the matter.  I have never been charged incorrectly.  I'm probably going to let it go b'c it's not worth the gas money but seriously, not cool.  Other than getting charged +10cents incorrectly, the cashier lady wasn't very friendly.  I put on a smile, I said thank you and how r u and got minimal response back.  Comeon now, I know you probably don't like your job but at least make it so I enjoy coming here.  After I\"m writing this, maybe it does deserve 2 stars .... but it was a decent burger and yummy Oreo Shake.  Just double check your receipt."}
{"text":"Whipped in here while running errands for bathroom & burger. Bathroom first.  There's a sign on the men's room door: \"Men's Bathroom broken, sorry for the inconvenience.\" Or something like that. Looks as though the sign has been in place for quite some time.  OK, there's no room for error here, I need to take care of #1 business pronto, so I peek into the ladies' room. The coast is clear. There's no lock on the door. Well, if a lady opens the door, she's going to clearly see me standing at the toilet, with my back facing her. She'll figure it out and wait outside until I'm done. And I'm going to be done & gone in 90 seconds anyway.   So no harm, no foul.  Or so I thought.  Mid-stream, in darts the store manager, a short, quite-stocky young woman.   Apparently she saw me head into the ladies' head - - and she's come in to investigate.   The manager says \"You can't be in here.\" I say \"Well you don't have a men's room. And it's a little late for me to be walking out now.\"   Then the manager says \"You are disrespecting women by being in here.\"   AHA! NOW we are at the crux of the manager's concern. Political correctness.   This manager thinks it's unfair for a lady to have to wait her turn under these circumstances. (As if people in this world have never had to wait their turn for a bathroom.)   Oh no, being a man, I should just go wet myself in the middle of the restaurant - rather than POSSIBLY cause a lady to have to wait her turn. It's not men & women equal - in her mind, it's women above men. This attitude may also explain why this manager hasn't bothered to fix the men's toilet in the first place.  But the sword of political correctness always bears a second edge - for those who know how to use it.  I say \"But I AM a woman. I am a pre-op transgender woman. Who just happens to be dressed as a man today.\"  Silence. Utter, glorious, satisfying silence.   I finish my b-room business and leave for the counter, while the manager remains, her brain seized up by the endlessly-looping, Möbius-strip logic of my response.   When I get outside, both the young girl at the register and the guy cooking in the back are both rolling with laughter. Apparently they heard it all. And apparently they are sick of working under a manager toting this kind of attitude.   I get my two-double-cheeses-in-a-poke and leave. The burgers, btw, were AOK for a Carl's. And the girl threw me a 10% discount.  Thank goodness I don't live anywhere near this neighborhood; I'll never have to return to this joint again.  OK Ms. Manager, here's the straight-talk:  It's the law. You serve food, so you are required to have working bathrooms. So fix the d@mn bathroom. And then you won't have men causing women to suffer these supposed indignities.   And if you can't figure out how to fix the bathroom - - then get your butt over to Home Depot, spend $2 out of petty cash and buy a manual bolt-action door lock and screw it onto the inside of the door. Then make a sign that says \"Unisex Bathroom\" to stick on the outside of the door.  Instead of lurking in wait to verbally crucify any man who dares to take a whiz on the premises."}
{"text":"I bought a six dollar burger and was completely disappointed the burger was small very small  it use to be thick was the hell happened carls"}
{"text":"I been to this Carl's Jr several times and the food and service has been very good. The staff is very good and you can make changes and they don't seem to care. I mostly go for breakfast but I have been there for lunches too, Every time I been there the food has always been hot and fresh. I will be going back for another meal."}
{"text":"Very slow service, under staffed. Thay have one person running the whole restaurant, do humanity a favor and hire more people or close the restaurant."}
{"text":"I literally was just able to maneuver out of drive through... after the lady told me there would be an eight minute wait for breakfast sandwiches. It's a shame when IHOP had faster service than FAST FOOD"}
{"text":"This Carl's Jr just opened on April 17.  I was one of the first to visit when it opened and found joy that they arr currently overstaffed.    On a second visit I dined in and was asked by more than one employee if I needed anything and if everything was satisfactory.  It was the greatest fast food service I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Delicious as always. Live this location,  brand new, super clean. And the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Well... The food was exactly how you would expect franchise food to be.... However the restaurant was filthy.  We stopped in at 8am. Our party of ten chose to eat in. The staff member handed me a greasy order number display for our table.... While waiting for our order I took my daughter to the bathroom. The entire inside of the toilet bowl had feces coating it. A human clearly had recently exploded inside the toilet. Had it been one isolated instance of nastiness I'd understand, however, filthy order display and a filthy restroom leaves me hoping that more care was put into the food cleanliness of the food prep staff, although I don't have much hope that it was. Here's hoping my meal (which was prepared correctly and tasted fine) does not yield the outcome of the previously exploded restroom visitor."}
{"text":"Food is good but they need more employees to handle and expedite orders.   Some patience is needed in this location"}
{"text":"I've been living in the Sunrise neighborhood for close to ten years now. Until recently, there haven't been a lot of food options besides fast food and even then, pickings were slim: all that was available was mostly burger chains. Carl's Jr is one of them. I've been a regular on and off throughout the years. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones, too, considering all the bad reviews.   I've always received stellar service at this location, whether dining in or using the drive thru. My food comes out quick and there's never any hiccups. They even offered a treat for my dog when I pulled up to the window with her once.  I prefer Carl's over other burger chains in the area because the company has got their formula for a great burger down! Tastes like it came from the grill, just the way I like it. I'll always be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Not too much can be said about a burger joint so I'll share something not everyone may know. They have veterans discounts every day. Just bring in something to prove it and you get a discount.  Oh, and their ice-cream cookies are delicious."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! I haven't been here in ages and now I know why! I ordered the chicken sandwich and I can't even describe what the meat was. I took a bite into it and it had the weirdest texture. At first I thought it was a tomato but then I realized it was the chicken. It had some sort of rubbery skin looking thing on the chicken. GROSS all around!"}
{"text":"The employee Sara is awesome !!! Best service i have gotten in a long time. Its great to know there are people who still care about their jobs and the costumers! :)"}
{"text":"They haven't fixed the ac in I don't know how long.  It's uncomfortable every time I go in.  I can only imagine how the staff feels about having to work in the heat when it's really not necessary"}
{"text":"This location claims to be 24 hours, yet they always have a reason not to take your order on the late night shift. One time they told me they were only accepting cash and at that time I only had my debit card on me. The next time I went there I only had cash on me and they tell me they are only accepting debit/credit, which doesn't even make any sense. Another time they told us they could only make numbers 1 through 4, so we ordered a number 3 and they go, oops sorry I can't make that either right now. Today at 4 am the lady asks to take my order, then after I say it she tells me their computer is down. I ask her for how long and she says all rudely, well hold on let me check, then it ends up being a 45 min wait. Don't waste your time driving to this location after midnight cause there will be some ridiculous excuse as to why they can't take your order. I don't understand why they are even open 24 hours. They are just wasting money on hourly wages."}
{"text":"Worst service ever after I waited forever they said my card they couldn't take rudely wouldn't explain  went threw the drive threw they all of a sudden accept my card I work right next door none of my coworkers will be back terrible service we ended up going to panda next door way better service and they accept my credit card with id will not be going back"}
{"text":"sub par food - never great - been there three times or so - Drive in only - the staff is not very friendly - it is open late"}
{"text":"Got the $5 meal box. Was the saddest thing I ordered from Carl Jrs. The frys were cold and soggy, the burger and chicken sandwich were flat/soggy and unflavored. The chicken strip kids meal had one tiny stop that was the size of one McDonald's nuggets. Thought Carl's was going to be a treat and drove 20 minutes just to be let down"}
{"text":"I made the huge mistake of ordering from the Green Burrito menu at this Carl's Jr.  I'm not picky.  I'll eat tacos from Jack in the Box.  Happily.  I ordered some kind of California Chicken Burrito, which turned out to be about a half pound of mushy refried beans, with MAYBE two ounces of rubbery, diced chicken mixed in.  Also ordered one regular taco - the meat was basically extremely greasy dog food - or at best something I'd expect out of a can of potted meat.  Asked for hot sauce....the guy said that had one kind.  It was in Carl's Jr. packets, and tasted like very slightly spicy ketchup.  No idea how the hell the Green Burrito stays in business."}
{"text":"Terrible quality I will never go to this Carl's Jr. location again or any for that matter. Everyone we order breakfast the biscuits are old or burnt! Tried to call and they never answer so I called corporate turns out their customer service is just as poor. Go somewhere like chick fil a don't waste your money or time here"}
{"text":"Great service and the food this morning was great. I had the steak and egg breakfast burrito w hashbrowns. Vicky is the manager on duty and is amazing. Amazing customer sevice with her. Thanks you."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I like Carls Junior and have been a decades long customer.  However, I don't understand why you may request adjustments to your order but the cooks seem to just give you what they want and ignore the requests. Like your requests are not important.  Also hate getting bkfst potatoes or fries that have been sitting for a bit and are served near room temperature.  I'm not there just so you can keep food costs down by giving me your older food you just want to part with.  If you charge me full price, my expectation is my order should be hot and fresh and looking somewhat like the promo pictures in their windows.  But kudos to the staff who bring something to work other than just being there to punch buttons sans any smile or friendly conversation.  I run into those who just stand out now and then and wish I could just hire them on the spot.  Good job hiring those guys."}
{"text":"Hey Yelper's here is the skinny on a good Wednesday burger special. Carl's Jr's Western Bacon Cheeseburger Wednesdays for just $1.00 get the $1.00 soft drink for a whooping $2.18 total. I would have taken a picture but I was driving and could not resist eating it sorry! P.S it was gooood!"}
{"text":"Staff was helpful and polite. Restaurant is clean. No problem using my coupon. Out in 5 min. Order is correct."}
{"text":"literally a 10 minute wait at the intercom for the drive thru to be told they didn't have what we wanted to order. It was out of stock. Then another 10 minute wait for the 2 cars in front of us at the window. I WILL NEVER GO TO THIS CARL'S AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Horrible place.  I sat behind a car in the drive through who was at the speaker for 9 minutes and they hadn't come on the speaker yet.  I had to call them to ask them to take the orders.  Than like every time I've come here they screwed my order up.  And no apologies for the wait, no thank you, they grunt at you take your money, shove your order through the window, than turn their back.  They act like their doing me a favor. This place sucks."}
{"text":"2nd visit to this location. Really friendly folks working here.  The 4 for 4 combo deal is absolutely unbeatable. LOL, the catsup dispenser is not working and wasn't working last week either!  Great service overall.  I wish they would add the Green Burrito part of the Karcher franchise."}
{"text":"This place is always clean, the staff is friendly and the food is always hot (and pretty good).  No nonsense here - if you ask for an extra sauce or two - no big deal.  They don't charge you 25 cents (Thank you very much).  If you ask for something changed up a bit or made a bit different - no big deal.  Drive thru is efficient.  I once, and only once, had an incorrect order in the drive thru.  I live close - I went back to get the item.  I was treated like a King!!!  The staff were genuine when they apologized, got me a soda while I waited, got my item plus a little extra treat AND the supervisor came out to apologize which I thought was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Two different visits they have screwed up a simple breakfast sandwich order.  I shall never spend my money here anymore."}
{"text":"Famous for their CHARBROILED burgers. Wanted to try the new all natural aforementioned CHARBROILED burger.  I was asked when I pulled in the drive thru if I wanted it.  I was then.......THIS IS RIDICULOUS!   I was just given an order, not mine.  Now waiting for MY BURGER.  I prefer McDonald's......now I remember why.   Now I am getting a refund because they still got the order wrong.  And she claims to be the General Manager, Ashley.  Now. Off to McDonald's."}
{"text":"First of all, go to Carl's JRs main website, and see if they have any coupons. Most of the time, they have buy one, get one (s).  It was dead when I pulled up to the drive thru. However, Alyssa, who took my order, was beyond sweet and helpful.  I ordered 2 $6 thickburgers, and yes, they are actually $6. No false advertising there.  3 chicken strips with honey mustard  Criss cut fries, and a small sweet potato fry.  Everything I had was fresh, (as fresh as it could be) I saw them drop it in the fryer.  When I got home, our burgers were nicely wrapped, forgive my sloppy picture, that is not CJs doing. The burger is the best that I have had from a fast food joint. Hands down.  The only complaint I have, which makes my review 4stars is the chicken tenders. They were very small. And when 3 of them is close to $4, I thought I would be getting a little bit more. Especially when some of the sweet potato and criss cut fries were the size of my palm."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to a Carl's Jr. They don't exist where I live. This particular location is located in downtown Phoenix near the basketball arena and baseball stadium, which guarantees they will get business. Well, food wise it was just about average. The beef patty in the burger was just okay. It reminded me of the patties at Burger King but I thought it tasted more bland. The bun they use for their burgers is also too thick. Too much bread in the bread to meat ratio. French fries were decent and very similar to the skinny ones McDonald's has. I probably would not go to a Carl's Jr. again. Just wanted to see how they are."}
{"text":"Please stop over cooking the biscuits! The other day they were perfect, fluffy and golden. Today they were over cooked again. Hard & dark brown which makes them a little chewy."}
{"text":"We went here Last night 11/17/16 around 10:20pm - 10:30pm we ordered Teriyaki burger combo and ultimate burger combo. there are 2 guys that time one brown skin guy with a black hair (SHORT CHUBBY GUY) and a TALL WHITE GUY! the one who serve us is the tall white guy. we waited almost 15 mins for the order in the drive thru and it's ok we don't complain  then we ask for ketchup no ketchup but no ketchup and with attitude too. wow! Seriously? we never complain and giving us that attitute? such a bad service and btw! when we are at the stop light our drinks (COKE) taste like water! so we wanted to do a survey and guess what! the reason he never gave us our RECEIPT because He think we are gonna complain! OMG SUCH a bad night for us. I hope to all of you out there please always ask for receipt if they are giving you attitude because it's directed to their corporate office. It's just an horrible experience for us. will never buy in this area again!"}
{"text":"not a good experience: floor was sticky staff forgot fries, dip & toy of our kids meal (we were the only guests inside) ketchup dispenser was empty fries were cold burgers were ok but nothing special will not come back"}
{"text":"They mistook our order and didn't give a combo then tried to charge us more for fries and drink than if we would have gotten the combo to begin with.  We decided to just get a water cup and they don't do that anymore because of the homeless in the area.  Carl's Jr. obviously doesn't care about the health of individuals and provide water."}
{"text":"I was eating there today and I dissent feel so good then I walked over to the target used there restroom and threw up. so I called them and told them what happens and they said that they would check the brothers and they said the burgers where coming out fine. They asked what I had and I told them what me and my friend ate. So please do not eat at this carls Jr it just might make you throw up."}
{"text":"I never ever give places such low reviews, but I felt I needed to do this and I've been sitting on it for a week.  We dined in the restaurant.   I was going to give 1 star, but my BBQ Chicken Sandwich wasn't horrible.  The bun was smashed and not fresh at all, the meat was a little dry, but I was able to eat it.  Our french fries were cold.  My dh's burgers were so sad.  I think they sat on the buns.  See the pics.  The deal he got was the $4 deal and was charged $9, which I'm glad he caught.  They did refund us, but it was quite strange, you would think if a customer said I want the $4 deal that has a huge poster on the wall, you'd know how to ring that up.  As we're sitting there I glanced over and noticed how dirty the walls were, the windows, and the doors.  I know it's an older place, but you can still clean it every 10 years.  Then I saw a nice little trail of ants right next to my shoulder on the wall.  That did me in, seriously.  So what does the kitchen look like?  I was afraid to look.  And why did you have to sit on our buns?  Take some pride in your location and your customers."}
{"text":"Went to the drive thru, i was seating there for like 5mins and no one is answerig the the drive thru machine. I went inside to order and found out the crew are just busy talking to each other. I asked them if the drive is out pf order amd they told me they forgot to turn thier headsets.   So i just order and eat inside and i found a disgusting tissue holder and salt dispenser are all covered with dust. SMH   I'm not going back here anymore"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for 20 years now! Enjoying a great Western Bacon!!! This is my Carl's JR :)"}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars, I would! Horrible service, no sense of urgency and no sense to even say sorry! Took me about 20 minutes just to get fries and a drink. Thank God I didn't order a burger! I might've been there an hour waiting for that! And there were only 3 people in the restaurant, and we were all waiting for food! It was nice that the workers were having a great time joking around and laughing though. Super classy! Never coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"I mean as far as fast food goes, it's better than most, but you still walk away feeling really icky. Also, the staff seems to get orders wrong frequently, check out the quarter 4 reviews of 2016 on Yelp.   I don't think this place deserves a straight up negative rating per se, but it's hard to find a fast food restaurant that enforces high standards, other than like.... In N Out. But we won't go there, lest a \"In n Out versus Carl's Jr\" debate erupts on Yelp. Not that it hasn't happened before..."}
{"text":"Bad attitude taking order, they charge extra for everything, even a cup of water or a side of ranch."}
{"text":"Food poisoning! Need I say more? The burger was not very hot. Luckily I didn't eat the whole thing. Narrowed it down, had to have been Carl's. It was late so who knows how long the burger had sat around."}
{"text":"Every thing is filthy nobody else here trash everywhere. I had to wait for service until they got off their cell phone. I for sure will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Great service and the restaurant was nice and clean . The food was fresh and fast no complaints"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would. My husband and I ordered the New burger that they are currently advertising which is the Jalapeño Double. We waited about 10 minutes for our food. We were handed the drinks, the fries and the lady told us to have a good night. My husband said to her \"Wait a minute where's our burgers?\" She shakes her head and apologizes and she gets them. Well, we pulled over to the side to make sure we were handed the right burgers; as we unwrapped the burgers it looked as if they were thrown together and the patties were cold and they looked old. We went back to get a refund and I handed the burgers to the cashier and she said she would show the manager and we waited about 5 minutes and the manager came out and handed us our burgers and to be honest with you these were the same burgers that we gave them and you could tell he just threw them in the microwave. Very Disgusting. He tried blaming the lettuce, tomatoes, sauce etc for making the burgers cold. I told him I didn't need an explanation and what I do need is a our money back. My advice is to not come here, unprofessional staff and the food is terrible. Pictures of our food is posted."}
{"text":"Said no to onions if the double cheeseburger had them and the chick said it didn't have them. It was covered in onions. Asked for ranch as one of the sauces for the kids meal. Didn't get any but hey they gave us about 10 packets of ketchup. The lettuce they used for my lettuce wrap burger was old. The people working all acted as though a dementor came in and sucked their souls out. The chick who took our order was denser than iron. Only good thing here were their nuggets and fries."}
{"text":"If I were to just rate food and atmosphere it'd be a 3 star,  however I found the service to be very good and it's something rarely seen in Canada's fast food chain industry.   The food was brought to our table in a timely fashion and it was served hot and the onion rings were crispy just how I like them.  The western 1/3 lbs burger was OK... I normally like my burgers juicier but I still enjoyed the quality.   As a customer,  I tend to lean on the customer service side of things,  and this place hit the marks.   I recommend this place for people who appreciate being treated nicely and it sure feels like they appreciate my business!"}
{"text":"Made a lil pit stop here to use some coupons. Great and fast service. Place was clean too.  And they weren't Jewish with the sauce condiments. They gave us alot without a fuss. Unlike cheap mcds who charges for extra sauce."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner last night. Unlike the first few times this was disappointing. Fries were soggy and the burgers were just ok. Consistency is the key for a good food joint whether a burger place our a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"It's ok. The teriyaki burger was really good and all but it's nothing special. If your gonna pay $2 extra for a combo, try smash burger at Deerfoot mall or fatburger on 32ave ne."}
{"text":"Took me awhile, but had my first six dollar burger finally. I was drawn in by the Fresh Baked Buns and those buns were very good, but the bottom bun was not as big as the top bun and could not stand up to the toppings it supported. The burger itself was large and pretty tasty since I like my burgers well done and dry. They only serve the fresh buns on the pricey burgers, but It is worth another try, since the buns do make a  bit of a positive difference."}
{"text":"There are a couple of things on their menu that are different and pretty good... Chicken sandwiches are ok, and I like the deep fried zucchini too. Its fast food, don't eat it often or you'll die an early death, but this place is pretty good once in a while."}
{"text":"Very very slow! I've waited about 15 minutes to get my order in the drive thru. If i wanted to wait that long i would have gone to a restaurant. This has happened on several occasions."}
{"text":"We drove into the drive thru at 10:01pm....  We get a pre recorded message making it sound like they are still open....so we wait....for about 3 minutes and decide after waiting to just go inside.  My friend had just finished her marathon and she was famished!  That's when we found out that the lobby area was closed as the door was locked. The lady was just standing there ignoring us.  Not even trying to look like she didn't see us.  She just plain did not care about NOT wasting our time.   We drive through the drive through again thinking that since she \"sorta\" saw us that we would get some service.   That's when we realized that they were closed when we got the same pre-re-corded message.  Apparently they close at 10PM on the nose.    I mean come on.  IF YOU ARE CLOSED TURN THE RECORDING OFF.  Seriously, how hard is it to turn that recording off?  And could the lady just have told us, \"I'm sorry but we are closed?\"  Nope she was too busy looking off into space ignoring us.  Really?      So this review is on their lack of service and care for their customers.  Crappy service. . .which means that for me, I will never go back to this location.  There are so many other fast food joints around. . .why waste my money on them."}
{"text":"This Carl's Jr was just built in the area and is so great to have!   The restaurant is clean and the employees are superb. I've never had a bad customer experience here and I tend to eat at this location about once a week or so.   Yes, the food is a bit greasy, but that's what you get when you go fast food. My order, though complicated at times, is always spot-on and I never have to return for anything.   All in all, good food, great employees, and a wonderful location!"}
{"text":"An American Burger chain that has recently moved into Canada. Staff was nice and its nice that they will bring your burger to the table but the burger and fries were not at all memorable."}
{"text":"It's rare that I have notable positive experience at a fast food let alone think of writing a review about it! Not only was my order 100% accurate based on my order at the drive thru intercom, but the attention to detail was fabulous. I got a turkey burger without condiments and added guacamole (amazing btw), and stated I wanted ranch with my fried zucchini (usually that never ends up in my bag). All aspects were correct and cooked to perfection, as well as impressively ripe and red tomatoes in my burger!"}
{"text":"These people can't never get my order right.  On one occasion, I ordered a number 4 combo and I clearly told them I wanted the cheeseburger plain (just the meat and cheese and the receipt also said plain).  Well, they gave me the cheeseburger with onion rings and sauce on it.  Then, I had to drive back to the restaurant (I did not find out after getting back home) to get my order right.  After they supposedly fixed the problem and after checking the burger before leaving, I discovered that they had either given me back the same burger or made the same mistake again.  Today, I went in for the same order and guess what? Yes, they had once again put sauce and onion rings after I told them I wanted a plain cheeseburger.  The girls at the window kept laughing and acting as though it was funny to mess up costumers' orders. I go to this place for my son, but I think the service is terrible.  I also think it is very expensive.  A number 4 combo (just a cheese burger, fries and a drink) is 11 dollars! I told my son I will not be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Hot fresh food usually.  Staff seems to turn over lots.  Bad place to put them right across from in n out, but when in n out is busy this is a good alternative.  Don't try the new Texas burger, get the Memphis instead(much better deal). The jalapeño straws are worthless!  No spice and taste stale.  Burger isn't bad once you take them off, but then again it's pretty much a Memphis with less \"brisket.\""}
{"text":"This place is a nice change from other burger chains.Much tastier burgers and fries than most, with more choices, and the option to get a Monster drink with your combo is a plus.They definitely need to open another location in the NW."}
{"text":"If I could I'd give this a zero star rating! I've been Waiting in the drive thru lane over 25 mins and there was only 2 cars in front of be. Ordered only a kids meal and was told they were \"out\" of of sprite. Finally approached the window, wasn't greeted or at least told sorry for the wait?! What the heck?"}
{"text":"Worst Carl's Jr. in any decent part of town! The cooks need to be re-trained or just replaced. More than once from this location, I received the worst Carl's Jr. food, out of any location ever. They don't even warm up, cook or even nuke the Pre-Cooked bacon, they just slap it on burgers like straight out of the packaging. I will never waste my money on this franchised location again. They should improve the management over there. I suggest the location on Rainbow & Warm Springs instead, they actually put out a great product at that location. No joke."}
{"text":"Only complaint I have with this location is that the drive thru time takes quite a while, other then that clean restaurant, friendly staff, and.... Good food I guess. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"For this girl on a low-carb diet, nothing beats the Low-Carb Six Dollar Burger from Carl's Jr!    When I held that first one in my hand and devoured it with shameless glee, I had a full-on, earth-shaking, world-rocking, life-changing SIX DOLLAR BURGASM!!!    Swear. To. Gawd.   Damn, I wish I had one right now."}
{"text":"Green Burrito always closes at night and as for Carl's Jr. side every time I have been there they are always out of a promo or just other items. I have given up."}
{"text":"Stopped at the Germann & Gilbert Rd. Carl's Jr today 9/15/17.  I wanted Carls Jr today because I saw an add on TV but the quality of the food I actually got versus the way they portrait it on TV is total opposite.  The burger was the Western Star double bacon burger.  The bun seemed all flattened and soggy.  The meat patties looked and tasted like they were prepared ahead of time.  The bacon was kind of tough.  For $8.51 I was certainly hoping to get a much nicer meal than what I actually received.  I could've gone to McDonalds and probably had a better tasting meal for a little less in price.  It's going to take a lot to get me to go back to a Carl's Jr."}
{"text":"I came here around 10:30 and the doors were closed. So I decided to walk to the window, just in case they can still help me with my order. I am in the stratosphere hotel across the street. Our server Raven, spoke to another vehicle in front of me saying I wasn't going to get my order standing in the drive thru. If I were an employee there I would have told the person standing there that we are not allowed to help people walking in the drive though as soon as I noticed. She needs to be talked to about that behavior period."}
{"text":"Horrible service ! Rude people and ignorant ! We only go to this place because it's opened late and this time it was a bad mistake . Caleb , the cashier , was so rude and short . He asked what we wanted , we ordered , asked for fresh fries and he stayed quite and just said he will have the total In the window , we paid and asked for buffalo sauce and he made a face , we said thank you and he just closed the window .  I have such a high patience level , but this kid just looked like he hated life . He's clearly In the wrong line of work !!  Horrible fries , shakes , etc  We will NOT be returning here !"}
{"text":"Great customer service with friendly employees.  Sometimes things can get backed-up, but remember this seems to be a training location for new local CJs.  They are very flexible with allowing customers ask for food \"their way\"."}
{"text":"This Carls Jr has certainly gone down hill. My husband and I go to the register to place the order. The women takes my order and tells me my total- without taking my husbands order and then gives me attitude when I told her she needs to add on his food too..  this same girl who had no clue what she doing- pissed off another customer by telling them they must not sell turkey burgers anymore because she couldn't find it on the register, had to have someone else come over just to show her.  We wanted to dine in, so we could enjoy the food before our road trip- do you think it was enjoyable? No! Because someone half way through decides to play with the sound system - which causes the music to go on and off and give a lot of white noise- and turn it into a damn nightclub blasting the music soo loud that we decided to leave. Freaking awful! And don't even ask for sauce, they won't give you more than 1."}
{"text":"I wanted to write this review to recognize the staff member named Jodi. Very friendly customer service. I had paid and walked away without receiving my change bc I was in a hurry to eat, she brought my change to me personally. After grabbing my drink from the dispenser and went to wash my hands and the food was out at my table waiting for me. There was no down time for Jodi bc as soon as she was done taking orders she started cleaning tables. Very efficient employee I must say. Being that I own a salon with a staff of 20, I can appreciate a great employee. Needless to say the dining experience was everything I expected and more! Thank you Jodi :-)"}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was delicious. Thank you to Jeremy for checking on us thru out the time and bringing us our food."}
{"text":"Yuck..don't eat at this location They serve old sour slop... I'm pissed at what I just ate here..never again"}
{"text":"Would get more stars but they are always out of criss cut fries. That's one of the main reasons I choose them and find myself continually let down. They don't seem to concerned either. :("}
{"text":"I'm glad to find this place rather close to me.  nothing beats a western bacon cheeseburger and fried zucchini!!  This location was just as any Carl's Jr. should be.  clean, friendly staff, nothing to complain about!!"}
{"text":"Yes, Abu J.. I will elaborate. Just for you.  $6 burger Fail .. you probably cost 35¢ to make and you were cold. Soggy french fries Fail .. How do you F up fries? Srsly. Sprite lacking Co2 Fail .. It is NOT hard to reattach a new tank. Customer Service Fail  .. I don't appreciate being scowled at while handing over money.  And honestly, I never liked this place.. its crap IMO."}
{"text":"The best Carl's I've been to.  And as a salesperson, I've been to many around the country. Some so disgusting and dirty I walked out.  Others slow or obnoxious employees.  This one had none of those bad qualities.  Just a clean place with a helpful and pleasant staff that makes you feel like family....very welcomed.  Order perfect.  Food tasty."}
{"text":"I should have checked YELP before coming here. I order a sandwich plain, add ketchup... They make a sandwich plain and add PICKLE.. I let them know that it's incorrect. They take the sandwich back as if they are going to make a new one.. All they do is take it back, remove the pickle and add ketchup... I just returned it and left.."}
{"text":"This is the worse Carl's Jr restaurant I have ever been to.   --The drive through speaker is low volume. The manager has been saying since it opened \"we are going to fix it soon\" But it never gets fixed.  --Three times within a month the wait in car line was excessive. Sometimes reaching as long as 7 minutes waiting for the person to take my order. There is hardly a wait to get in line because I guess people are starting to hate the bad service. But imagine when you get to the speaker and the person asks you to wait and you do...for 7+ mins!  --The manager and district manager have been called by me two times and still they do NOTHING to correct the simplest of problems.   I have just gotten used to driving to the Carl's on W Craig. At least there the staff knows how to run a restaurant. To bad too because this one is closer to the house."}
{"text":"Our food was fine but we waited to long for it and had a few mixups/not all there at the window. When I went inside I told the young guy behind the counter he had just given me my meals and that he didn't give me a receipt either and that my meals were still incorrect. He kept telling me \"just wait\" and so I did. About five minute later he walked over to me and said \"oh yea, well you have to wait\" so I continued waiting. He looked over at me walked back over and yelled \"I don't know you\". When I explained to him I had just left the drive thru and retold him my whole order and when told him I was the person he almost forgotten to give back the debit card to he got more upset and yelled again \"I don't know you, you could be anyone without a receipt\". Well as I said he didn't give me one. So he walked away back to the drive thru window laughing at me and staring, so I walked out accepting defeat. Well my sister who was with me didn't give up as easily she went back in with everything including the card used and explained were missing items. He turned and looked at her with a mean smirk and laughed at her as well but with her he pushed the missing items into her hand and said \"here!\" and walked away from her rudely. All this happened within a few minutes so I have no clue why we were treated like criminals trying to scam when he had just seen us and spoke to us moments before. I understand mistakes, we all make them, however I am swearing off RUDE businesses. I never went back and never will."}
{"text":"Been there three times in the past month - each time I received a heat-lamp'ed dried out burger - very disappointed.  NOT FRESH!! Will not return!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. I'm literally still waiting at he window, nobody has said anything to me so far, and nobody was in front of me, and it's been quite a few minutes, giving me enough time to write this post. The cashier did apologize though. Very slow service, will try my best not to come here again. Not the first time this has happened."}
{"text":"So slow! Every time! That might be ok if they were actually making everything at the time of order. Other ingredients were fresh but burger patty was cold?  What is up? Use to like Carl's. This one has lost my business."}
{"text":"Waited 10 min to order.  Bad customer service. Every time around 6 to 7pm.  Items always unavailable. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Not worth even the 1 star rating. First of all gave us the wrong hamburger from what we ordered the girl is too busy looking at her phone in order to make sure our order was correct. Burger appeared to be of dog food turkey dog food color. There was absolutely no taste it whatsoever, very bland. Will never go to another Carl's Jr"}
{"text":"I don't normally expect much from fast food as I am normally disappointed by either the service or quality of food. My husband first visited this location and was so impressed that the fries are always fresh. We now will go out of our way just for this location because it is far superior to the rest in the area. The staff is always friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Biscuits and Gravy here are bomb --hot and fresh every time!  Best of all, they are $1. Drive thru service could be faster.   Like the location- Gilbert & Germann- near the San Tan 202 freeway."}
{"text":"This building used to be a Krispy Kreme donut shop. The new occupant is Carl's Jr. In my second time eating at Carl's Jr., on this location for lunch. This place is very clean for a fast food restaurant. When I was eating my hamburger combo. I saw one of the employee on her hands and knees scrubbing the tile floor with a scouring pad. Wow!"}
{"text":"I think Carl's Jr is too expensive but this one on Charleston has the most polite employees. Every time I said thank you they relied with ,\"my pleasure\". Everyone is always genuine and pleasant."}
{"text":"Gladys was awesome,  make her manager,  SHE is an asset to this location.  This location was clean, prompt, and very pleasant."}
{"text":"This has to be the slowest drive through in the country!  They are slow to take your order and slow to receive your food....plan at least 12 minutes waiting in line!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with h some co-workers to at best check this of our list as we have not gone south to try it.  First the staff:  very helpful and a pleasant experience.    The food:  chain food.  More options then a McDonalds but really I would Raye it average at best.  The onion rings I would call a miss.  The fries not great.  I go the bacon avacado burger.  This was OK.  Was very messy.  Almost need a spoon to finish it.  Ambience:  Nicely done over all.     If you aspire to be average or just under choose this place.  If you desire more than average go  across the street to holy chuck."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying Carl's on the way back from Las Vegas. There aren't any Carls restaurants in the eastern part of the US, so this was going to be my one chance. I had a Famous Star burger with cheese and small crisscut fries. The burger was nothing special, but the fries were pretty good."}
{"text":"One star review because I pulled in to the drive-through at 20 minutes after 11 and they were closed already. Even though the website clearly says midnight."}
{"text":"There staff is the friendliest people I've ever met, come here often and love their food. Lose one star cause the food usually takes a while"}
{"text":"I got a western bacon cheese burger, the meat was overcooked, bun soggy, cheese cooked away dry, I think they microwaved this thing, I never learn, not the first time to experience horrible food"}
{"text":"Food was cooked well enough but the dumb girl at the window was too busy talking about partying and drugs or whatever to make sure she got my order right. I paid for a side item and I did not receive it. don't apply for a job if you're not going to do it correctly."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying I give this place a -15 stars for the amount of minutes I had to wait TO NOT ORDER OR GET FOOD.  I waited in the drive through for 15 minutes behind a car waiting to order.  The car behind me finally realized to back up and then I followed! The guy in front of me drove off too  You don't want my money or business? That's great I will never be back."}
{"text":"Horrible customer services this lady didn't even care at all not only did she cut us off mid conversation, but gave us attitude for no reason.  We also asked if we can order more and she replied with a \"what do you want\" in a rude way that made us not want anything else. They also got our order wrong we got tater tot's instead of the onion rings we ordered.  The time was 10:40am"}
{"text":"They do have some of the expected carny Strip price inflation, but only on certain items ... I'm giving it 4 stars tho because they mysteriously have the lowest price on Big Burgers I've ever seen. 1.50 each after tax ... by comparison they're $2.10 in Reno and in California I've seen them at $2.50 each!"}
{"text":"The very few times that I have decided to go to this Carl's Jr for something to eat has been anything but desirable. First off, the person running the drive thru usually comes off as being rude and very pushy. Secondly, and this happens almost every time that I have stopped there, the fries have been borderline raw. They are barely golden in color and not very crunchy.  It's as if they dropped them into the vat for a minute or two, just enough to thaw them out and get some texture to them, and they usually have a very small amount of salt on them. Lastly, and I did mention this to a manager who was running the drive thru, You never get any packets of ketchup with your order. Every time I have come home I have had to use my own ketchup because there are no packets in the bag. The hamburgers themselves are very good. It's everything else about this place that needs some serious improvements."}
{"text":"I've never really been a fan of Carl's Jr, generally. Their food is typically overpriced and not as tasty as other quick-serve restaurants.   However, the Hardee's Scratch Made biscuits sign caught my eye. Hey, I'm a Southern boy, what can I say?   For that reason, I checked it out on Monday, Dec 10. What I found there will make me return.   The Manager, Craig, is the key.   He knows his customers. Impressive, since the place is only been open a few months.   He has a friendly, cheerful, engaging disposition. It's a quality sadly lacking in many restaurants, particularly in quick-serve environments. And for Craig, is doesn't come across as superficial, \"I was trained to be nice,\" insincerity. It's real.   Craig seems to take interest in his customers. When I first walked in, he immediately engaged me in a conversation about something of common interest, easily done since I was wear a football jersey to celebrate my hometown team's victory the day before.   Craig also keeps the place neat and clean. Also a unique quality in quick-serve places these days.   Carl's Jr. in Surprise is what quick-serve ought to be."}
{"text":"#151  Long awaited arrival of well known Carl's Jr. to the Calgary market, apparently located in an old Arby's location near SAIT, Starbucks, and Sushi BBQ Inn along 16th Ave NW.  I had always loved Carl's Jr. since living in the US years ago so you can imagine my excitement being able to drive 20 minutes instead of 8 plus hours to get to one.  Unfortunately, the excitement, like any of Vancouver's Stanley Cup runs or Dallas Cowboys playoff runs, fell short.  For $28 and some change, two people got the following:  Super Star w/cheese for $6.01 in a combo including onion rings that overdone and almost chewy instead of crunchy for $3.09 (combo price and at this point, the onion rings are better at Burger King or A & W) and a chocolate shake that was more whipped cream than shake for $4.49 (combo price which are better at Smashburger).  Note: most burgers come with mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, tomato, onion so buyer beware.  Western bacon thickburger for $7.01 in a combo including crisscut fries for $3.49 and medium beverage for $2.69 (which is the extra large from years ago). The burger was not charbroiled enough as what they advertise is charbroiled Angus burgers and the bacon was too thinly sliced. The portion of the fries was disappointing.  For this price, I expect higher quality since there are many places like Smashburger or pubs like Joyce on 4th that have higher quality at the same price or sometimes less.  The service, especially by Canadian standards and actual delivery, was adequate.  This was a bucket list to do item but I might come back to see what changes, if anything.  Technically, this should be two and a half stars, not three."}
{"text":"Ben a while since I ate here or any Carl's Jr but today I went back because I was craving a burger & I remember as a kid how Carl's was my favorite because there burgers were so delicious! I got the moonshine 1/3lb combo with Chris cut fries I'm a have to say I was impressed fries where fresh and the burger was delicious can't say I have anything to complain about! Definitely with be frequenting Carl's more often now"}
{"text":"We have tried this spot a few times due to it's convenient location, and usually enough time has passed between visits that we forget, but there is consistently something wrong or outright missing from every order. Every time! A shame, too, last time we went the guy at the register was super friendly and helpful, but when we got home things were missing...  We've tried different shifts (different crew), different months, drive thru vs walking in... No improvement. Like I said in the beginning, usually enough time has lapsed between our last attempt to order food here that when Carl's Jr comes up in conversation we forget that this particular restaurant is cursed.   Looks like we're gonna be going somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"Food was like McDonalds. Greasy feeling in the end of it . Atmosphere was cool , service was friendly ! Fries were decent."}
{"text":"I will say the burger was huge and all the vegetables on it were very fresh BUT the patty had no flavor at all!!.. That was the most bland hamburger I have ever eaten. I had high hopes because of all the good reviews but I was not impressed with the burger today. Fries were good.. maybe my burger missed the \"seasoning\" station before it hit the bun. :/... I was really looking forward to a tasty dinner. *Sigh*"}
{"text":"Way too expensive for the same ol slop u get at any burger joint. Id say about 7 $ too much for a meal."}
{"text":"When you place an order for a chicken club sandwich and ask if it comes with bbq sauce and you are told no it has mayo and you get home and take a bite, only to find out it's marinated in bbq sauce, which by the way I'm allergic to and they have a bad attitude when you take it back and you call corporate and you are given a local number to call for Las Vegas area only to leave a message and never get a return call.  A 0 Star is actually more appropriate!"}
{"text":"Total pricks the workers closed the dinning room 2 hours early on a Saturday and hid from us behind the counter. Never felt so humiliated with my family.  I hope management reads this and fires all of you inept folks."}
{"text":"Just came back from this garbage dump and had to write a review while it was still fresh in my mind. I had a coupon for two Santa Fe Chicken sandwiches. Went through the drive in and brought them home. If I had tried to eat them there I would have raised some hell. My wife and I both took one bite and spit the chicken out. It was burnt and tough as nails on both sandwiches. Carls must be purchasing old Roosters because I have never eaten anything so disgusting. It was too far and not worthwhile to bring back so I went to BK and got two Jr. Whoppers - both very good. I guess they are too preoccupied with putting near naked women in their ads to pay attention to their food quality. So long Carls, that was the last time for us."}
{"text":"slowest drive thru in this area. absolutley inane. waited 15 minutes to place my order then another 10 minutes to get my order. need to hire people who are more friendly and have better training.  this will be my last stop here due to the incompetent staff and the rude lady at the drive thru."}
{"text":"Normally I dont do carls jr. I find the food to be mediocre and a little more pricey compared to other options. I could go to chipotle for the same price.  Well, today I felt like being different, especially since i got a coupon in the mail for a buy one get one free.   the cashier couldnt understand my order and when i got home i realized it was completely wrong. Very annoyed I called the manager and he was extremely nice. He explained that the cook just followed orders and the cashier took the order wrong. He apologized multiple times and asked what he could do, to make the situation better. he even offered to comp my meal if i wanted to come back then, or if i wanted to come back the next day he would fix the problems for free. Awesome!  Its lovely to see customer service at its best, and even better when you get a coupon with it."}
{"text":"I totally love this location of Carl's Jr.  The food is great, the service is excellent and they are always very nice.  I brought some friends from out of town who hadn't had Carl's Jr. before and they loved it too!"}
{"text":"If you go to this location, be prepared for a long wait! I have to echo previous comments in that the food is fine, but wait times are horrible!   I have only been here twice and both times the drive thru wait was extremely long. I thought the first time might have just been a busy day for them, but then in my second trip it was the same terrible experience waiting. In this recent visit, I spent over 30 minutes in the drive thru! I would have left but I was blocked in so forced to wait over half an hour for 2 burgers.   I won't be returning. There are two many burger places in close proximity that don't ave the service time issues I've experienced here."}
{"text":"So apparently at 3:15 am there is no response in the window and it appears to be open and the employee was sweeping and didn't bother to come to the window. What is the point to be open when there's no one serving. I proceeded to call and the employee told me I'm just doing my job and there's supposed to be a car to block the drive thru. So how is that my problem? This is so unprofessional and 5 cars came through trying to order & sat there as well & started honking. That's losing money in my mind but I come here all the time and now I will not return when someone talks to me like I'm inconveniencing them, when im a customer. You need to properly notify customers of this with better signage. Parking a vehicle in front of the window is not my idea of a large chain restaurant to show you're closed, because people still can pull up to order, which will have no responder, then as they pull around to the window to try to speak to someone a car will be blocking it, causing the customer to have to back out, which is somewhat difficult, especially when theres another car behind you about to go through the same ridiculous process. Don't display false advertisement if you're not open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Not a great experience this time around. And I'm not complaining about the food. It was OK. The lady that took my order did not seem too happy to be there. She greeted me with a stoned face of discontent. I actually felt bad for coming in to eat. She didnt have a name tag on, I guess that's a good idea in the time of the yelp. My receipt had Tania printed on it. She is a short Hispanic Woman. As far as the food, it came out in about minute and the fries were a little old, but it's sort of expected in FF. This used to be my favorite CJ's, but I think I'll go to a different location from now on."}
{"text":"Had nothing I wanted and every time I asked for something the young man would say that they are out of that at the moment. Worst ever. Do not go to this drive throw at night. Bad service"}
{"text":"Yes, I know it's a Carl's Jr, but the guy who took our order (drive thru) was very polite and happily took our coupons without any hassles.  Added bonus... they give free doggy treats to anyone who has their dog in the car with them. Totally cool!"}
{"text":"Came here late at night last week and my chicken sandwich was fresh and my criss cut fries and fried zucchini was delicious. He made them well done like I asked."}
{"text":"I never see anyone at this location and I found out why today! For a store that just opened do you think that the people that work there would be friendly that was not the case. I went in anyways even though the employee in the parking lot was more than unfriendly and went into find out that they didn't even have mayo to accommodate one of their 20 different burgers that they have. Epic fail."}
{"text":"The zucchini was good, especially with the ranch dressing. What a great side dish choice. This particular location needs a more cleanliness-oriented management (to put it nicely)."}
{"text":"When I was a kid the Western Bacon was one of my favorite burgers. Forget about Whoppers and Big Macs because I was all down for putting a fried onion ring and BBQ sauce on my burgers.  Fast forward to today; I honestly don't think this is the best fast food sandwich anymore. I think everything has changed about it. Well basically it seems like Carl's Jr has changed all of their vendors and quality of products. Ingredients are still the same, it just tastes different. Carl's Jr. buns are now kind of waxy, their burgers don't taste that good, and the bacon is just chewy fat strips. I just hate these sandwiches now. I won't be eating one again or at least not for awhile.    p.s. I had to order their onion rings because they changed up their fries. I'm sorry but I loved their French fries, but their new ones are the worst. These onion rings suck too!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here today with my wife.  Took a couple minutes before anyone came to the counter to take our order.  She was pleasant enough when she finally arrived though.  Dinning room was clean.  Took awhile for the food to come out to the table.  Holy grease when it did arrive.  Soaked through the wrappers on our sandwiches and the cardboard on the hash brown  things.   Twas a fast food breakfast.  If one of the 3 employees that seen us at the counter had offered a \"someone will be with you in a moment\"  or possibly let someone know there were customers at the counter this may have been a 3."}
{"text":"Mary has been so awesome with customer service. I have been a frequent customer over the last two months. Trying to get this location recognized on Yelp took some doing, but finally it happened. This is a great location near the 215 freeway, but it is also is far enough away from the busy Arroyo Marketplace.  This location has a dining room that is open late and is a good option to try their turkey hamburger.  Some of the most friendly and best service I have received from a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"As usual the staff is always well spoken and polite. My favorite part of CJ is that they say \"my pleasure\" when you say thank you. This is five star service and I love it. I do with they had more staff available in peak times. Crystal was killing it in the drive thru getting orders in and making drinks but she was clearly waiting on the kitchen for food."}
{"text":"IF IT WASNT FOR THE CARS BEHIND ME I WOULD HAVE DRIVE AWAY  I'm writing this review  while still waiting in line just to order my food!! \"Been here the past 7 min waiting\" I don't see any sense of urgency from any employee thru the window and I'm sure by time I get my food my fries will be cold!!   They werent sorry or apologetic about the wait!!  The Milk shake was FROZEN solid at the bottom and milk on top!! I was told it was the machines fault I order a slider combo triple and got one burger and no cookie"}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone is talking about this place was clean, Fe the lady running the counter was amazingly friendly and honestly it was the tastiest double western I've had in at least a year at this location! Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Have tried this location a few times now and have been let down. Each time something has had to go back for poor quality. This time is was chicken strips old and greasy. For fast food that is a pricey as they are I just expect more. This will not be a do again."}
{"text":"This review is about their new menu for Green Burrito. I used to be able to get a beef, bean and cheese burrito. I really like these. They no longer have these on the menu. I think this is true of any of the Green Burrito locations. The same thing happened in California. Not much reason for me to come back here."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fast fooder but was excited to try the new Hawaiian charbroiled chicken.  I was unimpressed- the bun was so so, the chicken bland and the whole combination was not working for me.  I will stick to the burgers next time."}
{"text":"I really like Carl's Wetern Bacon Cheeseburger. Greasy deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Well what can I say it just seems like they don't care about their customers, because they keep on giving  a 1 star customer service and it looks like the manager at this restaurant don't give a dam about losing customers or getting bad reviews. Today I went there at 12:23 noon and Giselle (order taker) sounded like she just didn't want to be there. As I got to the windows she wasn't friendly(you lost points there) then by the time she handed me the sodas( they weren't marked) I asked her which one was the Diet Coke, her response (which was the highlight of why I'm giving you a bad review) her response was\" I don't know you're the one that mixed them up\" ARE YOU F**** KIDDING ME!!! Like who says that, first of all if you would of marked them down I would of never asked you which one is which one. Her comment just killed it for me.   So IF YOU DONT LIKE DEALING WITH CUSTOMERS THEN I SUGGEST YOU WORK IN THE BACK AND LET SOMEONE WITH A BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE TAKE CARE OF THE CUSTOMERS!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to carls jr for lunch we both got  4 for 4  it was too much food double cheeseburger, spicy chicken sandwich, french fries an a drink  we couldn't finish"}
{"text":"Went in today to order a sausage egg and cheese biscuit only to find out they are all out of biscuits...smh? Its not like I could of had it any other way since most of their breakfast items are on biscuits.    It's like going to a pizza joint only to be told, \"sorry we're all out of dough\"!   Such a disappointment. Get your inventory straight Carl's Jr.!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Drive-thru took more than 15 mins. They have a 2 famous stars for 4 and have ordered several times with cheese. They basically charge the cheese on top. This time the person taking the order wants to charge full price instead of 4 bucks plus extra for cheese. To top it off, have me a look. Good job with the staff you hired. I go to this Carl's a lot but not no more. Rather driver double the distance as they MUST have better employees."}
{"text":"I love Carls's Jr's burgers but the woman working the drive through this visit is an idiot. I had to correct her 3 times at the speaker and twice more at the window and she still go my order wrong.    The manager need to higher people who speak English!!"}
{"text":"This Carl's Jr. Makes all Carl's Jr. Look bad. The employees don't wear proper uniform, the cooks never change gloves and don't get me started about the management. If I was a health inspector I would shut them down. They are always messing around and never paying attention to orders took me 10min in the drive thru last time. This place sucks! If your looking for good quality food better go to the dumpster bc this Carl's Jr. Is worse."}
{"text":"I was shopping at the near by target, saw someone eating Carl's Jr.... was like hey I want some. (First and last meal of the day) So on my way home I picked up some. I got food poisoning, it knock me the F out and I'm dying for almost the next 24hr... now it's thanksgiving day and I'm all fatigued and still having untimely movement. I'm sorry but F U Carl's Jr. you have ruined my thanksgiving so far."}
{"text":"Usually come here to fix the craving, came in today very disappointed with both the food and the service. I tried the new texas bbq burger, the meat is not fresh, crunchy jalapeno is cold and chewy...can't believe they served me that. Fries are also cold too. Won't be coming back to this location anymore."}
{"text":"Best place for shakes!  Love the big burgers"}
{"text":"Given this location several chances to get their st*t together but it's always one thing or another... Either serving me incorrect order or food that was just plain crappy tasting or cold, or poorly [slapped] together. I can't tell you how much I love their breakfast biscuits, and I can't tell you how freakin annoying it is when they slap it together so poorly that it just basically falls apart when opened. I'll just take my business to the Rainbow location from now on."}
{"text":"They took 10 minutes just to bring me a simple burger and after i finally received it and bite into it, i threw it away. It was soggy and sounded nasty when i bit into it. Im done with carls jr"}
{"text":"I give it four stars The breakfast is very good now. They even have jelly :) But no grape only strawberry that sucks but Its a step up for them. Getting under cooked breakfast meat is never a joy to me when ever I go they have to recook my order. So 4 stars it is."}
{"text":"Went here for the grand opening today. The staff were very pleasant and they already know how to recommend the good burgers. Service was very hospitable. You take a number and they bring you the food. They ask if you need anything, provide you with sauces, etc. They ask how you like the burgers. The people are very warm. I wish all fast food places are like this!  The Western thickburger was yummy. The bun wasn't so heavy and a little sweet. I actually think the burgers are a lot better than Holy Chuck's across the street. It's less greasy and actually made well. The meat are tasty. The Western thickburger was really delicious. The veggies were fresh. I also like the High mile burger. It's very simple. Comes with meat, cheese and sauces I think, but the bun made such a big difference. I love their burger buns!  Definitely going back to try the Guac bacon thickburger!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok ....I think I kinda like the hamburgers here,  just stop telling folks that a 40 oz drink is a large,  that is extra large, I don't want a drink larger than 32 oz,  that is a true large,  med. is 20 oz and small is just a tease.  I don't like the french fries but I don't like anyone's fries these days, so that is nothing,  keep making those burgers that taste like a burger should and I will keep coming back"}
{"text":"The last 2 out of 2 times I went here my order was messed up. The girl behind the counter didn't even acknowledge us for a few minutes when we walked in.  She was working on her schedule or something.  My famous star sandwich was just sad looking.  Not very appetizing. I don't think I'll be going back here again."}
{"text":"Not only did they give me the wrong sandwich, the genius at the drive through almost forgot my drink. Honestly, this all made me chuckle more than anything. HOW DO YOU SCREW UP THAT BADLY? Hahaha"}
{"text":"Yep...another 5 star---not for the food but, for the staff. What t team!  Go in at lunch and become a \"Friend\"---you will know it when it happens~"}
{"text":"For a quick stop in between appointments, I was pleased to find that it was clean, service was friendly and prompt and that the calories were listed on the menu. Pleasantly surprised that the Sante Fe chicken wasn't \"too\" bad and tasted good."}
{"text":"Just went through the drive thru at 12:54 pm. There were no customers at all. Only 2 people in line at the drive thru and I literally spent 15 mins waiting for my food. Are y'all really that slow? I could have waited in line at the canes next to them and gotten my food a lot faster. Canes had their drive thru line wrap around their whole store too"}
{"text":"Like to eat early breakfast and lime to dine in.  Have not come here for a while because they can not seem to open on time.  Came today, 6:20am and their doors are still locked.  20 min after there opening.  Guess I will go down the street to Jack's."}
{"text":"1 star for the service  No stars for food quality. I've gotten a good Carl's Jr. Burger before but this one was very dry. I drove home with it and it sat for 10 minutes but still was very dry for only sitting for about 10 minutes. Fries weren't the freshest.  Food was not worth the 10 dollars I paid for it I didn't see the atmosphere as I went through the drive thru  And I was definitely not wowed"}
{"text":"The manager in charge today, Erick was very friendly helpful and so nice to deliver my meal to my table.  The whole crew today was dealing with the lack of carbonation very well.  Some guests were being rude about it but the manager handled it very professional and in a friendly manner.  Nice to see the staff taking great pride in their operations."}
{"text":"Horrible! It would be better if there was an option for NO stars! My fish has about a squirt and a half of \"tartar sauce\" on it, but they made sure to give me half a head of lettuce. I also noticed a tray of bacon sitting underneath the food warmer, disgusting!"}
{"text":"Just had to give our drive thru order 3 times to the same person! Yes, 3 times. Contacts if you want my receipt number. I'll drive to one farther for basic competence."}
{"text":"The food is just ok.... This location they fall short on water. Look at my picture at that small water cup. SMH... nothing makes me mad like spending 20 to 30 bucks on food and then u ask for water and they give you a small cup of water. Again I dont need to brush my teeth I want water to drink. Three Stars from me."}
{"text":"New location!  OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK!   It's the same as any other Carl's Jr, except it's brand new and cleaner.    Burger selection is pretty good, and so are the choices for chicken and salads.  They probably have one of the best fast food breakfast menu's, IF you are into different kinds of breakfast burrito's and/or breakfast sandwiches(which I am).    I look at Carl's Jr as a good fast food alternative to your typical McDonald's or Burger King, with slightly better food and better shakes.  **TIP*** Go to their website and find the location near you, and they have several online coupons you can print out to save you some cash!"}
{"text":"couldn't give it less stars, will never ever eat at carl's jr, ever again.  the customer service here tonight is the absolute worst i have ever dealt with.  i don't care if i was wrong, misunderstanding the price,, but when i ask how much an item is i expect an answer, not to get bitched at by the lady while she refuses to tell me what the price is.  i will never, ever spend my money at carl's jr again."}
{"text":"Their all natural burger is very good. The baked bun is probably the best bun of any fast food burger.  The burger is 2nd to the double double at In and Out on my list of best fast food burger."}
{"text":"SO PISSED!!!! I ordered a #2, no cheese, wrapped in lettuce, add thousand island. And got nothing remotely close to it.   I have celiac's disease and am highly allergic to gluten. So when I went back in and told the guy that my order was wrong, I WAS LIVID!! I have learned due to my disease to check my order with a fine toothed comb. Really, it's a simple order.   If you have any specifics to an order GO INSIDE. Tell them face-to-face that you have an allergy and hold them to it. Well, I'm eating my own advice....  Does it surprise me that it had no thousand island dressing on it after they remade it???? NO!"}
{"text":"Now when one goes to a fast-food chain restaurants you are pretty safe to bet what you will get, and for  this location nothing was different; however, the person asleep on the floor of the restroom feet hanging out of the stall and luggage all over the floor is not what you expect. Staff was quick to take care of the situation at hand. But from the look of it he had been there for quite awhile. The food was delivered promptly and was as expected. Just be aware of your surroundings around this area of town, and don't be surprised of the treasures you can find."}
{"text":"drive through quickly at 10:30 in the morning. I got an expensive sandwich, it taste like a day old the cheese was hard and around the edges, bun old and  hard."}
{"text":"This place is open 24hrs, just don't come asking for breakfast! They don't serve anything involving biscuits (half of their breakfast menu) until 6:10am.  The biscuits here are amazing, just good luck getting one!"}
{"text":"Carl's Junior is one of those good fast food places you don't find east of the Mississippi.  One of the surprises with moving to the Valley, was discovering Carl's, Jr.  As with most fast food places, I rarely give higher than three star, because... well...  they're fast food, not Three Star Michelin cuisine.     But Carl's Jr might be the exception to my rule.  I would offer they are at least  three and half stars on most occasions we've dinned here.  We would recommend any of the burgers, but also the Chicken Strips.  They are flavorful and as good as any we've had, including the Colonel's and Popeye's.    We would also recommend the Malts and Shakes.  They use real milk and make it fresh before your eyes.  Nice!  Also, be on the lookout for coupons in your Sunday paper.  Most times there's buy one, get one free.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised today when eating here with my husband. Our burgers were fresh and hot, and not covered in sause. Friendly service, clean. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Having lived on the East (weak) Coast the majority of my life, I am not very familiar wt Carls Jr. I actually needed some \"cash back\" & they were the closest thing to me and I ordered 3 chicken fingers wt Honey Mustard sauce = $4.31 total.  They claim that the Chicken Tenders are \"hand breaded\" and I dont doubt it as they are some of the best I have had in recent memory. The 3 tenders I was served were very big and thick (maybe 4-5 inches long) & breaded and crispy while the meat was nice and moist. The Honey Mustard sauce was pretty standard and could have been spicier but I'm NOT complaining.  I have not tried anything else on the menu BUT I can give 2 thumbs up on the Chicken Tenders at least at this location."}
{"text":"When I came to this location only one girl was working window and front. I literally waited 10min to even get an order and while I was ordering she was trying to make a milkshake and get drinks for the drive thru. I felt bad for her I could tell she was stressed so I bit my tongue. But sadly they messed up my order too. I wanted the new 6 burger with the homemade bun but instead I got the regular bun. Which is the whole reason I went there was to try it. I then had to wait another 10 min for them to get me a new burger.   Tip to management: you are running your floor thin and understaffed. You may not have a lot of hours to use cause of a slow location. But experience of customers is key. Plus over working your employees! Get someone else in there to help with the windows so the people who do choose to come in and enjoy your service can actually enjoy it!!!"}
{"text":"It is so nice to be able to buy just a sandwich and a drink without the upsell of fries.  It helps me keep on track and make a decent healthful selection.  I reccomend the teriyaki turkey burger.  It had lots of flavor and was on a whole wheat bun."}
{"text":"Got burned  chicken fingers from this location.  I'm a chef at a local restaurant and if any of my staff ever thought of serving burned food to one of my customers they would soon find them selves out of a job."}
{"text":"Went here to get a teriyaki burger. They made me a turkey burger. No, it was not a misunderstanding. I went in to get my order fixed and was told I was not allowed to order the item I wanted because they hadn't trained the new cook how to make it yet. Unbelievable. Other items in my order were cold and disgusting and the manager (who speaks no english) did not help whatsoever. Utterly useless establishment. On the bright side i went to In-n-Out a quarter mile down the road and had the best burger I have ever had."}
{"text":"An excellent, clean, convenient Carl's with super-friendly service and and super-fast drive thru.  Just watch out for those new Cod Fish Sandwiches - mine was so hot it nearly took the skin off of my gums! You gotta pay to play, I guess."}
{"text":"Shake machine is always working unlike most places. The burgers are good. Conveniently located."}
{"text":"I came to this location while waiting for some car repairs. Ordered a side of hash browns and got some work done on the computer. Customer service from the counter was superb, and the place was spotless. Very impressed."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken club sandwich. They put BBQ sauce on it, so I asked for a remake. Guess what, second one was exactly the same.  Either they're deaf, brain dead, or just plain worthless. First and last visit to this location."}
{"text":"Im going to attempt to keep this short and to the point because I really only have one issue with this place but it's worth noting so here I go. Do not, I repeat, do not go to this place after 8pm. To anyone who is reading this petty, what may seem like a typical review, please head my warning as i have been to this establishment many times during evening hours and it is absolutely atrocious. The food not only takes COUNTLESS minutes to prepare, there's never a %100 guarentee you're gonna get what you paid for.  The service I received is the only reason I decided to finally get on and yelp about this. I'm fucking done with this locations garbage.   Ex.1: I ordered my most favorite sandwich from this place, a double western bacon cheese burger only to return home and discover my onion rings were missing and their signature BBQ sauce was that of a generic paste. They used their sauce packet BBQ cause they were either out of their signature BBQ or the cook had a lack of knowledge. Ex.2: That wasn't even the worst part. I think what made it all worse was the time I spent WAITING for an order that was destined to be fucked up. There were 3 cars ahead of me when I ordered at the drive through at 11:50pm. By the time I finally reached the pickup window, it was already 12:18am not joking I'm trying to be as honest as possible cause people who exaggerate on Yelp are theworst.  Might I add that one of the cars actually left without picking up his food? Must've realized they were gonna take forever. I suppose I'm part of the problem though cause it's me that continues to revisit this place time and time again hoping for there to be some change cause it's no lie when I tel you I've been coming here for about a year now and it's always the same. There's only ever 2 employees working graveyard and it's treacherous. Moral of the story is DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION AFTER 7-8PM. It's just not good. You'll waste time, money, gas. For reals. Please listen to my complaint. I tried to keep it short but this place burned me for the last time. I had to get it all out. Thank you to whoever even had the slightest intent to read this. Please just get some more employees on the night shift"}
{"text":"Never again will I come back to this Carl's. It shouldn't take long for a biscuit sandwich and some hash browns to be ready. No specialties added to it or anything. When someone 6 people behind you orders something you know has to be made because they don't have any ready and they get their food first, you know they skipped your number. Sure enough, I walked over to see if my number was still on the screen and it wasn't. This location was very unorganized. One person should not have to do everything herself."}
{"text":"Stale buns, rubbery chicken fingers, old dried out onion rings, off tasting burgers, with sauce on top of the bun instead of on the burger."}
{"text":"Quality is less that. Prices are high. Employee look very unhappy and do not give very good costumer service.  Dining area very dirty and the store needs renovation."}
{"text":"All I can say is HORRIBLE. I am (was) a big fan of Carl's JR until recently. The staff is extremely rude and very disrespectful. I wrote a letter informing them of the problems I've had with this location...Only to get lame excuses from who I'm assuming is the District Manager.. Their speaker still doesn't work or the staff doesn't know how to use it.. WILL NEVER DINE IN ANOTHER CARL'S JR AGAIN... There is a McDonalds right across the street people...Better service and functioning equipment... Avoid the stress... it should not be this difficult to get fast food."}
{"text":"15 minutes in the drive thru at 9pm on a Thursday night.  That is way too long for a fast food meal."}
{"text":"Pretty sure they reheated an old burger for me. Bun was hard. The bottom bun had another bun partially stuck to burger patty. So many onions. Thrown together.  Garbage! No time to drive back for a 2.59 refund. Just never going there again."}
{"text":"This Carl's Jr. Was horrible! The cashier didn't even acknowledge that there were people in line! I know the drive through was a bit busy but at least she could have said \"one moment\" or something! Instead she ignores 3 families in line and then when she ran us up said \"what do you want?\"   Not the way I would hope to be treated at any place of service. Food was okay but it felt like they didn't want people in the restaurant to begin with and that they hated their jobs"}
{"text":"It's fast food, nothing extraordinary, but I love fast food.  I usually hit this location because it's close to the office, they have a good chicken salad and they give me a big glass of water at no charge.  But the last couple times I have been through, they were out of large salad bowls (offering two garden salads with a side of chicken for the same price - um, no thanks) and refused my water request.  Apparently now if you want a glass of water that is larger than a thimble, you have to pay full soda price.  I don't mind paying for the cup inventory but I'm not paying for something I can get from my tap.  And thanks for making me beg for the cup of water which had no ice in it and you didn't give me a straw to drink it with.  Too kind!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service!  Tried to go thru the drive thru at 6:30am on 10/21/2017. Lady was very unprofessional."}
{"text":"For sure the slowest drive thru in America... always making me later for work even tho i work right next door."}
{"text":"Only order the chicken club sandwich with fries, it's always good. It's messy so request extra napkins."}
{"text":"Not really big on fast food, but had to try the new Carl's Jr. in our neighborhood.  The signage could use some work...I think most people don't realize it is there and open.  The staff was friendly and the service was quick.  My food was to be expected for a fast food joint...low expectations, so you don't get disappointed.  If I am craving fast food, this will be the go to place since it is so close.  I imagine this place will be packed during sport events, concerts etc."}
{"text":"3 am in vegas and headed for the airport.... so grabbed the first thing I found open.  I should have shopped around.  Tried one of their 6 dollar burgers...meal came to a whopping $12!!!  Little taste for a barely warm bacon cheese burger... dry fries....I wont ever repeat... even Mc.D's would have been better, and I HATE Mc.D!"}
{"text":"Normally love Carl's, in particular their awesome grilled chicken sandwiches but this place messed up my order twice in a row and definitely could have had better customer service regarding the situation.  Would have given worse rating but other times I have been here have been up to expectations."}
{"text":"Worst place ever! I did not stop in fast food places in ages. Decided to use restroom after shopping & get quesadilla . Girl was cleaning floor then smashed her nose , cleaned with her pants, then decided to take order..... I asked her to wash her hands first. She said Oh yeah, & went to restroom . Later took my order, just one quesadilla .... I had to wait it for 11-12 minutes.... Really?  Fast food????? Easier to stop in restaurant ! Place is sooooo dirty! Trash over filled .... I thru away quesadilla but left just a coke to drink...... Yucky!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm being generous with the stars here, but the brownie a-la-mode is killer, plus it's a nice, clean joint (unlike some of the Carl's in the states), and the chicken sandwich is okay. I hate pop, so the refills are wasted on me (I just get water). I just like to stop in when I need something on the go, and I'm right there... and the price is right."}
{"text":"drive thru not quick. But the chicken strips they just started selling are amazing."}
{"text":"I love Carls over any other FF resturants in the the area. I like their $6 burger selection and Carls singles. The FF are good but wife like the cuts. Almost every time walking in the door we get a big holler, welcoming us to Carls if the people aren't helping someone. So, with the corners choice of Mc Donalds, sonic, jacks down the street, I choose Carls. Oh I looked at the other few reviews adn i would be upset at a sandwich that looked empty on one side but then I ask where is the other side. Probably not centered well. Oh and talk about little meat go to Subway. the italian sub is like ordering a vegie."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten all day, pulled in here starving when I saw they were open 24/7. Midnight crew is off the chain!!! I pulled up and asked for the Biggest, Baddest, Meanest Burger they had and they told me to go with the 1/2 lb Jalapeño Thick Burger and said I could make it a double so that it was 1lb! Next they recommend swapping the fries to Jalapeño poppers!   I don't usually eat fast food, in fact I usually try to avoid it, but these guys went all out and came to the rescue when I needed a good bite to eat."}
{"text":"Just got dinner tonight...drive thru cashier wasnt too friendly...kinda put me n a bad mood...she was polite at the window....i guess it washes out n the end!"}
{"text":"I love the staff. My food is always hot and delicious I recommend this locations. Famous stars are my favorite"}
{"text":"Their website is not accurate! Do not count on getting any food or beverage there after anytime their website says! They lie and are very disappointing, do not waste your time!!!! We looked up their website at 10:15 PM and it said it was open until 12 AM. We show up at 10:30 PM and they're not open! We went a mile out of our way, walking, and they were closed! Not happy!!! At least have accurate information on your website!"}
{"text":"I would suggest eating here if you plan on not eating for the rest of the day.  Everything that tastes great here is packed with calories, fat, carbohydrates, and the price is like a nice sit-down restaurant.  I got the Six Dollar Jalapeno Burger value meal with an extra patty and extra jalapenos. Holy sh*t, it is really good for a fast food burger. After you eat, you basically feel like a sumo wrestler walking out. WARNING, you may need to be rolled out pf thw restaurant after your meal."}
{"text":"I (shouldn't) love Carl's Jr. but after several consecutive trips with awful customer service I will never return here. The kid that always works the window at 2AM is such a prick that we decided to never go again during his shift. Think about that -- timing your arrival around an employees shift.   Just returned from a 6PM visit and the young woman working the window must have been his twin.   If I'm polite, beginning each sentence with a \"May\" and ending with a \"please\", how can you not feel like a prick interrupting me with \"What?\" for every instance you don't understand the words \"...with a large Coke\" or feel the pressing urge to quit your job -- and your only other words being the total of my order? How ya' doin' misery? Not good! These people act like I threw-up on the dining room floor. Dude! I'm in my car! Your required duration for not being a total piece of shit has been considerably lowered! It's straight up UNCOMFORTABLY AWKWARD for everyone in the car when their only words are \"what?\" and finally reading the total owed when they've determined you're done speaking. Then follow that up with complete contempt and silence handing me the bag and items at the window and you've got Carl's Jr. at 84 E. Germann Rd. in good ole' Gilbert, AZ.   Aren't you embarrassed?!?!?  Chapter review. The only words your Carl's Jr. employee can, or will say are either:  1) \"What?\" 2) A numerical value  If this is true, among the rest of the American lexicon, your Carl's Jr. employee shall NEVER utter any of the following words or phrases that are common among human-beings:  1) \"Hi\" 2) \"Hello\" 3) \"Hey\" 4) \"Sorry, could you repeat that?\"  If the previous exercise made sense, congratulations, you're a human being. Please read on or click out now. If the previous exercise did NOT make sense, please proceed to 84 E. Germann Rd. where there's a job waiting for you at Carl's Jr.  Do you not get along with people? Don't worry, somehow this is not a problem. There are no consequences in this bizarro universe. Come join our team!  I never thought I'd \"Yelp\" a fast food joint, but I could buy crack with less guff.  No matter whose shift you time your visit around - hello and welcome to fuck you.   Being an asshole to your customers -- the ones that are polite and don't start their order with \"I need...\" no less -- should be a big problem. Not here. There are no consequences at 84 E. Germann Rd. Welcome 2016 Camp Self-Entitled Manager-Kids!  You know what would be really funny? If I worked my ass off opening my own business, then exclusively hired people who do NOT want to be there. Hilarious. It's so absurd that it's funny.  Sorry about troubling you with my business, I realize now how rude of me that was.  The odd thing is, I know in my heart if the manager-kids working here got fired, they'd be completely unphased, maybe feeling somewhat relieved to not \"have to\" work here anymore  -- which begs the question: what moron interviewed these children and thought everything was on the 'up and up'?  I would challenge anyone that works the drive-thru at this location to declare that being fired wouldn't be \"fine\" or \"good!\" I challenge anyone that works at the drive-thru of this location to even consider that your behavior could be out of line. Just for a moment manager-kids, close your eyes and imagine there are people out there who are not you.  No qualms handing the keys of your business to people that DO NOT want to be there? Come run Carl's Jr. at 84 E. Germann Rd. Need a cool billion? Come run my mall in Swallow Valley.  This is my impression of any employee that works the drive-thru here:  \"What?\"  This is my impression of that kid during their interview:  Manager: \"Thanks for coming in, I really appreciate it.\" Dolt: *just stands up, purposely avoiding eye-contact, doesn't put chair back under table, walks out the door in a huff* Manager: \"I'm impressed!\"  I don't expect people working a drive-thru to be lovely, but you don't get to be nasty. Truthfully, the way the young woman treated me last night, if you had witnessed this you might have incorrectly, but reasonably assumed that we had a personal relationship that had soured. Problem? Not at 84 E. Germann Rd. Come run my mall!  Can a real-life adult that has a stake in this location tell me why anyone would willfully return after being treated with disdain? Economics 101 anybody? Manager-kids? Perhaps this is a front for money laundering. I really can't think of any other reason an owner wouldn't blow this up.  Be really nice to the manager kids working here, they've had such a stressful shift and didn't get nap time today.  Are you feeling impressionable? Head on over to 84 E. Germann Rd and hit the drive-thru at 6PM or 2AM -- FREE contempt -- so much so that you can't avoid wondering how, not if, they've tampered with your food.   Looking to feed more than just yourself? Gonna spend over $25 here? Oh boy do they have a special place in their shit hearts for you."}
{"text":"The staff is a bit dull, not very talkative or greeting.. but the food is always HOT. I live a mile down the road and can get home from walking there and have hot food.. never happens with other close fast food chains. The food is always fresh.. fries are decent for Carl's Jr... They need to be more lively though, the staff reminded me of an old folks home, it wouldn't kill them to smile. Like hey I worked fast food to, yeah the pay sucks, but you're working, with food, AND people so a smile and a \"Hello how are you?\" is great.. They almost sound like robots \"Wel-come t-o Carls - Jr, how - may - I - help- you?\"    but seriously the food is AMAZING, always on spot, always right, and super yummy."}
{"text":"Die kleine Carl's Jr Filiale im Flughafen kann man leider nur aus Mangel an Alternativen aufsuchen. Sie bietet nicht das volle Angebot anderer Filialen - dafür höhere Preise. Zusammenspiel zwischen Bestellannahme und Küche scheint nicht optimal zu laufen, was zu längeren Wartezeiten führt."}
{"text":"Service took a little too long but I do admit the food was all very fresh. Also first time trying their fried zucchini and I do approve. Waffle fries are always a must. Lady working the drive threw was very nice and friendly. If I'm in the area again I will return."}
{"text":"Pretty average fast food burger, not bad. Would have been better if it was hot, everything was kind of luke warm."}
{"text":"There was nobody running the drive through of this location at 1130pm on a Monday night. I stopped in and waited for about 5 minutes at the drive through. I was never greeted or served. Needless to say I was very disappointed to have wasted my time and gas driving to this location for nothing."}
{"text":"I moved next to this Carls Jr in August. I've been there enough to form an opinion now. At first there was this nice guy working the window. He was funny. One time he gave my dogs a treat that was cool. But I don't think he works there anymore. One time i went through the drive through. I order 2 guacamole bacon cheeseburgers. We got 2 3 way burgers. We were starving and called, to complain. The Manager said, I could go back in a few hours for the right burgers. I did, guess what? They gave me 2 more of the wrong burgers. Then I had to drive back again, for them to give me  the right burgers. Fast forward, a week ago. I  went to Panda Express for me, and Carls Jr for my son. I had the receipt in my car, so I knew what time I got there. There was 1 car in front of  me in line. Then 4 cars got behind me. There was no backing out. I was stuck there in line for 35 minutes. Apparently the girl at the window was too fucking lazy, to tell the customer to pull up to the front of the store. Then they had the nerve to charge me full price, even though I was pissed. Apparently the cook was having a melt down, and nobody else knew how to cook. So we were all at the mercy of when the cook felt like working again.  I called the Manager and she said shes was sorry. That the girl needs to be trained to tell people to pull up to the front. That the cook was suspended for 1 week. But I got no credit nothing, just the right to vent. I told my son, I wasn't going to eat there anymore. That I would rather drive to the one on Lake Mead Pkwy instead of put up with this. But today, he wanted to eat there. I just ordered for him. Luckily nobody in front of me in line. I pull up to the window, the guy working the window has so much dirt underneath his finger nails, you would think he was a mechanic for his full time job, and this was his part time job. Did he think I was blind, and I wouldn't see it. Totally fucking disguisting.Then I told the Manager because she handed up the drink. She said it was because he was just doing a job in the back. Come on, he is probably a Gardner or something. Either way it's totally unacceptable. I'm done. I'm going to another one. This place is just way gross, totally unprofessional."}
{"text":"This is the slowest Carl's Jr. i have encountered. As i am writing this i have waited in line 15 minutes! This is horrible, you can't stay in business when you're this slow. Hire more cooks or something please as a drive thru should be much faster versus 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Any fast food place can be hit or miss. I love the Charbroiled Santa Fe Chicken sandwiches. But I know to ask for an extra chile. If I didn't, I'd get a tiny chile strip which would cover 3 bites. Gotta know how to work the system."}
{"text":"I went here on 1/17/2018 at about 9pm, there was a young lady here who was so pleasant. She seemed to be the only one managing the drive thru and tje register. Her attitude was great and she was very sweet. I wish I could have gotten her name, she definitely deserves to be be recognized for her stellar customer service. Food was also fresh."}
{"text":"Typical fast food experience. Go through the drive thru, order food, receive half of the food you ordered correct, pay amt and leave dissatisfied. The highlight of the experience was the soda because I was craving carbonation and the Philly burger was okay. Not trying to go all in on the employees but if you are working in this line of work, selective listening isn't going to help you."}
{"text":"This place shouldn't even qualify as \"fast food\", at best it's \"mediocre food that's been sitting around for 3 hours but we will make you wait 20 minutes for it\". Thank goodness there's a Burger King down the street now."}
{"text":"Located just north of the Raising Cane's on Rainbow and Warm Springs, Carl's Jr. is pretty easy to find. Never been a huge Carl's / Hardees fan, but recently have discovered their chicken sandwiches.  (+) Chicken sandwiches are tasty! I have tried the Chicken Club and BBQ Chicken Sandwich in the past week and have enjoyed both.  (+) They have a 2 for $6 promo where you have a choice to mix or match any 2 of the following: Western Bacon Cheeseburger, Famous Star, BBQ Chicken Sandwich, and the                    Carl's Turkey Burger. Not a bad deal! Also the $4 deal with 2 sandwiches, small fries, and a drink all for $4!  (+) friendly employees, for the most part..  (-) as friendly as the employees are, sometimes service can be slow as molasses! Easily my biggest complaint here...and sometimes it happens when there is no signs of any customers around. (-) while some of the promos are good, the prices are a tad bit pricey if you want to try something not tied in to a promo. $5.69 for a chicken club from a fast food joint? Damn.   This place is alright. I like the way they do their chicken, so I will be back. If it isn't a part of a promo though, I really don't see myself trying other things on the menu. Just doesn't seem worth the price they charge for most things.  3 stars.  A-Ok."}
{"text":"this Carl's Jr is the best one I've been to friendly staff very welcoming food is always fresh and delicious and always clean even the bathrooms stay clean I usually come her every Saturday since moving to awhatukee it's become my go to place plus all my coworker ask me where to go I tell them Carl's Jr my favorite place so 5 stars from me"}
{"text":"Carls is one of my favorite places to get a burger, but the cleanliness of this place is what brought down the score. Tables dirty a long with the restroom."}
{"text":"It's an OK carl's,  but the Green Burrito component of the restaurant is pretty terrible.    They even got rid of the salsa bar - thought I guess I don't care really because Green Burrito has always been terrible \"mexican\" food.   Stick to burgers, Carl.  You're good at those!"}
{"text":"Its shocking to me to have read past unsatisfactory reviews about Carl's Jr. on Cotton Lane . I usually come Tuesdays and Thursdays for lunch or when I have my nieces and nephews. They have fast and friendly drive thru service. Love their $5 menu! My favorite combo is the #19 , you can't beat a cheese burger, chicken sandwich, cookie, frys, and drink for $5 ."}
{"text":"I love when Carl's Jr. Is open for breakfast but they don't have biscuits or food ready. If you open you should have your own products. Why not just stay closed."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Ordered a sausage & egg biscuit without cheese since i have a cheese allergy. Ordered a second plain biscuit for jelly after inquiring if they had jelly.    3 people behind me got their orders.  Mine finally arrived and i sat down.    No jelly.  Returned to counter and had to force them to provide jelly.  Sat down again and opened up the sausage egg biscuit.  Covered in nasty, greasy cheese.    Anothet trip to get them to replace it.    Very sloppy operation."}
{"text":"Will never go here again! Over cooked meat, sooo soggy bun (not exaggerating in the slightest) and the lady and the window....not very friendly. Shorted me on fries and no ketchup even after asking for some. They did give me a napkin, yes, one napkin. Very disappointed :("}
{"text":"Go here quite often on the weekends to catch up on my reading early in the morning. This place gets it. They have wi-fi, it's always clean and the employees are friendly and get your order right. I usually order the french toast which is excellent. Also, their large sodas are a buck plus tax. I wish the other fast food places would copy and paste the $1 Large Sodas to their menu. I sometimes stop by in the evening for a $1.49 oreo ice cream sandwich. It's not the greatest but gets the job done."}
{"text":"Someone needs to replace the American flag in front of this establishment. It is very dirty and tattered at the end."}
{"text":"I don't usually eat in at fast food joints, but this Carl's Jr's location actually impressed me enough to write a review. It was a mid-weekday around 11:30ish, and I needed a quick lunch before an appointment so I decided on a burger since this Carl's Jr was in the parking lot area. It wasn't busy inside, but I was still surprised to be quickly welcomed by the friendly workers. My Western meat patty tasted freshly made and juicy, and the fried onion rings and thin bacon inside the burger were nicely crisp and non-greasy. Even the bun was thicker and softer than I expected! I should've taken a photo, but I was hungry and didn't think about that until I ate almost all of it. My fries also came out hot and properly cooked so I can't complain about that either. I didn't need to use their restroom, but the dining tables, condiment/beverage section, and floor looked clean and well maintained. I'll certainly have to visit this Carl's Jr again to make sure it wasn't just a fluke! :D"}
{"text":"I had never been to a Carl jrs before, the buttermilk sandwich was really good. Fries etc aren't the best but meh burger was good!"}
{"text":"I know you're not supposed to expect a lot from a fast food place, but I have to point out the morning drive-thru girl I spoke to earlier this week (it was a Wednesday morning, about 8:30). A month ago, I left fifteen dollars with her to pay it forward to the next person in the drive-thru line, and she remembered me! She even remembered the people she gave the money to! She was so sweet and happy. Actually I don't think I've ever gotten a surly person at this location. Then again, I only stop in through the drive-thru, so I don't know what their inside service is like, but the people on the line are always so nice!"}
{"text":"I would give zero stars for this place! The fries at this Carl's Junior is disgusting that I wouldn't even feed them to the birds! I waited 10 minutes in the drive through for my freaking food and they still gave me stale ass fries! Never ever coming to this nasty place again! Stop hiring dumb teenagers that don't give a crap about the quality of your food! Yeah I know it's fast food but why can't it look and taste as good as the commercials make it seem to be?! Haha....just kidding. Thumbs down for this location!!!! Hmmmph!"}
{"text":"Seems like every time i come here lately, a side order of bad attitude that i didn't order, is served up!  Won't be coming back after the particularly snotty attitude I got from a Ms. Elizabeth tonight though. What a shame, the sweet potato fries were actually decent here..."}
{"text":"My favorite burger is the western bacon cheeseburger.  It only costs $1.99.  Love it!  I have to say, the customer service is  great here like it is at most Carl's Jr locations.  I love to see young kids that take their jobs seriously."}
{"text":"Dear franchise owner I would like you to be aware that your employees close this establishment 15 minuets early, 11:45. Missing out on a potential dinner rush as Macys warehouse down the street starts their break at 11:40. I have watched and been one of 5 cars that get turned away almost everyday at 11:45. I am only writing this because I prefer Carl's over jack in the box. And jack is getting all those turned away cars."}
{"text":"Yes I am a CJ's fan, have been since they brought out the Western Bacon Cheeseburger in the 80's! Out of the big five! mickey d's, jack in the crack, floppers, and Wendy's. CJ's is my favorite! They have always changed their menu, always add something new, right now I like their Memphis BBQ burger! Haven't tried their breakfast biscuits, but been told they are pretty good. Not a fan of their fries, other then that, it's your typical fast food chain. This location is new, nice to see that in this area! Service is good right now. Can change as time goes on, anyway! Nice to add this option in Surprise!!"}
{"text":"What an awesome morning crew !!! I stop by 2 times a week to grab my lil one a burger and fries on our way home from my late shift 6am and they crew is always so friendly and make my daughter's food special for her. Always so fresh and hot. I vowed to never eat @Carls again years ago because of the disgusting food at another location but I believe that will be changing as soon as I am done with my dieting :) Thanks for being so awesome !!!"}
{"text":"Wanted some fast food, did not care much about what I wanted, just one of these crazy urges that hits you once in awhile. I remembered a TV commercial I heard for Carl's Jr....the 4 for $4 special. I forgot what it exactly was, but I knew they would know what I was talking about. So, I drove in, parked my car, went in and ordered the 4 for $4 special.  What I got was:  A good sized order of fries; a medium soft drink; a double cheese burger and a spicy chicken sandwich.  A bunch of food for $4. The fries were good (hard to screw up fries), the double cheese burger was also good,  tasty condiments etc: the spicy chicken was also passable. All in all for the money, this was quite a deal if a load of fast food is what you are looking for.  A steady diet of this would probably not be good for your health, but once a month would be tolerable. Other places you get a single, jazzed up burger for $5-6, this is a better deal to be sure."}
{"text":"It's conveniently located right off the freeway, but surprisingly super empty at lunch time. Food came out quickly, was fresh, but tasted just OK. The restaurant smelled like methane or something like that. Odd."}
{"text":"Worst Carls JR i have been too. Besides them giving me wrong orders, waited a long time and the drive thru service was bad"}
{"text":"It's by far the worst experience at this Carl's Jr. location. I specifically ask a spicy chicken sandwich WITH Swiss cheese. I expect lettuce on mines and there was none . they only gave me cheese and the meat. And it's worst the chicken meat was dry! Awful"}
{"text":"New Carl's Jr. Clean, efficient, friendly service. Got extra French toast sticks, which was really nice. Gladly plan to return when I'm back on this side of town in the future."}
{"text":"Came in at 4:40 pm they only had 2 workers working. The store and drive thru were busy. The manager was on her phone the whole time. I waited 15 minutes before they finally took my order. I do not put the blame on the 2 workers one was making the food while the other was trying to balance the front counter and the drive thru, all the while the manager was on her phone. As a previous fast food manager myself, this was really poor customer service for the manager. She should have ended her call  and helped! 525 and still no help or insight!"}
{"text":"Dirty bathrooms, paper towel dispenser doesn't work (wonder how many employees are washing their hands), and both ice dispensers are broke. Food was mediocre at best, looks like they stepped on my burger before bringing it out to me. Probably won't be coming back to this Carl's Jr."}
{"text":"Several orders were wrong as other people said. After asking for two lettuce-wrapped low-carb burgers then getting them home only to find they were on buns, we had to call the franchisee office who owns this location and several others in the area. We explained we are doing low carb meals only. To make it better for us they offered two coupons to get our next burgers. Instead a coupon for 3 pieces of chicken tenders and a coupon for either a chicken sandwich or turkey burger showed up. Obviously, they didn't listen to a word we said.   On our next visit they were out of the 1/2lb burgers. Really? Out of burgers? We drove to the one on Yuma Road. The service was great. The people were friendly. Our burgers were wrapped better than we have ever seen on Watson and the burgers were 1/2lb. So, we called the franchisee again. They told us they decided to discontinue the 1/2lb burgers because they were not big sellers for them. Seriously? How do you discontinue the Thick Burger that is nationally advertised.?    We called the corporate office in Tennessee. They took some information and said franchisees can make their decisions about what to carry. They asked for a call back number in case we were disconnected since the person on the phone needed to talk to a manager to find out what could be done. After giving our number the person on the phone hung up and has not called back in the two weeks since then.  Our daughter went to the one on Watson Road while coming to our house a couple of days ago, ordered a couple of the low carb 1/2lb burgers and they were okay. So much for the plans to discontinue them. This Carl's Jr needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"Would be fine except when you sit down you get asked for money by the bums that come in off the street. I got asked twice in the same sitting. They walked right up to me while I was eating asking for money, not food."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru today, first time visiting in a while. I did not get any dipping sauce with my fried zucchini which was a major disappointment since I love them. So no sauce for my son's chicken tenders either, no salad dressing for my wife's salad (even after they asked me what kind I would like) and no napkins which I would think would be a standard procedure in the drive thru. Also when I removed the bun for my spicy chicken sandwich I noticed the lettuce was brown. When I was handed my bag of food the guy did not say a word. I thought I had more food coming. A guy finally popped his head out and just looked at me. Not a word until I asked him if I had everything. Very unfriendly help. I do have to say my spicy chicken sandwich was good other than the brown lettuce."}
{"text":"I really like this Carl's Jr for many reasons: It's  nice and open...the service is really good...very helpful and friendly employees...and the place is so clean. The temperature inside the restaurant was comfortable and enjoyable. Usually the fast food places I go to tend to be either freezing cold or rather stuffy and hot. Not this one, as it was just right."}
{"text":"Just isn't very good.  I hate to give a less then favorable review to any establishment.  So let's start off on a positive note.  Carl's Jr is a clean restaurant with friendly and helpful  staff.    Now for the not so good part.  I realize Carl's Jr is a fast food resturant so I don't expect a burger like that from the Actic. However, I do expect the food to be fresh and taste good.   Today, on my visit  to Carls Jr I had chicken fingers and zucunni. The chicken fingers were not seasoned and tasted as if it had been under a heat lamp for some time and that's why the chicken was so dry. The zucunni while it was fresh and served hot, the taste just wasn't good. The only enjoyable part of my lunch experience was my diet Dr pepper."}
{"text":"You always expect a little wait going through the drive-thru. You don't expect a 15 minute wait with one car in front of you. If you have all the time to hangout in the drive-thru this is the place to go. I have visited this place before and they are  slower than other places. I did ask to speak to manager or supervisor but of course one was not working. Who runs this place? I wasn't planning on giving a star but you have to give at least one."}
{"text":"I am going to copy a letter that was sent to Carl's Jr. corporate office of our experience at this Carl's Jr. I am also going to include their auto generated response that is comparable to a slap in the face. Our family will never visit this or any other Carl's Jr. establishment... To whom it may concern: It is with great concern I write you today with the story of our experience in one of your restaurants. My friend, my brother and I visited the Carls Jr. in the Lakes of Las Vegas NV on 4-27-18 at around 6pm. We all ordered our food for ourselves and paid under one ticket. My  brother who is disabled with Cerebral Palsey ordered a low carb burger with no cheese as he cannot digest wheat or dairy. We go to our table and wait, our food comes and my brother opens his food to find both a bun and cheese. He pointed it out and then scraped them off and ate the burger and veggies. Later when my brother got up to go to the restroom and the Manager asked him, how everything was. My brother is very shy and introverted so to my surprise he told her about the mix up on the order, to which her response was \"well you ate it all didn't you?\" Then she said \"what is it some kind of diet?\" He said No, Hes messed up and she said \"honey, we all are\". then she mumbled some other stuff. My brother proceeds to the restroom and she comes over and says \"is he okay in there, does someone need to do a wellness check?\" I told her he was fine and he just takes a little while.  The sole reason I write you this letter is because my brother got his feelings hurt. I am over here trying to encourage him to have a voice. to talk to people, to engage and your employee who represents your company both belittled and berated him. It is my opinion that your manager receives some constructive critiquing on etiquette and manners.  Thank you for your consideration  It took a lot of courage for our brother to speak about the mistake in his order. To be talked down to is unacceptable."}
{"text":"We stopped by this Carl's Jr. to get a cheap meal during a Sun's basketball game. If you don't want to pay for the arena food, this is a good way to go. While we were ordering though, we were helped by Drew. Not only did he have gauges in his ears, but was extremely rude. We asked for a 5 piece of the chicken stars and asked if there was a bigger size. He rolled his eyes and said no. Then when he read our order back to us, he said we order a 9 piece. I also specifically asked for a combo and he didn't ring it up. We ended up having to pay for 3 separate orders. The rest of the staff was friendly and helpful. It is a shame he would ruin our experience like that. Very unprofessional and rude."}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru ever. 730 on a Monday night. I do not get it. 14 minutes so far... so much for fast food."}
{"text":"Since I've been out of the hospital last November, I've been there twice and did not like how they served the sides.This location really deserves 1 1/2 stars for just the burger.  They basically ripped me off when I ordered Fried Zucchini with my burger every time.  The manager told me that corporate told them to give me 8 pieces for price of $2.59 when other locations have given me more for the price with a discount of $1.29.  I asked the other managers from other locations if it was true what the manager at this location that you are given only 8 pieces of Fried Zucchini, they said it isn't true that it must be one of the employees complaining about it which that is also true because I remember one of the girls who was rude and argued with me about it seem to control the manager's decision."}
{"text":"My group of business partners stopped by this Carl's Jr for breakfast. Somehow we ended up to order hamburger sets for breakfast.  They are a bit heavy for breakfast, but they tasted great. The meat was juicy, and the buns are soft and flavorful. My guest from Japan was impressed by the quality of the food, and he told me the food is worth the price.  The service person was friendly and kept asking if we need anything.  It was equivalent to the service we receive from regular restaurants.  It was a satisfactory breakfast that energized us to keep working til evening by skipping lunch.  Nearby Burger King offers only sweet carbonated drinks, but Carl's Jr serves unsweetened teas and other drinks. It was a plus."}
{"text":"Oh my god............... I think I had a heart attack and a obesity health threat within a bite. My first Carl's Jr and I think definitely my last. I can't bring myself to like food like this, because it's definitely NOT food. Processed everything, greasy buns, no fresh veggies? Something is definitely wrong! I got my boyfriend to go order some food while waiting for our flight and I wanted anything that wouldn't give me health concerns. I ended up getting the diablo, which was ok but too heavy on the obesity. The good thing about it is that the cheese is thick and fresh and the jalapeño spice is a nice change from other burgers. A combo is not too expensive- $11-13ish, but the burgers are the size of my face. I got the smallest burger and it's been over three hours and I'm still having trouble finishing. The beef patty is also hella big compared to other fast food burgers.   The lines are on and off; they can be suuuuuper long, depending if everyone is having same flights at the same time. Anyway, it was indeed a.. interesting last meal before I head back to Canada! Thanks for showing me the true american way of food, Carl's jr! Hopefully I'll never risk getting heart burn this quick again though."}
{"text":"Always have some issues with either ordering (because they can't understand me or I can't understand them) lucky to get correct order, but today was the worst ordered steak and egg burrito combo with coffee and steak an egg burrito with diet coke told me as usual would have total at window, got to window no total tried to give me a large and med soda told them it was supposed to be a large coffee didn't give me a real receipt just one with a total lady brought me bag of food said sorry having trouble with system today. Got to work opened bag had med French fry large hash brown a western bacon cheeseburger an some mystery looking burrito. Tried calling 3x keep getting fax machine doubt I'll come back to this location. Trying to give this a one star rating only because I have to but yelp has put it at 3 stars and I can't seem to fix it"}
{"text":"This location is in Canyon Lakes Plaza shared with Ashley Furniture and CVS pharmacy.  Came into today Wednesday March 29th at 5:03 PM.  Nobody greeted us when we walked in,  there was nobody around and no line.  Waited for the server and she took our order and didn't hand us our drinks.  It was taking a long time for the food I thought It'd be fresh!   I overheard the kitchen say he mistakenly put pickles on my boyfriend's famous star 3 different times.  We get home my boyfriend's burger was cold so he microwaved it 15 seconds. My food was not hot plus the fries were cold.  We used to live by the Warm Springs and Durango location, which is much better but it's 5 miles away. I guess I'll drive there instead!  ***Check your food before you leave!***"}
{"text":"Kind of old building... Had no expectations for this place to turn out the way it did. I've never been to a Carl JR'S either.   Nick was the only person working both Front & Drive Thru. He acknowledged us, said he'd be with us in a moment.   Which it was fine, I had no idea what I wanted. I was surprised he was the only person up front at 4 pm besides the one person in the kitchen.  He didn't mind that I had a custom order,  he was more than accommodating.  You can tell when someone genuinely cares about their job. He's making the best of it,  he stays busy.  After he dropped off the food, he started sweeping up. Really nice guy. He could work his way up to a manager someday.  Great work ethic.   Great first time experience."}
{"text":"This has to be my 2nd favorite location on Fort Apache.. The one on Tropicana is my \"Go To\" but yesterday I came they the drive thru because all I wanted was a simple order of the new Bacon Ranch Fries and all I can say is I'm sure glad I had a coupon to use because these fries were a flipping JOKE '__' they weren't even worth the $1.25 I paid for them I will attach a picture to show you how it looks like they half made these fries and threw them in the box and said here ya go.. The guy at the drive thru was nice but by the time I got home I woulda spent more on gas trying to return the fries than to chalk it up as a loss.. I'll stick to the Chili Cheese fries and burgers these fries won't be on the menu long I hope they cut this promo short!"}
{"text":"I visit Carl's Jr once every blue moon! This little chain burger joint is expensive AF. The only way I stop by is if I get coupons in the mail or something. This location is a little sketchy only because it's in the heart of \"THE STROLL\" Aside from that let's be honest, it isn't always a persons first choice to go to a fast food place that is attached to a gas station lol but when you are hungry you are hungry! The breakfast French toast sticks are amazing though! I came here the other morning to take them up on that buy one get one free offer for those. The gentleman working that morning was half asleep as I had to repeat my order twice and give him the coupon number through the intercom 3 times. Why was this already a process though? Sheesh let me just get my damn French toast sticks and be on my happy way. But no when you deal with people who don't have common sense it's never that easy to just \"be on your way\". Will I be back? Sure send me some more coupons :-) But until then 3 stars for the HALF attentive service...."}
{"text":"The New Buffalo Burger Is GROSS\" Stopped by here with the coupon that offeres you a free buffalo burge when you purchase a Medium/Large Buffalo Burger meal and when i tell you that it's the worst i've ever had from Carl's Jr that would be an understatement! I usually never have a bad experience but then again Never say Never right? Skip this new burger for SURE"}
{"text":"Carl's senior may have been on to something, but Carl's Jr. has messed up the family tradition. If anyone asks you if you'd like to go for a Hot Carl's, they probably don't mean this place, but either way, the answer is NO. Remember that.  This place is basically just Hardee's, but on the West Coast. It's not the worst fast food place ever, but it's an evil chain (like all other corporate chains) and so I don't suggest trying it. I came to this location in Phoenix, back in 2011 and it was just like all the others. It wasn't my idea to come.  I should mention, I only rate national and global chains on a scale of 1-2. I rate family businesses on a scale of 3-5. Here is why:  Would you rather support the local family, or the multi national corporations and the rich men on yachts in the Carribbean? Why are the parking lots of the awesome local places usually half empty (or completely empty)? Why are the fast food chains always so busy? Why can they afford to open so late and get all the TV advertising and all the prime intersection locations? Why are they taking over all the airports, stations, and rest stops? Why go and support McDonalds, Taco Bell, Burger King, KFC, Wendys, Cold Stone, Subway, and so on? These places have systematically and coldly taken over the national food scene by using the cheapest ingredients, pre-packaged frozen systematic meals that are identical across the nation, ridiculously cheap prices for the polystyrene food on dollar menus, overpricing for everything else, rude underpaid servers on way less than minimum wage, and a ridiculously expensive mass brand advertising campaign that gets inside the heads of all the kids and the 20somethings and keeps them under the illusion that if it's not a brand name, it's not worth visiting. They spend all the money they should be investing in food and service, in advertising and cornering the market - the local places can't compete - and someday all we will be left with is the same chains serving the same food all over the world. That is our future. It's the way we're heading and you know it. Every time you eat at a bland national chain, you buy into that, you support that. Boycott chains. Support your local eateries. It's an embarrassment that generic brand national chains are even listed on a proper foodie website like Yelp, let alone getting 4 and 5 stars from so called foodies. Wake up, America, before we're all just batteries in the matrix."}
{"text":"Left my lunch at home yesterday so I stopped in to Carl Jrs for lunch. The Grilled chicken sandwich I ordered had completely RAW bacon on it. Eating raw bacon can make you really sick. Had to go back to Carl Jr's to return the sandwich. I won't forget my lunch again. I will say the manager was very nice and apologetic, she refunded my money quickly and offered to make me a new sandwich. I chose to wait to eat until I could get home and fix my own meal."}
{"text":"Have grabbed a quick bite to eat hear many times as it's right around the corner from me.  Always quick and friendly. Sometimes when I have my dog in the car they even give her a treat."}
{"text":"Ordered through the drive-thru, it took 13 minutes to get my food. I don't consider this fast good on this night.  To speed up service you have to help out the team, it is a win win for everyone. To me it looked like two people in the kitchen trying to produce a lot of orders. I believe the people that were in the drive thru could of went back to help as well.  Thank For Seeing My comment, I Was A Little Concerned.  Because I love coming to this location alot."}
{"text":"This place is never too busy to take good care of you. Great service. Great food. Love to get their coupons and get discount on breakfast. Their biscuits are just like the ones in the south."}
{"text":"Carl's Jr is my favorite fast food place. The chicken Club is my favorite. The Famous Star is great when Ihave a yearning for red meat. HOWEVER...how can it be that they've been out of Diet Coke for four days now????!!!! You might as well be out of buns as far as I'm concerned. I am seriously considering finding another location or another chain. I got to wait in line for four others to get their orders when I was getting nothing since they didn't have my drink. The Coke/Pepsi thing is a deal breaker with me and I was glad CJ went the Coke route but this is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! Smells like sewer as soon as you walk in. The bathroom smells even worse. The soda fountain is dirty. Sylvia, who took our order seemed nice."}
{"text":"Not sure why I keep trying out this place. They consistently produce really bad burgers. No matter what location I go to the food is not good. They have little meat, too much sauce and do not taste good.There is too much sauce so that it makes the bun soggy. Blek! The staff don't know what to do if there is a problem either. I gotta remember not to go here."}
{"text":"If I could leave negative stars I would. Last 3 times order messed up. This time hair in the lettuce on my sandwich was also the wrong sandwich I ordered plus the sprite was just carbonated water no sprite syrup. Then was told to bring back food after I threw it away to get the $$ back with the receipt.so I had to get in my trash and pull it out. Never will go back there again. Unless I want to get sick. Stay away. This is not the 1st time I have felt with rude customer service at this location last time I order was wrong while eating on location not drive thru that time the nicely fixed it but then the lady rolled her eyes and proceeded to walk to the back talking about me. Corporate office should fire them all."}
{"text":"Does it still count as fast food if it take them 30 minutes to clear 3 cars through the drive-thru?"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, I would. My boyfriend and I ordered one of the specials they were offering. The price was great, but the food was horrible. We arrived close to midnight, and decided to order a couple of burgers, the burgers we so dry I could barely swallow and it was also very cold. The fries were decent, I was just glad they were hot. I will not be returning here seeing that it was late and we were the only car in line, I can imagine the quality of the food if they were busy."}
{"text":"Gave one star because I had to give something, don't let Bianca take your order because she doesn't know the menu. I had to take my food back 3 times before they got it right."}
{"text":"Beer battered cod fish seems really rubbery. It's not crispy at all and the batter is really thick. Bleh."}
{"text":"You would think that since this Carl's Jr. is next to a new In N Out Burger, that this place wouldn't stand a chance.  I thought so first at too, but let me tell you -- Carl's Jr's variety in their menu sets them apart .  Their chicken sandwiches are hard to contend against.  My all time favorite (because of taste and healthiness) is the Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich!  Only 510 Calories, 17g per sandwich.  Combined with the Light Minute Maid Lemonade it is an awesome and low calorie meal.   The shakes are also top notch!  Food is a 9/10.  Service is a 10/10.  Cleanliness is a 10/10.  This is going on the work lunch rotation list!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat while my daughter cheered at The Orleans. Ordered two western bacon cheeseburgers with zucchini. And I must say. This has got to be the worse Carl's I've ever been too. Not only was my food horrible but the service was bad. My zucchinis were still cold and hard. And the burgers were not cooked probably. I couldn't even finish my food comfortably without thinking I'd get food poisoning. Never again!"}
{"text":"I'm going to make this one short and sweet. Place was kind of clean. Better than most but not immaculate. The manager seemed inexperienced to be a general manager. Kind of kept staring at me and not talking. You think he would make suggestions. Anyway, after I ordered my friends burger and mine. It took a total of 12 minutes.  Bear in mind our ticket was the only one on the expo board....?? Fast food?? That's why we come here because it's fast not amazing.  Really discouraged because I waited there for a while and a cashier, shift leader and general manager all just stood there and stared at the one cook on. You think they would help her because clearly two burgers was a task. How are you a lead or a manager if you don't jump in when your employee is sinking on one ticket?! Red flag  NEVER GET THE TERIYAKI BURGER. This was the worst burger I have had since living here in Nevada. I even asked my boyfriend to try some and he said \"I don't even want to finish chewing it.\" This is a man who can put down mostly everything.   The burger didn't even taste cooked and was not that hot. The amount of mayo and Teriyaki sauce on it was disguising. Both sauces were like ice cold. My bread was actually soggy from it. One leaf of lettuce and 8 rings of onions. I feel like that isn't SPEC at all. From staff watching their own cooks sink, to the worst burger ever I will never be back here, yet to this company alone.  CHECKERS DOWN THE ROAD!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Carls in the USA.  Old, run down, and filty, never again."}
{"text":"Everytime I've stopped by here it's been extremely understaffed and very dirty. Looks like standards have gone down hill. 35 mins from the time I walked in till the time I got my food, the woman offered me a cookie because of the wait. I didn't accept when I walked in there was a tray of cookies scattered about on the counter."}
{"text":"Everyone at the restaurant was extremely freaky friendly. Very helpful. I ordered the nachos and they were the bomb"}
{"text":"HORIBLE burger.  Looked like it was cooked to death and dry as the desert.  Feed it to the dogs.  What a waste, 11 bucks for dog food.   NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO TO THIS STORE."}
{"text":"So I'm comparing this place to other burger joints and fast food. If it was just fast food I'd give this place a 4star. Probably the best fast food burger I've had. I got the Western bacon burger. It was so filling and tasty. The fries are below average but I went for the burger so didn't mind.  This burger was so good it actually is comparable to actual burger joints. Not close to the best in the city but up there.  If you love burgers you have to give Carl's Jr a try. Or if you are sick of the typical fast food joints this places is tops."}
{"text":"Not quite as good as the last visit. Did the drive thru this time and had  some issues with the squak box. \"Breaker, breaker one-nine, got a car full of hungry dudes. Do you copy? \"  We pulled up to the window to finish the order, but the face to face didn't help, as the order was a little messed up. All in all, it was just ok, but not bad enough to scare me away forever. Management said they would make good on the order mess up when we called to inform them of the shortage. Chalk it up to a bad day. We all have 'em."}
{"text":"The only reason this place has 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the price.   This place has the best burgers of all fast food places hands down. Not to mention amazing shakes, fries and onion rings as well. I don't know why it took so long for one to open in Calgary but we are blessed as a city.   The location is perfect too, located right on 16th pretty accessible by most."}
{"text":"Filthy.  Soap dispenser in the restroom completely broken and other dispenser empty.  I had to wonder how the employees washed their hands."}
{"text":"Had to leave my burger behind (if it was ever finished being made), just now, because I had to be back at work and this crew was taking FOREVER. It should not take any fast food restaurant more than 5 minutes to make one single cheeseburger.   It took them 8+ minutes. I couldn't take it. You may have my $2.70 AND my burger, now, but don't worry, I will never sink another dime into this crummy location, again. 2 stars because I've had one really good lunch here a couple weeks ago - no such luck since, though.  Go somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"I came here wanting the new jalapeño double cheeseburger but for the second time they didn't make it right,first time they didn't put any cheese and I asked for no sauce and it was filled with sauce  and now again they fucked it up they put cheese this time but the wrong cheese it's supposed to be with pepper jack and I yet to get it right never going here again"}
{"text":"Waited over 10 minutes to order, staff is all confused and chaotic! Manager needs to retrain or restaff immediately!"}
{"text":"Located in a slightly outdated strip mall, but not bad at all. Typical fast food and as good as any other in the neighborhood. The outstanding \"Star\" at this location today was Krista the shift manager. She actually went around and asked how everything was and even bussed tables and took your trash if you are all done. It's a great feeling and a sight to behold when someone cares about their job and the quality of their work. It was \"my pleasure\" to have dined here today. *****"}
{"text":"Carl's Jr is Carl's Jr;  we all know the menu and the quality tends to be consistent (pretty good fast food burgers and I'm lovin' that fried zucchini with ranch dip), so I normally wouldn't bother even reviewing one because there are no surprises, but I got one the other night: BF and I were leaving the Stratosphere around 2 a.m. and decided to pull in for a cool drink. I just wanted a soda, he a had a chocolate shake in mind. I warned him not to get his hopes up- ALL fast food franchises are ALWAYS cleaning the shake machine after midnight, and sure enough, when we pulled up to the speaker and he asked if they still had shakes, The Voice (older female) said \"I don't think so, let me check\" and then, the inevitable \"No, the machine is down\"... but, WAIT FOR IT: \"I will make you one, though\". Wha wha wha WHAT?? My neck is still sore from the way my head snapped around. We drove around, thinking Ashton Kutcher would be at the window, laughing and pointing at our gullibility, but no, it was just this really nice lady, with a freshly made milkshake in her hand and a pleasant smile on her face. God love you, Carl's Jr Lady! These stars are for you!"}
{"text":"Arizona Burger Tour: Carl's Jr:  Judging Criteria:  First appearance: Smushed under an oversized and slightly stale bun. Only a hint of the charbroiled burger is shown. The condiments are more prevalent.   Flavor:  Holy Mayo and Lettuce Batman. So. Much. Lettuce. After the earthy, leafy, flavor dissipates I'm left with more condiments. It's like 3 parts mayo to one part ketchup. Finally, at the end, I get the smokey, beefy flavor of the patty. What I do taste is slightly burnt but not terrible.   Meat to bun ratio: Terribly off. So much bun and other stuff compared to the meat. I was left with a third of my bun left.   Included extras (veggies / condiments): Lettuce, tomato, onion, dill pickles, mayo, ketchup  Price: $3.99  Follow the tour on Instagram at @requiemofchaos.  Grade: C = It's ok. Burger might be a little overdone, but still tastes well enough. If you're hungry, it'll do. Might not be worth the price."}
{"text":"Gotta love Carl's Jr for when you are trying to get the kids and yourself fed in a hurry. Always good...not amazing...and consistent. Their double western bacon cheeseburger totally hit the spot today.   This location is new, clean and the employees are super nice. Overall a good experience :)"}
{"text":"Seriously, This Carl's Jr, if I'm writing a review about your franchise fast food establishment then you're doing something drastically wrong. Unfortunately, I can only explain the symptoms not the causes of your problems.   The worst thing about the C'sJ is the driver thru service. As others have mentioned, it's slow. And not like, \"oh this place is so busy that I'll have to wait.\" Rather, it's a \"One car ahead of me? Three? Four? It doesn't matter -- I'd better clear out 14 minutes to get my order.\" I'd twice waited so long at this drive thru that, after the car in front of me pulled out, I just continued past the window.   Well, before Sunday, that is, when I [foolishly] tried to make a 'quick' visit to their drive thru. There was one vehicle pulling away from the speaker when I rolled up. I promptly gave my order, pulled forward, then waited....waited...waited...watched the vehicle receive it's order -- A SINGLE BAG AND TWO DRINKS -- and pull away. I checked my clock, saw that I had spent 14 minutes trapped in their drive thru, and just drove off. Who knew how long they would have needed to actually complete my order -- that could have easily been a 30 minute drive thru trip! I don't what the line of cars now waiting behind me did but I'm sure any guess is accurate.   Does this location not staff? Is the staff not trained? Does the staff not care? Does it not have equipment? Is the equipment not functional? Does the equipment not care?  Honestly, I don't know, but it's pretty amazing that this location -- which I see does a lot of business in a premium location -- hasn't thought it might be worthwhile to operate efficiently. For me, I'll probably just call it quits on Carl's Jr because this one just isn't worth the hassle.   Thanks, This Carl's Jr, now I'm a guy who Yelps about fast food."}
{"text":"The sign outside says open until 1:45am (now is 12:39am) and they are closed! BOO! All the lights were off, not a person insight. Not sign stating any explanation as to why they are closed!"}
{"text":"This customer service is really bad and the food is just as crappy!! Stay away! I have gone there a couple of times and they just don't seem to get the order correct. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Very hit or miss location.  I guess it just depends if they have a new hire working that day.  More than half the time the burger is sloppy and lacking toppings."}
{"text":"Last two times I've been here they messed up my order. I've tried to call them to express my concerns but they haven't pick up my call once in a week.  Terrible service, won't be seeing my business any time soon."}
{"text":"Still no coffee available if you go through the drive through, AFTER 5 am. Really. These lames will get none of my biz. No coffee ready ??  Lame.  Theres a Rebel Gas Station, and a Del Taco a few blocks west on Charleston - theres always good coffee,  for those that care."}
{"text":"For those who know me I detest burger joints.  I have a scale by which I rate restaurants. Burger joints are at the 1 start end. Most unhealthy as you can get. Watch out for corn feed beef!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my Southwest Chicken Sandwich but at first I thought they forgot the green chile.  I opened it up and there was just a tiny piece :/  I enjoyed my sandwich but I would of loved it if it had a descent amount of green chile!"}
{"text":"Very clean store, fast service, super friendly and professional staff. My food was perfect and very fresh!! Also, I went in for dinner earlier last weekend and there was a VERY RUDE AND DEMEANING Customer that was hollering orders at the cashier from the back of the store. The staff did an incredible job of being courteous and handled the customer professionally then getting whatever the customer and his family needed. This was during a VERY BUSY time by the way. Also, there were some really bratty teens that watched a worker drop the food she was delivering on the floor because the brats were in the girls way. Not only did they not help her, I think they laughed. The waitress was very professional, cleaned up the mess, and got the customer what they needed. It's been a really long time since I've seen such disrespectful and unpleasant customers in my life in the same building with the most respectful, professional, and prompt workers. Thank you Checkers, keep up the awesome work!!!"}
{"text":"They have really good food and a large selection and variety. It is regular fast food though if you get a burrito they are pretty authenic a little too moist but flavorful.  A little higher in the pricing than other similar fast food but they do is better products. I'd definitely prefer over other fast food if they are closer."}
{"text":"Best Carl's Jr. I've been too. Try the 4 for $4 deal. Fries, soda, spicy chicken sandwich and hamburger. Great service!"}
{"text":"I had the 4 for $4 deal. Fries were ok but the chicken sandwich and cheeseburger were rubbery. I was the only one in there. Poor owner."}
{"text":"Great food, good service. Bacon ranch fries! Best friendly service I've had in vegas yet! Thanks to marlene E & her crew!"}
{"text":"What can I say....I love Carl's Juniors low carb burgers.  A more healthy fast food option minus the bread.  I normally stop here on the way home from work and this restaurant is always fast and efficient.  It's kinda hard to mess up a low carb sandwich....just don't add the bum lol.  Tonight  eating inside the restaurant and it's clean inside and they have some good music playing.  One of the employees did stop by to ask if everything is ok.  I barked out with a mouth full of burger....Of course it is.  I would have been more upset it she had messed up my rhythm of chews that I have down to a science when eating low carb.  Definetly check it out for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I stood in line here when it first opened to get a years worth of free food! Carl's Jr.'s is always been my favorite it was number one in my childhood never McDonald's. Same old same every time Western bacon cheeseburger fried zucchini chocolate chip cookie, best lunch ever!! The people at this location have always been very nice anytime I come through."}
{"text":"Honestly, as far as fast food burgers go, this is pretty good. A bit more pricey than the golden arches, but the food tastes better. Service is reasonably fast and friendly and they will add or subtract whatever toppings you ask for when you order your burger."}
{"text":"I know I shouldn't expect much when it comes to fast food, but at the very least, if you're going to qualify yourself as a fast food restaurant, I should expect to receive my food...fast.   On multiple occasions, I've visited this specific Carl's Jr, and the experience has always been the same; slow. Not just slow, but painfully slow; slower than a snail racing a turtle through a track made of peanut butter and molasses. I can understand if you have a drive-thru line like In-N-Out with 15+ cars snaked around the premises, but I've sometimes been the only car in the drive-thru and have STILL had to wait for what feels like an eternity.   If my order was at least correct more than 50% of the time, then I wouldn't really have as much to complain about, but after waiting eons for my order just to have it be incorrect, I find that highly disappointing.  Be warned if you're deciding to eat at this specific location."}
{"text":"Hot food, clean restaurant, friendly staff! Definitely a must if you are on the Surprise Area! Anyone who's ever visited the restaurant knows that the restrooms on the photos posted on the other reviews are not from this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Carl's Jr. location. Do not waste your time, speaking of time, we spent 15+ minutes in the drive through waiting for our \"fast\" food to be done. We watched the staff run around aimlessly for this entire period. The food wasn't good. They got my boyfriends order wrong, we ordered a plain sandwich and it came with all the fixings and when biting into the chicken tenders it had the mouth feel of raw chicken. On top of that we weren't given a bag for our food, he handed us the two boxes out in the open and then handed us our sauce. Also we ordered HI-C juice which we were told in the drive thru they had, only for them to tell us they don't have it at the window. The only redeeming quality about this location is the cookies. So thanks for the waste of time, money, and halfway decent cookie! We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Average fast food at best.  But what can you expect from fast-food.  Prices and deals are great.  I favor the breakfast vs lunch or dinner.  Service is fast and correct which means a lot"}
{"text":"Excellent combo prices in their breakfast biscuits are extremely tasty 2 egg and cheese breakfast biscuits for 3.00 you can't beat that price for that deal and they taste really good strawberry jam to it and you've got a good start to your day a lot of calories but it's a good start"}
{"text":"I just visited this place. It was great! Great tasting food and Olivia the server made it very enjoyable! She made it feel like I was at a friends house instead of a restaraunt. I would recomend this location out of any in Las Vegas simply because of Olivia! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Literally the BEST Carl's Jr. I've ever been to. It's so good, it compelled me to leave a review lol.   The customer service from the cashier was extremely on point, she was super nice and a fast worker.   Food was made fresh and it was well prepared. Good job!"}
{"text":"Carl's Jr.....Good place for burgers.  I always enjoy their guacamole burger which is grubtastic!  ;)  This location is also pretty quick about serving their food especially when your on your lunch break which is an advantage over other locations I've been to.  Place is neat, clean, and staff are friendly.  :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this location one time, today. It took 20 minutes to get my lettuce wrapped burger. They were out of lids for my salad, so they offered me fried zucchini. They were out of napkins. Napkins! I had to ask for a fork for my salad. I hope they were just having a bad day."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, but stars down for quality of the food. The first time I ordered the Western with sweet potato fries, the fries were soggy. The second time I ordered the Western with sweet potato fries, the fries were cold. Never again Carl's Jr., never again."}
{"text":"This CJ, is a little different, and I would have given 1 star, because of the fact, we ordered 2 burgers, 1 was a famous star with cheese, and the other was a super star no cheese and xtra onions.  Ok, how hard was that?  Not that hard right?  So The famous star had no cheese and the super star had cheese.  So they had to take them back to remake them.  So while we were waiting, our fries were getting cold, we had to take that back, then by the time we took those back, the burgers came! Really?  So we just went ahead and ate the burger, then just ate the fries, when they came later.   But what I do like about this, they have someone going around to the tables, like your in a restaraunt, asking if everything was ok, if there is anything we need?  Then not only that, the manager was going around to the tables, and asked again?  I had to double check to make sure we were at Carl's Jr. That was a nice touch for a fast food place."}
{"text":"This Carls Jr says open 24 hrs but whenever I got late at night it's ALWAYS closed WTH! Long waits in the day time hours."}
{"text":"Slowest drive through ever! Had one customer hold the line up for over 30mns. With no apologies from the manager."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. This is the worst service and slowest fast food restaurant around. We waited in the drive thru for 30 minutes and there was 1 car in front of us. No apology. Nothing. This isn't the first time this has happened. Every time we come here the wait is insane. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for burger and drinks.  All I asked special was \"little ice\" in my drink.   This is what they gave me... 80% ice!!  10 miles or so down the road it's too late to turn around and complain and get them to do over.  Am tired of paying good money for frozen water.  They need to give us a full measure of drinks and STOP RIPPING US OFF!!!"}
{"text":"All I an say is Cod, Cod, Cod. Go on line collect a $1.00 off coupon and head on over. Lunch a  little over $6,00.  Plus some cookies for another dollar and you hit the grand slam with table  service. Can you tell I'm not really a fast food person. What a bargain, baby..."}
{"text":"Drive thru pics look good. Food was another thing. Stick with 5 guys plain but consistent. One good thing the staff were super nice in drive thru"}
{"text":"Food was same as usual, dining room seemed clean, young guy who took my order was polite... But whatever you do DON'T USE THE RESTROOMS!!  The smell was so horrible it reminded me of the way public bathrooms in parks or beaches smell. If I didn't have to go so bad I would've just walked right out! The toilet bowl was dirty, and the sink was so DISGUSTING I don't know how you were supposed to get your hands clean in it. Who is the manager? How can they let this go on, because this was the kind of dirty that doesn't just happen over night!"}
{"text":"Spent over $39.00 tonight and received cold fries and  burnt to a crisp onion rings!!! Please do not stop at this location all I received was an I'm sorry from management and a better luck next time."}
{"text":"Have to say Carls Jr has one of the best teriyaki burgers for a fast food place! Keeps me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"The Beer Bacon Cheeseburger is the biggest abomination of a hamburger that I have ever eaten! It tastes like beef patties drowned in a nacho cheese SAUCE. I could barely discern the flavor of the vegies,bun or ketchup or mayo. It was so rich and greasy that I felt sick after eating it. I'd like to mention that virtually ever one of specialty burgers have been incredibly delicious and well conceived. Nobody's perfect. The drive through service was quick and courteous as usual."}
{"text":"We arrived at this Carl's JR shortly before 8am. Stephanie struggled with taking our order but was friendly. She over charged us, but did not know how to correct it. She asked for assistance, after about 5-7 minutes Edgar came to the front. He said 'what do you need' when knowing full well what the issue was as Stephanie had already told him. He was very rude at that point my husband said just give us our money back. He said he was very busy in the back, so I asked if his customers were important. He told me to stop yelling at him! Btw we were the only people inside and while waiting for Edgar one car pulled into the drive thru! No wonder this place is so slow! From reading other reviews I see there is no point in contacting corporate as the just don't care. I would give them a negative 100 if that option was provided!"}
{"text":"All about that grilled cod sandwich!!  Nice alternative to all the battered fried fish sandwiches available from the vast majority of fast food spots.  Fish sandwich is good and sauce is light, perfect for a quick lunch meal between classes.  Dining space in this Carl's is huge but I never really utilize it.. more of a grab and go kind of guy.  Fast service and nice attitude, can't really complain."}
{"text":"The worst Carl's Jr. I've ever been to, not only did they fuck up my entire order they even screwed up my sprite it is literally Club soda.. I asked for meal #3 with onion rings and drive thru lady gave me order #1 with a disgusting hot dog and no oinion rings how do you misplace the two.. I recommend strongly to double check all your orders before leaving the drive thru here so u don't waste your money"}
{"text":"The dining room has a smell that can only compare to a construction site portable outhouse. The lack of skill required to work at this fine establishment is amazing. The cook can not figure out sausage should be a part of a breakfast sandwich that has sausage on it. The cashier was what I believe to be a supervisor or manager, who was surprisingly slow, and could barely function. The other employee, was very angry at herself, I believe she even head butted the wall. I would steer clear of, if at all possible, unless you like torment and anguish.  I would most likely never return to this location, the last time I was there they had washed out the restroom, men's room I believe due to what I could only imagine is an explosion of diarrhea. When they sprayed out the restroom, which flowed into the dining area. The smell was foul and caused several guests beyond myself to vacate the dining area. This was of utter disgust."}
{"text":"Make sure to count your change!!   Drove to this location getting 2 western bacon burgers and an order of onion rings which came out to 10.67. Gave a 20.00 and got the change. I had a sneaky suspicion about something and rather than putting my money in my wallet I decided to count it. I only got 8.33 instead of 9.33!! I question the dood that gave me the money and he gave me the one dollar saying \"I was thinking that I shorted you\" and I said \"shame on you\"   Fucktard could have done this to the 3 cars in front of me and they would have never known. All that for just one dollar? Really??   The food was good and I'll come back again but the workers y agotta keep an eye on em.......  Feh.....  Oh by the way .... If Carls Jr is really checking Yelp the info on the receipt says Register 6 order #5147 4/2/2012 5:49:56 pm  Carls Jr 8055 7598 Vegas Dr 702 228 2114   and a big FUCK YOU VERY MUCH !!  Fuckin hate Hate HATE dishonest people...  Rant over....."}
{"text":"My family and I went in side to eat lunch and encountered Shane. Big tough guy, no hello, no smile (angry face) not even a pleasant expression, no kind words at all. I ordered a classic burger with only one patty for my 3 yr old grandson. Shane took it upon himself to order a different burger instead of what I ordered. When he repeated our order I caught the error and called him on it. Shane proceeded to argue with me because he didn't want to do his job and call it back to the cooks. I had to tell him several time to put in the classic burger the way we always orderd it at this Carl's Jr. Shane kept arguing with me while I have a hungry small child and finally I made him put it in. No thank you, No customers service, No common manners. Rude!  Then another man walks in and starts staring down and mouthing off with an hispanic man. It gets louder and louder with fighting words. Every time the Hispanic man starts to leave the other mans starts again with his ignorant mouthing off. The Hispanic man left and Shane walked over and starts talking with him being all macho agreeing with this mans fighting behavior. Then the Hispanic man comes back in... No one calls the police. Shane stands there all puffed up and after another few rounds of fighting words Shane finally says he will call the police. No management! I will never eat there again. Needs a Manager (baby sitter) at this Carl's when ever Shane is on the job. I don't write reviews and I had to give one star to warn everyone. Don't bring your children here it's not safe."}
{"text":"Time is not a priority for this team! I've been here two times and each time they were extremely slow. Make sure you eat before you go to this one, by the time you get your food, you'll be hungry again. Oh! And a full of gas is important if you plan on going they the drive thru, you'll be there a while."}
{"text":"It first started out as a great restaurant. I stopped going due to the inconsistency of the food it seems to be extremely dry. And on a personal note. I don't like employees speaking non-English where the customers can hear them."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast to-go on our way out of town. We got two sausage and egg biscuits, one big country burrito and a large hash brown. Their biscuits are the best! They were golden brown, crispy on the outside and flakey on the inside and so buttery!! Sausage was a little salty. My husband loved the big country burrito. The gravy with the meats and eggs was so good. The hash browns were crispy and good!! We always love Carl's Jr. Breakfast but this location had the best we have had by far!"}
{"text":"I like Carls Jr, I do not like this Carls Jr.  It seems everyone that works here is related, and they all could care less about quality of food or service, they show up for a paycheck. I have been here 3 times, and will not be returning.  I tried there red hot burger today, it was a soggy soggy mess served upside down on a burned bun.  In the past at this Carls Jr I have been served the wrong burger.  So, I tried to contact corporate via email, and it appears I have to send them a letter.  CORPORATE OFFICE   Carl's Jr. Restaurants LLC   6307 Carpinteria Ave., Suite A   Carpinteria, CA 93013  ill update my review when/if they get back to me."}
{"text":"I admit. I did it. I couldn't resist.  I just had to try the \"All American Burger\".... the ultimate junk food. Hamburger, Hot dog and fries on a bun.... and it was REALLY good!  I RARELY eat fast food and was snagged by the commercial and was driving by one day particularly hunger and ended up with that and and oreo cookie shake.  The bad news... the burger itself was over a thousand calories.  The good news... fast food is usually so crappy I can't keep it down but I chowed that baby like no-ones business and was fine.  (although with that many calories I kind of wish I had tossed my cookies!)  So yes, while I'm not a connoisseur of fast food - this one I liked!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give it ZERO stars! The staff on Saturday nights is worthless! They told me to wait a moment I said ok.... 20 minutes later still nothing! They literally just waited for me to get mad and leave! lazy staff needs to be replaced"}
{"text":"This is not a food review. Carl's Jr. is Carl's Jr. no matter where you are and you either like it or you don't. I do. What I disliked on today's visit was my being made to feel as though I was attempting to execute a fraud as a result of the cashier's ignorance and marginal rudeness. I paid for my $5.68 order with a somewhat older (1998 vintage) twenty dollar bill. When she saw it you'd have thought that I was trying to pass either Confederate currency or something which I'd manufactured myself. Saying nothing to me she pretended suddenly that I wasn't there, placed the bill I had given her off to the side and fetched a drink for a drive thru customer totally dismissing the fact that she had rung up my order in anticipation of payment. Afterwards, and still saying nothing to me she began puttering around with the bill in her hand and at one point seemed as though she was in deep conference with another employee albeit out of my field of vision. Having been blown off so that the drive thru customer could be attended to while I waited and then not being offered anything by way of an explanation as to the delay I finally asked what the problem was-I had my suspicions but couldn't believe this was being handled in such a gauche and unprofessional manner. She mumbled something and took the bill into the back presumably for a second higher level conference. When she returned more than a minute later she still said nothing though it was apparent that she would acquiesce and accept the bill. Saying to her in a pleasantly sarcastic tone \"Are you convinced now that I didn't counterfeit the bill...?\" she says to me \"I never said YOU counterfeited it\" (!?!?). At that point I could only conclude that she suspected me of possibly passing a counterfeit bill irrespective of its origins. She did however volunteer that they \"have to inspect ALL bills\". All what bills? Every bill each cashier in this store is handed has to be inspected? I checked to see if I was wearing a sign reading \"Ellis Island\" or something akin to it.. It was at this juncture that I realized this kid was/is chief engineer on the B.S. express.   I can well understand the necessity for wariness and vigilance when money is exchanged in retail transactions. As a past cashier I can recall a rather careless error I made which taught me a $100 lesson. Likewise, I presume there was nothing personal intended by any of this. Nonetheless the lack of professionalism and just plain bad manners displayed are I feel primarily attributable to ignorance and questionable upbringing. Presuming that the majority of fast food workers are neither PHD material nor Mensa candidates their overall ignorance doesn't obviate the necessity for good people and P.R. skills and again, good manners. The cashier could have smiled pleasantly and asked me to wait for just a moment while she brought the bill into the back. She might also have had the requisite degree of education or training which would have prevented her from having been so thoroughly confounded by a different looking though perfectly legitimate example of legal tender. Rhetorically speaking if I WAS attempting a fraud would I have been so stupid as to pass an obviously different looking bill?  Perhaps I'm turning a mole hill into a mountain but I nevertheless found the entire episode rather off putting and irritating. I fault the store's management for hiring employees who have little to no knowledge of anything prior to say Twitter or Lady Gaga, and the cashier herself for her clearly anemic one on one skills such as they are. P.S. Carl's, why don't you issue a revised memo to cease the mandatory though totally insincere \"my pleasure\" nonsense which is inherent to all transactions? It is a thoroughly unconvincing affectation. Adults seldom speak that way; do you think we'll buy that crap when some kid who won't even look you in the eye mumbles it? Have you so little faith in your employees that you don't feel them capable of saying something like \"have a nice day\" without making it company policy?"}
{"text":"I am mad that Carl's Jr. now offers the breakfast burger 24 hours a day.  As hard as I tried to resist my favorite breakfast sandwich, the Carl's sign called for me.  Pretty much all Carl's taste the same.  The nice thing about this place is that it is new.  The reason I am giving this place 5 stars is because the staff was very nice.  They messed up my order, but Nellie went out of her way to make things correct.  I will be back because I can't resist a great breakfast burger and great service."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Took at least 20 minutes to get my food when there was only one car in front of me. The girl at the drive through wasn't very friendly.  The food was ok. Well at least the burger was good. My friend got two beef tacos and she said they were gross. Jack in the box has better tacos for a better price. They weren't with the $1.50.  Probably won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I understand that being inside an airport, prices are inflated for the convenience, but you should at least get food with similar quality you'd get from the other locations.  The Famous Star burger I received from these guys was a joke!  It's like they just nuked the whole burger including the veggies. So what I unwrapped was this dry overcooked patty dripping with warm mayo and ketchup with soggy wet veggies.  C'mon, now!  For the record, I have been here before and ordered a Breakfast Burger and that one turned out okay.  Apparently they don't know how properly stack veggies in their burgers here, so if you do decide to come here, stick to ordering any sandwich that doesn't have veggies, and you''ll be okay."}
{"text":"Out of all of the fast food joints Carl's is tie for 1st. Gotta appreciate the military discount!"}
{"text":"I bought lunch for my employees, They wanted to try this place. I placed the order over the phone. Upon arrival the staff was very polite and the service was awesome. They food was nice and hot the burgers looked like magazine burgers! and the employees went out of their way to make the lunches amazing! The sides we ordered were nice and crisy and they provided condiments for all bags! Best service we have had in a long time! Wonderful service excellent job!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Slow service and ghetto! Some guy had ordered already and he still didn't have his order after 30 min! I waited in line for 10 min and the line did not move! Never coming here..."}
{"text":"Better experiences and better tasting food allowed me to give this location four stars. I stayed away from this place for quite a while but then found that Double Western Bacon Cheeseburger calling my name yet once again. Very friendly staff and warm, tasty food - the way life should be!  Side note: don't forget the crisscut fries for the best experience!"}
{"text":"Good food! Friendly service! But Good food! Good service, but slow! Philly burger was awesome! Hubby loved the jalapeño burger. Fries were fresh! Not bad for fast food! But must work on making it faster!"}
{"text":"Let start by the fact it smelled like rotten eggs. That's one. The people worked didn't even try to make things fast when there was 10+ people in the line. The lady in the front was messing up orders left and right. Bad service overall ."}
{"text":"I've never had to wait 30 minutes in a drive through line before i could even order lmao. There was only like 4 people ahead of me too. Never expect anything fast. not even a apology for taking long, just rude service when you get to the front"}
{"text":"Order a burger and asked for no sauce they bring it out with sauce I told them no sauce she brings it out with just meat and cheese I paid for a bacon western burger that was 11 dollars not a plain cheap ass cheeseburger they need to get there shit together here!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow I've never experienced such great service from a fast food place. Maria and another woman helped me out today and they were so helpful and sweet!!!! Usually fast food workers have bad attitudes and never care to actually be nice. But they should get a raise cause customer service like that is rare. & my food was good too! :)"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've eaten at this location.  Was in the area for a quick lunch and decided to get:  Western Bacon Cheeseburger, $3.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/carls-jr-7628-scottsdale?select=1RONucdG2fUzaUSkPblGyw#1RONucdG2fUzaUSkPblGyw  Big Carl, $3.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/carls-jr-7628-scottsdale?select=vRfvthRQhtZoM-XXpUqokQ#vRfvthRQhtZoM-XXpUqokQ  The Big Carl has become one of my favorite Burgers at Carl's Jr.  The Western Bacon Cheeseburger is an old fav of mine....and is just OK.  This particular location does a good job of making a decent fast food meal.  It's also a very clean restaurant and the employees are friendly.  Return Factor - 60%"}
{"text":"I was dying to try a Carl's Jr., 'cause I had heard so much on the \"Chains you wish were in NY\" thread a while back.  I needed to go print something at the ASU library, and my friend (!) found the nearest Carl's for me in the meantime (love to you for that!).  Carl's is right up there with Burger King for tasty flame-broiled (or whatever) burgers and nummy fries.  They also offer Squirt in their soft-drink line up, which brings back childhood memories of summers spent in Guatemala.  Remind me to hunt for Squirt up here, although Fresca must be a reasonable facsimile thereof.  There was this nifty machine were you order and pay, and then, get this, someone BRINGS the food to your table.  Can't beat that with a bat."}
{"text":"Every 5-6 months I get an uncontrollable urge for a Super Star with Cheese.  Only because it was my go-to burger growing up in So Cal and I have a tiny little spot for that burger in my heart.  So, I got that urge this evening and headed on down to this Carls Jr.  I've been to this one 3-4 times over the past couple of years - and have had similar experiences each time.  First, there were exactly 2 cars in front of me in the drive through.  And exactly two cars in the parking lot - which were probably employee cars.  12 minutes after placing my order, I finally pulled up to the window.  The car that was two in front of me had an ice cream shake handed to them and the one directly in front of me had a bag of goodies handed to them. Why it took so long, I have no idea.  The dude at the drive through needs to learn some customer service skills.  When I drove up, he looked at me and mumbled \"kldoidlp\".  I said \"what?\"  He then said \"ketchup?\".  No \"sorry for the wait\".   No \"hello\".  No repeating my order to me to make sure it was right.  Just \"ketchup?\"  I said \"ummm.... sure\".  He told me my amount, took my card, ran it, gave it back to me, stuffed a few ketchups into the bag that he was holding in his hand and handed it to me with my receipt.  He didn't thank me.  He didn't say \"F you\", he didn't say ANYTHING.  Simply handed me my bag.  It's usually automatic for  me to say \"thank you\" even when purchasing something, but I stopped myself this time.  His name was Cameron (according to the receipt).  Hey Cameron, buddy.  You need some serious customer service lessons.  Ask your manager or the corporate headquarters if maybe they could get you some training.  Because you lost a customer tonight.  And judging from the total lack of activity at 6:15 PM at your restaurant, I'm going to take a leap here and guess y'all can't afford to lose too many more customers.  The burger was good by the way.  Just how I remember it.  However, not good enough to overcome the horrible service."}
{"text":"Never had Carl's Jr before, but the commercial for the Grilled Cheese Bacon Burger made me go. Got the combo and the wifey got a Chicken Club sandwich. Bread was good for the burger. Was put together fresh because the cheese was barely melted. Would have been better with some Heinz ketchup on it. Only had mayo on it (a lot of mayo) and I didn't get any ketchup packs because as with the other fast food chains, you have to ask for ketchup packets so they can save a few pennies. The burger patty was a little small but oh well. It still tasted good. I tried some of the fries. Weren't too bad, but without ketchup I can't give a good opinion of them. Wifey's chic club was a complete mess. Bun fell apart. It was all over the place. Good thing she wasn't the one driving. This place was ok overall, but ketchup, ketchup, ketchup, ketchup! And make sure it's Heinz! Because as I have said time and time again, if it ain't Heinz, it ain't shit!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just finished sitting in a practically empty drive thru for damn near 20 mins. Only one car in front of me. As soon as I pulled up, a voice came over the speaker saying they'd be right with me. After about 8 mins or so I start trying to get their attention. No one answered so I pull around. Still behind the car, waited another 10 mins all for the \"person in charge\" as he put it to tell me that he can't and won't take my order at the window because it will mess with his drive-thru timer. He then complained to me that he \"isn't even on the clock yet and only helping out\" and suggested I drive back they the drive thru. I will never go back to this location. They care more about their number than their actual customers. And the lobby only had 2 customers in it! 1 Star!!!"}
{"text":"The food is usually good. I come here quite often living down the street from it since it was built. Usually the orders are wrong- so check them. Ill even correct as they r ringing it and she says no- i got it...then bag comes n its not right. They always manage to give my son a cheeseburger instead of regular. Usually thats the mistake i catch, and try to prevent. This location is one to bump up prices here and there. Dunno if its corporate, but chili cheesefries keep going up here.  Food is good tho like i said n ive never seen location dirty.  The order taker just seems to be the issue...whether its thru drive thru or inside.  Maybe its just MY luck? It wouldve gotten another star had this not been an every visit issue."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here (maybe 4 times/ yr) it's always the same...sloooooow. I keep forgetting to bring my pillow so I can lay down for a while. This last trip I was in the drive thru lane, this car was in front of me at the order speaker for literally 10-15 min. I was like, WTF?! No one was in front of them, it's not like there was a long line or anything, the person behind me reversed out, so I followed. I went in and asked what the hell, they just kinda shrugged me off saying there's only 3 of them working, BUT IT'S NOT CROWDED! 2 guys were already eating inside, the people sitting at the drive thru speaker waiting to order, and me inside... that's it.  Why can't 3 workers handle that? Because they move like snails crossing the salt flats. I'm done coming here"}
{"text":"The onion rings were the best ones I've had in a long time, but the zucchini sticks were a little too greasy. I took a bite into my famous star and it had way too much sauce on it like I had to get about 30 napkins to wipe some off of it,who am I kidding I had to wipe most of the sauce off! The Western bacon cheese burger was awesome in every way! The chicken bacon and Swiss Burger is really good to! We are most likely going to come back to there"}
{"text":"This place sucks!!!! Not a full menu available, only limited items. And the employees are pretty darn useless too."}
{"text":"This location is awesome for me because of the manager named Theresa. I think she is the District Manager too. She is really great. A+ in customer service. I ordered lowcarb combo from drive thru a week ago and found out that its not lowcarb when i got home. I was starving! Called the location and talked to Theresa. She said keep the receipt if I can and come back anytime and they will gladly replace my order. She was so apologetic too. Came to the store today and yes they replaced my order. Theresa happened to be there and what surprised me the most is that she even remembers my name! They made my day extra wonderful. Thank you Theresa and to the young lady on the register who helped me!"}
{"text":"Good food they could get better on their service. took away a star because they forgot two items in my order so i didn't have fires or my cookie."}
{"text":"Very rude person at front lied about having all American burger still I won't be going here anymore"}
{"text":"The worst foods they gonna serve you. Over cook onion rings and the burgers were ok but the bacon were not cook."}
{"text":"Most fast food joints deserve no more than three stars, but this particular Carl's Jr. I just had to write a nice review for.  Stopped by here about an hour ago and went through the drive-thru.  The person taking our order was exceptionally friendly.  We had guest card vouchers and they took them no questions asked.  I ordered a #1 Famous Star and I was shockingly surprised just how damn good it was.  Definitely restaurant quality.  The fries were crispy and awesome as well, definitely a notch higher than In-N-Out or McDonald's.  There was another reviewer on here who pointed out the great service and it was definitely on point along with really good food.  Can definitely see this place as being one of my regular visits during the week.  Too bad there isn't more Carl's Jr.'s like this location in town!"}
{"text":"Whatever you do! Don't order the grilled salad! The chicken taste like shit! They microwave it nasty as hell! And smells real bad!"}
{"text":"It's Carl's Jr, and by far this is the most awesome one I've visited yet! They opened this new location earlier this year, and were handing out the free coupon books for their grand opening, of course my sis and I each got one!  The place is clean and well lit inside, the workers are fun to talk with, and they're pretty fast when getting your order out. The cooks in the back take great care in getting your food out, everything comes to us fresh, hot, and nicely made - not squished as I've seen at previous Carl's Jr around the Valley!"}
{"text":"This Carl's Jr blows, we were there for Phoenix Comicon for all 4 days. We went to this Carl's Jr for two days because we were swamped and didn't want to waste too much time on getting full meals to go.  The workers there expect you to order the full meals so they don't have to hit multiple buttons when you just want the burger itself. The first time I ordered for me and my group of vendors, the chicken tenders came out dark brown, to the point where if you left it in the fryer any longer, they would have burned. My burgers bun came to me burnt on the inside, but everything else seemed fine, but then again I had ordered meals for the rest while I just got the burger itself.  The second day, I ordered a Western Burger without sauce (sis wanted it that way, I have no idea what she was thinking lol), it came to us without sauce but also no burger patty! They had also switched out the chicken tenders I had ordered for someone else with a regular $6 burger (I'm assuming). Luckily the vendors didn't care since they were really hungry and I didn't over-pay on anything since $6 burger is more expensive than the chicken tenders.  I honestly have no idea how they could screw up so badly on our orders two times on two different days. Both days they weren't busy, and had enough staff. The second day I think the manager was working (she was the only one wearing regular clothes, not the uniform), and they still managed to screw up our order.  So if anyone goes to this place, make sure you double check your order is right, I don't think they can handle huge orders or even the lunchtime rush correctly, and it's a huge shame because I really like Carl's Jr a lot, just not this location."}
{"text":"Got the best bacon cheddar frys tonight. Super fire and on point! My double western is great as alwAys"}
{"text":"Alway quick, fresh and helpful. Just how I like fast food. We usually meet up around this area for lunch as it is in the middle of my job and some friends jobs. Carls Jr is one of the places we like to visit. We stopped by for one of their real ice cream milk shakes/malts because the frozen yogurt next to Cafe Rio (first time eating there and it was great) went out of business. I got the oreo malt and it was pretty dang good. Overall I have always had good experience with this location."}
{"text":"Severely understaffed leading to long wait times both inside and at drive through. Frequent errors on orders (missing items, single burgers when ordered doubles, etc.) - and perhaps unsurprisingly, never in my favor. Also, recently showed up before 9:50pm and drive-through was already closed (stated closing time 10pm).  I love Carl's Jr., but they really need to do better at this location."}
{"text":"If I could give the store a negative rating I would I'm pretty sure they should be checked out by the health inspector and dirty dining I went in there I ordered food and when I brought the food home which wasn't very far it was cold and but decided to eat it I am disabled and couldn't get back to store I tried to call but not a answer till morning when I called the shift manager said I could have a full refund I got there and a different manager gave me back what I didn't eat and that sucked because I made the mistake going there and following the old rule when in doubt...this is and it was the worst experience I ever had the manager treated me like I was some sort of scum when in fact I am a nice person not important just way they made me feel the staff are young and friendly this has more to do with being single out that is how she made me feel and that's not my fault I am disabled in my opinion...the manager she needs a refresh on customer service and not be judging Won't be back and neither will my friend and family #foodpoisoning"}
{"text":"You are at the airport. You have not eaten in a while and will probably starve to death or have a peanut allergy reaction on the plane otherwise. You decide to eat here to avoid those problems.  After waiting in line for twenty minutes, you get to the counter and order one of twenty of so varieties of the same meat patty topped with something different. You settle on jalapeños or avocado or whatever. You wait ten more minutes for the food, for which they have blessedly provided a pager.  The burger is a total gut bomb covered in a glob of cheese. Even though it is more expensive here than the average location, it still comes out to less than a penny per calorie.  In fairness, the onion rings are decent and they do have refills on fountain drinks. Skip the burger."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. This is the 2nd time I've been to this carls jr and the employee either had a smart mouth or just rushed me out. Which is ironic both times I've been to this location there was nobody else in the restaurant. Will never return to a carls jr because of this. I asked if they were still serving breakfast and I get a yea in a tone that made me feel like I was stupid for asking. The 1st time I went for just a milkshake. I asked for no whipped cream. Received my milkshake with whipped cream when I asked for it to be removed the man just scraped it off and poured half of my milkshake out just to remove the whipped cream and handed it back to me. I watched him do it and I immediately asked for my money back. Worst experience ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service in graveyard shift! Not once, not twice, not third but many times they made errors in drive thru. The moment we left the place, some things in our orders were missing. Not sure if these crews were high or just whatever kids lol"}
{"text":"This place is clean, the food is fresh, and the employees are friendly.  I expect less from a place where I can get a full breakfast for under $5.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"This is my usual location that I go to usually I go around 1pm and everything is great and the staff is great. Thumbs up to the morning shift. Well today I went in at 6:53pm(I still have my receipt)......so I walked in and seen 2guys standing and talking to each other not doing anything. It was the cook and a cashier. So I proceeded and order the 2 for $6 mix and match and got 2 famous starts with cheese and a cup For water. As I was getting water I grabbed some napkins and it was filthy with ketchup and different sauces. It was disgusting to see the only napkin dispenser nasty and full of bacteria. So I threw the first few napkins away and went to sit down to only find that the tables were dirty full of sauce and crumbs. I had to clean my own table before I sat down. No one was in the lobby or in drive thru. So as I'm waiting, a young African-american lady walks in from outside. I assumed she was throwing out the trash but truly didn't know. So we'll these guys are still talking she grabs my food without washing her hands and brings it to my table. The burgers had grease finger prints and smears all over the wrapper. Fyi I was so hungry and hadn't eaten since 11am. So I open the first burger and their is so much mayo in it and I mean between every item. Bun, mayo, lettuce, mayo, pickle & tomato, mayo, meat & cheese, mayo bun. I could not hold the burger because everything kept sliding out and was extremely messy. I hand mayo all over my hands, face, and wrapper. So I just ate it and moved on the the 2nd burger and it was the same thing but this had like this red salsa all over the bun. And I thought to myself, damn these guys are dirty! Imagine if health inspection was here. Like I said I was hungry so I ate it and left very upset. Because of all the mayonnaise I started gaging and spiting up mucus as my stomach begin to hurt and I thought to myself I should of just got my money back. This is my first help and I am highly dissatisfied. Bottom line is I love this location but not with them 2 lazy gentelman there. I do not wish to see them again if I continue to go to this location or you will lose my business. I was in the food industry for the last 5 years and a supervisor the last 3. THIS IS NO PROFESSIONAL UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I'M SO DISGUSTED!!!!!  I would give no stars because of the sitituation but because yelp says I have to, so here's 1 star to post my experience today"}
{"text":"They're likely undergoing startup pains, because there seemed to be a lack of coordination. I ordered a portobello mushroom burger, but when it got to our table I couldn't see any mushrooms (were they mixed into the patty?). My dinner companion's burger said Jalapeño on its wrapper but it had no jalapeños, which is good because I'd ordered him an Original Six Dollar burger with no jalapeños. Sure, 1/3 lb. patties are big, texture was OK, flavour was a bit bland, lettuce was crisp...but I've been to an assortment of trendy burger places and missing a key ingredient or getting a mislabeled burger is no bueno. I didn't complain because I was oh so hungry and the kitchen was under a lot of pressure: lineups in sporadic waves both inside and at the drive-through. On the plus side, my chocolate milkshake was delicious, the waffle fries were well-seasoned and crispy, and table service was attentive and cheerful. The WiFi seemed fast, too. I'll try them again after they've sorted out their workflow."}
{"text":"Whoever gave this place 2 stars is lame in my eyes. Not American. I love this place. Got a western meal. Num 3 to the rest of you I out there. Awesome as always."}
{"text":"My husband and I just went in for lunch! The place across the street was too busy and we both wanted cheeseburgers and frys! And we both walked in we were greeted by a young Girl working the counter who was so friendly! We enjoyed our lunch but most of all the customer service we got at this establishment!"}
{"text":"My faith in Carl's Jr is restored thanks to the experience I had at this location! My previous experience at another Carl's Jr was not that good so I will admit that I was hesitant to try this location (let alone return to Carl's Jr to begin with). However, I decided to give this place a shot and I was glad that I did.  The cashier taking our order was very courteous. The wait time was quick and nothing on our order was screwed up.  As an added bonus, the food was delicious. The restaurant was also clean, which is always a plus in my book. My only complaint is that the fountain drinks tasted a little flat.  I still plan to come back though."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great. Compared to other similar fast food franchises, Carl's Jr is just average.  In my most recent visit here, I tried the Three Way Burger and it was... well, just okay. The burger patty and bacon didn't have a lot of flavor to them.  The sauce they added to the burger had just a mild sweet flavor.  Even the fries were kind of bland.  I added salt and pepper to them, which helped to improve the taste slightly.  Next time I have a craving for a burger, I'll be more likely to opt for Culver's, Freddy's, or Jack in the Box before selecting Carl's Jr again.  As far as this particular establishment goes, the employees were very polite and our order was processed quickly and correctly.  The restaurant was clean, which is always a bonus.  One thing I did notice was that there appeared to be a lot of vagrants milling about the place.  I felt out of place coming here since my hair was combed, my clothes were clean, and I don't have any missing teeth."}
{"text":"Decided to give them a try for dinner tonight and glad that we did.  Had the crispy chicken bacon Swiss sandwich and onion rings.  Both were hot and tasty.  Hubby's waffle fries and burger were awesome too.   Fresh, crispy veggies on both sandwiches added a pleasant surprise and took the  sandwiches from good to great.   Place was clean and staff were cordial - we will be back!"}
{"text":"First and foremost the service was great and my review is aimed at the new boneless baby back rib burger. I realize that 99% of fast food never looks anything like the commercial portrays. This burger was a huge disappointment though. The flavor as constructed taste of only BBQ sauce. Even though that is the flavor the dryness amazed me having to wash down what I was eating with my drink so that I could actually swallow it. I was also expecting a small portion of the rib but again it was even smaller than I expected with barely enough to cover 1/4 of the patty. The flavor in the rib meat by itself was actually very good but was lost in the sandwich itself. I would definitely expect more for a $11.76 SMALL combo meal, and would have rather spent that at a sit down restaurant on a quality product."}
{"text":"Found myself a wee bit hungry while driving on 16th earlier today. While never having tried Carl's Jr, I figured I'd give them a go. After waiting a minute at the counter while a staff gab was going on, a young woman then came up to the register, apologized for keeping me, and proceeded to take my order; something called a Western cheese/bacon burger combo. In short order, my meal was delivered to my table and I proceeded to 'chow down'. What a letdown! The fries weren't hot and the burger looked like it was put together by a gorilla. The bun was all mushed in and it tasted no better than the kind of burger you get at a street festival BBQ. Sadly disappointed with overall value and will never be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped by Carl's Jr. to grab a quick burger for the kiddos and treated myself to a Low-carb $6 burger. Wow, as my son would say, \"it was like having a party in my tummy\".  Warning though, very messy so don't eat this in public!  It was a manwich size burger, very filling if you can eat the whole thing and you won't even feel guilty cuz you skipped the bun!  4-stars only due to messiness-but sometimes you can't find a lettuce leaf that big!"}
{"text":"Arrived 7:45 AM for breakfast. Employees are courteous. Food is okay just like another Carl's JR.  Place is old and dated but clean and organized at least at the time I was there. The coffee taste bad (sour or acidic) but don't think it has anything to do with the employees. Carl's Jr. need to improve their coffee. It's far behind Mc Donald's.  Pancakes and/or waffles should be added. It's an American tradition."}
{"text":"There dining room supposed to be open till 10 but when I got there at 945 the doors were already locked some guest left so I went through the door and the guy in the front claims to be a manager and says they go by there register time which I guess must be 15 mins or more off then he says and I can refuse service to anybody and I'm not helping you order food. Terable guest service and they obviously don't care about making a sale eather do not go here at least Jack in the box down the street welcome us."}
{"text":"Do not go here anytime near lunch if you are short on time.  This place sucks I have been in line for 15 minutes unreal."}
{"text":"Very quick service.  Perfect pit stop on the way to California.  It is also the last piece of civilization before Blythe. Safe quick food. You know what you are going to get at Carls!"}
{"text":"79¢ large drinks. Enough said. Giant delicious diet coke. Yesssss. Also they have tea and will mix it with sweet tea or lemonade for a little AP action. Haven't tried any food...well ok that's a lie, I once ordered a small fry. It was salty, fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"I love be Carl's Jr.!  But don't stop at this one!  I haven't had a Famous Star for a month and it was in Portland when I had it.  I was really looking forward to this lunch being a home run, strike three, you're out!!  If this is any representation of what CJ's is like in Phoenix then I'll be finding a new fav. burger joint!!  The place was a pig pen.  The bun was old and had that old bread flavor, it's still in my mouth... yuk!! The fries were too greasy and I think they hadn't changed the grease in a month!!  Finally, the pop is flat!  I may regret The move to Phoenix if they can't even get fast food correct!"}
{"text":"Like the food and the service they have jalapeños that's awesome for a fast food place"}
{"text":"pretty good...love the burgers and the fries always hit the spot"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Carl's Jr. location in town! The employees are super friendly and the restaurant is always spotlessly clean. I love Carl's low-carb lettuce wrapped burgers and the folks here understand what I want when I order that (they will seriously wrap ANYTHING ON THEIR MENU in lettuce to make it lower in carbs)! I just love this location, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I'm a low-carber and I love Carl's Jr. because they will literally wrap ANYTHING on their menu in lettuce. Just ask for whatever \"low carb style\" and they will wrap it in lettuce instead of a bun. I love that. Their six dollar burgers are tasty and their grilled chicken sandwiches, while smaller than they once were, are high quality.   I think this is the best Carl's Jr. in the chain here in Vegas. I've eaten at most of the ones in town and this one has the most consistently delicious food, friendly employees, and it is always super clean. I love dining in because the eating area is so clean and they have both Diet Dr. Pepper, Coke Zero and fresh brewed iced tea at the beverage bar -- all you can drink when you dine in."}
{"text":"I took a picture of the bathroom. Pretty dirty. We stopped here to go to the restroom and eat, but after seeing the dirtiest bathroom I have ever laid eyes on, we didn't eat."}
{"text":"On par with most fast food joints. Nothing fancy but it was well kept and had friendly employees.   Carl's has a lot of big burgers and I usually end up going with the Jalapeño burger or one of their many specials. During this particular visit, they offered two Famous Stars for $5.00. That's a heck of a deal. What broke the deal for me was the $0.55 for cheese! WTF mate? So I'd end up paying basically full price for them. What gives? Needless to say I went with the jalapeño.  I'd return if in the area and I need a quick burger."}
{"text":"Okay I would give them a 5-star rating because they do have amazing burgers and amazing Fry's for a decent price, BBUUUTT....... the last time I went there they totally messed up my order ,they charged me almost $30 extra for something that I did not order and when I finally got my actual order I was given the wrong Burger and asked if they could have make the right Burger and they gladly did but they took the old Burger or the wrong Burger and tossed it in the trash instead of letting me keep it then on top of that when I had to wait 45 minutes to get my money back I asked if they had a manager on hand or corporates number and the employee told me to just \"Google it\", because they didn't have the number on hand!! Very Rude!!"}
{"text":"I'm not surprised this Carl's Jr has a 2 star rating. Apparently the general manager went to the bank&once he left everything fell apart. People's orders including my families were given to wrong people. There's no napkins&its been 10min&i still am waiting on my order of criss cuts while my burger gets cold. Very pissed of customer who won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I went once and got the spicy chicken sandwitches witch are my all time favorites there and I got sick and was in the bathroom. I didn't believe it was them so I went back two weeks later got my same and what do you know same thing happened this time to me,I say watch out here cause something isn't right witch is a total bummer:("}
{"text":"I think this is the best Carl's location in Vegas. The employees are always super polite and helpful and the restaurant is super clean. Love the new burgers they have. Great place to grab a quick bite for lunch."}
{"text":"This place served us burgers that didn't look how they're supposed to like in the pictures. The tables were all dirty and the floor inside the cooking area has food all over it !"}
{"text":"Frida was one of the most amazing workers I have ever seen. You should of seen how she could double task. She should be running a Carls junior, not just working at one!"}
{"text":"Have ALWAYS loved Carl's Jr growing up in Southern California.  The famous star and Western bacon cheeseburger are still delicious.  This location is clean and in the sports arena area which is short walk from local hotels.  A little different from hotel bars which is a nice change."}
{"text":"The times i have came here the drive through line is so long! This past time i was next to order and the lady kept telling me \"one more moment please\", \"It will just me one more minute.\", etc. I was waiting about 3 minutes before i could actually order. On top of that she forgot to give me my drink and by time i realized it i was too far to turn around. Overall bad experience and probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"Okay, so Carl's Jr. is a large fast food chain and it is unusual for me to review such a place.  But the Carl's at 1522 W. Charleston (just off the I-15) is a good place.  The service is always friendly.  The food is always fresh.  It comes out pretty quickly even if the place is busy.  And it does get busy around lunch time.  There are a couple of hospitals and a dental school in close proximity.  Walk in there around 11:30-noon during the week and you will almost be guaranteed to observe a sea of scrubs.  It kind of makes you feel safe.  Like there are people who can take care of you in the event of a medical episode.  But I am getting off topic now.  To make a long story short, good service and good food is hard to beat. Oh, and they now have sweet potatoe fries.  They are amazing.  Perfectly crunchy yet tender inside.  A little overly salted for me.  Still good though."}
{"text":"It can never go wrong with Carl's Jr. for a quick lunch! The cheese burger and animal style fries are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Well, as long as the food quality goes, it s better than MickyD or KFC. Jalapeño poppers are to die for! The drive through is fast! No complains!"}
{"text":"I was hungry midafternoon and even a bough I've had bad experiences at Carl's in the past I was craving my childhood favorite.  I walked in with 3 people behind me and cars in the drive through. There was one young man behind the register. I thought \" oh great this is going to take forever\". But as I watched him interact with everyone I was very pleasantly surprised.  He handled everything calmly and efficiently. He did not act put out like so many young clerks.  I hope his manager knows what a gem he has in jonathon."}
{"text":"Again I am not much of a fast food diner and you can see/read my previous review for another fellow Carl's Jr in the valley. I still much prefer McDonald's across the way or Burger King."}
{"text":"We had a coupon. That is the only way we will even consider the food here. First of all, the food portions are quite large and messy, secondly they are rather pricey compared to other fast food options.   That said, we got a buy one get one free Crispy Chicken sandwich, and their hand cut fries. Rahim, the Shift Manager, brought our food to us. He introduced himself, and asked us to please let him know if there was anything that he could get for us. That was a pleasant surprise.   The sandwiches were nicely wrapped, as well as nice and hot. The fries were crispy and hot. The food was pretty good.   The store was clean and organized as well. The staff there was well mannered and pleasant. We were really surprised with our visit to this Carl's Jr. location. Very well done! And props to Rahim for a job very well done."}
{"text":"If I could give them negative stars I would,  they never get my order right, the night crew is the worst , never going here agin"}
{"text":"The worst location I've been to and I've been to around ten different ones. We waited a long time for the food which I would've been okay with if it was properly cooked and put together. The bacon was so pink, the burger was very grey. My wife's chicken sandwich was very under cooked. We were hoping her chicken was already pre-cooked, had it been \"fresh\" it would have not been safe to eat. Staff very unorganized. We will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I'm a Carl's Jr fan for their fried zucchini and their crisscut waffle fries. The biggest thing about this place is their chicken sandwich. I definitely choose their chicken sandwich over any other fast food place in town that is. The chicken isn't breaded and its always tasty and moist. Their customer service could be a bit better though but it doesn't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"Had to wait 30 minutes in the drive thru, when there is only one car ahead of me taking one small bag of take out. They did not apologize, the order was cold. They forgot napkins, ketchups, and even my drinks so I had to ask them for every single thing. Typical fast food experience but i had to comment because they were a lot worse than the regular ones."}
{"text":"Had to wait more than 20 min for food while most employees were standing around.  The drive through was at a stand still and no one knew what to do.  Awe full service at 3:00 on a week day"}
{"text":"Awful service.   My visit prior they completely butchered my order after taking 17 mins to serve me.  The food was burnt and not what I ordered.This time the guy at the drive thru kept interrupting me and then asking me \"what?\".  Then I waited 10 min again.  I was trying to buy additional items but he made it impossible.  That's the opposite of what any restaurant wants.... They want you to order more, not less."}
{"text":"Congratulations! They somehow took the filth that is Burger King and cranked up the disgusting factor ten fold. This place is like the creepy fat uncle of burger joints. Greasy, tasteless and way too eager to disappoint you.  Another thing, why are my hands covered by a layer of rendered fat after eating there? Was i scooping butter out of a fat mans refrigerator? Was I rubbing grease onto the backside of a beached whale? No wait... I just ate at Carl jr's!  I think jr. needs a good whoopin because he just embarrassed the entire art of making burgers."}
{"text":"I don't expect much from fast food. You are getting so-so food from people who are unhappy usually. Unless it is In & Out or Chick-fil-a.... The wife was out of town and it was a hard day. So this sounded easy and good. The food was fine. Pricey at 10 bucks... but the service. I am not sure what this kids problem was. It was only 7:50 at night. But the kid could not have been more rude. He grabbed the money from my hand and slammed the window so hard I thought it might break. Then once again slams it open shoves my food at me. Didn't give me a shot to ask for anything. He had slammed the window shut again. I was afraid to ask for anything. Add to it when you leave this drive through you have to make this insane right hand turn. You can not make the turn without going up on the curb or jut way out into traffic. I hope this kid was ok because whatever had him angry must have been terrible!"}
{"text":"I was sitting in the dinning room eating and some Jack donkey employee thought it would be funny to use a air horn to wake up his employees. Yes it caused all of them to giggle and smile. But it caused me to bite my tongue. The first time was just stupid the second time a minute later was down right idiotic. I only stopped because I was in a rush.... Never again."}
{"text":"Customer service has been top notch on every visit. Their food is consistent and I only get two things here (not including my drink) which is the spicy chicken sandwich and criscut fries. They're my classics :)"}
{"text":"Didn't have the best experience. I was getting my tires fixed at the pepboys nearby.  I wanted breakfast and I understand that some places have a time cut off... But when I asked the employee he didn't seem to know if it was still being served so he followed up with what it seemed like was management.  The manager yells \"no- no more breakfast. No breakfast until tomorrow\"  I understand - I needed to pick something else. The employee helps a guest at the drive through and I'm assuming the gentleman wanted breakfast.   Manager yells again (he has on a headset) to the employee NO BREAKFAST. Breakfast until tomorrow.   Unprofessional. The employee did a good job and that's why it's a 3/5 not 2."}
{"text":"I do like their burgers, but service is always asi-asi.  Not here not there!  I have ordered many things and there's always one little issue.  My latest was no tomatoe burger, and when I bit into it I had tomatoe!  Not a biggie, I took it out but I did drive a ways out to get this order...I guess it's not BK my way!  With the right coupons I come here, otherwise, I cringe having to give my order and hardly ever expect it to be right."}
{"text":"This location between 10pm and 2am don't expect to get service, there is usually an employee's car parked in the drive so you can not order, or you will sit at the order screen without your order being taken.  Other few times I have gotten my order, it usually takes 10-15+ mins when you are the only one in line..."}
{"text":"Here we go muricaaaa. I've had Carl's Jr before 2 years ago and it was quite something else. After eating another burger from here I realize damn.. that was one heck of a burger!   I ordered the American and my gf ordered El Diablo. These burgers were huge like HUGE and I ordered the 1/3 size when there was a 1/2 size. Mine had the beef patty, sausage cut in two, hard chips, lettuce, bacon, tomatoes,  cheese and jalapeño mayo oh my god. It was definitely something else. The taste however was a so so. Nothing that great about it just lot of ingredients put together. However for airport food it's not bad. My gf could feel the arteries clogging as she ate hers ahaha. Not a bad place though for being in an airport.   Can take awhile depending what you get. They give you buzzers, which I think is good considering it's a fast food place in an airport. Also let you know that they didn't forget your order."}
{"text":"I only go through the drive thru but my order has always been correct, food has always been warm, customer service has always been good. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"I'm always hesitant to leave a bad review but this was a terrible experience. It took 25 minutes to get our food and the manager was incredibly disrespectful. Not only was she rude to us, but to her employees as well. While we waited the 25 minutes for our food, multiple people came in from the drive thru with incorrect orders. The manager was goofing off and then openly reprimanding her employees for disrespecting her. Just an all around joke here.   We will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"Horrible, ordered my food and waited ten minutes while the employee's stood around. Finally got my food back to where I was staying and both hamburgers were burnt the jalapeno poppers were hollow/empty and when I called to complain they hung up on me.   Stay clear of this place......  Over priced, bad food."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Bathrooms smell like sewage.Had a complaint and not taken seriously will take my business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars for this Carl's. The customer service is TERRIBLE. In the few times I've been they've overcharged me, gotten my order wrong, and the wait time is the longest I've ever experienced in a fast food drive through. One time the wait was literally 20 minutes. When I had to drive back to get the right order and get a credit for being over charged (2 separate occasions) they didn't even apologize. Total shame because I love Carl's jr food but the service here is not even worth it."}
{"text":"It's a Carl's Jr. I mean, what can I say? I will have to say that the clientele was a tad bit odd. First we had Jalapeño Woman, and then Dickhead USPS Worker. I use these terms endearingly. *LOL*  After eating all of the fine foods of Vegas, sometimes you just want to do a little low budg meal for lunch. We were starting to get hungry so we swung by CJ. We opted to try their new Big Carl, which was okay, but it will NEVER be a Big Mac.   So, let me tell you about Jalapeño Woman. She must work around here and frequent the joint because she was chummy with the workers even though you could tell they couldn't stand her. Well, the line moves up a bit and she turns around and goes ballistic because SOMEONE took her JALAPEÑOS! Heaven forbid. 1. Who gets their condiments ready before even ordering? 2. Well, there's no 2 because 1 means you take them with you as you wait for your order.  Anyhow, every person that joined the line had to hear about it. And she even added that it was so disgusting because THEY don't know where HER hands have been. Really? I don't want to know why YOUR nasty ass hands are in the condiment bar then. GROSS! And she was just all around weird because she ordered a cheeseburger but she wanted it all completely separate so that she could put it together when she got back to work. *shaking head*  Once we get our order, which was 2 Big Carl Combos to our table, we're missing a burger. How do you forget a burger? I went to mention it to the guy, who was apologetic, but it was still a bit weird.  We were sitting next to two USPS carriers on their lunch and mid-meal the male carrier's cell phone rings and, loud enough for the whole place to hear, screams (in a non-joking way), \"WHAT THE F*#%^ DO YOU WANT?!\" He then makes mention of him being at lunch and hangs up. Ummmm... okay.  The place was relatively clean. It's the clientele that makes it a bit dirrrrrrrrty!"}
{"text":"Ok so good is on point, but time is a small issue. Don't need to hire a whole new staff, just fresh food takes time you make and they make it fresh at 12:00am."}
{"text":"Okay seriously??? It's Saturday, October 21st 12:30 AM just so you can pin point exactly who was working the drive through. She was a Mexican girl, brown curly hair. I bought a gift card for Carl's Jr. This morning it worked just fine. I went back and after 20 minutes of sitting there in the drive through she said \"sorry there's no funds\" and hands it back to me. I called the number on the card and put it on speaker so she could hear it tell me that I had $12.17 on the card and she just stared at me and said \"sorry\" I asked to speak to a manager and she said \"there isn't one sorry\" are you kidding me? So I just wasted money buying this gift card that doesn't even work. Thanks. Maybe adequately train your employees to use the computers or how to use a gift card. I wasted money and 30 minutes of my life sitting there so you can just lie to me and say \"sorry there's no money\" when, in fact, there's $12.17. I'll be by in the morning to inquire from a manager why your employees don't know how to run a gift card and why your restaurant is being left unattended for poorly trained employees to not know how to let someone pay for their food."}
{"text":"Just got ripped off at the Carl's Jr. On 75th ave and cactus.  Ordered a famous star combo thru the drive thru and when I got home, there was no meat.  Had all the condiments on it with lettuce tomatoes onions and bun.  Super pissed off.  To far to drive back.  And they want to raise the minimum wage. Lol!!"}
{"text":"We had to wait 15 minutes to get our two sandwiches (not even meals!) and when they did come, instead of the grilled chicken club I wanted, I got a BBQ chicken. When I complained about the 15 minute wait, the woman said \"sorry\" in a snotty way. Oh, and you think the long wait was because they were super busy? Nope. There was one car at the drive thru and two customers in the store, besides my husband and me. There were more employees than customers and they still were slow! While we were waiting for our order, two men came into the place with their order, which they took to the counter and said was not what they had ordered at the drive thru. This is the norm for this restaurant... slow service, lots of mistakes. We're tired of giving this joint second chances. We're locals and we're never coming back.  Carls Jr. management needs to fire all the employees in this store and hire EXPERIENCED ONES, and even if you did, it's almost certainly too late to save this place because locals won't come here and it can't survive only on highway revenue."}
{"text":"After more than a decade away from Carl's Jr., I was lured back in with a Buy One Get One Free offer I received in the mail. Without going into sad details about the food here, I would just say that Carl's Jr. as a food chain has to do much more than just mailing promotion to survive the overcrowded Fast Food market. As for this location, besides its tired and dingy look, it holds the dubious distinction of the smelliest restrooms in a Vegas restaurant. The staff is on the other hand super friendly."}
{"text":"I gave them a shot after waiting 20 min in the drive through... When it happened again I had to make sure management was responsible for this awful service. Never again!! No wonder they have such a bad rating."}
{"text":"Tried this place when I first moved to Buckeye and they messed up both my wife and I's burgers twice. We then felt a bit off later that night with our stomachs, but figured maybe it was something else and this place had an off night. We returned about a week later and ordered the same things ( No. 1 combos) and while they got the orders right that time, my wife and I both had stomach issues that night with full on food poisoning with me! Since we both had bad stomach issues after eating here and it was the only full meal with the same food each of us had that day, we deduced it was the food here.   We will not be returning..."}
{"text":"Two words for you - Guacamole Burger. So I've always been a big fan of their waffle fries and jalapeno poppers, but I had yet to find an entrée that I actually enjoyed (I mean, yeah, they have an ok cheeseburger, but it's not \"wow I NEED to have that again\"). But the guacamole burger my husband selected on our last desperate fast food meal was awesome.  The guac was creamy and flavorful, and it was complimented with a spicy cheese and red onions. If you've tried Carl's and weren't convinced, then give the guac burger a shot. And always get it with waffle fries - so crispy and soft and salty and awesome!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, fries, and shakes!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and kids couldn't get the order right. Came all the way home to see that stuff was missing from our order. Note to this location: maybe you shouldn't ask question about the order if you cant take it right. You suck!!"}
{"text":"So, I was not too impressed with the risque television commercials a few years back with Paris Hilton and decided to avoid them.  However, who doesn't want \"free food for a year?\"  Every grand opening of a Carl's Jr location, the first 500 people that order the combo get a coupon book for a free sandwich every week.  Not quite \"free food for a year,\" but more like a free sandwich each week for a year. So, yea, I went and waited in line for an hour for their opening.  The breakfast combo was alright, but nothing special.  On another day,  I tried one of their sandwiches.  Maybe it is the fresh baked buns, perhaps their special sauce, but it was the most invigorating sandwich I have every had at a fast food joint; definitely enjoyed.  I may not like their advertising methods, but the food is good!"}
{"text":"Customer service is terrible. We stood there for about 5 minutes without even being acknowledged. My daughter and I both eat low carb and I had the sliders low carb style at a few other locations and attempted to order them here. I was told by the girl at the counter that they \"aren't allowed to do the sliders low carb.\" I told her that I had them that way at 3 other locations and she said that the general manager instructed them not to make the sliders low carb style. This is just the most asinine thing I've ever heard. What is the logic behind this? You're using less lettuce! I decided not to eat, but my daughter did because she was on her way to work and got a low carb thickburger with no ketchup... and when it arrived? Yeah, of course there was ketchup on it! Not to mention the fact that the dining room was absolutely filthy. The franchise owner needs to fire everyone here and start over, just look at your reviews buddy. If you're thinking about eating here, don't."}
{"text":"Not a fan-the prime rib burger was good but most of the burgers are just awful. This location is unique as it has a Green Burrito in it too so you can get a taco salad some burittos or whatever floats your boat. I like the taco salad but havent eaten here in years."}
{"text":"Nice!   this was the first Carl's Jr. I discovered Green Burrito. Strange name, but they were pretty decent for fast food. Years later, I read Morgan Spurlock's book, he's known for doing Supersize me. In Don't Eat this Book, he writes about the connection of Green Burrito to Carl's as an attempt by Carl himself to revitalize the chain. And apparently Carl was fired from his own chain but since rehired?   There is some dark history with me and this location, but it had nothing to do with Carl's. I had a motorcycle accident out front one night. Actually, I had a protected left turn (left onto Maryland north), and someone approaching at excessive speed from the opposite direction BARRELLED thru their red light to make a swerving right turn- right on my path. So I veered left and slammed into that island in front of the Carl's.   also, in the area was the first (ghetto) apartment I had when I moved to Vegas, so I have been going to this location since moving here in 1999. The Ghetto apartment has since been refurbished somewhat as a Siegel Suite.  Carl's is one of maybe 3 national chains I go to for one reason: The Big Carl. Right up against McDonald's mystery mad cow beef, the Big Carl is a larger burger for cheaper. Folks, there is NO reason to go to McDonald's since the McD brothers sold to Krok.  They put unsanitary barfed and peed on playgrounds and make happy little sweatshop imported toys so that your kids will nag you to go.   So go to Carl's!"}
{"text":"Had the privilege of sampling their burgers, chicken fingers, waffle fries and milkshakes the day before they opened. Those hand scooped milkshakes are worth coming back for like every day. So yummy and I may or may not have been back for one already ;)  The burgers are juicy and delicious. Love that the chicken fingers are real chicken - so good! The waffle fries are the perfect combination of salty and crispy.  Great experiences here already and they've only been open a couple of days."}
{"text":"Nasty tasting & strange looking burger patties...cold onion rings...chicken fingers very good and unique ice cream sandwiches ...would not return"}
{"text":"Five Guys prices for fast-food that's just above McDonald's quality. I have only eaten at a Carl's Jr. a handful of times in my life and it's probably been about a decade since I last gave this franchise a try. I don't recall thinking it was anything special then, and my opinion probably isn't going to change anytime soon.   Carl's Junior serves a pretty big \"$6 burger\" on a brioche bun. The bun is phenomenal. The burger that's between the slices is mediocre. Splurging on the combo gets customers a bigger drink and more fries than any one human being should ever try to consume. I recommend saving at least a buck and half and skipping the fries, the burgers are big enough to satisfy your appetite.  Being attached to the US Airways center gives this location a little bit of a unique feeling. It's a convenient lunch or dinner spot for downtown workers (and the handful of downtown residents). It's also an option as a place to get a bite that's going to be a bit cheaper than whatever you would order at an event inside the arena."}
{"text":"First time coming to this location and what can I say? Awful. We ordered a combo and an additional burgers hen we pulled up to the window, the guy was busy flirting with a girl that worked there. They handed us the food and closed the window 10 minutes later. We drive away irritated, to only realize that they didn't us our drink. The service was so terrible that we took the loss and bought a drink elsewhere. The avocado burger had a tiny bit of avocado and half a head of lettuce. To top it off, today, we both have food poisoning. To say the least, this Carl's Jr. Sucks."}
{"text":"Hiya..... this place is no different from other burger vendors, maybe priced somewhere between A&W and Five Guys. Quality is not there. Kitchen crammed with too many young employees is never a good thing."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for my food. This is not a fast food place!!  This place sucks I'll never come back to this place"}
{"text":"Why did I even bother?  Sometimes after work, especially when I work overtime I am simply hungry and nothing is open because I get off of work at 12:30 AM. I was starving and did not feel like cooking when I got home. I happened to remember Carl's Jr. also sells burritos under their \"Green Burrito\" name so I thought I would just try it this once.  Well, it just so happened that night they weren't actually selling any of the Mexican food. Bummer. And I was already IN the drive-thru, sitting there with my stomach rumbling still. I decided to go with the Carl's Jr. Six Dollar Burger combo, bringing my total to a whopping $8.68. I don't know about other people, but paying anything over 6 bucks for something someone is handing me through a window never sits well with me.  And surprise - the burger didn't sit well with me either. I got home and the fries were incredibly sub-par. Just sad ass fries in general. I didn't bother eating very many of them. But my dogs enjoyed them. The cheeseburger - such a joke! I can't believe people fall for this \"it's like a restaurant burger\" crap. I guess if you've never been to a restaurant and had a burger then...  Anyway the cheeseburger from the minute I picked it up was slip-sliding everywhere. Why? Because there was massive amounts of mayo and mustard sliming up the works. I had to undo the burger, pick out everything, scrape off a majority of the sauces, throw out the mealy tomato, and THEN have the actual burger. They say it's \"Angus beef\" - okay. Maybe it tasted a BIT better than normal fast food burgers, but really? NOPE..   I'd rather have McDonald's guys. At least the fries are better."}
{"text":"The food ain't bad the customer service isn't either but whoever make the decision to give the guy on shift who speaks the least amount of English the headset is a dick. He's not funny, if you're reading this and you're the one who makes that decision, I know you're laughing at this and thinking you're hilarious, but you're not. You're a dick. A big fat dick. You could be a chick and you'd still be a dick. Every time... I can hear the other English sparking people talking to him trying to give an English lesson while also cooking the food, and I know you're still laughing, but you're not funny Dick. You're just a Dick, and guess what Dick, I hope you love being assistant manager because dicks like you stay assistant manager for a very long time, maybe even forever. So enjoy your laugh barely above minimum wage assistant manager chick who's also a dick because chances are you'll be laughing at this one for years to come. Aim high and remember to keep laughing when Mr ESL keeps kicking ass and learns how to do everything to become manager then hires all his friends and family and you become the one with the funny accent in your own neighborhood. Keep laughing it up, funny ass dick because that's what's funny about what you're doing when you say \"here ya go\" then go and giggle your ass off until it's time for you to go home. Real funny Dick, real funny."}
{"text":"I thought this place was open 24/7, which was my misunderstanding lol I came here shortly before they closed and was given outstanding customer service. I don't remember the name of the girl I talked to/took my order but she was a sweetheart; super nice and very patient. It was nice to experience after the long day I had"}
{"text":"I liked being greeted as i entered the restaurant. The cashier was attentive and stopped what she was doing to service us. I had the taco salad and it was well worth the price paid. 5.99 but enough to feed the wife and I.  I was feeling nostalgic so I got a bean and cheese burrito. The size of that for the 1.69 price didn't match.  I did like that they had a salsa bar so that made up for it. Location was at the corner of Dessert In and Maryland. I guess they have problems with shady people coming in because they had to kick out a couple of people all in an hours time."}
{"text":"We come here on a regular basis, mainly because we can get drinks for $0.79 + tax.  But with a 10% student discount and our bank gives us money back for using our debit, about $0.65.  Sometimes we'll get breakfast here and their burgers are decent, some are a little overpriced, but you get a good amount of food.  We've gotten to know some of the people here and they are always friendly with excellent customer service.    Really, as far as fast food, this is about as good as it gets - excellent service, clean place (when we choose to eat in) and reasonably quick, as the food is cooked when you order and not sitting under some heating lamp growing stale.  Oh, and they always have ice when we need it.  I prefer the bags of ice at Carl's Jr as the chunks are bigger so the ice lasts longer than McDonald's, although the bags are $0.99 here as opposed to less at the McDonald's across the street.  Well worth the extra $0.10 to $0.15.  It's also in a great location for us, on the way home."}
{"text":"I just left there waited 15 mins got home after being in class all day very hungry odered shake,Bacon western and onion rings'That is the worst HB I have ever gotten The bun was blk and dry the hb very dry and I threw it in the trash worse dinner ever"}
{"text":"I'd admit, I've never tried Carl's Jr before since there aren't any around where I'm from in New York City. So if this Carl Jr. is exceptional, I wouldn't have known. But what i can say is this joint was absolutely great. The lady behind the counter was very accommodating and pass by my table a few times if everything was alright. Which is very odd for a fast food joint (especially in nyc).   I've order the Guacamole Burger and my friend ordered the Teriyaki Burger. My burger had the options to upgrade for the burger to be double meat patty or the angus meat patty. So i chose to upgrade it to an angus beef patty which was great and delish. I like the burger being charcoal and the guacamole made the burger moist and creamy. I have to say the sauce in my burger was awesome. No condiments (ketchup) needed. Great place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I ordered famous star and found mold on my hamburger buns. I took it back and they looked at it and said, yeh ok. I will never go back. So grose"}
{"text":"Damn are you for real I drive out of my way for lunch to try the new baby back rib burger and this is what I get. Barely even one rib. I paid over $11 bucks for the combo and you cant even give me more than one rib!!' What a rip off. Don't bother ordering this burger. This is my biggest gripe with fast food. You advertise an amazing hamburger with baby back ribs and deliver the pathetic excuse!!"}
{"text":"Showed up at 10.40pm. Sign on door says they close at 11.15pm People behind the counter look at me like I'M a problem. I didn't even bother w the drive thru after that."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best Carl's Jr I have ever visited.   After about 10 mins of working out what we wanted I finally ordered. The fries were hot and fresh, my sandwich was huge. I advise anyone and everyone to check this place out, they are friendly and the food is great."}
{"text":"I don't usually like to eat fast food but today I just wanted to get some quick chicken strips or something. I thought Carl's Jr might be the place for that, but I don't really know their menu having only eaten there once before. I guess I must not have been all that impressed on my previous visit either because I can't even remember what I had. No chicken strips that I could see. This time I had some kind of Santa Fe chicken sandwich and onion rings. Yuck!! I am not a picky person and eat nearly everything but I barely choked down the dry, messy, fake tasting sandwich and couldn't even finish the onion rings. It all tasted very gross to me. The onion rings had about a pound of breading and tasted bitter like old grease. The sandwich had a big chunk of lettuce that I finally had to pull out because it kept sliding out. I didn't use the ranch because one of the first listed ingredients was high fructose corn syrup. The bun was dry and the chicken was like some kind of pressed meat product. I can't believe this is the same restaurant that is offering an all natural burger. Sorry Carl's Jr, you're going to have to do better than that!"}
{"text":"I come in here at least 3 times a week. The place is always clean and the workers always greet me with a smile. Thanks ladies!"}
{"text":"I go here at least twice a month. The food is always good. It's slightly more expensive than some other chain fast food restaurants but it's worth it. The lettuce wrap burgers are awesome. And the staff are always kind and efficient."}
{"text":"Have had decent experiences with Hardee's (CJ's sister operation in the Midwest) and had recently bought a $10 CJ gift card through charity fund raiser, so yesterday (8/1/15), my family and I attempted to use use the gift card at CJ on Chandler Blvd in Phoenix.  After waiting a long time to order (apparently drive through customers always have priority), the cashier couldn't get the card to work.  I don't know if she was incompetent or the system was broken.   I later checked online to make sure the card was still good - balance showed $10 as expected.  Between being understaffed, taking drive-through customers on a priority basis, and the fiasco with the card, we easily spent 4x as much time there as we had anticipated.  Not the definition of fast food.  Now I have to find a different CJ to burn up that gift card, and I certainly won't buy another.  Edit:  Forgot to mention, the music not only generally sucked but was way too loud, except in the kids' play area, which had a very unpleasant odor."}
{"text":"These guys suck man they gave me 2 bottom buns for my burger. I thought Carls jrs was the best now I'm having second thoughts. I'll never come to this location again."}
{"text":"Very poor first and last experience. Mine and two other customers had orders that were not correct and then forget to replace mine. Got a refund and got out after 30 minutes of wasting my time in a lengthy line up with nothing but a headache to show for it. Steer clear, could be in for a long wait until they get their systems down. Expected far better in a new frontier."}
{"text":"The new menu inside show the calories for each sandwich and side. Carl's Jr. is a little more expensive but their burgers are tastier and bigger than other fast food burger chains. I love this location because the staff is consistently inviting, friendly, and helpful. The bathroom is consistently clean."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Carl's when I'm hungry after driving back from LA. I just get off the I15 and, here we are. At that point, I'm not looking for anything super delicious or anything... I just want something in my belly to fill me up and last me a while, seeing as I have to get home to do laundry, getting stuff ready, buying groceries...  On more than one occasion, I've come here and it's been empty. That's actually the default situation here, it seems: the dining area will be about 95% empty, and there'll be a few guys manning the kitchen. That doesn't really present a problem for me, because people or not, I need to eat. But since it's always empty, I can usually walk right up to the counter and have someone take my order in 30 seconds or less: teriyaki turkey burger, hold the cheese, criss-cut fries, ranch, Sprite. As far as I'm concerned, this is the best meal in the place. Sure, the $6 burgers are great, too, but they're also about 1000 calories. (I know the Sprite, ranch, and fries aren't the best idea, but that's why I get the turkey sans cheese!)  I usually get my food out to me fairly quickly, and it's consistently pretty good. My only major gripe with them is that their bread seems to always be the worst bread ever. I don't understand it. It's bad on the turkey burgers, and it's passable on the premium burgers. Maybe it's because these guys are so liberal with their sauce that the bread absorbs it? That's my current theory.   Also, the prices here are on the higher side. I've always felt there's a scale for fast-food restaurant prices: starts at McDonald's on the low side and ends with Carl's on the higher side. The food here is better than McD's, so I guess it's ok. But just be aware of that.  As far as this location goes, it is clearly not on the best side of town. I'm not complaining about it one bit, I'm just stating that this isn't the burger joint to take your girlfriend's parents (take them to Create). It's never been a problem for me, because I roll with the homies, too. The actual restaurant is in pretty good shape, which is a plus.   All in all, I'll continue coming here when I get off the freeway. It's in the perfect spot for that, the service is quick, and the food is good. That's four stars right there."}
{"text":"Because this Carl's is the closes fast-food place to my house, it's one I go to more frequently than other fast-food places. I've gone maybe 5 times in the last month and a half during various times, so I've got a pretty good handle on it.   Usually, I come here and get the turkey burger with criss-cut fries and a drink. It is not a difficult order as I don't ask for any modifications -- just the burger and fries an drink and a side of ranch. Word. having said that, I don't think I've ever gotten a messed up order here. That's awesome bc it sucks when you get home and you're missing the cheese or something. Fail.   The service, however, is hit-or-miss here. A few times I've gone and gotten really crappy service, just like I've got and gotten really awesome service. I have yet to figure out how/why/when and all that, but there it is.   The food here is the same fast-food, Carl's quality you already know: better than McDonald's, sure, but that's like saying you're the skinniest kid at fat camp. I do like the turkey burgers, though, which is why I come here. (Although, I got regular burgers the last time and they were ok, too)."}
{"text":"I ordered the jalapeño thick burger, and there's only 4 jalapeños on it. Thankfully I picked my own jalapeños at home. But this burger is SUUPER dry. The fries weren't seasoned and only half of the Fry container was filled. I was expecting more from Carl's Jr. used to love their $6 jalapeno burger. What happened?"}
{"text":"Worst meal I experienced during my stay in Las Vegas by far! Also one if the worst meals I've had out altogether in a very long time. I would give it zero stars if it were an option. It took 45 mins and the staff were fighting because they clearly did not have there sh*t together. All the tables were filthy and our food was disgusting. Oh ya and we almost missed our flight because of it. Thanks for leaving a bad taste in our months. Literally"}
{"text":"So why would I be giving a Fast Food chain location a 5 star rating? For some reason, THIS Carl's Jr. is one in a million. Yes, there is an In-and-Out across the street but this Carl's Jr is everything In-and-Out can't be.   First of all, THEIR SHAKES!!! Carl's Jr. shakes are hand scooped, and mixed upon order unlike they're competitors across the street. The chocolate shake IS the best I've EVER had from a drive thru. Point for Carl's Jr.  Second, the hand battered chicken strips were literally hand battered, i watch the guy through the service window dip and fry. The single best chicken strips i've ever had (but they may need new sauces, tired of BBQ...but still outstanding nonetheless). Point 2 for Carl's Jr  Lastly, Hours. 24/7 on the weekends and midnight on the weekdays. Brilliant for my late night guru-ness.  Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service!! 14 minutes in the drive through!!! 1 rude girl working drive thru and the front counter. $19 for two meals!!! Then she gets nasty when we ask why it's so much. Another 3 minutes at the window!! It would be faster if I went inside and cooked it myself.   If you're in a hurry, don't go there!!!  Food was wrong BUT, they were very nice when I had to go inside to get the correct order."}
{"text":"We had to the try the new chicken tenders that keep appearing in commercials. It was ok nothing spectacular. Raising canes is better to me. If you need a quick meal, its not that bad. The service was really slow for some reason. There wasn't a lot of people inside, maybe the drive thru was busy. Its a small Carls inside a gas station."}
{"text":"Waited at the drive thru this morning and no response.  So I went inside to check.  No customers.  I asked and they were clueless.  Did not seem concerned or apology.  Left to go to BK."}
{"text":"Drove up to the drive through. Lady told me to hold on a second then proceeded to talk on the phone with her friend about plans later all while her mic was still on. When I kept asking if she was done and ready to take my order she kept saying \"hold on its important\"   No it wasn't. Get off the phone when you are working and do your job."}
{"text":"I like Carl's Jr.  I like it for breakfast, or lunch or dinner.  I think they are better at most things than McDonald's and burger king.  But mostly I like their hot biscuits and gravy for only $1 on a cold winter morning.  Makes my insides nice and toasty while satisfying the hunger pains of several hours of starvation while I sleep."}
{"text":"Went here late last night on the way home wasn't sure if it was open PLEASE ADD THAT IS OPEN 24hrs I was glad tho since I got the bacon avocado hamburger and some fried zucchinis which made my night will def return lots of stuff on the menu since it's a green burrito as well."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. Took 20 minutes to get a breakfast biscuit and a burger. Also ordered a large crosscut fry and it had about 7 fries in it. Time to chop some heads at this one."}
{"text":"I would hope that Carl's Jr would expect the same amount of customer service 24/7. However, my last visit there around 5 am was very disappointing. I work swing shift and when I got off I was craving a western cheeseburger. This location is the closest to my house. As I pull up to the drive thru, the cashier tells me he will be with me in a minute.... It's very early in the am and I am the only customer at this location at this time. I am patient so I say \"okay that's fine\". I am waiting for about 5 minutes before I get annoyed. Then I feel like I'm talking to myself as I say \"hello\" to the speaker. Finally he answers and acts like he was waiting on me the whole time. I make my order. Then I pull up to the window and smile pleasantly as this gentleman is very unfriendly to say the least. I understand that working these late hours are not fun and I was trying to make his mood a little better but he was just being rude. I didn't appreciate the service I received from Josue. Maybe it was just a bad night, but a cracked smile would have made my whole day because he is not the only one with problems."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want a charbroiled burger and this Carl's Jr. can deliver on that. The drive through is convenient and I usually go for the classic Carl's Jr. cheeseburger. It's juicy, big, and has that good charred taste to the meat. I like the sliced onions, pickles, and even the iceberg lettuce. Their fries are  prettying standard, but at least it's hot.   What I like most about this location is the customer service. They are really just polite and pleasant workers. I know it's fast food, but I think the workers care about the product and service. My food is never squished or hastily thrown into the bag. It's neatly packaged and has napkins and/or condiments if I asked for it. Another plus is that this place is always kept clean in the inside and outside. The inside has a decent modern decor too. Dining in has been a good experience as well. Overall, good job on having good workers and good standards. Will be back!"}
{"text":"So I swore off Hardee's and Carls Jr. back in 1993 after I got a job there taking orders.  Now that that's a few decades behind me and I live across the street, I figured I'd give it another whirl.    It was great.  I'm out of the loop on the whole fast food phenomenon in the country but for some reason the quality tasted way better than that of a McDonald's.  Not sure if they use actually real food here but it sure tasted like it.  I had the Western burger and onion rings and it was marvelous.  I went the next morning and got a pass for Eos Fitness because that's how full I felt after eating it but I guess that's the point of eating is to get full....right?    The one thing that was confusing, unless they were messing with me, was that it was like the fries you could get large but only a medium onion ring...or vice versa....it seemed confusing :)  Definitely a go-to in a pinch."}
{"text":"After having Carl's Jr. in the US, I was glad to finally see one here in Calgary. The Canadian experience doesn't live up.  Our first experience was in the UBER long drive through line (more than 15 min) AND They got our order completely wrong. But the line was so long, and there is no place to park so we just took it and left. (they have about 10 spots right out front the restaurant)  Went back this evening. Burgers were o.k. Cris-cut fries are o.k. too, but not nearly crispy enough. Onion Rings were overly breaded but crispy. My burger was dry, it was the western, and was supposed to be slathered in BBQ sauce - it was not. My wife had the Teriyaki burger and she quite enjoyed it.  Honestly though, for the money - you're FAR better off going to Five Guys(cheaper) or to Fat Burger (comparitive). The patties at Carl's Jr. are very processed, and taste like it. Likely they are made at a central location and then frozen and shipped in.   For the money - you should definitely get freshly made and grilled/charbroiled burgers.  I don't think I'll be going back - I'd rather spend that kind of money for a burger at Five Guys!"}
{"text":"Men's restroom smells like a sewer it's unbearable and it's been like that for 2 1/2 years management needs to do something about it. Please!!!!"}
{"text":"I been waiting in the drive thru here for almost an hour now. This Carl's Jr. sucks. Ghost town inside. They used to be rockstars here. Not anywhere. Tsk tsk."}
{"text":"When I walked to Yonge/St. Clair at lunchtime, I saw Carl's Jr. had moved into the area.  Apparently they have been there since March (I usually bring my lunch plus I haven't been in the office much this spring).  I'd never been to a Carl's Jr. (they just recently started opening up Ontario) so decided to try it.  Once you order, you sit down at a table and they bring it to you.  I ordered a Famous Star Burger without cheese, onions or lettuce , Crisscut Fries and a Diet Coke.  When I opened wrapper around my burger, it was just bun.  I turned it around and found the patty.  I know I didn't get any cheese, onions or lettuce but my burger looked nothing like the fresh fun burger in the pictures.  It was squished, greasy and the patty was cold.  It was just an okay burger.  The fries were okay.  The ketchup had a funny taste so I didn't dip.  I found the staff very friendly and helpful, though.  When you're done, they take your tray/garbage away.  I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Carls jr. Ever since i tried it in LA. This was the closest fast food in the area so i went to this one not so enthusiastically. This location is attached to the US airways Centre and can be accessed outside. They have another  Carls jr inside but it's smaller. It's bright inside. This location is a decent size,  and the prices are very affordable!   There was a covention going on when i went so there was a long line. I don't drink soft drinks so  i was about to order the chicken tenders alone which come with 5 pieces for $4.79. But the combo meal coves with fries and a super large drink for  $5 so i said what the heck I'll just order the combo.   Got my order quick, huge chicken tenders really hot. But it was kind of bland so i got the bbq sauce and honey mustard than i was good.   But what really impressed me about this place? The staff. That very day, somehow all and i mean ALL the staff working that day were all female. One of them was pregnant too. I was so impressed by their sense of urgency,  awesome quick service and team work. I've never seen anything like it. They weren't rude even if the customers were. Kudos to you ladies. I've never seen an awesomely run fast food place especially by an all female staff!  Thank you for the great service   Would recommend and come back because of the experience"}
{"text":"I've came to this Carl's Jr a couple of times and the customer service has always been very friendly, actually one of the friendliest restaurants in Vegas I've ever been to. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Poor service, poor food.  They forgot and lost my order.  Man, they need some help.  The steak burger absolutely looked less then desirable and I hate cold fries too. Lathon was my server and overworked and not responsive.  I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"They always forget something or take down the order wrong. And I tried to get a different shake because it was runny like milk and she refused. This place has gotten over on me to many times fuck this location!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here a few days ago in the early evening and both ordered the thick burger meals- firstly I must say we've normally never had a problem at this location and are usually pretty satisfied with our food but upon returning home and eating we both were almost instantly sick afterwards and this illness lasted about 24 hours for both of us and it was so god awful that I don't think I'll ever be able to stomach Carl's Jr again :-("}
{"text":"Tried the new Big Carl. Not bad, but I don't need a whole head of letuce just clumped on the damn thing. Come on Carl. Put some effort into it.  Value: Carl Preparation: Mac Taste: Carl Size: Carl"}
{"text":"Late night work order run. Went to grab some food more some coworkers and myself. Went through the drive thru which was very quick and easy. They said we would have to wait a few minutes given the amount of food and that they would have to make new fries. Fresh fries! I'll wait for that any day! We received our food order and tootled back to work. The need for a hamburger was real and being on a budget I was able to fulfill that need. Was a great menu that hit the spot!   This was also my first time to Carl's Jr., pretty impressed"}
{"text":"If I could base my rating off of my experiences with one employee named Renee this place would be a 5 star. She is friendly and courteous and works very hard. I wrote this review because of her. She deserves to be acknowledged and I hope her bosses are aware of how valuable she is.  Unfortunately the food at this location leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"Just went and spent almost $30 and waited way to long for fast food!  My order was completely messed up. Wrong food and missing what I ordered  We always go here but lately it has been terrible!   I guess it's time to change to a better location."}
{"text":"These poor bastards just can't keep it together. Went thru the DT just now. Gave my order and waited...and waited. The answer came back through the speaker \"Huh?\" Really? Repeated order and away I went. The service here is getting slower and slower. No cheese on breakfast sandwich (as ordered), cold hash browns and no napkins in the bag. Winner winner chicken dinner, I'm done here!"}
{"text":"After my initial visit to the Gasoline Alley location a few days ago I didn't intend to return so soon, but we were pressed for time and hungry, so Carl's Jr it was!   What I first noticed about this location was that it was much more modern and urban with its decor and furniture than the Red Deer location, and was close to spotless. My dining partner again chose to order the poutine thickburger, and once our food arrived he noted that there was a definite increase in quality from the other location. There was also a noticeable change in the length of time it took to serve us; both of our meals were ready in less than 5 minutes. I tried the chicken teriyaki burger and was pleasantly surprised. Pineapple, chicken, and teriyaki sauce on a whole wheat bun = yummmmmm.  Overall I am so impressed with this chain and it's definitely going to become my new go-to burger place. I never thought I would be able to rate a fast food restaurant 5/5!"}
{"text":"Our friend liked the smell so much, she asked to have half our burgers and chicken. We ordered two $5 combo meals. 1st combo) spicy chicken and a regular burger: was good and was big enough to fill one of us up. 2nd combo) chicken pieces: I was slightly disappointed it only included 5 small pieces, should have ordered the two burger combo instead."}
{"text":"Hope everybody gets their order from Robert Thomas because he made sure everything was clear and easy to order offering solid customer service and friendly attitude that assures I will come back for superior service."}
{"text":"Do not go here!  Run, run, run.  Pulled in here because it is at the end of the strip and wanted some quick eats.    Ordered 2 famous stars, a large Dr Pepper and a large Iced Tea with Lemon.  The lemon was given to me in a bag, um ok.  It was late on Saturday night, not too bad of a wait.  The drive thru gal had no voice at all, was literally a whisper.    The bag was given to us with the drinks and we drove off.  I put the lemon in the tea and took a drink and almost died.  It tasted like a rat had crawled in the iced tea machine and died.  I didn't know it was possible to get iced tea wrong.  I am sure it was the dirty machine.  I had my husband taste it and he almost choked to death.  I had him try it to reassure myself I wasn't being dramatic.    In the bag was some extra food ( 2 spicy chicken sandwiches to be exact.)  Great, you would say free food, to substitute the almost $2.00 drink we trashed.  No, no, and more no, we didn't even feed that crap to the dog!  This place needs to be shut down!!! I have never, ever said that about a place on Yelp before.   I am very shocked no one got food poisoning from the burgers."}
{"text":"From what I undetstand, this used to be a poorly performing store.  It has been turned completely turned around as the food is always fresh, the crew always friendly, and the store is always immaculate.  My girlfriend and I drive across town to go specifically to this store because of the exemplary service we receive every time.  Kudos to the management and crew for turning the store around so dramatically."}
{"text":"disclaimer: my only reason for the 3 stars is because they need to update their signage. for a store thats fairly new, i would assume their signs on the drive thru have to be up to date.  i recently moved to the blue diamond area earlier this year. when this carls jr opened, it was definitely good news! you can only eat jack in the box, in n out and mcdonalds so many times!  my boss at my internship was talking about the new chicken strips @ carls, and i HAD to try them!!!! so - we went for dinner tonight. ordered the chicken strips, chili cheese fries, criss-cut fries and a few sodas. also wanted to order their banana chocolate chip shake, but the guy said they no longer have that item. why have the sign up then?! but, he did try to sell me on a chocolate malted something or other shake.  anyway, we get home, and everything was in the bag. the chicken tenders were pretty damn good! kinda remind me of chicken crispers from chilis, but the batter wasnt as fluffy. very flavorful and juicy. chili cheese fries were ok. a little greasy and a bit too much cheese (yes, i said it. too much cheese. i love cheese, but when theres more cheese than chili thats just weird to me).  definitely will be back because its right down the street from the house. thanks carls! just...update your signage at the drive thru!"}
{"text":"So I just tried their grilled chicken burrito but I was charged for a grilled steak burrito (I didn't notice until I got home). The tomatoes tasted spoiled! I can't believe they put that in there. It was really soggy and I had to wait until 10:30 so that they could give it to me I got their at 10. Very disappointed, most likely will not go again."}
{"text":"Look, I love Carl's Jr.  Specifically their breakfast burger (without bacon) and the Carl's #1.  Both make me an extremely happy girl, and my life is better when eating here.  But, this Carl's just isn't the best that I've been to. Yes, I get the food I want, for the most part, but this one just lacks in so many ways it's almost silly. For starters, the dining area is a weird setup.  I guess it used to be a Krispy Kreme according to a previous reviewer, which explains the large, weird exposed kitchen with the matching wood floors and the double door entry with the bathrooms in the double door area versus being inside the actual restaurant.  This location seems to get a lot of riff raff, probably because it's at the end of the light rail, and located inside Christown mall.  (well, the parking lot area, at least.)  The service is somewhat slow, but not unbearable.  Food is fine, but it's the ambiance of the place that makes me go through the drive through versus eating in 99% of the time. Today I ate in because I wanted to, and didn't have time to stop at home and eat, so I dined in.  Overall, not my favorite Carl's, but it does the job.  I don't mean to sound like such a hater, but there's loads of fast food in this area, and I can't put my finger on why I'm so chronically disappointed with this Carl's. I think its a combination of the riff raff crowd, overall slow service, and the weird layout. They do have outdoor seating here, so you can eat outdoors if the weather is nice.  Oh, and the music here is SO freakin loud when I'm in there! Like, to the point where you sort of have to talk over it, or if your sitting alone, it's to the point where it's really annoying."}
{"text":"I admit, I'm a Carl's Jr fan.  They have such tasty burgers!!    Anyways, I used to frequent this location more often when I lived down here.  Open early, stay open late, with a very clean lobby area.  Can't complain!"}
{"text":"Always a treat to go to Carl's Junior when I'm out west. I think they are far better than Hardees here in the east. Great burgers and the biscuits at breakfast can't be beat. The $6 burger is my favorite and my wife raves over the jalapeno burger."}
{"text":"Michael on the grave shift (1:40am) was super nice. I was feeling kind of down and his upbeat personality on the speaker and at the window put me in such a better mood. That was just the boost I needed for my day. You guys need to hire 100 Michaels! Can't wait to come back next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"It's a rare experience when I go to a fast food restaurant.  I'm not \"anti-fast food\", I just personally don't think most of it tastes that good.  That being said, I usually really do enjoy a Carl's Jr burger.  When judging a place like Carl's Jr, it's all about expectations.    The burger at Carl's is char-broiled, differentiating them from many fast food restaurants.  Their meat patties are usually slightly bigger than most places, and the burgers usually have crisp and fresh lettuce/onion, and fresh tomato.  The sauces are simple, but effective.  For example, the Famous/Super star is my favorite burger on the menu due to the white sauce they use.  It is like a slightly tangy/acidic mayonnaise.  This sauce is boring by itself, but when combined with the other ingredients on the burger it actually has very good flavor.    The reason I give two stars is because I think this particular Carl's is not that good.  I live a stone's throw from this restaurant, and usually do not get the level of quality I will find at a Southern California Carl's.  The inconsistency is what makes me bring this place down to a two stars.  Consistency is even more important when it comes to fast food.    The positives is that it's open 24 hours, and the inside of the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"Okay, so, I may have cheated on my pescatarian diet again (sorry, animals) but I just had to make an exception for Carl's Jr. The hype was too major. I'll chalk it up to mob mentality.   As for Carl's Jr., I was satisfied with the experience. Was it worth it to break my diet? Nope. I mean I haven't had a burger in a 8 months so maybe I was building it up in my head. The burger itself was massive(1/3 lb) and you could make it 'massive-er' by ordering the 1/2 lb. I got the Guacamole Bacon Thickburger, I mean if I was cheating on my diet, I might as well eat all the farm animals I can, right? right? lol. I would describe it as an equivalent to a pub burger. It is nice to have pub-style burgers available as fast food though. And the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice too, like an upscale version or renovated fast food/diner place--which seems like the new trend for FF restaurants.   I also upgraded my fries to the chilli fries, which I really did not like it was quite salty and the spices were odd. It almost tasted like there was curry powder in it.   If you're coming here prepare to wait, it must be the hype surrounding the opening. And the drive-thru has major delays! Like spilling onto the streets-delays.   I probably wouldn't  go back to Carl's Jr. because of my dietary restrictions (unless I give in again, which could happen) but if you're a meatasaurus this is your jam!!"}
{"text":"delicious lettuce wrapped thick burger and the service was super nice and accommodating to me with bringing my food to my table and filling my drink for me (I have a broken arm so that was really helpful) thanks for the great burger Carl's Jr. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This location is close to my work.  I've always received fast friendly service.  I prefer a lot of their menu items over similar ones at other fast food restaurants (ex. breakfast biscuit sandwiches, pretzel sandwiches, fried zucchini and burgers).  The restrooms and dining area have always been clean when I've been there."}
{"text":"I will preface this review to say it was Christmas day and Carl's Jr was the only thing open. I had no other options and I had never been to this particular fast food chain.  The location is quite clean. That is why it got 2 stars.  The food is atrocious; the people are ambivalent and the fries are greasy. I will save you all from my usual banter and witty remarks.   Dont go here unless you invest in pepto bismal!"}
{"text":"As for a chain restaurant this one is superior as for the service, cleanliness and food are top notch. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Got the Carl's Star Burger Fries & drink combo. Burger was pretty tasty- however the French fries were undercooked a raw. Yuck!  Disappointed in the over all experience at this location. Corporately, I really like the fact that they support our military & offer specials / discounts for them.  Overall-Why don't we see this more?!"}
{"text":"They have items on the menu that are \"no longer available\" and even though the company website lists the Nellis location as a Green Burrito, you can't order anything off the Green Burrito menu after 10pm????  Carl's Jr is Las Vegas just seems to be not worth it over all, this isn't the only location with shady practices and less than okay food."}
{"text":"Bad reviews about this place are ridiculous. This is the only fast food place that has ever come to my table after I received my food to ask me if I needed anything else. Service was very friendly and top notch. Food was quick and delicious.  Place was clean. What more could you want? Would rate over 5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"For a fast food burger joint it's decent stuff. Their breakfast menu is very good overall, with my favorites being the biscuit & gravy as well as the breakfast burger. Overall it's good when you need fast food or quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Wow went thru and was amazed soda machines down .ok not an issue have some tea and move on placed order received food and went home. Now get how tenders are as burnt as can be order sweet tea nope got unsweeten. Well call up let them know but no Manger on duty not good. Biggest thing is no one was there what was the issue in getting the food cooked right . they will replace but we all know that's not really the point. disappointed quality and service"}
{"text":"The french fries are so fresh and hot but burn your mouth off. As long as they keep selling fried zucchini and monsters I'm going to keep coming back I love this place."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are thick and just right..the turkey burger is to die for and I don't mind the wait while they make my burger fresh..worth the wait and $$"}
{"text":"This location is decent. I've noticed the tables are always clean which is not the norm for a lot of fast food places. If you go through the drive thru they are not super fast so expect to wait a few minutes and that's even if you're the only car there.  The food is fine.  I'm a sucker for a Bacon Western Cheesburger and I love their fried zuchinni!  YUM!  Their milkshakes are pretty darn good too.  They have the standard chocolate, strawberry and vanilla but every month they have a special shake.  I had a Banana Cream Pie shake that was sooooo yummy!  I highly recommend it!  Thanks Carl's Jr."}
{"text":"I haven't tried much on their menu but their chicken guacamole burger is good, and so is their turkey burger.    However... they advertise hand breaded chicken fingers and WOW they are REALLLLLY GOOD.  The bad part is they are over priced for em though."}
{"text":"This must be the worst fast food restaurant in the country!  So bad that I paid for my food and wound up driving off without it. The drive through girl took my money, stood around for a few minutes then disappeared. This left one poor guy running back and forth from the kitchen to the counter trying to run the whole restaurant by himself. I sat there in the drive through watching this insanity for about 15 minutes and realized there was no way I'm eating anything that comes out of this place! I didn't see the point in wasting even more time trying to get my money back. It didn't look like anyone was in charge anyway.  Lots of places to eat out there,  I'll get by just fine without this one."}
{"text":"Recently went in to Carl's, got a $6 burger fries, shake. Excellent food, but what stood our was an employee , I think Mara, she was excellent at her job, made us feel welcome and cared about her job. If I ran a restraunt, I would recruit her and have her work for us."}
{"text":"I come here bout 3x's a mo. & I just can't do it anymore. The cook that works on late shift SUCKS. The manager is sweet. I always get chicken Santa Fe & I have to request fresh lettuce. The chicken is rubber, the bread hard on the outside. Tonight I received it the same way however my cheese wasn't even melted.  IM DONE!  I go after work arrive always bout 1130pm. I'm sooooo DONE!!! Let me know when u get a new night cook!  Yes I do know food I've been in the industry 15 yrs."}
{"text":"Horrible service !!! Would never go back ! Went through the drive thru and No one responded on the speaker I sat there for 10 minutes and still nothing ! There was even a car in front of me and behind me ! I would never return r this location ! I hesitated going before I pulled in and I should've stuck with my first mind !"}
{"text":"I wuzn't gonna bother about a Carl's Jr review cos I went there in October in the am (after 6) and got a decent bkfast.    But I saw a tv ad for Jack in the Box, which I used to LOVE in Denver even though everyone HATED it (fuckit they're not my friends anymore) explaining they serve breakfast All Day Long.    So I pull up to this joint 4 am cos I got an early flight, and want some breakfast sandwiches to take wif me to the aeroport.  \"NO we don't serve breakfast til 6 am!!!\"  Even for drunk people at 3 in the morning (I'm not drunk but if you're open 24 HOURS and bars close at 2am, maybe people WANT a sourdough sausage egg monstrocity).    I ended up going to a Circle K by the airport getting some \"tacito\" things, Carls' Jr was a real bring down."}
{"text":"First time to this one. Love the Low-Carb Burger. Fast and Friendly service. This is the only one that I have been to that has asked if I would like to have Jalapenos with my burger. Very Tasty & I will be back! Drive thru is kind of trippy, as it looks like it starts at the next building over."}
{"text":"Todays review is about Bisquits Breakfasts.  Carl's bisquits are better than McDonalds, Burger King, and Jack in the box. They are truly outstanding. I was not impressd with Jacks at all..  Mcdonalds is #2, and Burger king slighly behind them. Service was good at the cheyanne,Rainbow location. Person was very friendls, and courteous."}
{"text":"I past threw this Carl's Jr. Daily and at times I would stop by for some lunch. Omg the jalapeño poppers are so tasty. Definitely pretty much what I order lol. On July 17th I stopped to get some jalapeños poppers. I was waiting for a long period of time thru the drive thru. The customer in front of me ordered a lot of food. Roxanna was th employee who was directing drive thru. So as I get home and start to eat my jalapeño poppers I notice that the cheese and peppers were missing on 4 poppers nothing inside them. So I called and spoke to Roxana express how disappointed it was to get jalapeño poppers with no cheese and jalapeños. She apologized and took my name down. She told me to go back to restaurant so they can make another order for me. I was very pleased with her customer service. So here I am yelping away the feedback."}
{"text":"Was in there this evening for a quick bite. Normally I go through the drive-through. Tonight I was with a friend and we ate there. Big mistake. Horribly dirty everywhere throughout the dining room. Trash cans were full, The floors were filthy and many of the tables were dirty and sticky."}
{"text":"This Carl's Jr. franchise is one of the better ones.  First of all, product is everything and Carl's Jr. has a reputation for making a great burger.  And the success of any franchise depends on how the crew executes.  The crew here on Northern have never failed me.  Their burgers are always fresh and their fries are delivered hot, and if you can do that you're well on your way to harvesting good customers.  And whose morning is not made better by one of Carl's Jr biscuit sandwiches?  Carl's makes the best biscuit in town...no other fast food chain even comes close.  And finally, being a military retiree, and on a fixed pension, I'm grateful that Carl's Jr gives me a ten percent discount.  Friendly crew, good food...who can ask for more?"}
{"text":"For fast food, this is some pretty good stuff!  I had some chicken fingers and a chicken cesar wrap. it was good for $4."}
{"text":"the worst Carl's jr. super long waits, never have salads, and when they do they're brown and half filled. really bad... always has been though."}
{"text":"This is right around the corner from my store so I go here often to get the guys something to eat. Lately the drive thru has been running slow. This morning was the end! Pulled in and ordered, sometimes their screen isn't working and there isn't a display; this was one of those times but the girl repeated my order back correctly. Pulled forward to wait......and wait.....and wait. 22 minutes later the car at the window pulled away. When I got to the girl held out her had for money; no apology, no explanation or anything. I work in a service industry too but I would never NOT acknowledge that the people in line had been waiting an excessively long time. I asked what had been wrong as I paid and was told the car at the window had changed their order. So why weren't they parked while it was prepared and then brought out to them so the rest of us could get going?  To  add insult to the whole thing I was then handed the wrong order. And told it would be a couple minutes to get what I had ordered together. I asked for the manager, told her I wanted a refund. She gave me the pat lame answers that tell me she really isn't management material. \"There was nothing she could do about the wait.\" Got news for you sweetheart, as management it is your job to solve problems, stave off disasters and think outside the box. I know, I started in a fast food place and now I own my own business (different industry but still its service oriented). I am truly disappointed in how this was handled. There are a thousand fast food places, now I wont mind driving around the corner because I wont be going back to Carls JR."}
{"text":"I don't care for fast food but their orange cream shake is really good!  This store needs to get there speaker fixed though. I literally screamed my order in three times until I finally just drive around. All they said was \"sorry, it's been broke awhile\"."}
{"text":"It's fast food so can't say much that others haven't said.  Nothing great, nothing horrible.  Took food to my daughter and grandson for lunch.  I prefer healthier options but it is on the way to her house. She said the hamburger wasn't that great.  My fried zucchini was ok. Even with four cars in front service was fast and the customer service was ok."}
{"text":"What can I say?  The Jim Bean Bourbon Burger was calling me.  With a nice mix of the sweet   bourbon sauce in every bite, crunchy onion straws, and pepper jack made great toppings. Yes bacon, lettuce and tomato also join the meal, with such a fine mix of ingredients this burger did not disappoint.  A mighty fine burger from a fast food place.  With all that in it you will instantly go into a food coma once you finish it.  I needed a 1000 calorie burger so this fit the bill perfectly.  Without a meal all day Carl's Jr is my Kryptonite at times.   If  you are looking for a satisfying meal I never go wrong at Carl's.  Plus this particular location is generally appointed with friendly staff and well cooked fries.  Yes I even had fries, might as well get a meal if your going to cheat on your diet.  Go all the way and enjoy a fast food treat, check this place out when you get hungry."}
{"text":"Finally a Carls Jr in Surprise.  I have only been waiting like 7 years!!!  I was commuting to Litchfield Park to get my Western bacon cheeseburger or famous star fix..... What is even more interesting is the fact that the new Carls Jr in surprise has all new staff and they must have been trained to be polite and courteous???  Not that often that I stop at fast food and get super polite and courteous from the teenager employees.   When I think Carls Jr, I think big sloppy burgers, forget the diet and dig in.  Plus who can pass up a $2 bacon western burger?  Bacon, fried onion rings, barbecue sauce, cheese, and meat?  Can't really ask for more?  I workout out to eat stuff like this :P Enjoy it.....  Off of Grand in the Lowes parking lot, tricky parking lot location, but worth navigating the yellow bumps and arrows to get to Burger heaven.  Yes Carls Jr makes the best fast food burgers :)"}
{"text":"So, this place is open to 3am actually. But it's mediocre ascertain it is a fast food chain. Their star burger is the charbroiled burger... But honestly the burger party is so thin. Maybe I'm just used to eating at Burger Priest or Toma burger.  Can't complain much of you set your standards that it's a fast food burger. But paying $7 for a burger, I'd probably be able to get a slightly better burger somewhere else. The question is, how would this compare to Burger King. They're both charbroiled burger style."}
{"text":"Don't go to this one, I'm warning you. I waited 30 minutes at the drive thru, and they got my order wrong.  Once you're boxed in, you can't leave, you'll have to wait. Never again!"}
{"text":"We eat here too often lol! The service has always been great here and they almost never mess up the order, even when they're super busy. Last night, they were very, very busy. I ordered a burger with no tomatoes and onions because my daughter is allergic to tomatoes and doesn't like onions. They goofed, and when we got home, it had both on it. They also forgot something. I ALWAYS check my orders, but for some reason I didn't check it last night and got all the way home before realizing the mistakes. We ate what we had, then I called to talk to the manager on duty, Lisa. She was apologetic and asked me when I'd be coming back in so she could leave a note for the manager who would be in. I went in this morning and talked to Fe. She was awesome. She apologized again, got me the replacement items and even gave me a complimentary drink while I waited.  The most important part of customer service, to me, is how an error is corrected when one is made. Lisa and Fe handled the situation perfectly. Thank you, ladies. I will definitely continue going to this location. :)"}
{"text":"I live just around the corner and patronize here frequently. The food & customer service is very good during the weekdays but is horrible on the weekends! It's just slopped together and the service is even worse! John shouldn't be allowed to clean the floors much less at the drive thru window... He can't handle taking orders or getting them correct & forgets everything. No napkins or utensils & any condiments. Not even a greeting or thank you!  I know it's just fast food and not brain surgery but... Wow!"}
{"text":"This place has gotten a lot better in terms of consistent quality and good service. At least in my experience and each visit so far.   I am a fan of their burger menu. Ever since my first huge six dollar burger, I've been sold. Especially since I  am from Canada.   I love their breakfast menu. Very affordable and tasty. The hashbrowns are awesome when they are fresh. Hot and crispy! Their zucchini is a must try item. Their fries are average. They need to up the ante on this one, fries are a staple and can make or break you. There are few places where you find yourself craving for their fries.   I was especially excited about their Breakfast Burger! Beautiful concept! And it is delicious. Needed a bit of ketchup to balance the flavors.   This location is my favorite."}
{"text":"It was clean, they got my order right however the food didn't taste as good as I remembered. Lastly they had two large LCD TV's going it was quite loud, when I asked a employee if they could turn down the TV she said they don't have that control and walked away. If I want to watch TV I'll stay home and watch what I want to not some crap they feed us to watch. Take the TV's out of fast food and restaurants."}
{"text":"Saw a television ad the night before for a Carls Jr. Jim Beam Bourbon burger . . . and boy did that look good . . . so today for lunch we headed out to try one.  Very BIG dissappointment . . . the burger was dry, the bacon was burnt, and the sauce . . . where was it . . . not on my burger.  I was truly looking forward to one juicy messy burger that oozed and dripped goodness all over . . . and this was not the the burger for that.  To finish out the order . . . I had onion rings . . . nice and crispy, but not real hot / warm . . . and a coke . . . which was kinda on the flat side.  Not my idea of a good burger joint for lunch."}
{"text":"Wanted the Teriyaki Burger. The guy at the register informed me they were out of pineapple and asked if that was okay. Nope! He asked if it was really that good because he hasn't tried it but everyone was getting upset about the pineapple. I wasn't upset, but the pineapple does complete the teriyaki burger. So I went with my usual Western Bacon Cheeseburger combo with the new Fresh Baked bun. I might add the place smelled like a bakery, which was pretty awesome. When our food came out, my burger was on the regular sesame seed bun. Just as my b/f started to get up to take it back, the cashier brought over the correct one. So at least he remedied the error quickly. And the Fresh Baked bun was great. But I still have to wonder why these fast food workers think they deserve $15 an hour..."}
{"text":"Ordered the Teriyaki Burger combo with no lettuce, tomato, or mayo. Waited a while for our food and they brought it out to our table. When I unwrapped my sandwich, it had everything on it that I didn't want. So I had to take it back up to the counter and wait for someone to acknowledge me so I could tell them it was wrong. Had to wait awhile longer to get my new sandwich. Ate fries while I waited. They were ok, not super fresh. The burger came out as I asked, however there were onions on it which I was not sure about when I ordered, but those were easy to pull off. The burger was quite tasty with the pineapple and teriyaki sauce. Ran out of napkins at our table and had to steal some from another table. Overall, could have been better."}
{"text":"I'm just curious to know if it's true that the chicken tenders are really frozen, or if the effort just didn't want to be made to make them this late in the evening.   If you show your full menu, then that should be disclosed that your full menu is not served during specific hours."}
{"text":"I don't think I've reviewed a fast food place but this place deserves it. The burgers are always cooked perfectly, juicy and tasty. The staff is always asking if I need anything and all of them are top notch. If you're looking for fast food in this area give this Carl's a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had just went through the drive-thru and waited a good while to get to the window. I get home to indulge in my burger. I see no bacon in my burger that I ordered and paid for! I go to call and all the numbers listed online are disconnected, beside the 844 number and email listed in the receipt."}
{"text":"Seriously this Drew kid that others have posted about...the worst! Couldn't get the order right to save his life. Had to ask him if I was on Candid Camera (he had never heard of it) after the 20th attempt. I seriously think he must be doing it on purpose...no one is THAT bad."}
{"text":"I feel silly giving a five star review to a fast food place but the service here was the best I've had at a fast food restaurant! Props to the lady working the front today, 11/12/13 4:30pm. Very helpful and sweet. The food was fresh and very tasty too. Two thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"Usually don't eat at fast food places except McDonald's because I like their any likes breakfast so I am surprised by this Carl's Jr. It has great hamburgers and since I don't care for fries I was happy they very good fried zucchini. Service also great"}
{"text":"This location is amazing. Good food and the most friendly staff of anywhere I have ever been. They make you feel very welcome. Service is excellent and always with a smile. Other Carl's could learn a lot from this location. Give it a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Nasty dirty badly needs to be remodeled restaurant. Lots of dirty tables, old paint chipping, bathrooms filthy and the whole location needs to be sanitized. Workers here barely know English-language. I didn't order once I saw the establishment and dealt with the rudeness. I asked for a refund and left. Don't come here unless you want to catch food poisoning."}
{"text":"I paid a visit at this location and saw that they had a 5 dollar box. I was surprised how good these tiny charbroiled sliders were. I absolutely liked them and the meal was well portioned out. It also came with some fries, a dried out cookie, and a medium drink. Not a bad deal and a quick lunch."}
{"text":"What a disaster today.  I have eaten here occasionally over the years and all is as expected.  However today, what a fiasco with one mistake after another.  They first gave my meal tray to another customer and I received theirs.  I attempted to get the hostess attention but she continued on her way.  I walked around trying to find my meal and the other patron had opened my meal before realizing it was wrong.  He accepted his meal from me and I suggested we both have our meals re-cooked to assure piece of mind with no tampering.  He declined but I did bring it to the staffs attention.  They remade my meal but here is problem two, I paid for the Six Dollar burger and what I received was a regular size burger with no apologies or willingness to correct my order again.   As said, Ive been here over the years and today's service was pretty dismal without satisfaction or apology.  I won't be back, simple mistake they failed to correct....very poor customer service!!  You gotta be kidding!!"}
{"text":"Well yet another place I won't go into anymore, walked into the bathroom as a cook was leaving it, not only did she not flush the toilet she did not wash her hands either, so gross"}
{"text":"I was happy to hear about Carl's Jr. coming to Calgary.  Calgary's restaurant scene is livening up and I think there is an excess of trendy-hip restaurants that price their food to cater for six-figure incomes.  We need more places that hold value and quality at the same regard.  I believe this location of Carl's Jr. does just that.  We decided to go on Boxing Day and the evening dinner rush wasn't that bad.  As soon as we walked in we were asked if we wanted to order.  Being it was my first time at a Carl's Jr. and I wasn't familiar with the menu it would have been nice to have someone greet me and help me with my choices.  I don't like taking up the order taker's time and holding up a line when I'm deliberating what I want.  In fact, there were two other couples hanging out reading the menu before deciding what to order and they asked if we wanted to order before them.  It was good to see Will walk around and chatting with people who have ordered to ensure people were happy, perhaps he could have also helped some first timers with their orders. Kudos for him to be active on Yelp to help improve as well!  The food quality was there.  The burger patties had enough flavorful and were lean.  The fries   were a bit on the salty side but tasted good and were fresh.  My wife and I ordered a combo each and our bill came out to about $25.  Not too bad for a full meal.  I did have a concern about how the bill was itemized.  Adding a combo was a set price but the bill looked like fries and a drink were added at full price. It's a bit misleading thinking that we paid more.  However, we talked to the cashier who directed me to a supervisor.  He explained that the price of the burger went down to compensate for the full price fries and drink.  Not a big deal but it could be confusing to some first timers.  4-stars for now but I'm hoping they get to 5-stars.  I'll definitely go back to try a different burger and see if I can get an equally good experience (if not better)!"}
{"text":"Don't normally rate fast food places, however this deserves a rating for their Biscut, egg, sausage, cheese breakfast sandwich, it is truly a meal and very fresh and tasty, Good bye Egg McMuffin as their is no comparison! and a better price to boot!"}
{"text":"Worst carls jr I've ever been to! The restrooms are disgusting, the place has a weird funky smell as soon as you walk in and the food is horrible! My fries were all soggy and oily! Definitely Never comming here again!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is extremely slow... My breakfast order took 10 minutes. Nothing fast about this fast-food joint."}
{"text":"I love Carl's Jr. I am a burger lover, and well, when you have tried as many burgers as I have, you know when it's going to be good with the first bite and their six dollar burgers are consistently good every time!   Since I loved the burgers so much I decided to try other items on their menu and I have a few favorites there too! What is especially good about their menu is that it allow me to go low carb if I am watching them (seems it's always a struggle) and the breakfast bowl is great for keeping me satisfied, flavored just right and is most certainly on the low carb menu! So most mornings, I'll be stopping in for the low carb bowl and a large Diet Dr. Pepper!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads, and breakfast items.  Can enjoy the $6 dollar burger either with bun or low carb style.  One of my favorite burgers!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to a Carls Jr in Canada. I asked what was on the teriyaki chicken burger. I was told and I asked for a few items to be taken off and ordered a combo. I got my food quickly and took it back to my hotel room.  They never mentioned tomatoes so I was unpleasantly surprised to find tomatoes on it. The chicken was nicely cooked and I loved the pineapple. The french fries were not that good. On another visit I tried the waffle cut fries which are much better.   I would eat here again but remove the tomatoes and skip the fries or get the waffle cut ones."}
{"text":"I'm not really a 'fan' of any fast food place but my kid was starving and this was the most readily available option. I was thankfully surprised. The service was fast and incredibly attentive through our entire time in the restaurant. A nice young man checked on us shortly after getting our food and made sure that we had everything we needed.   Not really knowing what to order as I wasn't familiar with their menu, I got just a basic burger. It was quite good and the price was right. My son had chicken 'stars' (nuggets) and fries. The fries left plenty to be desired but all in all, he was really happy."}
{"text":"Full service Carl's Jr in the airport?!  Yes please!  I had been on the lookout so I could try the new baby back rib burger.  I was happy to find one in the airport!  It is full service, so you don't have to worry about anything missing.  You can get your specialty burger and your fried zucchini.  There was a longer line, but the orders were handled pretty quickly.  Everything else was pretty much as you'd expect.  If you need to leave to go to the remote terminal though, be advised that you can't come back unless you go all the way back around through security."}
{"text":"Great place for burgers and waffle fries. Excellent real milkshakes, super clean,  staff were friend and efficient"}
{"text":"This place has terrible customer service. They make your food sloppy and make you want your money make. The fries are soggy and super brown change the oil."}
{"text":"Ordered a hamburger and onion rings on Saturday...hadn't eaten all day. Sunday became violently ill...Monday went to the ER and it is now Wednesday and am still suffering from it. I'll never be back!"}
{"text":"I had brought my kids to eat here before the suns game and the soda was flat .Every single dispenser was flat I tried coke , sprite, Dr.pepper , Hi C, and fanta . I had broufht it the the cashiers attention after another customer has said somethibg out loud. The cashier said she would go back and check it but never left the counter , so I got up again to address it with the manager . The manager Erick walked around with a cup and tasted the soda and said \" I dont tast nothing wrong with it \" then proceeded to go back and work . By this time there is a lobby full of people saying the soda tasted like sprits water with no flavor . I asked to speak to the manager and Erick stated that he was the manager and if I didnt like the soda that he could not refund me because I was getting the $5.00 special meal deal and technically the soda is free . I then asked for all my money to be refunded because the food was cold and i just wanted something to drink . Erick really doesnt understand customer service . All I wanted was a soda ."}
{"text":"This location is definitely the biggest to open in the city yet. I believe this is the former location of the Blind Beggar before they moved down the street.  They were well staffed and we pumping through the people very quickly when I went through. The food was hot and fresh as usual. I gave the promotional California burger a try. It's basically C Jr's version of an In 'N Out burger. It's a good sub since we don't have In 'n Out here, but doesn't live up to the actual thing."}
{"text":"A good experience on my visit a couple of weeks ago. I went first thing in the morning so I didn't experience the long wait times like others have complained about. I went through the drive-thru which was quick and the lady working was very friendly and polite.   I usually get the same thing and the quality was on par compared to my visits to restaurants in BC and the US.  No complaints here."}
{"text":"They gave me a packet of coupons to eat for free for a \"year\" pretty much a burger for a week. Place is open 24 hrs and so is the inside. The employees are nice and friendly. The only complain I have is they take forever in the drive thru but other then that its cool to sit and eat."}
{"text":"auf unser flug wartend, haben wir uns hier ein burger bestellt. die burger sind relativ günstig und so waren wir auf die größe gespannt. überraschenderweise waren die burger gut groß und waren reichlich belegt. sie waren frisch und sehr saftig. preis/leistung ist sehr gut und die burger definitiv viel besser als von mcd."}
{"text":"One of the worst Carls I have ever been to. Tried them twice, both times the gal behind the counter was extremely rude and bossy. Food is burnt and dry (burgers & fries). Came by once at 9:15pm and they had closed early (supposed to be open inside til 10pm) went around through the drive thru and the person working DT is hanging out the window smoking a cigarette and they were rude also when they actually has to work. Complained to their corporate management to no avail. Wont be back."}
{"text":"I allowed my friends to talk me into making a Carl's Jr. run.  It was a mistake for sure.  I try and stay away from fast food as much as possible.  But, since I have a full house of drunks the last thing I want is for them to start cooking.  So, a buddy and I took everyone's orders and hit the drive thru.  I must admit, that while we were waiting in line, everything started to sound good.  Sometimes a late night burger is a perfect way to end a night.  We got there just a little before 11 pm and made our order.  It took a while for them to bring our order to the window.  We made the drive home and everyone jumped me as I walked in the door, like a pack of hyenas thinning out a herd of antelope.  The burgers were okay but I ended up paying for it a little later on."}
{"text":"Was kind of surprised about this low rating.... I come here at least once a week..... service may be slightly slow, but the food has always been pretty good..... I really enjoy the breakfast biscuit sandwiches, but they have decent burgers as well. Along with the fact that I usually have some sort of coupon in my mailbox for here makes it pretty convenient. The price could be better, but it is not outrageous. Roughly $5-6 for a burger and soda would be .85 after tax."}
{"text":"I have been to this Carl's Jr a few times. As far as food quality goes: they do great. As far as service goes, it depends. If you are there before or after a game, chances are you will not get that great of service. Just being honest here, it will take a while to get your food, and it may be incorrect. However, if you go when there isn't a game chances are you'll get your food fairly quickly and accurately. That being said, it gets an average rating. Honestly, if you're trying to catch a bite to eat downtown before or after a game, there are several places, and if you do choose Carl's Jr. then keep in mind that everybody else decided they wanted to go there too. There is a Jack in the Box, a Taco Bell, another Carl's Jr, and a Burger King all within a 10 minute drive of here."}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru no matter when I've come thru. Particularly at night or early morning....not sure why it takes so long but it's always slow whether I'm the first in a line or behind a car or two. The food has been pretty good every visit when I've been here.....just wish they would speed up the drive thru as many of the other nearby are faster and easier to get through. Order size for me is one burger so not like it's a huge order"}
{"text":"Failure.     Biscuits not cooked through. Woman's restroom filthy.  Not up to standards."}
{"text":"They actually give treats for dogs in the drive thru! That just makes me so happy lol"}
{"text":"Well, I guess Carl's Jr is running a special on a $5 meal box.   More like cheap Box, the cookie that came with it was no bigger than a quarter."}
{"text":"Great, to finally have one in Calgary!!!! Food was great, service was quick even though the place was packed.  I highly recommend everyone to try it!"}
{"text":"Time for Another One-Year Boycott. I recently gave them another try and what do you know! They got my order right!  Not so tonight. Either their workers are deaf or they just don't care. Maybe both. Either way I won't be back for at least a year. Good luck staying in business with this kind of help, shmucks."}
{"text":"Starving after our flight here, this hit the spot!  Burger was great, couldn't eat it fast enough...  Difficult to understand the lady in drive thru... took a good 5 minutes to get through what we wanted to order but otherwise it was fine."}
{"text":"Honestly i wanna give one star place is under staffed it's 8:30 pm the 11th and 2 girls are working no one else buzzers going for many many minutes the girl that took my order was handling mine scooping fries and oninrings grabbing the actual food and all with the same glove she was sweet but this is now the last time i come here i only use this place as a emergency back up when I'm crazy busy and want a ok burger been a few time sin the past recently and the drive thru is always backed up 3-6 cars deep and no one in the store.... management needs to train employees better and likely need to  be replaced inside of store was a bit dirty... nothing to horrible the girls nice attitude is the only reason you guys got 2 stars i was a employee at the company in 99 in Oregon and it's sad to see this place ran horrible. I'll have to just go to farmers boys across the road but that place sucks as well customer service just has got horrible in Vegas in general. Sorry for lack of punctuation in a hurry..."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever at a fast food restaurant  first I called ask for directions person that answered didn't know then when I i just finished. Work for 55 people  customer service and my girlfriend wanted me to stop to pick something up that would be easy But the same person a man was the person  who was at the drive thru  Ordered-a turkey burger which he informed they don't have anymore ok that I understand  I then ask for a grilled chicken to keep it healthy  he put down a bbq chicken I said no that he said all chicken has bbq on menu I questioned him so the chicken club  is bbq he said yes  but it took him 2 minutes to answer now I asked for the manager no response   I pulled up he was standing here like I was ok o called my gf  who has been sick and waiting to eat something with me This guy at 11pm on Tuesday the 27th ruined my day me and my girlfriend night. If u are going to hire somebody please teach them hod to answer. Questions when asked t would be embarrassed if I owned this location I have lots of people that live in by you  they will All hear about this  One employee. By the way he should be fired for lack of customer service and knowledge has made me vnever want to go to Carl's Jr. sgain"}
{"text":"I like Carl's Jr food in general, but this location doesn't cook to order. Rather they hold beef patties, chicken, buns and probably other stuff in a steamer and \"assemble to order\" like McDonalds does. This makes a big difference in the quality and taste of their food to the negative. I very much like their other location on the corner of Litchfield Road and McDowell though. They cook to order....."}
{"text":"Here at the drive thru... we have been waiting for 20 minutes to take our order no explanation as to what is going on. Not sure if they are understaffed or what but this is the time everyone gets out of work. There is only 2 cars ahead of me in the line and they have not been helped. The wait now is about 30 minutes and no way to get out of the line! I will be speaking to a manager."}
{"text":"It's hard to write a review of fast food...it all pretty much tastes the same.  So, I am not going to write a review of the food that I threw away...instead, I will write a review of the guy working the counter...He was simply great.   He had suggestions, he had a smile, he was articulate and he remembered my name when handing me my food.   Good job brother!"}
{"text":"This location is really close to home and I like to stop in about once a week in the morning and get an order if biscuits and gravy and a coffee. Sometimes the gravy is awesome with pieces of sausage and a really good biscuit, but more recently the gravy is awful. It is often too thick, but this morning there were giant lumps in it and no sausage. The biscuit was also hard and undercooked. Here's a thought-if it's not ready don't serve it. I would rather be told it's not ready then sent on my way with terrible food. Another peeve-I always order a large coffee and somehow it always comes in a different size cup. I know it's a fast food joint, but a little consistency would be nice."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. Great food and good a/c. What else does anyone need during lunch?"}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. I always used to go eat at this location because it was near my home. However, whenever I purchased something there I always had something to complain about. Most of the workers there are rude. Half the time my order is wrong and the food quality is horrid. I love Carl's Jr but this location tarnishes the brand. Stay away!"}
{"text":"The amount of time it takes for the workers just to take your order in the drive thru is insane. I made the lazy mistake of coming here because I didn't want to get out of my car and go somewhere where a single diet soda is not $2.80, and I ended up waiting behind two cars for nearly 15 minutes. It was 2:45 pm, so I can't even understand how it took that long when it wasn't a lunch or dinner rush. My mistake for coming."}
{"text":"Worst Carl's Junior food experience ever. Fries were so cold and soggy, chicken club sandwich was chewy, cold and tasted a bit odd. I had to remove the lettuce because it was wilted and lifeless and disgusting.   Used to enjoy the food here, won't be coming back.   It's fast food, is it that hard?"}
{"text":"*    * Once you walk in, the floor seems kind of sticky. Like someone spilled soda on the floor and used that to clean it. The workers don't really have that welcoming presence that you would normally find at a normal restaurant.   * With the 4 for 4 deal, you get a spicy chicken sandwich and cheeseburger with fries (& a drink). The burgers, at first look, looked so flat. Like there was nothing in there but a patty and cheese. First bite into the cheeseburger and my mouth felt like a Sahara desert. The patty was dry. Like I practically drowned it in ketchup so my mouth had moisture. The spicy chicken sandwich wasn't that bad but it wasn't even spicy. They might as well have called it a chicken sandwich. The fries were good though. Tasted like McDonalds fries (which is good because those are my favorite).   * Would I come here again? I highly doubt. The burgers weren't impressive, as so the facility.   * Rate: 4/10 * $"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of fast food, so I usually don't rate higher than 2 stars for fast food places. I know I say I'm not a big fan of fast food places, but I am a big fan of their bacon western cheeseburgers (which you can't find at any other fast food place). Anyways quality of food here isn't all that great (especially comparing to in-n-out burger), and I can easily knock down this place to 2 stars, but heck where else can I get my bacon western cheeseburgers? They sure don't sell e'm at In-N-Out. If In-N-Out did sell these type of burgers, Carl's Jr. wouldn't even exist in my world. You better believe that I this rating is just simply for that burger, everything else can kiss my a** goodbye, because the quality of food sucks here, just like I stated above.  Bacon Western Cheese Burgers FTW."}
{"text":"No sign of the awesome manager that was working before.  Now two weeks in a row the same drive through lady has screwed up my order."}
{"text":"Came here after EDC at 530am and they weren't selling breakfast yet. They also didn't let me order chicken tenders cuz they don't serve them til 11am. And I found a metal screw in my fries...yeah a metal screw."}
{"text":"I am surprised that this place has no reviews.  I really try to not eat fast food.  But call me crazy, I like to think that having a turkey burger on your menu makes it semi-healthy.  And I LOVE turkey burgers.  Yum.  I also like the fried zucchini here, it's a good change from the usual drive thru stuff.  The service has always been friendly.  However, I do think they are one of the more overpriced fast food places."}
{"text":"Only been here once so far and I LOVED the taste of their burgers. The store was super busy even after 3 months of being open, next time I'll go through the drive thru for hopefully quicker service. Other then that the food was fantastic"}
{"text":"They never ask you if you want a doggie treat and when you do ask they never have them. Well then take your sign off the window and stop misleading me.  You've never asked once if my canine companions have wanted a treat and when I do ask you're out.  Kudos the food is always misshapen because they love mixing things up in your order but my darn kid just has to have this western burger.  I dislike I wanted to go to Bachi but it's Wednesday and it's her choice on where we eat.  The people are always nice though so that is always good but dang it stop saying you have dog treats when you never or rarely do btw I've been in this drive through waiting for my food for a total of 8 minutes now.  Is this usual? Also the chick who is manager has been on the phone for a vey long time"}
{"text":"This has got to be the slowest Carl's Jr ever. I've been here on at least 3 occasions and even though there is no one else in line, it takes several minutes to even acknowledge me and then 10-15 to get my food. This is always breakfast time...so not even a lunch rush in the drive through. This last time I hit the the bathroom before leaving and OMG...porta potties and  the beach bathrooms in San Diego are better.... seriously! The smell was atrocious, there were french fries and ketchup on the floor, and a several straws with their wrappers laying in one of the sinks. I honestly was afraid to sit down or touch anything. It seriously smelled like something had died in there. Note to self...DO NOT RETURN AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Not a fan when you close for the day to prove nothing but only cause drama. This is a chain restaurant and shouldn't be trying to play politics. Higher min wage, Immigration....what next. Good news though raisin Canes is opening up next door."}
{"text":"Terrible service at this location. Have had to go back into the location more than once to have them correct an order, only to get pushback and a request to pay more money for an order they messed up due to their lousy speaker system. And tonight my hubby is the victim of food poisoning from the CA Classic. Will be avoiding this location in the future."}
{"text":"I for one like Carl's Jrs and this one is a good representative of the chain. The food is always good and the employees are always helpful and cheerful. They also have free Wi-Fi which is a plus. I just wish the Carl's near my office I frequent for lunch also had free Wi-Fi. They often have someone out on Baseline Rd promoting a Buy one Get one free promo on Western Bacon Cheeseburgers (which are my favorite)."}
{"text":"Downgrading to 3 stars ... Here's why ...  Since the fabulous jalapeno cheeseburger was removed from the regular menu, it is only available as a special request,   and it is no longer fabulous"}
{"text":"I am updating my most recent review of this Carl's Jr.  I previously gave three stars due to slow service and lackluster fries.  Today I'm giving four stars.  I ordered my favorite El Diablo combo but chose jalapeño poppers instead of fries (they really need to work on the fries).  When a staff member brought me my meal, I noticed they had given me fries instead of the poppers. I pointed out the error and she said the order had fries listed but she would take it back.  While she was gone I took out the receipt and sure enough the cashier had forgotten to change the fries to poppers.  When the staff member returned she had replaced the fries with the poppers.  I asked her if I needed to go up and pay for the poppers since I had only been charged for the fries, but she gave me a sweet smile and said no, that the cashier had made a mistake and asked me to enjoy my meal.   This was totally unexpected and demonstrated true customer service.  This CJs has a great staff and I will continue to eat there. Kudos to the employees!"}
{"text":"awfull experience never again will come to any Carl's Jr. 30min wait, Ordered a chicken salad with no chicken and ordered two salads and got one ranch dressing. HORRIBLEEEEE DONT GO HERE  To top it off I saw 3 orders that they messed up! Had to check mines! NEVERRRRR"}
{"text":"Drive thru guy made up for it the next time around. I'm not one who holds grudges and I haven't had an issue since."}
{"text":"June 25, 2012 Monday - lunch 12:15 PM 4 adult and a kid  Atmosphere - 5 stars Food - 5 stars Service - 5 stars  Background - Needed a quick lunch before heading back to Reno.  Atmosphere - lots of tables and the place was very busy and clean  Food   Appetizer - none today.     Main Course - I had the chicken strips for the first time. Wow they were so tender and plumb.  Could have put these on a fancy plate and I would have never know it was fast food.    Dessert - Just a quick bite, no time today  Service - The cashier was an older lady but super sweet, friendly helpful a true customer service experience, I wish I got her name.  The older man bringing out the food was completely friendly and making sure you got what you needed.  Future - Sure, but I doubt it will be any time soon as I live in Reno."}
{"text":"Horrible service ladies kept talking throughout the whole time making the food mass stop my order was a hair in my food horrible service I got my money back I left never coming back to this location"}
{"text":"The girl at the drive through got my order wrong and somehow it was my fault. When I went back and asked to speak to the manager, she was on break? Seriously?!!! The girl insisted it was my fault and wouldn't compensate the fact that I had to drive back there because again it was my mistake in ordering (which it wasn't) !! And God forbid you ask for a cup of ice, she gave me the nastiest look that could kill. Worst customer service. Never going there again."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to check this place out but I was disappointed. The food was mediocre and I was totally disgusted by the fact that the BBQ  sauce we ordered was literally jell-o. I haven't been back since and don't plan on going back. The atmosphere was not the greatest either- it was pretty unclean and below average for a fast food joint."}
{"text":"The employees here regularly ignore the drive through, especially late at night to very early morning.  This particular day it was actually around 11:30am.  We sat for 15min or so at the intercom, dead silence.  Then decided to pull up to the window directly thinking maybe the intercom was broken or something.  Sat at the window for a few minutes, still nobody came.  Knocked on the window, as an employee walked by.  They waved and kept walking, so we went elsewhere for lunch.  I called the store maybe 10min after and needless to say, I got the same treatment, only this time with chuckling in the background.  I hung up...  Generally I don't have high expectations from fast food places these days, but this was ridiculous.  This is certainly not indicative of all their stores, but this one needs some help in general customer service."}
{"text":"Before evening get to review the food:  One cashier , 10 people in line. You get the picture."}
{"text":"This place is a dump, sorry to be so harsh, but its dirty, nasty place. I mean its on the strip it should be somewhat clean. The food was warm, yes warm, not hot and just felt dirty eating there. Sad because the other restaurants on the strip are good. I know this is fast food but still. The workers don't seem to care about you or your food just get the money quick. They can hardly dress right either I dont need to see what kind of boxers they are wearing that is such a bad vibe. Also the drink area was gross trash, soda syrup everywhere, and they couldn't even keep their ketchup container full. Just really will not go here again, also they dont keep their dining room clean, I mean when your eating and bum comes in an asks for money, really now, not while im eating. I wont go here again and do not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"It really smells bad like I'm scared to est my food cause it might make me sick.. The employee's clearly dont like to work and my order was super wrong but I dont wanna go back in the stank to return my order.."}
{"text":"Carl's is our go to place when we want a fast food burger that is actually fast. In and Out and 5 Guys I prefer but both generally take longer to get into and out of.  Overall I prefer a full restaurant experience and think I've had too much fast food in the past. But if you are in a rush, Carl's will get the job done and be pretty good."}
{"text":"Let me make this short but sweet.  We waiting for our food ( which was to go ) for 45 minutes. Granted, while we were waiting the manager gave us two free large drinks and added fries to our order for no cost. This helped with the frustration we were experiencing considering this is supposed to be 'fast food.'  But then IT happened. i watched a cockroach walk his happy little safe all over the floor where people were waiting and then into the KITCHEN! i was appalled.  Once we got our food our money was then given back to us since we had to wait for so long but i will never be going back. My experience here kind of made me question these fast food restaurants. :\"}
{"text":"The food here is alwYs hot and perefectly cooked.my favorite is there sausage breakfast biscuts!!! No joke there biscuts are freaking real!! No frozen oddly chewy gross biscuts. Just plan old real flaky warm biscuts. I recommend everyone try one of those breakfast sandwiches from Carl's Jr...and you will agree that it has one of the best breakfast sandwiches around. Not to mention the service was speedy friendly and accurate decent price. You will be seeing me again"}
{"text":"Nobody who works here speaks English, and it's therefore basically impossible to order through the drive thru. I'm here a lot and it's quite clear that the manager is a racist who refuses to hire white people, only illegal aliens."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place is still open. I don't like it. Food is over or undercooked and they are incredibly slow. It's been like this since I ordered. NO ONE has got their food. I only come here when my husband or in-laws want something. It's FAST FOOD! You shouldn't sit in line for 30 minutes just to get some gross, greasy resemblance to food."}
{"text":"Long wait in the drive thru. Came here with one car ahead of me 5 minutes later there are 6 cars behind me and I have yet to order"}
{"text":"Drive through order \"Would you like salsa or ketchup with you breakfast burrito?\" \"Salsa please\"... really enjoying my burrito at work now with no salsa... fail"}
{"text":"Don't know how this chain stays in business. The food they put out is under par and when you bring it to their attention its hilarious to see the look on their face. It just comes from poor or no management.  2 people here and half the table are dirty."}
{"text":"Hardee's Biscuits!  Hardee's Biscuits!  According to the staff, to their knowledge this is the only Carl's Jr. in AZ that has Hardee's biscuits.  If you've enjoyed those biscuits in other parts of the country, you know what I'm talking about.  Simply the best.  Restaurant was clean and staff were pleasant.  Food was hot and served in a timely manner.  Nice location in a somewhat dumpy area.  Lot of props for the biscuits.  Review is for breakfast meals only."}
{"text":"I waited in line to get a milk shake for my fiancé who just had an oral surgery and could not eat solid food. Once I got up to the line, and now had people behind me, I was told the shake machine was down for the night (it was 6:22pm). I understand things happen, however, I felt it would have been appropriate to put a sign on the menu board or something to that effect so people didn't wait in line for a product that is unavailable."}
{"text":"Usually I love Carl's Jr. but not this one. Went there for the first time and will not go back. Place is outdated, dirty, & staff was not friendly. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Awful. Ordered two burgers w fries and got two bacon burgers with unmelted cheese and raw looking bacon AND they forgot the fries. I ordered 2 cokes and was given cherry cokes. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"This place sucks !!!! They charged us an extra 15$ and when we were explaining that that was way more then what we bought was worth! And then instead of fixing it to the price of what it was supposed to be they sat there and argued w us for 20 min and after we left it wasn't even the right Order!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience here. The drive thru took forever AND messed up my order. They didn't give me the proper condiments that I ordered. And they also don't say hello, goodbye, or thank you. What terrible service. I had to deal with this because it was the closest thing to me and I was in a hurry and terribly hungry. A mistake that I won't make again!"}
{"text":"Fast food - NOT! There was one car ahead of us who ordered 1 small bag of food and we waited 15minutes. Literally one car ahead of us and one car behind. That was it. We just ordered two shakes. Chick-Fil-A down the street has tons of cars in line and I bet their customers didn't have to wait as long as the customers at Carl's Jr."}
{"text":"Today is the second day I've gotten breakfast from downtow's newest fast food establishment. And I can admit, I'm a fan.I really like their biscuits. While I'm generally not a fast foodie, Carl's Jr will be a nice rotation. However, it is oddly located inside US Airways Center."}
{"text":"Consistently slow service in the drive through. Food can be inaccurate maybe due to out-of-date technology (giving cashiers the benefit of the doubt). Food is consistently great, I do enjoy the thick burgers distinctive flavor."}
{"text":"I was waiting in line for F##king 20 mins or more for a simple damn meal two Spicy sandwich and a damn small Dr Pepper SMH that was ridiculous didn't even get it was fed up had to wait for the damn line to move to just leave. Never coming to this place ever again. Worst place."}
{"text":"I stopped by this Carl's Jr for a quick snack during my lunch. I was in a rush and service was fast and efficient.   It is located on the corner of Sahara and Fort Apache so it's rather easy to locate and get to from the street."}
{"text":"I've come to this Carl's Jr on a number of occasions and have always received really friendly and attentive service here. I don't normally give four star reviews to fast food chains, but they really seem to go above and beyond at this location."}
{"text":"I eat here often. I like  their burgers as they seem to be juicier than others. This place has always been friendly and helpful to me. The place is always clean.  I can get my burger lettuce wrapped. This is something most places do not do or do it very poorly. They do an excellent job of wrapping my burger."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Carl's Jr since I was 10 and living in SoCal.   We came here for a play date for DD and her friend.   The temperature in the main dining room was almost as hot as it was outside.  I estimate it was 95-100F inside.  Come here if you like saunas because I was told the a/c \"is always like this\" inside when I asked if the a/c was out.  We saw milk sitting on a counter, unrefrigerated, for at least fifteen minutes or longer.  The grossest part?  ALL of the tables were dirty.  I mean, GREASY FINGERPRINTS dirty.  If a rag was used to wipe these down, it must have been without soap or water.  The kids were happy with their Spiderman kids' meals, so yay for star shaped chicken nuggets.   On the bright side, The kids' play area was cooled to an appropriate temperature.  They had fun playing there, hence the 2 star rating.  This visit will most definitely be my last.   What gives Carl?"}
{"text":"Yum..good fast food, cheap prices. I mean if you gonna eat fast food I would pick Carls jr or Wendy's over all the rest."}
{"text":"Love Carl's Jr. double western with cheese, fried zucchini, french fries, and a orange soda is my go to. The workers here don't give you a hard time about how many sauces you ask for and that's great because I love my ranch :D"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant and friendly staff, but what I liked about this location is the fact that I had a coupon from the App that was originally to get a free $6 thickburger.  When I came in the app ended up getting updated and it is now a buy one get one free.  They honored the original which was very nice and they didn't have to do it."}
{"text":"Hmmm Guacamole 6$ burger.   food - tasty burgers, as far as fast food goes, i think they have a tasty, Caloricly suicidal, burger...next to Burger King..i think it is the most flavorful and good (not saying good for you tho). also, i think they got new fries..because they were pretty damn good. location - ummm could be worse. needs a refresher, remodel.  employees - very nice. not bitter fast food workers. brought food to my table and i didn't need to leave a tip.  corner of Washington and 24th street."}
{"text":"Always clean, the staff is always friendly, and they always get my specialty order right. I just can never figure out why no one is ever here except me."}
{"text":"Been waiting 10 minutes so far... We came in and there were already 4 very annoyed guys waiting for their food. They have one person behind the counter and one person assembling the food.   Seriously, owners of this franchise... You have GOT to stop this severe understaffing. If you provided quick service at least you have something and maybe business will pick up; but you guys have nothing going for you.   Oh hey after another few minutes another guy finally got his food. There are people just giving up at the drive through line... So stupid.   I went here for breakfast a month ago and during the breakfast rush they were down to 1 employee because the cook went to get more garbage bags.   Horribly managed location. I've seen lemonade stands with better employee management."}
{"text":"Service here is okay. It's fast food so it's convenient to just grab and go when I'm too tired to cook. My favorite is the western bacon cheeseburger and my husband likes to try different burgers they come out with occasionally. Their shakes are really good and I like how they have criss cut fries as another option for fries."}
