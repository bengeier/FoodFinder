{"text":"We've been going to this bakery for 2 yrs now. They are always friendly and accommodating. The baked goods are delicious and we love going there."}
{"text":"This is one of the best bakery's that i have been to in my life! The service is amazing, especially the nicest woman who helped me with everything, named Sharon. Amazing pecan bars. Everyone has to come here!!"}
{"text":"Today I stopped at Ventito Bakery. Carol the owners mom was just taking some bread out of the oven.I bought a loaf for only three dollars Next week from Tuesday thru Sunday all the Bread will be two dollars. Donna the owner asked what flavors I liked, She let me try a strawberry cake with whipped cream frosting that was to die for. Small portions and great service. Stop in and  try this great   new  bakery in Old Avon Village!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered mini desserts and pastries from here based on a google search for a large party at a nearby country club this past weekend and just ordered based on the website.  The desserts were EXCELLENT, amazing, beautiful, and delicious and all consistent.  The presentation was amazing as well - on a silver platter and arranged nicely.  If we didnt have guests at the party I would have eaten everything!!   Delivery time was a little delayed but still within a normal window.  Family running the business is super friendly and nice, and you need to order from here for your next party."}
{"text":"Ordered a dozen marble GF cupcakes and a dozen strawberry GF cupcakes. Everyone loved them!! One of my friend's is a baker, had the marble and said he had never had a better cupcake. They are THE BEST cupcakes we have ever had."}
{"text":"I am so thankful for this bakery! The staff is seriously SO SWEET! We called them this morning to see if they could do a gender reveal cake for my sister who lives in the area. We are from out of town. Not only did they come through for us, the the cake was beautiful and ready less than two hours later! My sister said it was delicious!  She said she'll be back for sure for some of their pepperoni bread. When I visit her, I'll be sure to go too! Thank you Ventito's! 

Do yourself a favor, grab a fork and check out this little Italian gem for yourself!"}
{"text":"The absolute most ridiculous experience. We communicated with one of their employees Donna, regarding a birthday cake. We were clear in what we wanted, we even sent photos to make sure our cake looked like what we wanted. We have someone pick up the cake because we're out of state. And the cake looked liked a 4 year old put it together. It's embarrassing. We called to let them know what a mess it was, and that turned into an even bigger mess. So rude and unprofessional. I was told the person who took the order was in the hospital and I had to call them. Really, a business is telling me to call someone in the hospital to dispute something. So unprofessional. Donna took the order, Donna was not in the hospital. Donna just didn't want to fix her mistake. I asked for the owners info and was told I would have to wait until after Christmas to resolve it. When the owners husband was right there. I spoke to him, and quickly realized why the employees at this location are as ignorant and rude as they are. He was also so unprofessional. Demanding we bring the cake back...for what? So you can resell the cake. Our toddler could make a better cake than this. Do not order cakes from this bakery. You will be disappointed and have to deal with unprofessional, ridiculous people. We've added a photo for your viewing pleasure. Top cake is what they made us. Bottom cake is what it is supposed to look like. Are these people blind?"}
{"text":"I wandered in here with my nephew because it is next to a Pok√©mon gym. They were just taking some pizza bread out of the oven. The owner said her 70-year-old mother had rolled it. Let me tell you it was mouth watering. And only five dollars. I also got a half dozen cannolis which they stuffed when you order them. And some pecan cluster bars. Don't judge me, I have a sweet tooth. Honestly everything was amazing. This was such a cute family owned place. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The Avon area is lacking in good bakery options so I had high hopes when I heard about this bakery. My mom and I decided to check them out after having lunch at the always lovely Treehouse.

The interior is a bit drab. Outside they had an Italian flag, but there wasn't anything Italian inside. We walked in and were surprised to see that there wasn't an obvious display case of goodies right away. The first thing you encounter is the freezer that is full of all kinds of cakes sold by the slice. To the right is another area with breads. In the back is a display case with cookies. The only Italian cookies were Pizzelles and the other cookies didn't look appealing. 

A definite strength of this bakery is that they offer a large selection of gluten free baked goods. This would be a great option for someone with Celiac disease. Since everything is sold individually it would also be great for providing a gluten free option at a gathering where you don't want to make everyone eat gluten free.

My mom and I settled on a slice of Strawberry Cake which was reasonably priced at $3.75. The slice was large enough for us to split. Neither one of us liked the cake or the frosting. My mom tossed her half after a couple of bites. When I asked my mom for her expert option (she has been baking from scratch for longer than I've been alive) on whether it was made from scratch the verdict was that she didn't think so.

I really wanted to like this bakery and I especially like to support local businesses, but this just fell flat for us. I would have loved more than one Italian cookie option as well. This area needs a good Italian bakery!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and helpful. Made my cupcakes to my color specifications as a walk in. they are mostly pre-order bakery so call ahead if you have time. 

cupcakes were moist and airy and beautifully but simply decorated in fall colors like I asked. 

Only draw back is they are mostly pre-order so if ur just stopping in, you gotta hope its the right time but I really liked them."}
{"text":"I am celiac and Donna and her mom are outstanding.  They have a wonderful attitude in satisfying the customer. If you go on their website you can view many choices. Both gluten-free, dairy free and gluten and dairy products. I bought products in all categories and my family and myself are pleased with all. 
I recommend calling I'm placing your order a few days before you need it. They do have bakery items to purchase but not a huge supply."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem and I can guarantee you that you will not find better service anywhere! Two days ago, my wife and I were looking for a local bakery in the Avon/Avon Lake area for desserts for a family party. All other bakeries were closed/closing. I called Ventito and Donna, the owner answered. This was at 3:45 and they were scheduled to close at 4. I asked if they had any cupcakes we could come grab and she said SURE! She asked me to give her 20 minutes because they were just made the night before and they hadn't been frosted yet. My wife and I showed up at 4:10, ten minutes after they closed (!!!) and Donna let us in while she was still frosting our cupcakes! She took the time to make sure our desserts were perfect, even though it kept her working past business hours! Not only that, but then she had is try several other desserts, all of which were delicious, so she could get our opinions on them. Ventito is an absolutely great place, family owned, and I will make sure to go back for years. If you want not only great baked goods, but better service, I'd suggest you do the same thing as well!"}
{"text":"I had two types of cupcakes, both Gluten Free which typically don't stand up to a normal cupcake. These cupcakes were different! Probably the best cupcakes I've ever eaten. The buttercream frosting was amazing and the cake was not dry at all.

Bonus: the owner of the bakery was super friendly!"}
