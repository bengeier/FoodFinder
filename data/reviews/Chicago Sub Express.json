{"text":"Great, hearty and real sandwiches! Good bread, delicious grilled veggies.  Simple and yummy!  The owner is very friendly and welcoming! They also serve ice cream.  Definitely will return for more,  especially the meatball sub.  I would've taken pictures of the sandwiches but we ate them too fast as they were delicious, camera didn't eat first :)   It's awesome to have a nice new food place in the area.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. I got the 12\" Chicago O'Hare Sub along with a home made Chicken Noodle soup. It didn't disappoint. Both very delicious. Fresh fresh fresh. Owner was super friendly. On top of cold deli items they had hot foods as well and Kawartha Dairy ice-cream. Lots of sauces and dressings to put on your sandwiches. You might be paying a bit more but you are paying extra for that taste and freshness. Unlike your chain sub joints. Excellent spot."}
{"text":"We came here because we were curious why there was so many five star reviews, and WOW, you will not be disappointed. The customer service was excellent and the food is fresh and delicious, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So I was pretty surprised to see every review at 5 stars and thought that doesn't make sense.... but it does! First off service is first class.  They were helpful with everything as I was catering for a dozen people for lunch.  Everything was ready on time, packed and fresh and it was a hit with the crowd too.  Had the meatball, chicken parmesan, and veal parmesan sandwiches with a few subs too and lasagne.  I tried the spinach vegetable lasagne and it was delicious.  Will definitely be back here! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Freshest and best tasting sub I've ever had, hands down.  Quality ingredients.  The amount of love that goes into them making your sub is incredible!  A must try."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. I had a turkey club sandwich for a late lunch. The cold cuts and the toppings were fresh and the buns were freshly baked. All in all much nicer than any chain restaurant. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome service solid sub great selection well done...will definitely be back to try the meatball sub looks great"}
{"text":"Excellent quality sub! Tastes great! Great value considering the size of the sub. It's huge!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches.  Meat and veggies so fresh. Bread great and fresh. Ruined us for chain \"sub stores\". Tiramisu was great too. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here today for the first time and will definitely be back.   We were welcomed by the loveliest people who really took the time to explain the menu and offer suggestions.   The subs were huge and amazing (we got both lunch and dinner out of our 12\" subs). The toppings and buns were super fresh which makes all the difference. So many sauces to choose from!!   The meatball sub is definitely our recommendation (oh and the kawartha dairy ice cream).   food: 5/5 menu options: 5/5 service: 6/5  :-)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today, it was so incredible. The owner is so knowledgable and nice! He really made us feel welcome and gave incredible suggestions. Everything in their food is made of real ingredients that you'd be able to pronounce! We ended up picking up a full tray of lasagna for dinner! Hand made and full of delicious fresh ingredients."}
