{"text":"Nice place.  Food absolutely horrible.  I figured a simple original infused Italian menu would be easily executed however I'm wrong.  Risotto mushy and over cooked and dry. Proteins smelled funny.  And cooks not clean at all. Will not be back.  However across the street is the schnepf farms bakery and cafe and I heard they have a bad ass chef from multiple fine dining restaurants and resorts experience as well as celebrities.  Organic farm to table truly.  Olive mill could at least go across the street and buy fresh produce from the Schnepf's to at least have fresh ingredients?? I will go for oils but for eating and possibly weddings are banquets I'm going to Schnepf's farm and experience this awesome chef bring something we have needed and long over due to queen creek! Whomever found this guy deserves an award!!!"}
{"text":"OK, really out in the boonies unless you live in Queen Creek. It was dark and not so inviting inside. Our lunch was good but pretty ordinary. Tours of the mill require purchased tickets."}
{"text":"This is my other \"go to\" place when the weather is nice and cool and I want to get out of Phoenix. I'm very grateful that we have this olive mill near Phoenix and can spoil ourselves with fresh delicious olive oil. I like it that you can taste what you buy first, it's still hard to choose but helpful. I took their \"Olive Oil 101\" tour twice and enjoyed it both times - very informative and interesting. The food they offer at their \"eatery\" has always been tasty, the baked goods are fresh and they make their cakes and other stuff with olive oil instead of butter. I got a double (or was it triple?) chocolate cup cake and it was delicious! The people at the store are friendly and ready to help and answer any questions. So far, it's always been a very pleasant experience each time we went there. Hope to be back next year when the weather cools off."}
{"text":"What a great little shop! Samples, deliciousness, a real country feel! Well worth the drive! It's like going on a mini vacation!"}
{"text":"Fantastic flavored oils and vinegars. I use it almost everyday and live all the great flavors that they have. The strawberry balsamic is heavenly and the garlic olive oil is amazing. LOVE!"}
{"text":"I wish they had two categories for stars.  Five stars would be for the wonderful variety of olive oils, friendliness of employees, and unique gift ideas and then two stars for the food in the little deli.  The first time we visited the Queen Creek Olive Mill the food in the deli was fresh and delicious.  The last two times have been a big disappointment.  Yesterday, I ordered grilled garlic corn on the cob.  It had a delicious flavor, but the core was still cold, meaning it had either been frozen or refrigerated, so when I bit into it, the corn was cold.  The Greek salad had tomatoes that were flavorless and two tomatoes were soft and on the verge of being rotten.  All was very overpriced for what you received.  It was not very busy during the time we were there, so being in a rush could not have been an excuse.  We will definitely  return for the delicious olive oils but we will find another place to eat lunch from now on."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a Groupon I found online. I walked in and the workers in the store greeted me as soon as I walked in. They know their product extremely well. They showed me different options and let me sample anything I wanted. I ended up purchasing several olive oils and a balsmic. I highly reccommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Love the oil's and Shell's passion for the Mill and its products."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review till now! I am in love. Oils and Olives is my favorite place for olive oil, spreads, honey, and vinegar. My favorite part is that I can sample everything before I buy. This is also my least favorite part because then I end up liking everything I tried and spending way to much! The staff here is always very helpful and I always find something new to try. Some of my favorites are the garlic olive oil, garlic Parmesan dip, Chili Lime oil, and asiago cheese spread. They also apparently have a couple restaurants that I am going to try soon. I signed up for their rewards program and they automatically give you $5 off your next visit so I am going to use it to try their restaurant in Queen Creek. This is one of those stores that once you start using their products, you can't imagine how you lived and cooked before without them!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  We come here when it is time to look for a gift for someone special or just to pick up something cool for yourself. This is their satellite store in the Kierland Commons and it is closer than driving to their main location in Queen Creek.  They have a swell selection of all sorts of goodies made from Olives and then some. Many of them you can sample while visiting the store. Olive Oils, Stuffed Olives, Vinegars, Wines, Spreads, and Tapenades. Too many to list them all. So GOOD!  They even have several items that are made from Olives that you should not eat. These being Soaps, Lotions, Bath Oils and Balms.  Some of my many favorite are the Roasted Garlic, the Bacon, and the Chili Pepper Olive Oil. I cannot resist getting a jar of the Stuffed Olives. I always also have to stock up on the Tapenades. Love the Caramelized Red Onion with Fig Tapenade and the Peach Caponatina. Both taste awesome with my pan seared duck breast that I love to cook.  Don't forget the really nice Gift Boxes they have. Some of them you can customize to your liking for your special friend or family member. They also have fun Apparel and locally crafted Ceramics that you can purchase. Check out their website to see all their fine products or just pop in and give them a visit.  Keep it LOCAL when you can. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"OK I am going to say, how can you not love this shop! I have been to some other ones as well and they are all just so great. We have really started shopping at these places all the time. The selections are amazing. Anything you could want in Olive Oil.  Even wonderfu kinds of Vinegar. Blood Orange Vinegar is my favorite so far. Mixed with a little EVOO, and some spices, best salad dressing and healthy! Stuffed Olives, crackers, dips. Some of the little dishes and platters are really nice. Bright and colorful. Samples every where, I was full by the time I left here.  Some really good cheeses as well. It is really good to be able to sample things before you buy. Then you do not have to have something just sitting on the shelf.  You bought it and now you do not like it."}
{"text":"I really love coming into Queen Creek Olive Mill because of their variety and helpful staff/owners. Actually, it's fun to get lost here.   When I worked nearby, I was in here all the time, and our pantry closet in the past, attested to my many purchases. But Queen Creek Olive Mills isn't a one trick pony.   Besides olive oils and balsamic vinegars(photos), they have a bunch of fresh pastas and sauces (or gravy, if UR from the east coast). If UR into kitchen novelties, aprons, utensils; they have a large selection at better prices than found next door at Sur.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food and the service is great. They have all types of olive oil and even some great wine. I do try to avoid this place during snow bird season because it's usually packed and it's hard to find a place to sit,"}
{"text":"All you ever wanted in a specialty store.  Every flavor of olive oil, olives, nuts, and chocolates all locally sourced.  Friendly, welcoming staff."}
{"text":"They have Chicken and Waffles and really good coffee! If you don't live in the area it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Fantastic ... went to another store in this mall with the intent of a gift, left and came here.  Glad I found their Olive Oil soaps!!!  Went online to find one of their stores closer to me.   I adore olive oil and found some soap that I purchased for gifts.  Reasonably priced for this great soap.  Will come again ~  Also have lots of interesting wines on display.  Didn't need it this trip but will look at them again for wine  ~"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here at the recommendation of one of our friends who came to Phoenix for college. We were staying in Tempe so we were happy to see a marketplace location in Scottsdale (we didn't have time to drive out to the mill unfortunately). We are so happy to have come to the marketplace and feel incredibly lucky to have encountered Shell, their culinary concierge. She was extraordinarily knowledgeable and patient with expert recommendations. Their olive oils and balsamic vinegars are delectable-it was hard to choose! But we left with rosemary, blood orange, truffle olive oils and prickly pear and white balsamic vinegars. We also love that the shop supports local businesses! Please be sure to visit this marketplace when you're in the Scottsdale area and hopefully you're fortunate enough to meet Shell!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the qq olive mill so I was thrilled when the opened a store in Scottsdale. In love all of the oils from here, there are so many different flavors that you can use for anything. They also have a great assortment of beauty products... I love the Chapstick and the body oil in lavender. Perfect stop if you want to get some unique gifts and they have a great selection of wines"}
{"text":"I love olives, I love olive oil, I love vinegar, I love wine, I love bath products...so why on earth wouldn't I love a store that sells it all in one place! Oils & Olives is a gifter's and a cook's paradise! It's also a great place to stop by if you need a little mid-day snack because they have samples out all around!   I am very happy this store opened because rather than driving all the way to their Queen Creek Olive Mill, I can visit their store here in Kierland! The staff is incredibly friendly and very helpful in pointing you in the right olive oil direction. All of their vinegars and olive oils are made at their Mill in Queen Creek and they also sell Arizona wines. The space is stocked full of goodies perfect for adding flavor to your daily meals or for creating a colorful gift for a friend.   So what about the taste? The taste is sublime! Picture this: bacon olive oil. It tasted like bacon grease but without the added fat and it's perfect for eggs, chicken, pasta...anything really! They also have vinegars such as the strawberry vinegar which tastes delicious with chicken or in a salad. This is a shop that everyone should visit at least once and it's right in the middle of the Kierland Commons! I can't wait to make bacon olive oil chicken with my new olive oil!"}
{"text":"Love this place we didn't eat but we had ice cream it was delicious. Their olive oils are amazing and the olives with the Mesquite almonds in them yum"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and breakfast. I had the ricotta pancakes and a bowl of mix fruit. I am not a fan of grapefruit, so it would have been nice to get a better assortment. The shop in the restaurant let's you taste the different olive oils, which is cool."}
{"text":"What to say Yum, Yum , Yummy. We were here for a tasting and thoroughly enjoyed our grilled cheese sandwiches on fresh baked bread with delish olive oil and delish balsamic vinegar.  The chocolate cake made with chocolate olive oil was rich, moist and fab.   The woman serving us was so generous feeding our group, it was a pleasure.  The tapenades especially onion was delectable. We left with 2 bottles and will return for gifts."}
{"text":"What a cool place!! They have a sweet gift shop with lots of great Olive products. Oils vinegars dressings and more! My wife and I got sandwiches and tea. Great lunch sandwiches! Creative flavors and twists on sammys.  Kind of pricey but worth the splurge!!"}
{"text":"My family comes to the Marketplace here in Kierland Commons to load up on their fantastic olive oils and vinegar. They offer many other local products, but we have our steady favorites. The garlic olive oil is so great for cooking eggs, pasta, etc. The vanilla oil is perfect for baking, or making our favorite vanilla bean olive oil waffles. I love that the store will let you sample anything, and have recipe cards everywhere for you to peruse or take with you.  The staff is very attentive, friendly and helpful. Shell (in particular) is just the best! She really knows her stuff, and remembers us each time we return to the store. She makes coming into the shop such a nice experience.  It seems like people in other reviews are confusing this store with the mill/retail store in Queen Creek. This location is simply a place to buy the wonderful products that come from the Mill. If you have the chance to go down to Queen Creek, it's a great place, and worth taking the short tour. The Queen Creek location also has a nice café.   It's a good feeling to know that you're supporting a local business, and the benefit to the customer is that they are buying a fresh product. It's definitely worth stopping by to see for yourselves."}
{"text":"No more shipping fees for me! This local business holds a special place in my heart. I'm on my fourth bottle of Chili Olive Oil, a truly inspired and essential part of my kitchen now.  There are many zesty and dreamy flavors like Bacon, Blood Orange, Mexican Lime, Vanilla Bean, etc. Oh, and you can try them all at this beautiful shoppe.  They have other locally made products as well;  soaps, pastas, skin care products, accessories and more.  Yet another reason to visit Kierland Commons. Damn, as if that place wasn't dangerous enough."}
{"text":"You really don't know what good olive oil is until you've truly tasted good olive oil.  Oils & Olives sells straight from Queen Creek Olive Mill, giving customers the flavorful experience.  It's just like visiting QCOM sans the hour drive and a few other things.    All the oil and vinegar flavors and all the tapenades are available.  You can sample all of them here as well.  There's also plenty of locally made beauty products and wines.  The only thing Oils & Olives is missing is the tour and the food.  I can live with that."}
{"text":"The worst customer service. A weekday visit with only 3 customers including the 2 of us in the store and 1 employee that never came out from behind the counter, didn't look up to say hello, or \"how can I help you?\"  I guess our business was not important. I'll spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Even though I have never been to their actual mill at Queen Creek, I do love their olive oils and will purchase them whenever I see them at a farmers market or gourmet store. It was really cool to see that they have this store in UNION that has their full line of products. At least I think so. They had A LOT of stuff, anyway. I bought some of the spicy olives that they had available to sample since they were just so yummy and also after trying a handful of the dozen or so oils they had out to try ended up selecting the bacon and white truffle flavors to take home with me. YUM! I have already broken open the bacon olive oil to drizzle on some butternut squash ravioli I got at Sprouts and it was D-LISH!"}
{"text":"I am moving and so wanted to stock up on local olive oil. Sampling the oils, and vinegars was fantastic. I will def be ordering online so i dont have to miss out on the garlic olive oil. Staff was fantastic. Very knowledgable and helped me box up a gift set."}
{"text":"This is not a restaurant by any stretch. Why it's listed in the restaurant category is beyond anyone's imagination. Ridiculous to say the least."}
{"text":"I have been to this location three time now and am always very happy. The service is great and I really love that you can try everything before you buy. I just learned on this visit that they have a rewards program. I wish I would have known sooner! The products all are very yummy and great quality. A must stop for anyone who likes to cook."}
{"text":"Loved! Loved! Loved!  . . . this little shop is in the new Union at the Biltmore on Camelback.  It is small, but so many wonderful olive oil products are there for you to smell, taste and buy. I loved the little tasting table in the middle where you can actually smell and taste a variety of their olive oils.   I settled on two on my last visit: 1. A Gourmet dipping olive oil - so incredibly good with French bread! 2. A Chocolate olive oil - bought it for a friend who is a great cook and likes to experiment with new recipes. Also picked up a recipe for chocolate cake made with the chocolate olive oil for her.  Next time I'm in I want to try one of their olive oil soaps. Just imagine how delightful they would feel on your skin in this dry climate.  Must give it a try.  Across the aisle at their sister store you can find cupcakes made with the different oils. Worth a try.  Love to cook? Love to eat healthy? Love your olive oil to be fresh? Then, by Jove, this is your place.  A taste of Italy right from Queen Creek, Arizona."}
{"text":"Very over priced products for sale, few of which are made there.  The sandwiches are good, ice cream too.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We went to the Olive Mill with our 2 kids to enjoy some local food based on the recommendation of my brother in law.  I am from a small town so the ma and pa atomsphere was a refershing spin.  I am from Chandler - aka chain city.  There was also live music and the food was great.  It's a great place to escape to if you are up for a drive and in the mood for a relaxing local food joint."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for several years and have always been impressed by both the quality of the local products offered and the helpfulness of the staff.  The star is the olives and oils from the Queen Creek olive mill, but the pastas and fresh artisan breads are excellent as well.   Feel free to ask for advice about the plain and flavored oils -- and get samples of each. Also, don't miss the variety of vinegars, dipping oils and glazes from the mill. Don't forget to collect a few of the free recipe cards for ideas about how to use some of the more interesting flavors: vanilla-infused olive oil makes great waffles and adds an interesting dimension to cakes. The blood orange oil is good in dark chocolate brownies, and I hear the chili oil is great for popcorn.  This trip, I learned that they also carry locally-sourced mustards and honeys.  If you want to learn more, just ask the staff. They're usually happy to talk about the products. Beyond that, take a trip out to the actual mill. It is a bit of a drive, but you can visit, take a tour, and get all of your olive-related questions answered. There's a restaurant onsite, so you can grab lunch or snacks if you like."}
{"text":"How could you write a 5 star review on an .....olive oil place? Well after visiting, it's pretty easy. I thought I would just cruise in to check it out and actually got a free bottle of crushed basil olive oil! It is by far the best tasting basil olive oil I've ever had and I've recently been putting it on anything. But I digress. The employees here are really helpful and let you taste test a lot!  I would suggest checking this place out when they do free events. I want to say they used to be on Wednesday evenings? You get to try different products paired with foods and wine. All sample size obviously, but still a great opportunity.  They don't have just cooking products either, their lavender body line is freaking amazing. I feel more relaxed just thinking about it."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise this little spot is! I'll kinds of all of oil's and vinegars infused with flavors/essences. Add to that an incredible array of lovely olive oil based massage oil's lip conditioners and soaps!   Still, The highlight for me and my family was the tasting bar. Now, we are all of oil people, we know good all of oil, the quality here is outstanding. Customer service is is also fantastic.   I enjoy making my own salad dressing, but it's never quite right. I tend to make it a little tart, which my son and I enjoy, but it's not a fan favorite for my husband. Shell is the woman that works the all of oil/vinegar bar, she is very fun. She's also quite informed about food and flavors. Self spent a good deal of time helping us find the perfect mix - for a perfect salad dressing! It was the highlight of our afternoon. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Outstandingly ( Is that a word?) fantastic staff, ( Howdy Phillip and gang), great cupcakes, best peach Ice Tea Eva, and from what I hear the Sangria is to die for. (I was done drinking for the night) I went to a Yelp Elite Event and part of our tour was a stop here. I have been wanting to hit their QC Grove location for a while now. I will definitely have to do that. The shop part has the strangest, wonderful, and most delightful olives, oils, and beauty products. Chocolate or Bacon Olive Oil anyone? lol"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon the UNION shops (easy to miss if you just walk about the main stores near the courtyard) and noticed some wine available for sampling! After trying some reds I'd never even heard of (barbara?!) And left with a nice Bricco Riella moscato because we're using it as a mixer in a modern version of a gin tonic :) After stepping in to make our purchase we enjoyed another lovely sample of cheese stuffed olives and quickly noticed an array of tapenades and all sorts of goodies we wanted, instead the cashier tells us about an \" olive oil 101\" event, hands us some \"class passes\" and gives us a huge loaf of fresh, local sourdough bread! Talk about customer service!  I am definitely looking forward to coming back to more wine samplings and checking out the Queen Creek olive mill. See ya there!"}
