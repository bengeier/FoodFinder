{"text":"Went there for a birthday party. The flamenco \"show\" is no more than a couple of dances with a guitarist. Nothing out of the ordinary. If anything it's a marketing attempt at driving traffic into the restaurants.  The food, which was off of a prix fixe, took a long time to come out. The main came out about 2 hours after we were seated. The paella was far from authentic, especially comparing it to other places in Toronto. The appetizer and dessert were equally uninspiring.   I wouldn't come back. If you're looking for good Spanish food check out Carmen's on QueenSt W. If you want to see a flamenco show go to an actual show. This restaurant won't do a good job at either!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a Spanish restaurant in toronto look no further! The tapas selection are very well organized and after literally tasting ask their menu over the years I have yet to find a tapa I didn't enjoy. Also make sure you order the paella right away as it does take 30 minutes to make but well worth the wait. It had a very romantic feel to the restaurant and lightly lit which is perfect to bring your better half for a nice and romantic dinner."}
{"text":"After visiting Spain and trying very delicious paellas, tapas and sangria I decided to try what Spanish food Toronto can offer. I found a groupon for Tapas At Embrujo and went there on Friday evening. I can say this is one of the best places I went in Toronto: food was great especially paella and they had a life performance - Fmentango dancing and a singer. Without groupon it would be quite pricey otherwise this place definitely worth visiting! I would recommend to go on the weekend to see the performance."}
{"text":"My favourite Spanish place from now on. Our server was super nice, recommended us a few dishes, all delicious.  We ordered the Papas Bravas, pork skewers, Spanish tortilla, Lobster Croquetas. So good! And of course we had paella, so tasty that we finished and only took a picture after.  Wine list is fine. Next time I'm going to try the cava, vodka drink they offer. They had a flamenco dancer and guitar player. The dancer was talented. The show was short but great! I would recommend this place, their food authentically Spanish, great service and nice show"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst dining experience I've ever had! I'm including fast food and sit down restaurants when I say this. Here are all the problems I had: 1. The food was very expensive for the portions served - we were in a party of 5 and told our server this. There wasn't even close to enough food for us.  2. The food was terrible: for what we paid, I expected at least a half decent meal. This simply wasn't the case. I couldn't eat any of it and I'm easy to please when it comes to dining.  3. Service was half assed: our server spent more time taking selfies with her friends at the front of the restaurant than she did actually working. There were only 3 occupied tables in the restaurant at the time.  4. The owner(I believe) ejected my mother and brother upon arrival: this was my biggest issue. I was unaware of this until the next day, but it was the last straw. They arrived at 4:45. The restaurant didn't open until. He was allegedly very rude and asked them to leave and come back in 15 minutes. Rather then seat them for 15 minutes he asked them to leave?! That is crazy to me. My mother is a saint so rather then find a new restaurant, she went back. She emailed the restaurant all her concerns and is yet to receive a reply.   This was my first tapas experience and sadly will more then likely be my last. This hole-in-the-wall left a bad taste in my mouth. If it's ever recommended to me again, I'll grab a sub and call it a night."}
{"text":"Wow... finally Embrujo is back with it's original Chef.  Day and night of difference from previous years. I believe the past owner was Mexican. Jose is a true Spaniard. Need I say more? Great selection of wines as well, especially the Leza Garcia Crianza. The Paella valenciana and jamon iberico servered there are to die for."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and experience.  Service was attentive and food was delicious.  Enjoyed the performance and would recommend.  Also, there is a \"free dessert\" with Yelp check-in."}
{"text":"Went there on a whim last week with 3 friends. The food was nothing short of amazing and the service was quick.  You must try the bacon wrapped dates and the lamb chops!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants on the Danforth. Very fancy interior and friendly staff. Although you'd think the service would be slow, we always seem to manage to get in with no hassle. You can make reservations online if you really need to get a table.  They will sometimes have live entertainment, as one occasion I saw a Flamenco show (really great guitar !). As for food I usually go with the seafood, specifically squid which they make perfectly.  Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"Very nice spot! I went with my fianc√©e and her parents for a fun evening on a Friday night. The place was busy but not overcrowded, the atmosphere was animated and looked like everybody was having a good time. The service was fast and attentive. Our server knew his way around spanish wines and guided us through the menu with a big smile even though we probably asked around a thousand questions. First tapas came out after 10-15 min, and, the Flamingo show started shortly afterwards. Beautiful dancing and singing that was the perfect entertainment for a lovely meal. We especially loved the duck confit, the potato omelet and the scallops in saffron sauce. The only \"but\" was the fact that the paella, as delicious as it was (tasty, saffronny and full of seafood), was missing the crust underneath that we've seen in some other places. We Pointed this out to our server and he informed that this is the way it is supposed to be and, after all, the guy was spanish, so he should know better than us, right? All in all, a great evening that we'll repeat before long."}
{"text":"Visited this lovely establishment with a Groupon & I fell in love.  The seafood paella was amazing & I can't wait to go back for it again.  Also had the charcuterie board with a wonderful glass of wine to start. Had the sangria, although was a little sweet for my liking, was pretty good. A definite night out with a great show."}
{"text":"This is officially the worst service I've ever had in any restaurant in Toronto. 1. It took an hour for them to bring our food. 2. We were on the table for 20 minutes before they came to serve us. 3. We were 10 persons and the waitress got angry and the first time we ask for something he said that he was not going to split the bill. Of course, it was a nightmare at the end of the meal. 4. We ordered 3 dishes and arrived just two. 5. The waitress were rude. 6. The food was average and the sangria awful.  Really, it's not worth it to go to this place. If you are planning to have a great dinner experience this is not the place you want to go."}
{"text":"Dined here with a group of friends -- shared a bunch of tapas dishes and drinks. Overall, mediocre experience as the food was nothing special, and the service was slow. I'll give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt as they were also in the midst of the Taste of the Danforth festival so staff resources seemed scarce. I would like to come back on a regular night to give it another go.   Recommendations: bacon-wrapped dates and red wine sangria"}
{"text":"Genius!!! This was the thrid time I have been here and by far the greatest experience.  Last friday (july 18) we arrived at 9:30 having already made reservations and me and my queen waited a bit for a seat but not a problem as we dipped back outside to the sidewalk patio to have a quick smoke. Come back in a were given a choice of tables. As we had been out pre drinking we decided on a nice quiet corner table to whisper sweet nothings to each other.  Our waiter was AMAZING, His name was mark and he was informed and polite and really cheerful without being overbearing. There was not white sangaria??? but that was ok. We opted for the Tapas menu and were not disappointed. We had the serrano ham and cheese croquettes and the bacon wrapped dates to start. Both were lovely. We then had the trio of beef and stuffed peppers. Again high quality tapas. Now onto the Flamenco show. Muey Bien! Talk about gose bumps galore. This show will not only leave you speechless but the music and voices will haunt you (in a good way) for days to come. So moving, powerful and provoking. It invoked massive feelings of missing our second home in Evissa, Spain. The first time I come here many years ago the food was good and the service was ok,. The second time was not a good experience and I learned recently that it was taken over by another group of people that did not let it live up to its name. Well the orginal owner is back and it is no surprise and plain to see that he has brought back the charm and true Espana essence that made it such a success in the first place. Please come for the food, romantic ambience, WORLD CLASS service and a one of a kind flamenco show. We will be back several times over especially when we are missing authentic Espana tapas."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on the recommendation of a friend and it was AMAZING! Each dish was more succulent than the previous ( a must try is the lamb in fig sauce and baked goat cheese with honey).  At 9:30pm the Flamenco show started and it was great!  The service was impeccable and the staff super friendly. I would highly, highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious with a group of 8 on a Tuesday night. Our reservation was for 8:30pm so by the time we got there, the place was starting to clear up. We ordered the Summerlicious menu for $38 as well as two 1.5L pitchers of sangria. Sangria was delicious. Highly recommend.  I ordered: Gambas al Ajillo - sauteed shrimp with butter and a hint of spice, super flavourful; Paella Valenciana - mussel/shrimp/squid paella, not much shrimp or squid but this was still delicious; Delicias de Queso de Cabra - goat cheese fritters, found that there was too much goat cheese for my liking but loved the fritter taste. I tried my friends' desserts and I think the goat cheese fritter was probably my favourite one.  The service was outstanding. Everyone was super nice and attentive. Food also came out really quickly. Service definitely bumped this place to a 5 stars."}
{"text":"Two stars are for the performance alone. The dancer was good and so was the guitarist but i found that the volume was too loud for a dinner and performance place.   The service left me angry with the waiter not once but thrice taking away my plate before I finished. Twice I called him back but the third time he sneaked up on me and left with my desert! I had like a big bite of the flan left to eat! Not cool Mr. Waiter.  My friends and I failed to notice that there was a minimum $30 per person charge for the dinner/show time, so when the bill we noticed they charged us an extra $15 (we were short off). I wish the waiter had left us know we still had $15 left so we could have ordered something else rather than waste that money.  Food was average and too salty. There Lamb dish was the one good thing I can recommend. Personally, I don't think I'll be going back again."}
{"text":"It was an okay dinner meal for the conclusion of Summerlicious 2016.   Service: The server was very nice however, unaware of the menu. A fellow diner is allergic to chicken and we kept reiterating that we needed to know if any items had chicken broth. After asking the chefs and kept reassuring us that one dish didn't she ordered it only to have him come by and say \"Oops!\" and that she wasn't allowed a substitution so she simply ate spinach. Furthermore, I have NEVER had a server keep telling us to be quiet despite us speaking at a normal level as were others except we were targeted. It was a work dinner thanks.   Location: On Danforth with a really heavy oak door! It was intimate and sweet however, having our server point out that people were smoking weed was probably not the best topic of conversation when we requested the bill just saying!   Food: The paella is a saving grace for this restaurant. It was so flavourful and delicious HOWEVER. Mine was about half the size of the others who ordered it and SUPER OILY. I clearly got the lemon. Bacon wrapped dates were nothing to cry home about and the almond cake had a strange moistness and tasted off-putting."}
{"text":"THE ABSOLUTE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday party, left with a frown and a very empty stomach. For the price, the food is very average and in extremely small portions. The paella for 2 is not enough food to be shared by two. The sangria, for $45 a pitcher, was completely void of flavour. They even charged $22 just to allow us to eat the cake that we brought at their restaurant. All in all, I got to eat around 3 spoons of the paella, 2 shrimps, 2 clams, 1/5 of the bacon wrapped date, a few bites of saut√©ed mushrooms and paid $66.66. I'm all for splurging on a good meal, but this felt more like I was stealing bites from a friend's lunchbox. In addition, the server was very inattentive, for an automatic 18% gratuity, he can't even be bothered to refill our water pitchers in a timely manner. Our table of 9 spent a total of $600 here and everyone left hungry, grumpy and completely sober."}
{"text":"The patatas bravas and the bacon wrapped dates are SO good! Literally all the tapas we tried were delicious and tasted just like what I had in Barcelona. The owner was super nice and chatty with us- made us feel right at home! I would definitely love to come back here on a night when they have a flamenco show. Great place!"}
{"text":"It was highly recommended and we were so disappointed.   Everything were so salty and the service was horrible.  The waiter was so aggressive and keep pushing us ordering more food and drinks.  It would be zero star if there is an option."}
{"text":"Ask for andres, the food is amazing!!!!!!! Absolutely worth the drive. Stop thinking and head over to embrujo ask for Andres tell him El J sent you."}
{"text":"We're so glad we found this spot!! Food was fantastic ; and we loved the guitarist and flamenco dancer/singer! Waiter was super nice and fun to interact with. We'll be back here again."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now, and have had great experiences both times. We have gone on weekends so that we are able to enjoy the show as well. The food has been great both times, and the show is enjoyable as well. Even though they state there is a minimum order per person during shows ($30) I think this is a reasonable amount for dinner + show, and that amount includes drinks as well. On our recent visit we ordered the stuffed piquillo peppers, the artichokes, papas bravas, mushrooms in garlic and the fried goat cheese. We also ordered the shrimp in chocolate (which my husband enjoyed so much he thought about ordering another plate) and duck confit, as well as paella. Every dish was good, and they timing of the dishes was spaced well. We have been to several Spanish restaurants in Toronto, but this is the only place we've found where the quality of the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"I'm not convinced. Food was too salty, the duck leg was too cooked, out of 3 dishes and one bottle ordered, 1 dish and the wine were not available. It's too pricy for the service and food quality."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic however everything else about this place isn't! I visited with 6 guests for a birthday. Let's run down the pros:  Any of their paellas are delicious! The rice is cooked perfectly and the meat and seafood tasted fresh and were not covered by a lot of seasonings. Almost everything we had tasted great but anything that came with \"hand cut\" potatoes as described in the menu, were clearly McCain fries! Lamb chops, calamari, and angus beef.... All wonderful.  The live performance is inspiring and no matter if the crowd is into it or not, the dancer and guitarist give it their all. I saw it twice that night :)   The atmosphere is romantic and intimate and really brings you into the moment of being there.   Now on to the cons:  We sat down at 7pm. Exactly 7:01. The first time our table was acknowledged, even after we tried to get the server's attention many times, was at 7:35.   We ordered at least 9 dishes in one shot at around 7:30 and the first ones arrived at 8:20. Aka an hour after ordering and 1.5 hours after being seated.  One of the first dishes we ordered never came at all and when we followed up twice we were simply told on the second follow up that the order wasn't put in the system. Ok no problem....but apologize and offer something complimentary! It was the most expensive dish they had and the only item 1 person wanted to eat.  After looking at other tables we noticed there were bread baskets at each table but where were was ours? We had to request it. It was dry/ borderline stale and seemed like grocery store bread. When I asked if it came with oil, I was told they could bring out oil and balsamic vinegar however when the server returned, he felt it necessary to let me know I had pissed off the chef with the request and that he remarked \"tell her this isn't an Italian restaurant\"! Nice!   Oh man!!!!! The wine menu. Great selection however they had 4 menus printed on regular white computer paper. Not even laminated....Two resided at our table and the servers came by to collect them saying that they only have 4 printed for the entire place! Maybe print some more so paying guests can look over the list at their leisure. This place seats about 30 by the way, if not more. If I crumpled one would we be down to 3 for the entire place? Times aren't that hard!   Drinks took about 45 mins to arrive after each order.   Plates were never cleared away as the night went on and simply piled up at our table until we asked the server to remove them.   Upon booking, we were not told that individual bills could not be processed. Many of the guests didn't eat $30 worth of food, aka the $30 min they charge each guest in a group. Luckily we worked out payment so that we could cover the bill (including tip) but each person paid for what they ate.   The kicker. Long before the end of the night, say an hour in, our server tells us that they are turning tables in 45 mins so we'll be asked to leave WHEN the other expected party comes in!!!!!! Are you kidding???!!! 1) don't tell me your turning tables! I know exactly what it means and it's not my problem! As paying guests with reservations, we were entitled to stay however long we chose. If staffing can't  accommodate their bookings, take it up with management. 2) keep your restaurant lingo to yourself. How you speak with patrons is just as important as the food and the wait time, since it impacts the overall experience. 3) kick someone else out!!! Our table was the last to arrive between 7-9 and it wasn't until 9 that another table left the restaurant. Oh I was watching. Maybe use those tables for your v.i.ps on the way. 4) when we leave is almost entirely up to how quickly the food is served. Slow service plus more slow service doesn't exactly equal a quick departure. All in all, we were there for 3.5 very long hours!   It's a shame. I'd be back only if they had take out!"}
{"text":"Awesome ambiance and good food with live entertainment. Great for dates!  Food is healthy and tasty."}
{"text":"Portions were small. Food was tasty but not amazing. Some menu items not available. Lack of wine choices. Was there to celebrate a friends birthday and was told to 'shhh' during the live performance and prohibited from taking photos during this time. Tipping defaulted to 20 percent. Definitely reconsider your destination for a weekday celebration with friends."}
{"text":"Came here with the Hubster for a pre-concert meal.   We had visited Barcelona last year and have had tapas on the brain since. Service was very friendly. Turns out our server is from Barcelona! She helped us navigate the menu (with my non-dairyness) and gave some recommendations.  The Food: To start, soft, crusty bread that was warm and so pillowy. It was served with a garlic tomato sauce that the Hubster would have eaten with a spoon if not for his sense of propriety. PAPAS BRAVAS - a staple. The server said these were Barcelona style, and they were very similar to what we had on our trip. A+ CALAMARES A LA ROMANA - good crunch, a bit of chew, good sauce CHAMPI√ëONES AL AJILLO - I'm a big lover of cooked mushrooms and these were fantastic. The sauce was perfect for that bread. SOLOMILLO CON TRES SALSAS - Beautifully beefy steak and great sauces. The parsley was like a punch to the face (in a good way). The Romesco was mellow and excellent. I think the mustard had cream, so I didn't try it. DATILES CON BEICON Y ALMENDRAS - Sweet, savoury, smoky, bacony... what's not to like? I might try making these at home.  We were too early for the Flamenco show, but I caught a peek of them practicing in the studio below. Looked intense.  A really great date spot, and a wonderful way to eat a bit of everything. In the end, we were stuffed with great food and Spanish wine/beer."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. The food is very average at best. No flavor. The waiters don't bother to serve water often. Very overpriced. It is EXTREMELY overpriced. $45 for sangria pitcher? $22 birthday fee?? Are you serious? Don't go here."}
{"text":"Unfortunately was a disappointing experience. Food selection is poor and very small portions, presentation is non existent and alcohol selection is poor as well! On Saturday night they had one server, the poor girl was running around and trying to keep everyone happy, I felt bad for her! She was amazing though! The show is short and lacks passion!  We were in Spain a few times and went there to relive the Spanish experience for an evening but obviously the restaurant failed to offer that. I mean if you have never been to Spain or a real Spanish restaurant then you might like it. But if you know something about Spain and Spanish food and culture this will be a disappointment ! Sorry Tapas At Embrujo"}
{"text":"Their paella was disappointing. The chicken pieces were dry and tough. The rice had no flavour. I don't recommend the paella. Had the mushrooms in garlic and olive oil. That was really good."}
{"text":"Paella Bomba was undercooked.   Parts of the rice was gritty and hard. As for the Gambas al Ajillo, despite the printed restaurant menu clearly starting it was tiger shrimp, we were served a bowl of baby shrimp!  (Definitely not the same as pictures posted in reviews).    When asked, was told recipe had changed and menu not updated.  Absolutely no offer was made by staff to take the dish back or substitute with another.  Instead, was told, \"this is how it is served in Spain\"! Service was friendly but poor attention to basics.  Water never refilled and dished never cleared with out requesting -even after table became overcrowded as new dishes arrived.  Overall disappointed with dining experience.  Would not return nor recommend."}
{"text":"Summerlicious 3 course meal for $38 is a great deal  Service is amazing!!   Tips   Make your Saturday reservations online don't miss the Spanish dual performance at7 or 9:30 - professional performer  Try their Sangria $45 for 1.5 litre"}
{"text":"I LOVED our experience at Tapas At Embrujo - what a night. The food was fantastic, the sangria was amazing, and the show was so much fun! We ordered quite a lot of food and every single dish (but one) was flavourful and delicious.   We started with two pitchers of sangria - one white, one red. Both were amazing and I drank red most of the night, but I have to say, the white sangria had a hint of cinnamon that made it simply phenomenal.   Items you MUST order: the dates, the lamb, the eggplant fries, sangria. There was so much more, but these were my absolute favourite. Also, a nice bonus - there is a check-in offer for free dessert! Our was a dense, lemon pound cake which was lovely.  The show was a flamenco dancer who also sang along with the guitar. She interacted with the audience as well, which was a nice touch. There is even a flamenco studio in the basement where you can learn all the fancy fast steps involved!   I am absolutely looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. When we tried to talk to a manager he hid from us and refused even though he was on site. The server lied to us about coffee being included. Tried to overcharge us when we were paying too. Stay away."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here. It was a deal for a set dinner. We each had an appeitizer each, then a chacuterie board, and then we share a paella. The food qas very good here.  Great quality. This place is small but I find the interior to be comfortable and inviting. The service here was good too. This place is good for dates and good for small groups of people. I would definitely come back and try out other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious 2017. (I didn't realize that I've been here before for Winterlicious 2016-- their paellas are a 40 min wait!)  It's a very classy and romantic restaurant--spanish music playing, candles and dim lighting. No one was on the stage as they normally open for dinner time, but they make an exception for lunch because of Winterlicious. The food is exceptional, definitely about quality over quantity. Staff are also very polite, professional and experienced.   I got the lobster croquette as appetizer. It was crunchy, crispy and had a flavourful garlic mayo sauce. I was surprised there was only two croquettes on the plate though.   For the entree, I got the rack of lamb. The meat was cooked perfectly, still tender and juicy. Sitting on a bed of garlic spinach and some wine reduction, I was impressed by the flavours and execution. Very tasty. My only critique here was I my plate was chipped in a few areas.  The goat cheese fritters are crispy like the croquettes. Not a fan of the jelly, but must say after the last bite, I was stuffed!   I'm glad I came here for the set meal, because paying for these three dishes at full price would be too expensive!"}
{"text":"We went here for a birthday, on a Friday night. We really enjoyed the night. They have excellent Tapas, priced accordingly. Tapas were absolutely, wonderful. We had almost all of them on the menu and they all tasted amazing. Croquettes, bacon wrapped dates, the beef, mushrooms and the shrimps were our favourites. I was not very impressed with the Paella, I have had better.  They had flamenco dancing, which was very good.  Overall, it was a very good experience."}
{"text":"Since returning from Spain last year, my friends and I have been searching high and low for an authentic and delicious tapas place in this city.  We tried to get reservations at a few places, and this spot was the only one we contacted that had a table available.  1) Ambiance: great little spot, d√©cor is understated, but still nice.  They have a super-cute patio out front.  They have live music and flamenco dancer on the weekends, we quite enjoyed the performance, but we were thankful that the performance was short, not because the music was bad, but rather because it was sooooo loud!    2) Service: our server was great, quick, and attentive.  We had ordered two dishes with similar names and the kitchen ended up serving us the same dish twice...the waiter comped us the duplicate dish and got us our original dish too.  He did forget to bill us for the 3 pitchers of sangria we had, but we pointed it out and it was quickly rectified.    3) Food and beverage: the food was delicious, but it just didn't meet my expectations or rival the tapas dishes I have been craving since returning from Spain.  I would recommend the duck dish, along with the bacon wrapped figs (though they were a little sweet).  The sangria was delicious!! Possibly best I've had in the city, however at $31/pitcher I would expect nothing less.  Overall, I did enjoy the experience, but the search for the tapas I've been craving continues.  It was great to try, but I won't be going back in the near future, since I still have a few more tapas places to check out this summer."}
{"text":"Used the $39 Travelzoo coupon. Saved $35 overall- well worth it even without the coupon, and that says a lot!  Best tapas since Spain. Excellently served and presented; waitstaff extremely polite. Lucky to find a space on the patio, table too tiny to hold 6 plates of food though!  Free bread basket with tomato sauce was a wonderful appetizer.  Lamb chops: must order. Perfectly done with fig sauce. Scallops:massive and cut like butter. Need to have something to enjoy the saffron sauce with, so save a slice of bread. Pimentos with manchego cheese: yummy, great balsamic reduction. Shrimp with chocolate orange sauce: confusing. Wouldn't order again. Nutella mixed with orange juice. Maybe I don't like chocolate... Queso with honey: I can't remember the last time I was licking honey off my fingers! The cheese was wonderfully gooey and molten and the honey complemented it just right. Calamari: was calamari."}
{"text":"Great pre-show dinner. Service was quick and friendly. Loved the croquettes, and the lamb. Calamari wasn't rings, but the batter was light and well seasoned. Red sangria had a hint of cinnamon? Wish I could've stayed longer!"}
{"text":"We were here a few weeks ago.  On Saturday nights they have a live show that was pretty impressive.  They sing and dance without a microphone!  Crazy.  It's a bit loud while the show is going on and they prefer that you keep your voices down and chatter to a minimum (understandably).  The food was so good ~ definitely worth coming here.  The prices were pretty reasonable.  We ordered the paella (the fancy one with chorizo) and a number of tapas dishes (the peppers with goat cheese was particularly yummy) and 2 bottles of wine and it was about $80 per person including tax and a fairly reasonable gratuity (18% ish).  A great experience overall."}
{"text":"Not bad, I wouldn't say Tapas at Embrujo blew my mind, but not bad.   I think it's my standards actually haha, but I've also never had Spanish food so disclaimer** I don't actually know if this is authentic!! Nonetheless it was delicious!  The waiter and hostess was extremely nice. I would of appreciated more of an attentive waiter, but I do understand he was a bit busy. As soon as I came in asking for hot water on the chilly evening, the hostess brought it out right after she sat me and my boyfriend.   Also free bread basket! Who doesn't like that!  Rack of lamb with a fresh fig sauce: MUST MUST ORDER. It's two pieces, and the sauce was perfectly sweetened. The meat fell right off.  Sirloin chunks on a bed of home cut French fries topped with a light mustard sauce: Not as great as I would of hoped to be honest.. It was more like a meat poutine without the cheese.. but it was alright.   Black angus sirloin strips served with three in house prepared sauces: MY FAVOURITE. THIS ALSO LOOKED SO AWESOME. My favourite sauce was the sweet mustard and I would have this ten thousand times over. This was what topped by 3 star to a four star.   Sauteed clams with wine and chorizo: Alright, Alright.  Fried squid served with alioli.(Calamari). ^Same as above.   Sweet piquillo peppers stuffed with Manchego cheese: Actually such a creative combination. This was delicious and inspired me to try this myself at home haha.  The ambiance has a dim lighting, like it would be great to watch a dance or watch a band play live music (as they usually do!)   Overall, I had a great experience with a lovely server, amazing food, and wine always helps right?"}
{"text":"Everything was very average including the food, drinks, service and the weekend performance.  I found their food and sangria here were made too sweet to my taste.  The duck confit was the best from what we ordered.  One thing I found weird was that the lighting was too bright for a restaurant.  I almost thought that I walked into a food court.  The lighting finally darkened a bit before the Spanish dance performance. The performance was a bit boring, and the performer's costume was not impressive."}
{"text":"Came in for a dinner and a show.  The food was ok for the most part but not spectacular.  The soup was entirely too salty.     The show was amazing."}
{"text":"Got the groupon deal, the food is better than average Spanish cuisine, the highlight will be the seafood rice, almost the best I ever had. The only downside is that there is a class going on downstairs of the restaurant, the noise from is class is kind of annoying"}
{"text":"Nice cozy place with great food.  We started with the cold soup and salad to wake up our taste buds.  Then came the Serrano and cheese board; I loved every bit on the board.  The main was Paella Bomba; it came with shrimps, mussels, squid, scallops, chicken and chorizo.  Each bomba had absorbed the flavor of the seafood and meat, and this dish was like heaven in my mouth.  A glass of sherry ended this delicious meal.  Great attentive service!"}
{"text":"Was a bit over priced for the food. Friendly environment, but can't justify the price for Hispanic food. Food quality was alright, a bit bland. The yelp check wasn't valid, did not honour their own deals. The waiters seem unsure of which tables ordered what, twice we got orders that weren't ours."}
{"text":"Eh. Pass. Overpriced and not quite worth it.   Pros:  + Service: Kind and attentive wait staff.  + Pokestop: Right on top of a pokestop. YUS.   Neutral:  Food: I got the lamb, and while it was tasty, it was a touch overcooked and was rather burnt.   Cons - Ambiance: While the decor and set up is lovely, the singers/performers were incredibly loud, bordering rude. While we were trying to enjoy our meal (which was hard to do considering the loud echoes of their music against the walls), they repeatedly tapped their feet loudly & gave bemused facial gestures to gauge our attention. I get it, cultural performances are there to add to the ambiance, but we didn't appreciate it.  - Parking: or a therelackof.  I came here for summerlicious and the overall experience makes me question whether or not I want to do summerlicious/winterlicious in the near future. Even with the discount prix-fix menu, it was vastly overpriced for what we got."}
{"text":"My mother loves this place so I took her there again for mother's day. They have a great selection of Tapas and live flamenco show which is always a highlight of visiting the restaurant.   We have been there several times but they change the menus from time to time that may not be fully updated on their website. So do make sure to check ahead if you have something particular in mind. Some of the items on the yelp photos may also no longer be available.  We had the bacon wrapped Datiles con beicon Yalmendras (bacon wrapped dates/w honey and toasted almonds) Solomillo con salsa de mostaza (sirloin with cream and mustard sauce), Cangrejo de concha suave (soft-shell crab with alioli) and Tortilla de patatas Salsa de whiskey (thick potato wedge with onion, eggs /w butter and whiskey sauce) .  The food was excellent and the flamenco performance is fantastic!  Restaurant has limited seating so do book ahead via open table or call. there's specific times for the performances daily so do check with their website or directly with the restaurant for show times so you can plan your visit accordingly.  they didn't have a great dessert menu and that's why they didn't get the 5th star from me.   But overall a great place for a special night with good food an great entertainment."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  Tapas at Embrujo was my final Summerlicious stop for this year, and I decided to try Spanish tapas food, since it's something I don't get to try that often living in Markham. Reservations were full before 8:30pm, therefore I was only able to book for 8:30pm. I was actually glad I did, as there was a Flamenco show at around 9:15pm, which was one of the best local band shows I've seen.  As for the food, I had the gazpacho, cordero castellano, and the delicias de queso de cabra. Many of the dishes I ordered, at first, seemed quite ordinary, but it's the garlic-y/wine reduction feel that really made each of the dishes stand out. The lamb chops (cordero castellano), in particular, had some sea salt added to the outside of the meat, which created an excellent effect when you bite it.  I also ordered some extra tapas, including the vieras con salsa de azafran and the champi√±ones al ajillo. The sauteed mushrooms were simply an excellent dish with the olive oil added, and the saffron sauce in the scallops tasted like mango sauce, which was quite unique.  For $35 not including the two tapas, this was definitely worth the food and the show. Technically the minimum cost is $30 if a show is happening, so in effect I paid even less!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. We were a group of 8 people for dinner time. We bought discount voucher from travelzoo. The owner refused to honour our vouchers because we bought them on the spot with our phones. We were not happy and we thought of leaving the place. We end up staying. The food, however, was very good. We left the place with the sour taste of bad service."}
{"text":"Tapas at Embrujo exceeds expectations! Great selection of beverages, hot & cold tapas + dessert. Excellent friendly service. Stay to watch the \"voodoo queen of flamenco\" Maria Serrano perform. You won't be disappointed. Toronto's closest venue to being in Sevilla, Spain. Viva Espa√±a!"}
{"text":"Not quite getting this. Wife and I had 4 tapas--each one nice, but we were in no way full.  We got the goat cheese stuffed peppers (tasty); some little fried balls of I-forget-what (tasty), the bowl of chickpea and spinach mush (not great), and the octopus in potato mash (odd-okay).  Wife had 3 glasses of wine, I had two beers.  Wth tip and tax, $150.  Good service, nice place, but left us a feeling like we spent a lot and didn't really eat dinner."}
{"text":"How disappointing!  To begin with the service was lacking and with only a few tables filled, there really was no excuse. Over 15 minutes from being seated to be offered drinks and have water brought to the table. Then an additional wait to place our order with not a word from the host/waiter as to suggestions or specials or for that matter to ask if we even had any questions. Order placed, well so we thought, as he came back 5 minutes later and asked if we were ready to order as though he had never been to our table. Again, only 6 tables filled in the restaurant at the time.  Clearly, he was too busy flirting with one table of 4 young ladies and then actually sitting at another table of a couple to take their order.  As to the food, it presented nicely but the flavors were completely overwhelmed by either garlic or hot chili flakes. I like both as much as the next person, but the seasoning was completely heavy handed, making the food less than palatable. Other items like the lobster croquette had strange consistency and barely a hint of any lobster and more just soggy breadcrumb mush. The octopus was perhaps the best of the dishes we tried but here again that garlic just had to creep back in to overwhelm the palate.    I would not recommend this place at all. There is much better tapas to be had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious with a group of friends. if you don't want to read the review here is the gist of it: Delicious, friendly service, had a fun time.  My choices for the summerlicious menu: Shrimp, Lamb, and Pear.  The shrimp is your basic fried shrimp with some chilli oil. Nothing fancy about it yet it was still tasty. The Rack of lamb was yummy. It comes with 3 decent sized racks and spinach. The spinach was sweet and tasty. I started off with eating that first then proceeded to the lamb. The lamb was juicy, tender, and tasty. For dessert I made the mistake of choosing the pear. Don't get me wrong, the pair was tasty but after trying the goat cheese from my friends I can definitely say I chose the wrong dessert lol. The goat cheese had that sweet and savory factor. It game in 3 small round bites: Tip,don't eat it whole, try biting half and just savoring the taste.  Aside from the food, we chipped in for a pitcher of sangria. It was fruity, tasty, and not overwhelming. Was a good choice!  The venue is cozy, rustic, and probably a good place for date night? They play Spanish music in the background and they have a small stage (im guessing for live Spanish bands).  Service was good as well. He gave his recommendations (like the shrimp and the goat cheese), and made sure we always had enough water with us. My friend's dish came late (5 mins) but he was always giving  her updates on it.  Wasn't disappointed. Will probably try this place again!"}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations of this place! And actually I can't complain about the food!... But the service!!!!?? OMG! We ordered food which never came to the table and what with receive came after 1 hr. When I requested to talk with the manager the server was rude and he refuse to call the manager.... DON'T GO TO THIS PLACE!!! The bill was high and the service doesn't worth the price!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever:  - Charges extra for certain items on the groupon meal not displayed on the purchase site  - When you want to order extra tapas, they'll bump the most expensive items to full price  - Runs out of their signature dish halfway through the meal, and don't tell you when you put in the order  Food is great. I just wish the person running the place is more sensible."}
{"text":"Walked by...saw there was live music...looked at the menu and we were hooked. Very authentic spanish cuisine."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a romantic, sexy place to impress that special someone... Bring them here!  Make a dinner reservation and watch the Flamenco dancer(s) while enjoying the many succulent dishes from the amazing menu.   I'm not normally a drinker, but I drool over the fruit laden Sangria (served by glass or pitcher).  If there is a heaven for fruit - then their Sangria is Fruit Heaven   Did I mention the Ambiance? Cozy seating, nice lighting, wonderful pre-dinner show and friendly service.  I read that this was voted Toronto's most romantic restaurant more than one year.   If anyone needs a dinner companion, let me know :-)"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable. Great mojitos. Service was fast and friendly. Everything we had was delicious.  Calamari, black angus chunks, peppers, lobster croquettes and pork. Great place to stop in before a concert at the Danforth."}
{"text":"This is my second time here due to their Winterlicious menu that was attractive. The decor speaks Spain and they have Flamenco dances during certain days. We went there for lunch which is prixe fix at $23 per person.   The crab croquettes were deep fried and the portion size was not the same for the plates we received. I was surprised it had cheese in the middle. Overall, not bad but would have preferred more sauce.   Then we waited like 30 mins for our entrees!!! A very long wait when I see food coming out for other tables.   The seafood paella was salty and small portioned. Definitely not the same as the ones in Barcelona!!! The squid stew dish was ok. My friend loved his steak and fries. The meat was tender and cooked right!!   Dessert came out faster, and I enjoyed the poached pear in red wine. Their 'crema catalana' was sweet and not smooth to taste.   Now the surprise part for minus one star - I had to pay for HOT water!! This is the second time for me in 2018. What???? This time I asked why and they say they do charge for it. It doesn't make sense!!!   Verdict: food is ok. (I thought they might have improved, but paella is still salty!!!!) Atmosphere is nice, but I wouldn't go back anymore. If I'm in that area, I'll probably stick to Greek good."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for a pre-show dinner. Everything was perfect! The flavours were just gorgeous and better than what the menu conveyed. Not a single miss and we ordered numerous tapas, desserts and drinks. A surprising hit among the drinks was the Sherry fizz. For the tapas, we had the peppers, steak in a mustard sauce, bacon wrapped dates and duck confit.  The sauces were just heavenly and they were generous with the bread at the table.  They were also good with our timeline. We heartily recommend this place and will come back."}
{"text":"Love the flamenco show with the Spanish guitar! Been here over a dozen times. Try the steak with fries and the cheese with honey (phenomenal). Staff is also very nice and professional."}
{"text":"Tonight I had the great pleasure to sample this establishment. My son had been there before and told me it was a wonderful place but it took me sometime before I actually managed to visit.   I loved the decor with the terracotta tiles the moment you walk in..... it's very Mediterranean. Small tables are strewn throughout the restaurant which kind of match with the small plates that they offer.   I had a house Chardonnay to start which was very bold and yet sweet and I gave myself over to the suggestions of the wonderful young waiter and said \"what do you think I should try\"?????.   The end result was six different tasting plates that were just delicious most especially the honey bacon wrapped figs. The stuffed peppers with goat cheese was scrumptious. Mushrooms, steak on top of a bed of crispy fries and olives topped everything off beautifully.   The only downside to the visit was a very noisy table in the corner who clearly didn't understand that this was a specialized venue with an incredible Flamenco show, not to be missed. And certainly not to be talked over.   Thankfully the waiter advised the table to try and dial it down just a touch so the rest of us could enjoy our Spanish flare for the evening.   I thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely go again"}
