{"text":"R.I.P.  Best food ever! We miss this place so much. Sad music now plays in my head all the time. Ever since you closed, GG."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years. Some of the best calamari I have had which is always fresh, tasty, and not chewy. I usually order flaming cheese (amazing), with either souvlaki, calamari, or sole.  Excellent, affordable meals.  Very good tzaziki.  Just have to ignore the tacky decor and you will love it."}
{"text":"This place is always empty or near empty every time I walk by and it's for a reason. I've ordered takeout pork souvlaki dinners several times just due to limited take out options in the area. I'd rank this lower than mall food court quality Greek food and the last time I got take out there, got an upset stomach, so haven't been back since. By the way, take out is all you would want to do here, as there is no ambiance, and the decor feels like the 1970s."}
{"text":"I usually only bother to review restaurants when they really disappoint as there are plenty of rave reviews going around. I really want to save people from wasting their money and time at bad places. The Greek Gourmet is one of these places. My mother had them \"cater\" her birthday party about 10 days ago. She's still apologizing; although it's not her fault. A mixed Mediterranean feast was anything but. Severely overcooked meat was the primary problem. It was supposed to be gyros, souvlaki, fillet mignon, lamb chops for the meat platter. The meat was cold and very overcooked. The Gyros were dry and cardboardy, the lamb had no life left in it. Fillet mignon; is that what the 1/8\" slices were? The chicken souvlaki was verrrrrrrrryyyyyy dry. The  tzatziki itself made my wife feel ill for the rest of the evening because the garlic level was tilting. Mushy salad, with no olives or feta.; It was supposed to be a Greek salad. that should have been an easy one. It looked like last weeks food was reheated. All in all, an unpleasant experience.  My mom did like the rice though,,,,,, I guess something was salvageable......"}
{"text":"I am honoured to be the first to review this place.  This has been one of my favourite haunts for many a year.  There are a couple of notable things:  The Tzatziki is brilliant! garlicky, lemony, tangy deliciousness.  The best way to order is to get a sandwich and split a large greek salad with whoever you're with, as I prefer the salad to rice and potatoes.  The greek salad can be a bit inconsistent, but when it is on, oh baby, it is ON.  Piquant, bursting with really good feta (I am more than a bit of a feta-snob), and just perfect.  For the record, when it's not at its best, it is still quite good.  Try the gyros on a pita, or lamb on a bun.  Definitely avoid the non-greek dishes, like falafel and hamburger.  They also have really excellent chunky fries, however if choosing between fries and salad, I always go salad."}
