{"text":"The smoked turkey BBQ sandwich was absolutely delicious! The turkey was lean and had a rich smoky flavor which paired wonderfully with the tangy sauce, red onion and pickle. The bun was dense, crunchy and buttery! 2 enthusiastic (and sauce covered) thumbs up!"}
{"text":"You know, it was ok. It wasn't amazing. It wasn't terrible.  Was it a nice change? Yes. Did it change my mind to be my go to pizza place? No.  The ribs did not taste terribly fresh. The pizza was sort of tough.  Flavors were there, just not the entire package.  The people that work there, are, FANTASTIC. Sweet, honest, sincere people that are doing what they love.  I think that just a little more finesse, and they will be unbeatable.  I walk past the place often, and never smell a smoker going, makes me wonder how the ribs are really made? Just grilled? I don't know."}
{"text":"Cappy's storefront wasn't special, just a regular pizza shop look inside. But the food was damn good. I have had bad pizza on so many occasions its nice to find a good one, well priced and made quick. We showed up late, almost closing time, the man inside was super accommodating and didn't make us feel like he couldn't wait to leave lol, like some people do! I was satisfied and got a discount with my yelp coupon. Also, he wasn't' concerned with a penny here or there, he let us throw our drink on the coupon even though it made us over by a few cents. Damn good people! There was a parking spot right out front, which was nice because there weren't any nearby for other shops."}
{"text":"This place was pretty disappointing. The thought of pizza and ribs together is an amazing thing. Sadly, I think both the pizza and ribs were lacking. Pizza had absolutely no flavor, which I believe is from lack of seasoning in the sauce. Also didn't care much for the crust. Ribs were mediocre at best. Will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Darren brought home their ribs and pizza and I love him for it! The ribs were so tender and rich and had an amazing sauce. This Southern girl dug the hell out of them. The pizza has a good crust and sauce and cheese and my request for pineapple wasn't frowned upon."}

I recalled riding past Cappy's last week when traveling through the South Hills and thought to myself \"Nice, more BBQ options.\" Well, last night, we finally had a chance to try some since Kay astonishingly was craving both BBQ and pizza. 

When I went to pick up my order, I was greeted by a group of people mixed in terms of age and led by a man with long, wizardly white hair and a bandana. If Santa Claus was a biker and cooked BBQ, he'd look like the man I assume was the owner. I'll call him the Pit King. 

\"Have you been here before?\" 

\"No, I have not.\"

\"Young man, you are in for a treat. I've been down South and have learned from the masters. We'll be competing at cook-offs soon.\" Self-assured he was.

In one flat box was a medium pizza with pineapple and bacon. In the other was a full rack of ribs flanked by small containers of potato salad and cole slaw. 

Lordy, lordy, that sauce, that bloody, intoxicatingly tart sauce, one that attract hungry bears from miles around with its honey, its booze, its vinegar, its...sticky, sticky, consistency possessing those PHAT and PHATTY St. Louis Ribs that Nature had already blessed with meat aplenty.  Lips were smacked, fingers were licked; Kay and I had become libidinous teens in a steamy car feasting instead of heavy petting. 

The potato salad and cole slaw were both exceptionally creamy and flavorsome. 'Tis a shame Cappy's doesn't give more than a 1/4 a pound to an order.

The pizza came next, winning shiningly with cheese that tasted dairy-fresh, a wonderfully seasoned crust that was as crisp as it was chewy, and a rich-as-a-millionaire sauce that I reckon is prepared carefully, clandestinely, lovingly in large basement pots. 

Yes, Cappy's is yet another pizza place and BBQ joint. Welcome them, embrace them. May they up the ante all the more for both pies and pork make the game a little more interesting."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this shop. We have been making pizza at home for years because we always felt that we could do better than the local pizza shops, but Cappy's has us beat. We haven't made pizza at home since we started eating here. 

We ordered a Margherita Pizza, a Philly Cheesestake Hogie and an order of Ribs, and all were excellent. I never thought the quality of a pizza crust could make such a big difference - but it does. The crust is crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside and absolutely perfect. You can tell their oven is legit. 

My boyfriend said that the Philly Cheesestake was the best he'd ever had - which is saying something considering we just went to Philadelphia and had the \"authentic\" sandwhich a couple of weeks ago. 

As other reviewers have said, the ribs are fall-off-the-bone delicious. They are craving inducing.

We picked up our order and the service was good. A taller man with glasses waited on us very attentively. 

Overall, definitely worth the money. I would expect to pay a lot more for food of this quality."}
