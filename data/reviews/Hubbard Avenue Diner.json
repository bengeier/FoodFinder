{"text":"It is really hard for me to give a breakfast restaurant a rating above 3. Hubbard Avenue Diner comes close. This place is seat yourself and is very casual. The meals come with some delicious biscuits instead of disappointing pancakes or english muffins smothered in butter. Also, the food is good and the menu is an average size as far as breakfast places go. The staff has always been very friendly and that has made for some favorable experiences."}
{"text":"I went to Hubbard Avenue Diner for the first time for dinner on a Tuesday night. We were seated promptly and our server brought us water right away. The place was pretty busy for a Tuesday, and it seemed like they were well staffed.  We had a tough time choosing what to order, since everything sounded pretty good. In the end, I went with the white chicken chili (which the menu said they were famous for) and my friend went with a burger and fries.  The food arrived a while later. I've got to say, mine was the least white White Chicken Chili I'd ever seen, but it was really delicious! A nice mix of beans, chunks of chicken, and a flavorful base, topped with cheese and green onions. My friend reported that her burger was \"what she expected\", typical diner fare.  After our waiter brought the food, it was tough to get his attention. When eventually I asked for a box, he disappeared for several minutes. My companion pointed out that the boxes were within a few steps of our table. I almost got up to grab one myself when he finally returned.  The service wasn't that great, but the food was pretty good. I'd like to return for breakfast, and to try some of their ridiculously good-looking desserts!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!!! The staff is super nice, friendly & helpful... They offer cookies, cakes & pies too( which are on display)... I have yet to try these but I shall.... perhaps my next visit.....The restroom is kept clean too.. looks like an updated 50s kinda joint... fun, relaxing, enjoyable..some place to bring the visiting relatives... oh yeah.... they don't have(at least summer of 2013) hot dogs... have cheeseburgers but no hot dogs(?)....I'm not one for hot dogs but thought you should know..."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of a glass case full of desserts and this diner has two-a large case full of mostly pie but also some cheesecake, carrot cake, cookies, etc. and a tall rotating case full of pies. The pie flavors change seasonally and most I've had are pretty satisfying-a few seem like they have food coloring added and I tend to stay away from those (this is why the glass case is very useful).  Other than the dessert case ... this place is made to look like a classic diner but the food is perhaps a bit more 'updated.' The veggie bean burger is my favorite-not like a prefab 'veggie burger' but more like a thick lump of refried black beans on a bun-a little messy. Good if you love beans and want to eat them like a burger but probably not as good if you really wish you were eating a burger but are a vegetarian.  The shakes here are also good. The service is ok. There is sometimes a wait but it usually goes fairly quickly. Families with kids are abundant.   Very similar to Monty's Blue Plate on the east side (same parent company)-Monty's seems to have more vegetarian options and fewer types of pies."}
{"text":"First time visitor to the state of Wisconsin, Middleton to be exact, and I imagined it to be a picturesque hamlet of pastures and barns. Uh, no. Though the scenery was more than a little anticlimactic, this diner, may be its saving grace.  Granted, we only had coffee and dessert, in my case the lemon meringue pie, it was fantastic!  The decor is a mix of two of my favorites, diner on the inside and deco on the outside   The staff was prompt and courteous and since I'm here for a couple more days, I'll be back"}
{"text":"Though I do not live in the area, whenever I am, I make time for Hubbard Ave. I love the food and the atmosphere. The menu is large and the staff is friendly. Can never go wrong with the bakery! Recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"Delish. Great service and ambiance. I showed up with 7 friends for brunch and they pushed tables together for us. I enjoy the blue berry pancakes and the veggie egg benedict but I have never had anything here that wasn't tasty."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites in Middleton.  The food is consistently very good.  Not spectacular, but very good.  The burgers are delicious but nothing out of the ordinary.  There are some other good meat dishes as well; the fried chicken is good and the meatloaf is supposedly excellent (I've personally never tried it).  There are also some good pasta dishes, which you wouldn't expect from a diner.  The parmesan penne is always a favorite, and the double-deluxe mac & cheese is 100% Wisconsin goodness.    There are also many sandwiches and salads, ensuring that there's something for everybody.  The servings are large but not humongous.  Good thing, because you definitely want to save room for the pie.  I haven't explored the pie selection in depth, but there are numerous different flavors available every day and many seasonal flavors as well.  I usually stick with the Key Lime pie, which is probably the best I've had in Wisconsin.  The apple is also delicious.  The service has always been friendly and attentive, but it takes a while to get your food.  It's easy to see why; Hubbard Avenue Diner is constantly busy.  Waits for seating are common on Fridays and Saturdays, although Sunday evenings are quieter.  Good as this place is, I don't think it's quite worth a fifteen-thirty minute wait.  There are many other great restaurants in the area that could seat you right away.  All in all, a very positive dining experience.  I've been there often and never left disappointed.  Reasonable prices and good food, with excellent pies.  Recommended if you are in the area or are generally a fan of other Food Fight Inc. restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is consistently great. Responsive service, tasty food, large portions, and good value."}
{"text":"This place really hits the spot. They've got a classic diner menu but with better than diner food. I've eaten here for almost every meal type (Lunch, breakfast) and have enjoyed everything. Nice selections on the menu-not super wide variety but enough to choose from.  Of course, the PIE. delish. Peaches and cream is basically just cream, but I loved it. I often stop in for a slice of pie alone. I think 5 bucks for a slice is a bit high, but the slices are too big for one. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fun and Yum!  Went with a party of 13 and had the Chicken Pot pie as suggested by my niece who loves this place.  It was excellent diner food and I loved the hot apple sauce.  My son had the Chicken and Chips.  He loved it.  The pies were nice.  Love the Shirts and stickers.  Loved the authentic feel.  Service was good.  Friendly and helpful for our large group."}
{"text":"I stop in for pie every time I'm in the area for business. I pick up pieces for everyone in the family. This trip, I picked up strawberry cheesecake, oreo cheesecake and French silk and ate the strawberry cheesecake right away. Oh yum!!!! I had to go back for more before I headed home!"}
{"text":"Coming from the established Food Fight Inc. chain that holds several other Madison staples (Bluephies, Monty's), often seeming inclined towards breakfast, the Hubbard Avenue Diner comes across more as a decent straightforward diner than an update with a twist delighter.      Offering an expected array of breakfast combos, burgers, and sandwiches.  With a guarenteed wait period for a saturday or sunday midday.    Hubbard delievers what you'd expect for a fair price.  If you're in Middleton looking for a breakfast staple you're set.  If you destiny calls you to a grander morning feast head inbound."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch because the two other cafes in the area close earlier. I was surprised to find that the comparable menu items I would normally order at other establishments were significantly more expensive for smaller portions. I decided not to overpay and only had salad. I now remember why this is our Restaurant of last last resort.  tl/dr: Overpriced!"}
{"text":"Hands down the most over priced mediocre dinner I have been to. I had 3 eggs, double bacon, a single pancake, and a soda. My bill came to $19.88. That's absurd. The bacon was just regular greasy spoon bacon that wasn't even hot. I asked for my eggs \"soft scrambled\" and they were just regular scrambled and not that good. Pancake was just okay And my Diet Pepsi was flat. Just horrible. So with a $5 tip I spent almost $25 on a truly mediocre breakfast. Monty's Blue Plate is vastly superior. I could have saved myself $10 and had better food at Perkins."}
{"text":"Kind of a cute place, although a bit kitschy. The pulled pork sandwich was greasy and messy, but decent, but the banana cream pie contained gray bananas and left something to be desired. The coconut cream pie that a friend ordered was delicious!"}
{"text":"Good food, but maybe a bit more then average price.  I had the meatloaf dinner last time we were in and it was good if a little drier and heavier then Mom made when I was a kid.  My wife really liked her food and I enjoyed mine.  The atmosphere is pleasant if busy. Overall a nice experience.  Would recommend the pies."}
{"text":"If you love pie, this is the place to go.  They have a lot of variety to pick from. The food is a also very good. I love the Caesar salad there and they had an amazing beer cheese soup one day. Always happy after dining there."}
{"text":"What a great place.  Good food and great service.  Hint:  if you don't want to wait ask to sit at the counter.  And the National Mustard Museum is right next door!"}
{"text":"I love the Reubens! Dessert is delicious. Friendly wait staff. Often very busy and noisy. Decent prices and family friendly.  Piece of"}
{"text":"It was a gorgeous morning, so we sat outside after a 30 minute wait.. which wasn't bad, because we strolled around the area. Our waiter was amazing, since he took our order and the table's order next to us without writing it down. He was very pleasant and impressive! Our food arrived without much delay. It was all delicious and fresh. We LOVED it. Great place, will definitely return when in Madison."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday night with the boy for a slice o'pie after his positive reviews. This establishment is so cute--classic diner vibe down to the rotating pie case by the door! I think it would be nice for a date (first date maybe?), although I haven't tried the savory food. He got the fudge bottom silk pie and I got a strawberries 'n' cream slice. These slices are HUGE.. so don't be frightened by the nearly $5/slice price. His fudge bottom was very tasty, but it wasn't a silk pie like I'd ever had before.. it had a texture sort of like pudding with extra gelatin in it. My strawberries 'n' cream was half macerated strawberries mixed in with whipped cream and half whipped cream. So delicious! I am a girl who loves homemade whipped cream, and this pie was my kinda dessert. I wish the crusts were a little bit more substantial, but they are really just a vehicle for what's inside the pie!"}
{"text":"Always good service, and decent food. I'm a fan of the white chicken chili, and their strawberry rhubarb pie. You'll typically wait"}
{"text":"It is ok.  My folks love it, I think it is ok in a pinch.  This morning I had the corned beef has with eggs over easy.  Eggs were over something and the has was tired and dry.  Like I said, ok in a pinch but not my favorite spot."}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere is so homey, and it truly looks and feels like a little cozy diner. The milkshakes are delicious, and I love that they give you the ENTIRE milkshake that they made, with the extra that doesn't fit in the cup in a metal container on the side. The burgers and fries are good too, but I always end up getting the mac and cheese - yum! Also, don't skip dessert - the pies are heavenly."}
{"text":"We have been going to Hubbard since it opened and have always enjoyed the food......until tonight. After waiting 45 minutes politely for our food we finally complained. The waitress could not tell us why our food was taking so long while everyone around us got their food. We also never got drink refills or even a check during this 45 minutes. Even after the complaint it took another 15 minutes for the food to come. And it wasn't complicated food. So...the easy over eggs were hard and dry and the pancakes were cold. My husband refused to eat it. The hamburger was dry.  While we were told we didn't need to pay for this undesirable meal we were very disappointed when a manager couldn't even come to the table to apologize.  This was definitely our last visit.  My question though is has Food Fight gotten too big to run well managed restaurants?"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Hubbard Ave Diner many times.  Great pie, good service, average food, really inconsistent execution by the kitchen.  If they aren't busy, you've got a good chance to have your order arrive correct (as in get what you ordered as you ordered it) and hot.  If they are busy, forget it.  They really need to have an expediter in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Food was good here. Looks like management has changed. Had omelet had canned tomatoes and mushrooms. Hashbrowns could bounce off the wall. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Awesome attention to detail. Very crowded. Sat at the counter with a large group. All of us had changes or modifications to our food orders. Not one of us had our food come out wrong. Thank you. And of course dessert was sublime."}
{"text":"LOVE the Fudge Bottom Pie, absolutely thee best. Recently tried the Patriotic Pie (waste of $). If you enjoy yogurt + a soggy bottom crust perhaps you'll enjoy this pie. Looked forward to a fresh BERRY pie with blueberries, strawberries, raspberries. Where's the berries?  Majority was what they call cream, yet taste exactly like yogurt with very few berries scattered on top. For the price, & season sure berries are affordable. Unable to recommend. The ONLY good thing about it was the very \"small sliver\" for the price.  Unable to recommend. Every other pie of theirs we've tried have all been delicious, with outstanding flakey crust(s)."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far since moving to Madison this summer; once for Friday night fish fry, once for brunch (ordered a quiche & hash brown special, which came w/ sweet bread and a fruit cup). The fish fry was quite good -- light, flaky, a bit greasy but that was to be expected. Fries were tasty. The brunch special, though, was pretty mediocre. Friends dining with me on that occasion were underwhelmed as well. But for a nearby diner, the styling of the place is OK, service satisfactory, and love the pi t-shirt slogans. Speaking of which, have yet to try the pie -- next time!"}
{"text":"I was in town for training and someone recommended this place. I got an oreo milkshake and a quarter fried chicken dinner with waffle/crisscut fries. The shake was perfect. The fries were so cripy and well seasoned. I would totally come back just for those. The fried chicken was tender and crispy. I did not like the roll that much. It reminded me of a popover. I would definitely come back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great place for families. Wonderful staff and very good food. Not to mention the pies. Great place to get holiday pies and a bonus as locally owned which is getting harder to find in the Middleton area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  excellent service. Hash was okay. Biscuit was good. Collectivo coffee. Taking pie home to try."}
{"text":"I have only been for breakfast.  We were seated promptly on a busy holiday morning.  My pancakes were good and my wife's omelette was good as well.  Both times I visited for breakfast their was a steady stream of people coming in.  No one has to wait too long nor are their a bunch of empty tables, a sign of a good restraunt in my opinion.  Next time I'm in Madison I'll be back for breakfast and one of these times I'm gonna grab a slice of Pie too!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, pretty good pies, nice menu, dishes are fresh.  Going there is a pick me up for sure."}
{"text":"Yes, I know that this is not an old dinner, it's just made up to look like one, but I'm still sold on that gimmick. It looks great. They have a great variety of omelets and pancakes for breakfast in quantities enough for a lumberjack. Usually, you can get counter space if the tables are full. Regardless, service has never been slow. A little high price than your average place for brunch, but worth it once in a while. Also, the pies are great for a late night dessert."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Had a Reuben with waffle fries, iced tea, and slice of banana cream pie. The Reuben was passable, but unremarkable. The meat seemed like cheap, reconstituted pre-packaged sandwich slices rather than quality deli cuts. The pie was completely average, with a crust that tasted like club crackers and was quite salty. The portions were underwhelming, especially the paltry slice of pie, which, for a whopping $4.89 really should have been much more substantial, or much more delicious. I spent just shy of $20 on lunch for a single person, which, for this level of quality is entirely too much. For someone who grew up eating at small-town greasy spoons, this place is a definite miss. There are plenty of spots around where you can get better diner food for a much more reasonable price."}
{"text":"Great location, great atmosphere, great service and delicious food.  We had White chicken chili and turkey pesto blt. Had an awesome pie at the end. Will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"I have a punchcard for their pies. The pie flavors change seasonally and are always amazing. You get HUGE slices too. The only one I haven't liked (after about 20 tries) is the grasshopper. Blubarb is my hands down favorite, followed by pumpkin."}
{"text":"GREAT PIES!!!  This review -- and my rating -- are for the bakery ...and, in particular, for the PIES!!!  For many years, my wife and I have been stopping in Middleton on our annual trek to Spring Green.  Although Spring Green's \"House on the Rock Resort\" and its \"American Players Theatre\" are wonderful, currently, the city is simply not a food hotspot.  But Middleton is another matter -- it has many restaurants and multiple bakeries to consider!  This year, on a beautiful, mid-August Saturday in Middleton, we stocked-up at Clasen's European Bakery, had a brat at their outdoor brat stand, walked next door to Culvers for a banana split, drove a few blocks to the infamous National Mustard Museum (where we replenished our depleted mustard reserves) and walked next door to the Hubbard Avenue Diner.  This was our second visit to the diner, but I had almost forgotten how great their bakery was.  As soon as you walk through their doors, you are standing in front of their bakery case, which is always loaded with tall cakes and beautiful pies.  This year, though, as I was standing before their showcase, I felt that I was in the \"National Pie Museum\"!!!  So much good stuff!!!  My apologies to the young lady behind the counter for all of my questions and for my \"kid in a candy store\" enthusiasm (she was very kind to me, though, smiled and answered all of my questions).  Eventually, my wife and I selected three slices of pie to go.  I ordered a Hot Fudge Malt and a Strawberry Shortcake (it looked like a double decker Strawberry pie!).  My wife ordered a Butterscotch Meringue.  We placed the three individually-boxed slices into our cooler and drove to the hotel.  Our plan was to rest for an hour, take a shuttle to the theatre and to sample our desserts upon our return.  Neither of us could wait that long -- we dug into them right away!  Here is what we found...  The Hot Fudge Malt pie was very good and flavorful, but just slightly heavy for someone who has had too much to eat.  The Strawberry Shortcake pie, however, was a surprise -- it was actually vey light, very moist, fresh, flavorful and tasted almost exactly like strawberry shortcake.  Even the crust was excellent.  This was my favorite.  As my Chocolate Malt pie was to me, my wife's Butterscotch pie was slightly too heavy for her (remember that we had already had a lot to eat!).  That said, although I usually don't like butterscotch, if I had had any room left, I would have eaten the whole thing!  Still, that Strawberry Shortcake pie is still my favorite.  I'd like to add it to my daily diet!!!  Moral of this story -- go for the pie and bring your appetite ...and maybe a camera, too!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, perfectly-sized plate of food for a good price. Homemade biscuits are to die for, and I'm usually not a biscuit fan. Wait was a little long, but to be expected mid-morning on Sunday. Will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Hubbard several times. I am usually pleased with their food and service. It's not the food I have an issue with... it's the pie. Which is weird because that is what they are all about. I have had tried a few of their pies, and I'm not impressed. The worst one was the banana cream pie... that is the nastiest piece of pie I have ever had. The bananas were firm but slimy, like they had been coated in something to preserve them? I don't know, but the pie didn't have much flavor at all. The other pies I have tried are key lime, and I think it was a peanut butter cup one. The peanut butter cup chocolate one was ok, and the key lime again had no flavor. Your pies are pretty pitiful, which is pathetic considering that is what you all try to be famous for. I will continue to go back for the food but I'm pretty sure tonight's banana cream pie nastiness will prevent me from buying an over priced crappy piece of pie again!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Father's Day.  The wife had the tuna gyro & fries with the French silk pie for dessert, I had the blackened chicken sandwich & waffle fries with raspberry rhubarb pie.  My son (3yo) had the cheese burger & apple sauce from the kids menu.  The wife said the tuna in her gyro was dry and overcooked but enjoyed it overall.  My sandwich was pretty tasty but the waffle fries were only luke warm.  Disappointing when there is an extra charge for those.  The French silk pie was too rich!  We couldn't eat more than a bite each and took the rest home. Apparently this is their most popular dessert.  The raspberry rhubarb pie was excellent.  Service was efficient if not particularly friendly.  Our server did seem to get overwhelmed as the place began to fill up.  It took ages for her to bring us the check.  This place is very kid friendly so stay away if you hate the sound of noisy kids.  The tiled floors and open plan nature of the restaurant made the screaming and crying carry really well!  I suspect we would have enjoyed it more if we'd gone for breakfast instead."}
{"text":"Hubbard Ave is my go-to brunch spot when I'm looking for hash browns, omelets and pancakes (or corned beef hash or meatloaf of the gods). Especially when friends are in towns, since they love the home-cooking feel and the Mustard Museum is right next door. (The Mustard Museum is perfect for a short walk when I've eaten too much at Hubbard Ave Diner, which is every time.) Brunch is a solid four stars, every time.  The extra star is dedicated to their Strawberry Shortcake.  June 14, 2013 was Strawberry Shortcake day and pies were on sale. I had friends in town, so I thought - what a great excuse to buy a pie! I almost ate half the pie before they arrived (oops!) The pie was covered in whip cream so frosty cool it was almost like ice cream. The shortbread was light and moist and covered in fresh strawberries. It was the perfect combination of whipped cream, shortbread and strawberries. I ate this pie last week and I'm still daydreaming/talking to my co-workers about it.   Thank you, Hubbard Avenue Diner, for all that you do."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with both the food quality and service, but have only been there once so hopefully my experience was atypical. The frittata was bland. Copious amounts of tabasco were needed. The service was very poor. Waited a long time for a menu, and had to repeatedly ask for coffee and condiments from a server who, although not rushed, just did not seem to care."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab breakfast or brunch.  Expect a wait on the weekends.  The food and service are top notch."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this diner for years--mostly based on breakfast experiences, but the past couple of visits have brought it down from a better rating in terms of both food and service.  The interior of Hubbard's has a fun, 50's diner decor that was once a novelty, but now seems a dated trend  --and something for which you pay extra to maintain.   On a visit today, my spouse and I asked about an item we had previously loved on the menu, and were told by \"Kara\" the waitress (who is too good for her job)--that it had been taken off the menu over a year ago.  Not, \"so sorry, we no longer carry that\" or \"i'll pass along your feedback to the mgt\" or \"you're right, that was great\"--just an impatient attitude that we hadn't kept up with the Hubbard Universe of Menu Updates and were wasting her valuable time and attention.  The waitress also went through the motions when it came to service--putting down the plates and asking if we needed anything else as we watched her back walking away from us.  We had to call out and stop her in her tracks for Tabasco---and got the hand. No drink refills, no plates cleared, nothing.  It was the end of the Sunday brunch rush, there were fewer and fewer patrons, and one could sense the changing of the guards, but still. Although we had planned to take advantage of bringing home a slice of pie or another tempting treat from the extensive bakery, our waitress's indifference and later ongoing disappearing act changed our minds--we felt lucky to get the check without waiting forever.  As far as the food goes, our omlettes were delicious, filled with fresh and generous ingredients, but the hashed browns had been on the grill far too long and were practically inedible. Too bad no one asked--not the waitress or the hostess, who never said a word--about anything-- upon our arrival or departure.   The prices at Hubbard's have risen yet again--but the quality of the food and service have not.    Throughout our latest meal, various workers were scurrying about to finish their side work and clean the floors--one young woman was vigorously sweeping  a pile of restaurant floor ICK right next to our table--clearly raising dust --and taking away our appetites.  I understand that this work must be done--but how about some consideration for patrons who are still trying to eat without dust as a condiment?  If the same vigor had been applied to giving service to diners as was given to the workers' desire to  clean up and leave, we certainly would have had a better experience."}
{"text":"We came here on the advice of some locals for dessert. I had a slice of pie there and left with a box of delicious apple pie as a souvenir. While I can't vouch for anything from the \"food\" menu, I will say that they have very solid pies. The decor is charming, too."}
{"text":"Think I've died and gone to heaven. Got the tuna gyro with mixed greens and it was DELICIOUS! My plate was overflowing with vinegary dressed greens and a warm, fluffy pita loaded with a generous grilled tuna steak, lightly roasted tomatoes, red onions, and a yogurt dill sauce. I am hooked and already counting the days until I can go back! Wow!"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome spot to take the family, especially those with younger kids. The service is always speedy and friendly, but sometimes the food takes a bit long even when they aren't packed to gills. The pie is delicious. The menu is broad and there is something for everyone. I am partial to their blue cheese and bacon burger."}
{"text":"i like this spot, but it's kind of frustrating. it advertises itself to be gluten-friendly, but it's not. pointing to the crouton-free-salads and bun-free-burgers on the menu as the gluten-free options is not really being gluten-friendly (this during hours when they randomly decide to not serve actual gluten-friendly dishes like the delicious blackened catfish).   and for a spot that has a whole room of baked goods (pies, cakes, cookies, muffins, cupcakes, etc.), i am really surprised they do not provide ANY gluten-free options, whether it comes from their kitchen, or the nearby silly yak (who serves many madison/middleton-area restaurants). c'mon folks...  again, i dig this place. they just need to step their game up."}
{"text":"I go here all the time, because it is consistently good. Burgers, wraps, reubens, are all solid. The fried chicken special on Thursday and Saturday is fantastic, and the pies are also really top notch.  Some people have complained about the price, but I dont get it. When it is close to $9 to go to Culvers, here you get a REAL burger and fries for the same price.  Malts and shakes are great old school in the stainless tumbler, and they have real good coffee too.  Their breakfasts are also much better than standard diner fare, with fresh ingredients, and well prepared biscuits and hash browns."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by our server at the Free House for dessert. Hubbard seems like an old-school diner but we were told it's actually only been around for 15 years or so and that the decor and building were all new. So that was a little disappointing. The thing here is the pie. We all had some. My husband really liked his lemon meringue. even though he said he'd bad better. I went with the apple-blueberry. It was decent but to be honest, I've definitely had better. They serve Sassy Cow ice cream and also make shakes and have a full menu. I think if I were to go back, it would mainly be for the ambiance, which is really fun. Other than sheer number of pies and cakes they have, I don't really see anything super special about it. They don't seem to use natural or organic ingredients, either. Overall, it was fun and I'm glad it exists but could definitely be improved upon."}
{"text":"I ordered take out with my girlfriend 4 minutes ago after getting done with a long shift at work. To my complete surprise when I opened my chicken pot pie... it was SMALLER then what you would buy at any grocery store. I'm sorry but when you pay 12$ for a meal that should be considered a platter you should get MORE then a cup of soup. I got exactly the opposite.  My chicken pot pie came half full in a small soup container. You should be ashamed Hubbard ave diner for serving up such a pathetic  excuse for a meal."}
{"text":"Boy this used to be a 4-5 stars for me, but the last two times we had to wait for our food way too long and it came out cold and didn't taste very good.  I do like their white chicken chili and their pie."}
{"text":"Our office got lunch from Hubbard Avenue Diner today, I ordered the Reuben with a side of spring mix and lemon vinaigrette - $10.29 before tax and tip.  Essentially everything on the menu is around $10 or more. The cheapest meal anyone ordered was a cheeseburger and fries for $9.69 (plus tax and tip). Maybe it was the take away containers, but the portions don't seen to justify the price.  The Reuben arrived on a thick, buttery slices of rye with a thin layer of thousand island dressing and sauerkraut. The mixed greens were a bit wilted from being packaged with the hot sandwich, the dressing was very light and refreshing, contrasting the heavy lunch sandwich. The corned beef between the sandwich was ample enough, but I wouldn't go as far to call it generous.  I think, next time I will just stick with their pies and cakes, because unlike their menu items, those warrant the respective sticker price.  A couple of co-workers remarked the Burger was \"disgusting\", with gristles of fat rendering the beef patty  unappealing and inedible. The patty was dry, and they guess from the taste was made from the cheapest quality of meat."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with the breakfast.  High price, lower quality.  It is pretty hard to screw up hash browns but they were able to do it."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the rave reviews are about. Meals are mediocre at best. They do have excellent cookies. Waitress told us that most of the pies are NOT baked from scratch but brought in. They don't taste like \"home made  fromscratch\" Very misleading. For a village diner it's ok and will do in a pinch. But there are much better places to eat."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have been consistently impressed. The food is great - good variety, with clearly labeled vegetarian and vegan options. Amazing desserts. The wait staff is super polite and very accommodating."}
{"text":"First time for us to eat at this diner in Middleton Wisconsin. I had the delicious turkey burger which was on a wheat bun with leaf lettuce tomato pickle and a little bit of avocado served with a side of warm apple sauce. It was delicious. My husband said that the chocolate walnut pie that he ate was delicious. Our server Ellia was excellent and all the wait staff were very helpful and professional. They all were very busy and never stopped moving. All the bakery goods looked awesome in the cases and were made fresh daily. All the waitstaff wore comical T-shirts about pies and the t-shirts are for sale at a reasonable price. A fun place and reasonably priced with delicious food."}
{"text":"We used them to cater three events at my office and they were AMAZING!!! I would totally recommend using them as a cater. Jose was very accommodating to my special requests and I believe they went above and beyond what they had to do for us. The desserts were always the biggest hit of the meal. We had pies one day, carrot cake another and sugar cookies the other day. Everyone raved about it! We will be using them again for sure."}
{"text":"Very solid food. The menu has a good variety of food with both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. It's not the fanciest food, but when I have visitors or when we can't decide where to go, this is just a good solid option that will have something for everyone."}
{"text":"Delicious! First of all, they serve local coffee (Colectivo), so major props for supporting locally owned small-ish businesses. Second, the pies. Upon entering the door, you are greeted by a display case of sumptuous pies that make you cringe at the thought of having to admit that they taste better than your mother's. In addition to these two delights, they also serve a full menu of breakfast and lunch plates that are sure to please. I ordered the southwest eggs benedict, which were served on two pieces of corn bread and had a salsa sauce instead of traditional hollandaise. I also had a slice of the strawberry sour cream pie for breakfast-dessert. My friends shared bites of their French silk pie and key lime pies, which were also divine. Service was friendly, attentive and patient, and made for an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Hubbard has some fun options for breakfast or lunch. This is the non-hippy, Westside version of Monty's Blue plate, the beefy brother (although this establishment has vegetarian options, vegans should stick to Monty's).   First, they kept the dill pickle version of the reuben sauce (shame on Monty's for that sweet pickle junk): so lovers of reuben's (tofu, turkey, or pastrami) this is the place to be! PS. they have all 3 \"meat\" options here - hallelujah!  Second, can anyone scream WAFFLE FRIES?!?!?!? GET IT!  Third, they got cooks in the kitchen who truly understand South-of-the-Border breakfast options.... they are all good (southwest Eggs Bene - uses cornbread vs english muffin, get a side of green and/or red salsa to top it off; Huevos Rancheros; Breakfast Quesadilla)  Fourth, breakfast club is pretty decent, get it with a poached egg and goo ensues!  Fifth, see first - Reuben with Turkey - OMG  Sixth, burgers, (I sub turkey for beef, but it's still great)  Seventh, turkey dinner anytime.... GRAVY? moist turkey? home-made mashed potatoes with lumps? cranberry sauce with little cranberry bodies? oh yes, thank you, please and double please!  Eighth, on Saturdays - Fried Chicken - not as salty (nor garlicky) as I like it, but home-cookin and hits the spot.   Ninth, Fried Fish on Friday - same as chicken, not as salty, but hits the spot. Nothing frilly (no beer battered), but it's a good clean fish fry, with fixin's.  Tenth, PIE PIE PIE PIE PIE PIE PIE PIE  Eleventh, COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE  Twelfth, other people order the salads. With all the above options, I never understand it, but they must be crowd-pleasers. They are rich and FULL, big bowls. Maybe someday, that salmon one looks yummy.   Alas, the drawback is alcohol. You'd think the food fight group would be wild about alcohol here, but it's a simple, modest beer selection only. Alcohol is NOT the center piece; just good ol' home cookin'."}
{"text":"I'm perplexed as to why this place is always so busy. In my 17 years living in the Madison area I have given it 3 tries. I must decide it \"deserves another shot\" every 5 years or so. I mean, all those people waiting for a table can't be wrong, can they? Well, in my opinion, yes. After my visit today, I can say that it will receive no more business from me (except pie maybe...the pie looks awesome!)  So, today I decided to have a mommy/daughter date with my 4 year old. It has been a good 5 years since I was last at Hubbard and I thought this might be a fun environment for a lunch date with a little one. We got there, put in our name, and waited about 20 minutes. Which is fine, I'm willing to wait for good food. Now, let me just bullet point my experience:  *Order a cookies and cream malt to split. Very nice size and she puts it in a glass for each of us. Not as thick as I like from a diner malt but very tasty. Things are off to a good start. After we receive that we place our order for a chicken panini sandwich with goat cheese spread and avocado (me) and macaroni and cheese (daughter).  *After around 20 minutes our waitress comes over and says that she is so sorry, but she forgot to put our order in. Not to worry, though, she put a \"rush\" on it.  *We wait about 5 more minutes and 4 year old has to use the potty. I let the waitress know so that she won't think we left (because at this point a lot of people may have just walked out).  *Ugh. No soap in the bathroom. This is unacceptable to me...my 4 year old balances on a toilet by holding onto the sides of it. That combined with just using a restroom in general...no. We will not touch food now without washing our hands. So I take her out and tell the waitress who is kind enough to let us wash our hands at the sink near the kitchen. She also told someone to put soap in bathroom. At this point I am still optimistic and a good lunch could turn the whole experience positive.  *We get to table and daughter's mac 'n cheese is sitting there. My food comes right out as we sit down.  *My chicken panini is NOT a panini. It is not pressed at all. The chicken breast is unseasoned and tastes microwaved. I take two bites, the first one is tendony (if that's a word) and the second one is so chewy I have to drink water to get it down. Also, the flavors were not incorporated together at all. The goat cheese and avocado (some of which was brown) was just thrown on. In a panini, normally, the flavors meld together because of the pressing. But, like I said, this was not a panini. My fries are decently good so I stop eating the sandwich and stick to the fries.   *I notice daughter is picking at her mac 'n cheese. She LOVES mac 'n cheese so this is odd. I ask her how it is and she replies, \"I guess I don't have wish magic.\" What?? \"Because I wished for good macaroni and cheese and I don't like this.\" Hmm. Now come on kid, how can it be that bad? \"Try it mama.\" So I did. And I wouldn't eat it. It had a tang to it that can only be compared to the cheese sauce people use for nachos at gas stations/ball parks. It was like the noodles had been mixed with nacho cheese sauce.  *Waitress notices that we have almost all our food left and asks if we need a couple boxes. I tell her no thank you and I tell her that the food was not too good today. To her credit, she only charges us for the malt and gives me two coupons for a slice of pie (which I do still want to try sometime, so that was nice.)  All in all, I gave 2 stars because the diner atmosphere is really cool, and the waitress did what she could to make it right. But after a total of 1 hour and 45 minutes spent on a lunch we couldn't eat...I won't be giving it \"one more shot.\"  P.S. Table next to me sent their food back twice...so it may have been a really off day. That said, I must only go there on off days!"}
{"text":"Always a great place, never had a bad experience. I always have to wait for a table, but it is worth it. Plus they give you free pie on your birthday. Amazing pie!"}
{"text":"Gave them two stars four years back.  We have been back five or six times in the past six months and have been very impressed.  No complaints and look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Okay... not sure where to start.   The food was amazing. The service was amazing. The dessert selection was amazing. We went on a Wednesday at 1:30 and the place was jammed packed, if that tells you anything.  We had their pie and their cheesecake, both where great.   I had a burger, with the thickest slices of bacon I've ever had on a burger. My wife had the chicken salad that she scarfed down. The fries were great. This place that you wish every Denny's, Village Inn, Perkins, etc. could taste like.   Simply amazing. Go there."}
{"text":"Truly exceptional! Every aspect of our breakfast was superbly executed, including the service we received from Imelda. And we didn't even have a piece of pie."}
{"text":"After a few more visits I have to say I've been happy with the service and food. It can get busy at times but I have been happy with the value and the pies are good too."}
{"text":"I love this place. Truth be told - I love diners in general. But Hubbard is great - I've tried it for brunch, for dinner, and for pie of course.  Brunch - I'd have to say you can get better brunch other places in Madison. But they do a decent job.  Dinner - comfort food. Definitely not fancy. I like the chicken pot pie.  Pie - is to die for. Especially the peanut butter silk/french silk one. Oh my god - instant food coma.  Service - always really friendly and attentive. Environment - feels like a diner. Not too retro, but definitely still diner with booths and stools. It also has a tendency to be cold - at least in my opinion."}
{"text":"We really liked the diner and its WIDE assortment of pies. There were five people in our party and we all ordered something different.  My breakfast was very good - the scrambled eggs were light and fluffy, the hash browns were the shredded variety with lots of brown crunchy bits and not greasy, and the biscuit was large and tasted great with honey.  The caramel apple walnut pie was good and I would eat it again.  They must have had over a dozen varieties of pie!  Based on just the food I rate this a solid 3-1/2 but the pie takes it up half a star to 4! Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I took my grandma here for brunch today and was disappointed.  She ordered the Sunday brunch special- quiche with a hashbrown crust.  It was served with some sort of blueberry bread, and a side of fruit.  The quiche was bland, and the blueberry bread was extremely dry and crumbly.  The fruit was not fresh- mushy melon pieces.  She didn't enjoy her meal, and I felt sad about that.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich- bacon, egg, avocado, and goat cheese with sourdough bread.  The textures and flavors of all the components together were not pleasing, it was a bunch of mush between soggy bread.  Side of hashbrowns was tasty and crunchy.    The service was decent, and the wait time at 9:30 was reasonable.  Did not try the pie."}
{"text":"Hubbard solidified my fandom once they switched over to Colectivo Coffee a few years ago. Yay and thank youuuuUU!!! :D  I have never had a bad or sub-par experience at Hubbard. Whether a pie to-go (shout-out to Jason, the \"Pie Guy\"!!), cookie to trot, or sit down 2-3 course meal, it's been lovely. My entire family loves dining at Hubbard, and that's a picky lot!  Turkey BLT, pancakes, mac and cheese, meatloaf, your basic diner comfort foods are done, and done well! Nurturing nourishment all the way!  PS - Please bring lasagna on full-time. I have had dining companions RAVE about it, and you don't serve this Italian blue plate of deliciousness.   PPS - I am not sure what other reviewers are talking about in terms of long wait times. I have never experienced more than a 10 minute wait (parties of 5 or less).  You keep doing you, Hubbard Ave Diner. We like you just the way you are!"}
{"text":"Our family loves Hubbard diner for a nice Sunday brunch ! My personal favorite is the chicken pot pie with the hot apple sauce on the side - YUM!!!! Make sure to get a slice of pie before you leave :)"}
{"text":"Great diner food and fabulous dessert! I had never heard of pie tacos. What a great invention.  Comingback for breakfast to try the scones. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Hubbard! My sister and I stumbled on the diner one day a few years ago, and we've been hooked ever since. Over the years we've brought plenty of friends to enjoy in the fun of Hubbard, and the simple yet awesome tastes of their American-style menu. Our favorite part typically dessert, and getting to peruse through the big window displays for pies, cookies, cakes, etc  The diner can get pretty busy, especially during lunch on weekends and most nights around dinner time. The atmosphere is light and they have great seating for mid-sized groups."}
{"text":"Always good! We have Sunday brunch here three or four times a year. I don't understand the negative reviews. We've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Today I had the clam chowder. It was excellent as usual. I also had a half of a chicken salad sandwich, a piece of two silks pie and the key lime pie. All of it good. Especially the Zanzibar chocolate ice cream."}
{"text":"What happened?! This used to be my go-to breakfast place. The homemade food, especially the biscuits, were what made this restaurant worth the inflated prices and lines at the dooor. No more. I won't be back. Today I came to indulge in the amazing (no more) eggs benedict. I got a half cooked breakfast. The English muffins were raw, just taken from the plastic bag and the hashbrowns were awful. You know, the kind that are burned on the outside but cold and mushy on the inside. My extra side of hollandaise came out cold in a tiny plastic cup.  The standards are gone and the food is the same cheap, processed food of everywhere. Flo and Alice would even be embarrassed to sling this hash."}
{"text":"My b/f and I were staying at a nearby hotel and woke up with the kind of hunger that a measly room service breakfast just won't satisfy.  He pulled out his phone and searched for nearby yummy places to get our grub on at.  He found a place called 3 Sisters.  Sounded awesome.  We threw on some clean clothes and out the door we went.  ...As we pulled up I had just remembered that it was Easter morning - dammit.  They were closed.   So we took a little drive and stumbled upon this diner.  Looked cute, it was busy, so we parked and went in.  We waited a whole 30 seconds for a table.  THEY HAD MIMOSAS.  Done.  I ordered one.  Joe had some OJ.  They had a cute little menu for breakfast.  One of the dishes that caught my eye was the potato zucchini pancakes...yum!!!!  I didn't order those though :( I did order the special breakfast quiche.  And my oh my was I a happy lady :) You had the option to get either the typical pie crust OR a hasbrown crust.  I decided to walk on the wild side and get the hashbrown crust.  Just delicious!  Joe ordered their french toast, 2 eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns.  The french toast was creamy and delicious.  They make the cinnamon swirl bread that is the main star of the french toast.  Obviously.  He also got a biscuit as a side.  It was the size of a small child and more delicious than I can begin to tell you.  It was tangy, flakey, buttery, chewy...heaven.  We ordered 2 to go.  I also ate them with honey.  Ohm nom nom.  We were too full to order pie :( that and we had no where to store the pie at.  We were checking out of our hotel that morning and headed back home.  I hear that it is delicous.  They had a chocolate cake that was like 2 feet tall.  I had a dream about that last night.  If you find yourself near Middleton, WI or Madison... go here.  Eat.  Drink.  Be Merry.  And bring me some pie.  OR biscuits."}
{"text":"A slice of their strawberry rhubarb pie is enough to pull me across town just to eat there. I appreciate that they're open on holidays like Labor Day and that their service is always just the right amount of efficiency and considerateness.   I keep giving their non-pie food second and third chances and it just isn't that impressive compared to their pies. Somehow the plates I order just aren't flavorful enough, or hot enough, like the hashbrowns look great but come a little lukewarm, or their bacon looks like the package, but just isn't crispy. The slices of avocado are a little too thin. I never seem able to finish my plate, and I feel like I could do better in my own kitchen, no matter what breakfast or sandwich I've ordered there.   Maybe it's because I fill up on pie first..."}
{"text":"Old fashioned, great staff, amazing food. Is Dean Winchester were real he would eat here, no, live here. Best pie ever."}
{"text":"Very clean establishment with a super friendly waitstaff! Decent prices and great food!"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Middleton. I regularly get the black bean burger but have tried many of the menu items and it's just really well prepared good hardy food. It gets very busy on the weekend and some evenings but it is well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Hubbard Avenue is OK.  I like the decor, but there is always, always a long wait and the servers are neither friendly nor efficient.  Overpriced food.  Seriously, get your act together.  You basically added a monty's west and yet everything is 100 times better at Monty's."}
{"text":"Service was incredibly unremarkable, slow and inattentive even though they weren't busy. Blt was not any better than hospital cafeteria food. Pesto mushroom sandwich was the best of our dishes, if a little too cheesy. Chicken chili was okay, but underseasoned. Would not return."}
{"text":"Great menu, tasty food, awesome pie. If you are in Madison you have to eat here.   A classic american breakfast menu is what greeted me here. The portions were big and the price was fair. The eggs were so good I wanted to find out who supplied them for the diner. They just has this fresh taste that really stood out. (BTW I ordered my eggs over hard) This diner is clean and the staff is friendly. This place gets busy too, since they are right next to the mustard museum.  But I had read that the pie was good here and so, with a full stomach from breakfast, I ordered a slice of banana cream pie. This was the freshest cream pie I have ever had in my life. I tasted no preservatives and the sweetness was balanced. The crust was flakey with no raw spots on the bottom.  Highly recommended, do not pass this place up."}
{"text":"Pie is good but the food was cold and stale. It tasted like it was a day old, surprising since we waited over 45 mins for it to come out. Lots of Madison residents have suggested this restaurant but it is over rated."}
{"text":"Fabulous!! Great food and service! First came for lunch. We had wraps and the chicken chili! Fantastic! Came for breakfast. We had omelets. Loved my cheese and spinach!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch.  It's not for the average 1 hour lunch place.  It took us a wee bit longer to get our food.  The food was ok, I was under the impression that the tuna steak gyros would be sliced pieces of tuna or at least a tuna filet that was cooked the way I liked it.  It was a well done piece and it would have been better broken up into pieces.  It was tasty, just too much tuna for each bite of my gyros- it took over the bread, vegetables and their dill sauce.  My friend had the hamburger and was able to only each half.  She really enjoyed it.  We also brought back with us the pie, because...it's pie and you should never leave without dessert.  It was tasty even on the next day.  I can't say that I'd get the tuna again, but I'd give them a shot on another dish!  Oh, and I was informed that going here for breakfast is good and cheap!"}
{"text":"We had come here before and had great shakes!   Came for pie and had lunch.  Blue bacon burger, blts, and California chicken.  Our waitress was wonderful in helping our ordering. The food reviews, burger was okay, blts were excellent \"tons of bacon\". California chicken panini was great, very tasty!   Desserts, well the brownie sundae was very big, this should be shared, too rich.  3 pieces of chocolate silk pie later.. The chocolate is very dense and has a dark chocolate taste. The crust was a favorite.  Of all not bad, but not a favorite We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The fudge brownie sundae is TOTALLY worth the $6. Holy cow!!!! (Also, it's much better than the chocolate chip cookie sundae ... trust me.)  Pro Tip: You can order a half sundae for a little more than half the price of the full desert.  Oh, and they have some killer non-dessert foods, too. You're gonna enjoy whatever you decide to order here!"}
{"text":"I've been to Hubbard Ave for sit-down food maybe 20 times over fifteen years and more times to stop by for Chocolate Shop's ice cream.  I've never thought, 'this is good,' feeling more like I'd rather eat my own food at home. It's obvious they try to cut a lot of corners using gross lettuce for salads, and very rubbery chicken.  I only continue to go due to the convenience of social outings since many friends and I live around the area.  I don't understand why Hubbard is a food fight restaurant. Hubbard and a couple other restaurants have made me realize that being part of the Madison Food Fight Restaurant Group has no meaning. If you want to go to a true diner with a variety of amazing breakfast and brunch food with big servings and pretty prices, go to Madison favorites: Original Pancake House or Mickie's Dairy Bar. I tell all friends and visitors to go here. Read my reviews for what to order at those places.  The Restaurant Group also has Bassett Street Brunch Club and Monty's Blue Plate Diner which are good as well."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday morning for breakfast with a group of 4 based on the recommendation of the 2 people we were with that live in Madison (we were in town visiting from Milwaukee). We were told a 20 minute wait, which didn't seem like a big deal at all, but the wait was made even better by the fact that there was free self-serve coffee while you wait. How nice is that?!  We were seated right around the 20 minute mark, which was awesome because we were all starving & I was super excited to check this place out after hearing it be hyped up so much. Unfortunately, it took quite a while before our server finally made his way to our table, so in the mean time we were all out of coffee and getting a little cranky / irritated at the wait. When he finally came over & took our drink order it was literally another 10 minutes (at least) before he brought over our coffee / other beverages. I understand if the drinks ordered from the bar take a little longer but the pot of coffee should have come around first thing.   Once we ordered our food it didn't come out in a particularly speedy fashion, but it was so delicious I quickly forgot about my irritation with our waiter and the super slow / terrible service. Everyone at the table was diggin' their food, and I have zero complaints about the quality of the deliciousness that I inhaled.   HOWEVER ... service can make or break an experience and our waiter kind of killed ours.   Overall, I'd definitely go back next time I'm in town, but I'd pray for a different server & hope for a better experience in general."}
{"text":"Food was good. Don't quite get why some people are so psyched about this place. Didn't try the pies - so maybe thats what everyone likes."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I really did. But the fried fish was tough and the french fries only luke warm. The chocolate shake was the redeeming value."}
{"text":"I feel like I should write two reviews for Hubbard - one for their food, and one for their pie.   First - the food. It's okay. Just okay. We've had a number of breakfasts there that taste like they sat under a warming light for too long.  Things weren't fresh. hashbrows tasted soggy.  Just okay. Their mac (the food I eat more than any other food when we are out) was also just okay.  The waitress claimed, as she brought it one time, \"The BEST mac and cheese.\" I have to disagree with her. It's pretty mediocre.  I would give it 3 stars. It's not horrible. It's not great. It's just...yes...I'm going to say it again...okay.  The pie, on the other hand? Delicious.  Single handedly the BEST lemon meringue pie I have ever eaten. I confess that sometimes we stop and buy a full pie and just eat it as a family for no good reason other than it's amazing.  The pie? 5 stars.  So what do I give The Hubbard Avenue Diner overall? Well, mathematically speaking, I guess it's a four.  Four stars.  But just go for the pie."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants on the planet. Good quality, decently priced breakfast. Should be an actual crime in the city of Madison to leave without getting a piece of peanut butter chocolate pie."}
{"text":"I've been here twice (and the first time I bought a t-shirt that had a peace sign, 'of,' and then a pie sign = peace/piece of pie).  The first time I got the eggs benedict...it was ok. The hollondaise was pretty heavy and traditional. The service was great even though it was mega busy. They let you drink coffee while you're waiting for a table!  The second time I went it got an omelet which was better than the benedict and came with a really good biscuit. But I got a piece of pie, which they are supposedly famous for, and it was terrible. The apples were mushy and pretty much flavorless. The crumble on the top was also flavorless and not crispy. The crust was mushy and might have even not been fully cooked.  All-in-all, I will probably be back to try dinner options in the near future!"}
{"text":"Went exploring this morning to find a good greasy spoon while in Madison. I found the diner which sure looks the part but I expected more. Service was great and everyone was very friendly. Loved the 60's music playing along with a packed place w/ good atmosphere. But the food was below average & really expensive. 2 eggs w/ corn-beef hash $10.99? Even downtown Chicago diners aren't that pricey. I could have grabbed a 3 egg omelet via room service @ Marriott West for $10.25.   Still hungry...."}
{"text":"Hubbard was great! Awesome pies! Took two home for thanksgiving !  Had breakfast and lunch here as well and both were great."}
{"text":"Not exactly what I think of when I think of diners from my years growing up in Jersey. But they do a good job with American fare. Fried chicken meal was delicious and probably the best in Madison. There are a few places that do different spins on it and a few fast food places but none that match up in terms of good home style fried chicken. At least none I've found. The dessert, a cheesecake, was good. Very rich, almost too much so. Nice family friendly casual and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Two great soups, delicious, warm cornbread, great service and local 5 star beer on tap! I call it \"winter lunch perfection\"."}
{"text":"I'm so fond of Hubbard Avenue Diner in spite of eating there exclusively with my ex-fiance, who turned out to be a complete tool.  The point is, that's how good this place is.  I can vouch for the breakfasts (spinach omelet as well as whole grain blueberry pancakes) as well as the lunch/dinner menu and pie.  I had their tuna steak sandwich once, and it was good but not great.  My standby is the veggie burger, which is just right.  There always seems to be a wait, but it's been worth it for this FIB."}
{"text":"Went here the other week with my parents and my wife for dinner. Agree with other reviews that you can plan on a wait. We waited about 30 minutes. Nothing too unusual for a Friday night around 6:30.  I had the fish fry. It was decent - not the best I've ever had but very good and decent portions. My wife had the Chicken Quesadilla and it was awesome! She loved the corn salsa that came with it. She shared a bite (as well as her leftovers) and it was very good. My parents had the Pot Pie and the Meatloaf and no one was complaining.   Their slogan \"Famous for Pie\" was very true too. They had a ton and we had to try them. WIfe and I shared a slice of Apple Pecan something - it was very good. My parents shared a slice of Cherry - my dad said it was the best he ever had! I will definitely go again and try their breakfast!"}
{"text":"Hubbard Street Diner is a nice, large place that does a great job of putting a modern touch on classic diner food. Seating is widely spaced and the ceiling is high, and the place feels very large. It can be somewhat loud, yet you still feel like your conversation is private.  I've been twice had had the specials both times: fried chicken once, and the pot roast another time. Both were remarkably good.   The pot roast was a very large portion and while it was a little salty, that was the only fault. Otherwise it was great -- soft and tender, with rich gravy and strong flavor. Mashed potatoes and green beans came with. The beans were good, the potatoes good enough. They had a lump or two (intentional, I'm sure) and bits of potato skin inside; neither of which I care for. Still, I ate all of them. They tasted great.  The fried chicken was crispy and hot, but not greasy like many other places. I'd say it's the best I've had in the area, easily. The coleslaw was good and the potatoes as I described above. I opted for butter, salt and pepper rather than gravy and liked it better this way.   However, for a place that says, \"Famous for pie!\", I am seriously unimpressed. I had the French silk and the filling was way too thick in texture. The whipped cream was unnoticeable in the context of the dessert and disappeared from the taste of the pie itself. I would not order it again. The coconut cream was better, but too light in flavor -- adding some more coconut to the filling might fix that. The crust on both were good.  Despite the pie issue, I would go back. Both dinners were good, and the menu has a wide variety of dishes. Perhaps I will give breakfast a shot one day on the weekend."}
{"text":"Thumbs down!  Worst Rueben I've had in a while. $9.80 for a Reuben with fries.   The pastrami looked like it had been fried and was old; it barely tasted like pastrami. If I bought this pastrami at a store, I would never buy it again.  The sauerkraut was dark and flavorless, as if it sat in a hot pan all day, then got reheated for today.   The 1000 island dressing may as well have been mayo; there was no tart or sweet flavor to it.   Which is a shame, because I've always enjoyed eating at the Hubbard Ave Diner."}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend over Labor Day weekend.  Our server and our food were great.  However, I can't say the same about their reception/hostess.  I walked in and waited for a second to give her a free moment to talk to other guests, said hello, and she completely ignored me after making eye contact with me.  She was a young, petite blonde with a bob haircut.  Really disappointing front door service, Hubbard.  Please gently remind this young and inexperienced person that the polite thing to say to paying guests is, \"Hello.  Someone will be right with you.\"  This is Customer Service 101.  Not difficult!"}
{"text":"Delicious comfort food and heavenly pies. This is yet another staple in the downtown Middleton area. Bonus, they have their own parking lot in a crowded area where there is mostly street parking. There is typically a wait, as this place is so good that it is always crowded. My suggestions are a bowl of soup with a slice of coconut cream pie for dessert."}
{"text":"The food was fine. Not awful, not that delicious. Service was fine. Our food came out quickly, the server girl was prompt, but not too friendly. The atmosphere was, of course, like a diner.  Our pie was not good. Sign after sign -- on the front door, on the menus, on the \"seasonal pie\" flier on every table -- talked about how Hubbard Avenue Diner is \"famous for pie.\"   We split the raspberries & cream slice of pie from the seasonal menu. It was made with a creamy, fluffy filling (think banana cream pie) as opposed to raspberry chunks like a traditional fruit pie.  I couldn't find the crust. Well, I found a little -- it was a strange, flaky texture (almost phyllo dough-like) and very thin. The topping on the pie was, I believe, supposed to be a cream cheese topping, like cheesecake-y. The baker, though, must have forgotten to add any sugar when mixing the topping. It was a nice mouthful of cream cheese. Just straight cream cheese.  \"Famous for pie\"? Why?"}
{"text":"The place is cute. The food not so good and the service horrible. Just don't mind to put your name in a waiting list for a table, they don't know how it works. They will just shout that there is a table available and if you are fast you can have it. Doesn't matter if you just arrived or if you are there waiting for 30min+. They also don't know that a 13 month old kid needs a space at the table (even when you ask for a high chair). My hashbrown was looking leftover, was overcooked and tasteless. Our food was cold. My first and last time at this place."}
{"text":"Very classic feel and great food! Service was typical for this kind of spot, I'd recommend to anyone looking for a casual meal at a fair price. Will be back."}
{"text":"This review is ONLY for the bakery cakes. It pains me to give them a bad review, I've always had good meals at the diner. I took a second chance on their cakes. The first cake I ordered several years ago for my daughter's graduation was over done ( burnt on the bottom) dry and tough. I was somewhat embarrassed to serve it, I reached out to the diner, they apologized and made it right. I wanted to believe in them so I ordered a small white birthday cake again today- dry with a very tough brown top and sides. So disappointed. Stick with their pies and eat in menu, yummy. Do not order the cakes."}
{"text":"Not a bad little diner.  The food was about what you expect for diner food, some things amazing, some mediocre.  They were packed on a Sunday at 11:30 and we had to wait about twenty minutes for a table.  Normally wouldn't be super frustrating, except they were very slow to bus tables and seat people.  We really could have been seated sooner than we were.    The service was pretty good.  Our server didn't exactly come back to check on us a lot, but she was on the floor quite a bit and we were able to call her over when needed.    I ordered the burger with a cup of chili and a side of hashbrowns.  They burger was nothing special, the chili was ok, but yum yum, get me more of those hashbrowns!!  They were perfectly crispy shoestring cut taters.  All they needed was a bit of salt and a good dousing of ketchup and I was in psuedo-breakfast HEAVEN!  Hubby got the Sunday special of pot roast with mashed potatoes and gravy and green beans.  Thankfully we have a deal about quantity over quality, so halfway through the meal, he was willing to trade 3/4 of my burger for a paltry amount of his roast and potatoes.  Worth it!  The pot roast was really tender and the potatoes and gravy were creamy and perfectly seasoned.  Skin on, baby, the only way potatoes should be served.   They had millions and billions of pies, so of course, I had to have a slice.  I'm not sure if it was just because I was already stuffed, but the cherry pie for me was only ok.  Too much fake syrup, not enough cherries.  I would go back though, just for a couple more servings of hash browns."}
{"text":"Didn't get to try the pie, but I sure wouldn't bother going back for anything else."}
{"text":"I saw reviews for this place and decided to make it a point to stop in with my family.  We had never been here before so we had to try one of everything.  We started with a cup of their homemade chicken-n-dumpling soup.  It was very good.....   Then we decided to try a cookies-n-cream milkshake which was amazingly tasty.... We each ordered a different meal so we could share.  They both were kind of just flat and flavorless.  I had the turkey n gravy with mashed potatoes and gravy.  This also was served with vegetables.  My wife had the scallop potatoes and ham.   We enjoyed all the fresh pies, cakes, and ice cream that they have to offer.  We will stop back and try some different food and dinner options.  Then maybe I will give them if deserving the 5th star.   The staff was friendly and smiling, the place was very clean, the look is of a modern style dinner, the prices were reasonable, and it was worth our stop!"}
{"text":"Service was great, pie was amazing. The food itself was a little bland for me, but it I will still definitely recommend this restaurant to my acquaintances!"}
{"text":"What is not to love this place. Hubbard's is always jumping. Fun place to go. Food is great staff is fun. Gets crazy busy. If you have the time and the patience it's a great place to go"}
{"text":"This place is located in \"downtown\" Middleton and is centrally located.   Easy parking also.   I just moved to Madison so I have visited this place a few times.   Once for lunch, yummy, and twice for breakfast, double yummy.   It is a clean diner with great service.   The food has been served quickly and hot.   Try some pie.   This place is worth the visit."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Hubbard's you are missing out on the cultural phenomena that is this diner! Every weekend swarms of Westsiders gather here to eat and stare longingly at the vast array of pies displayed.  With waits being a planned occurrence, know that there is coffee out and ready!  Always a good meal, and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We had pies and cheesecake delivered for our wedding. Everything was delicious and the staff was prompt with delivery. Only one problem, but it wouldn't hinder me from using the service again...we ordered a carrot cake and it wasn't delivered, but the other 17 pies were. :( Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Hubbard Avenue Diner a couple of times and I honestly do not understand the attraction.  Both times were mid- morning during the week, the place was very busy, the service was slow and the food was mediocre.    On our first visit m wife ordered bacon \"crispy\" and it came out burnt.  So burnt that when we tapped it on the plate in front of the waitress pieces cracked off.  The waitress was noticeably embarrassed and offer to replace it and we told her not to bother; but she felt compelled and brought some out anyway; however, it came after we were done eating.    Our most recent visit was very similar to our first visit.  The service was extremely slow; it took about 30 minutes to get our breakfast.  The waitress stopped twice to tell us our breakfast was coming soon but it took about 10 minutes after the last \"coming soon\" comment.  My wife ordered eggs over medium which generally means they are not runny but the yoke isn't cooked solid.  Unfortunately over medium to the cook meant one egg was cooked hard with no yoke and the other had a minimal amount of yoke.  I ordered the \"Mile High\" aka Denver Omelet  with hash browns. They must have had an over abundance of green pepper or a shortage of ham and onion in the kitchen because it was pretty much a green pepper omelet with a little ham and onion.  To top it off the green pepper was still very crunchy.  They must have also been running short of hash browns because the serving size on my plate was far less then my wife received.  Now for the table next to us.  The diner serves all of their breakfasts with biscuits unless you request otherwise.  Well the table next to us requested wheat toast instead of biscuits and he received biscuits.  He pointed out the error to the waitress and she replaced the biscuits with toast but they were almost done eating by the time the toast arrived.    I've had their pies at work functions and they are an average of 3.5 stars.  The plus is they have a huge selection and some of them are 4+ stars so you can probably find one you really love."}
{"text":"Wow.... I don't remember eating here before? I've been to far too many places to recall. My wife and I took my father in law out for dinner in downtown Middleton. We had talked about going somewhere downtown before but have always went inner city.   So fast forward to the visit. My wife ordered the meat loaf with mash potatoes and gravy, and some vegetables on the side. My FIL had the turkey dinner that included cranberry sauce. I had the (can you predict it based on my reviews?) Of course I had the pulled pork, my favorite no matter where I go. Everyone enjoyed there dinners. My pulled pork wouldn't win any competitions by any means, but it was still tasty!   Service was very good considering how busy this place was. Our waitress, who was vegetarian ask about the meatloaf and you'll be told she's a vegetarian!) did a fantastic job. The prices were very reasonable, I'm talking $9.00 to $11.00 a dinner for very generous size dinners.   We didn't try the famous pie. Although staring at the case will make your mouth water!  Great Service Great Food Great Atmosphere"}
{"text":"I consider myself something of a chicken tender/strip enthusiast (not the most refined of tastes, I know...), and I'd be lying if I said I didn't think the Hubbard Avenue Diner had the absolute best chicken tenders I've ever had.  They're the kind that let you know they came from a chicken as opposed to a freezer, with an absolutely sublime breading, and deep fried to the most exquisite of golden browns.  Get them with ranch to enjoy them at their best, and don't even think about ignoring the awesome coleslaw that comes as a side.  Their pies are good too."}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch with friends last Friday. Wait was about 30 minutes. The waiting area is jumbled with high top tables but no chairs; not sure why they are there. Everyone was happy with their food. Turkey pesto sandwich was great; very fresh and flavorful. Side dish was not memorable (literally I am not sure what I had as my side). Tried a famous pie; maybe hot fudge was the wrong choice. It was tasty but the only thing that made it pie and not mousse was pie shell. Service was good. Would come back if we were in the area."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast here with my son and a few friends.  I ordered the breakfast club sandwich (yum!), and he had the Mr. Chippy pancakes.  Both were tasty and yummy. My only complaint is that its a bit pricey for breakfast."}
{"text":"Authentic Main Street diner. Decor is 50's / 60's motif. White bean chicken chili is to die for.   Love the counter service and homemade pies to go!  Love the uniform, unfortunately it's hard to explain.    Think \"Peace Sign\" of \"Pi Sign\"  Peace of Pi.  Cute play on words."}
{"text":"I travel throughout the Midwest for work, and every time I make my way into Metropolitan Madison,  I make sure to stop at the Hubbard Ave Diner. If I worked in a closer proximity to Hubbard Ave, I would make it a point to stop there by bi-weekly. I've dabbled with a few different things on the menu, but I've pinpointed the breakfast club as my favorite thing on the menu. Holy potatoes is it good. Bacon, avocado, goat cheese, good friggin luck making me salivate harder than with that combo. Moral of the story, hop in your car now and go to Hubbard Ave. Final Score...8.8/10.0"}
{"text":"Hubbard is definitely decent, but it seems like more often than not it just isn't quite as tasty as I was hoping it would be.   However, they've got tasty shakes (nothing out of the ordinary, just good, not-too-thick shakes) and the dual silk (chocolate and peanut butter) is no-bones excellent."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Hubbard Ave Diner.  We went for breakfast.  It was Saturday morning, so it was busy as expected.  However we were promptly seated.  Our server (didn't catch her name) did a fine job.  My wife had eggs Benedict, I had huevos ranchos.  Both were generally good.  However, both were served with hash browns.  And it wasn't a good day for the hash browns.  We both burped them for hours afterward.  I realize every food service establishment can have occasional problems.  So we'll go again for a second chance.  The pies and other goodies in the cases just looked to good to not return."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Madison for comfort foods that will satisfy everyone. I have taken ALL of my visitors here. Have never had to wait more than 15-20 minutes for a large group on a Friday night during peak hours. Usually you can grab a seat at the litte bar.  I go to Hubbard about once a week.  I think the Mac & Cheese here is better than the Great Dane's. Comes with jalapeno corn bread. YUM. Milkshakes are generous portions and very good, and so is their pie. Fish fry is good and consistent from friday to friday (have not had the same experience at the Old Fashioned). White chicken chili is great and the blue cheese dressing is delicious. Waffle fries are great too. Oh and so are their biscuits at breakfast."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast on our way home from WI and we weren't disappointed. It's located in a cute part of the downtown area and the exterior of the building looks like a true vintage diner which made it more fun. Inside the decor matched the retro theme. We put our name on the list and were told 20 minutes or less which was accurate. Our server greeted us promptly and brought back our drinks right away. He also took our order right away and our food came in about 15 minutes. I ordered the French Toast with bacon crispy and Ben had the corn beef hash with eggs over medium which came with a homemade biscuit. Everything was cooked perfectly, delicious crispy bacon and the eggs were just right. We both loved our meals! Once we were finished the server took our check up and ran our card. Our total visit took an hour including wait time. Overall, we had a nice experience!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of Hubbard Avenue Diner. It's kitschy, funky and clean. I love the Pi collection more than the Pie. The service is fabulous.  That said, the food is mediocre (I'm being nice) and the pie is not great. Most diners have reliably good food, but I don't really get that here."}
{"text":"This is your standard, all-American diner.  It meets expectations and has little room for improvement.  They even serve beer which is nice, and specialize in pies with occasional featured pies on discount.  The acoustics do get a bit loud if the place is full and/or lively kids happen to be dining, but at the end of the day it is a diner.  Great place to take folks who like comfort food and good service."}
{"text":"It's like I've stumbled into my own \"breakfast porn\" spot. Don't get me wrong as there is not sex involved, this place just has a lot of what makes me... Comfortable. To start, I could have been subjected to the hotels $12.99 cattle call breakfast \"buffet\" but fortunately there wasn't a single seat available. The front desk person sent me here, and for that I owe her a debt of gratitude. A new building, designed as an Art Deck dinner, they got that spot on for the casual art and Architecture buff. Equipped with an expansive wrap around walk up/sit down counter and expansive natural lighting and better yet... They supply coat racks... Holy Crap Batman. No one does that anymore. Got her on a Sunday mid morning and was able to park right outside the front door. So either this packed place has ample parking OR they have a nice size parking lot."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now and the food is very average.  Today I had corned beef hash and scrambled eggs and both tasted like they had been under the warmer for hours.  The eggs were cold and rubbery and the hash was overly crispy and dry.  The biscuits each weigh about 7lbs and there is nothing very appealing about them.  I like the diner feel but likely won't come back.  Would still consider trying the pie to go though."}
{"text":"Just a note. The proprietor of Hubbard Avenue Diner reached out and addressed my issues. I really appreciate his attentiveness. That act alone will ensure that I try the diner again."}
{"text":"I was here with a group of people for a bruch/lunch on July 4. A busy morning, but we were lucky in that we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. Being a huge pie fan, I had a good time looking at the pies in the display cases.   For my meal, I had an omelet, with cheese and other stuff in it. It was good, but nothing too outstanding. I also had a slice of key lime pie. Delicious.   But the reason why I feel like I can't rate this place higher is due to the slow service. By the time we left, there were maybe 50% of the tables full. It had gotten the point in the day where the wait staff was wrapping silverware in napkins.   But I remember it took 15 minutes to get our pie. Literally, all they had to do is slice a few pieces of pie.   I would definitely go here again, but just expect for it to take longer to get served."}
{"text":"Best place in town for pie!  They have 10 standard flavored year round and about 5 seasonal flavors. You can help yourself to a seat at the bar and order from their full diner style menu or you can just enjoy a slice of pie. If you happen to come on pi (3/14) day, a nice line is formed to the left along the display pies and either get a slice or a whole pie to go ( $5 deposit for glass dish). The wait staff wear pi theme tshirt a which you can buy at the register."}
{"text":"Note: This review is ONLY for their bakery.  I ordered a cake for the boy's birthday, sight and taste unseen.  I have never been to Hubbard Avenue.  I was drawn in by their online order form that listed sizes, cake flavors, filling flavors, and frosting flavors.  There were just so many options!  And for $12.99!  Sold!  I called up and ordered a mocha cake with raspberry filling and mocha frosting.  The lady on the phone told me how good that sounded.  I know, Phone Lady, I know.  She asked for an inscription.  She then asked if I wanted any particular decoration.  Baffled, I said no, they could do whatever they wanted.  Upon hanging up, I hit myself in the forehead.  I should have specified that the cake was for a 31 year old man, not a 5 year old boy.  Shit.  Hopefully they don't put clowns or pokemon or something stupid on it.  I picked it up, and I was extremely pleased.  It was a pretty little cake, the color of wet sand, with a palm tree on it.  Tasteful (pun not intended)!  Professionalism and prettiness aside, it was a gloriously delicious cake.  The best part really is the mocha buttercream frosting.  I want that frosting on everything I eat from now on.  It'll be worth weighing 400 pounds."}
{"text":"good diner atmosphere, food was so so. had the ham and potatoe casserole and then a slice of caramel apple walnut pie ala mode. casserole was ok, not super flavorful. and honestly i wasn't amazed by the pie."}
{"text":"Went their recently at about 2:30pm.  Not very busy.   We had to wait a very long time for or orders to appear.   They were good.  I would rate my Rube about a 7 out of 10.   fair amount of corned beef.  good and flavorful cheese.   Sauce was so so.  Bread, ok but could have been better.   The Fiesta Chicken bowl was good with a nice variety of ingredients but we were sure it was to include poblano peppers which we couldn't find in the dish.   We should have said something but didn't. I requested soup with my sandwich for which I had to pay more for as a side.   It was just a cup of soup and not a bowl as I had hoped for.   Seemed skimpy to me.  The soup was good but nothing spectacular. The cheesecake was not that exciting.   It was ok.  Maybe a 6 out of 10.  I have gone back a few times since the above review in 2011.   The wait time has improved but the dinner meal is skimpy for the price and though the food is prepared fine the flavors are absent.   I have decided to not return for another dinner.   I might stop for breakfast if in a jam but will most likely go elsewhere.  Sorry but I have to scratch this restaurant off my list of places to go."}
{"text":"I am surprise this is not higher than 3.5 stars.  I have hit Hubbard mostly for breakfast and it has always been a very positive experience (if you don't mind a weekend morning wait).  Good service, good food, good variety, no weak points, which is rare these days.  I would go out of my way to eat at the Hubbard, which puts it in a 4 star category for me."}
{"text":"Upon entering the Hubbard St diner I was enveloped by the hometown atmosphere. It seems quite a few locals were here for a family dinner. I say that because I saw three groups hug it out with \"hey, how are you? what's been going on? how are the kids?, etc.\" I came here for the deserts but I know the have great food too. I was torn between the meatloaf, turkey dinner and chicken pot pie. I selected the meatloaf. It was an excellent choose with 2 good sized slabs of meat with mashed potatoes/gravy and a healthy portion of green beans and carrots. A very satisfying meal. I like their cherry pie and ordered that for dessert.   The service was very good, my food arrived quickly and was piping hot ready to eat. I recommend and will return. A classic landmark in Middleton, Wi."}
{"text":"Great place, friendly staff and DELICIOUS FOOD & BAKERY!  I love the fun diner vibe and cute \"pie\" t-shirts.  Baked goods are dangerously good!  :)   I've been here for dinner a few times!"}
{"text":"This place is known for their pies. In addition they are known for their Pie, PI T-Shirts which are awesome!   The location in Middleton, WI, is a perfect little city center. Easy parking next door.   I thoroughly enjoyed my Grilled Cheese, which was pure Wisconsin Cheddar with Lettuce, Tomatos on hearty multigrain bread.  I could barely finish it, but don't worry, no part of the grilled cheese was left behind.  Now, onto dessert.  Blackforest Pie - I wasn't sure how they were going to accomplish this feat, but they did and they did it WELL! YUM!!! The crust was flaky and buttery. Tasty - pie can't be good, unless it has GREAT crust.  Cherry Pie - Delicious crust once again, but the filling, was an excellent balance of jellied cherries that were sweet and tart. - no a la mode needed.  Carrot Cake - most and delicious. Chunks of Walnuts on the outside and pieces throughout the cake - a little too much with the walnuts, but the cake and cream cheese frosting made up for the nuts.  Service was very good. She was neat, polite and prompt. Refills on drinks were never requested, she took care of it before we realized we needed them.  Chocolate Chip Cookie - bought one to go. Had it about 5 hours later and it was still moist and chewy with soft melty chocolate chips - I wish I had bought 12!  I highly recommend visiting for a meal and dessert. Then visit the Mustard Museum next door!!"}
{"text":"I went here in 2011, hated it, and thought that after hearing from others how good it was, that it must've been an off-day. After a recent Sunday morning breakfast, I know that they must just be smoking something.  The food here is not good. Don't ask me about the pie, because I didn't have any. I had a benedict-like breakfast sandwich that I couldn't finish (not normal). Heck, I didn't even eat half, and I was effing hungry. The eggs were tasteless, the waitress never refilled our coffee (and we were at the COUNTER, for heaven's sake), and the biscuits were cold.  My guy had a breakfast scramble, which, admittedly, tasted a LOT better than my breakfast sammie, but still, this place sucks for breakfast food. He agreed it was no good and we decided never to come back.   If you have a purse and jackets, get ready to share hooks under the counter, because they're only every third or fourth seat apart. So that can be awkward with strangers. haha  I do NOT understand the long lines to be seated, and I do NOT understand why people come here. If you want the pie so bad, order it for pick up and take it home. It's not worth stomaching crappy food just to earn dessert."}
{"text":"I half expected to see Biff and Marty McFly going at it. The place reminded me of the diner in Back to the Future. Cute, charming diner with a lot of pie options. I should have tried the grasshopper pie. I haven't seen that since the 80s. So many options to choose from. Too bad I didn't.   Small wait, not a biggie. Plenty of pie and dessert to oogle at. Not to mention the pies swirling around the spinning pie display case. Haven't seen one of those in awhile either.  Chicken salad I would have to skip next time. A little too sweet for my liking, but the waffle fries were good. I tend to be picky with the way people prepare chicken salad.  Santa Fe salad was a nice size and was said to be good. Chicken dumpling soup was also said to be good. Cocunut cream pie I guess was okay. Nothing spectacular.  Good service. Charming atmosphere and a lot of dessert options."}
{"text":"The food and the service was overall okay. They took themselves very seriously. I had the quarter chicken dark meat with fries, and it tasted normal but not outstanding. The pie I had was the Mississippi Mud, which I found to be very delicious.   Could benefit from more decor. Overall a nice experience, but I'll try something else next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Of all the Food Fight places in the area this is my fav!    It's nothing to write home about but it's great for what it is!  it's not your typical diner food, it's got that Madison twist (the tuna gyro, for example) that makes it fun, and more granola friendly!  I've never been disappointed and I Always have leftovers... this may be because I'm always saving room for dessert, which is AMAZING!!    Breakfast is more like a 3.  I have high standards and so far Madison's breakfasts just haven't impressed me yet... it's fine I would just rather make my own, I guess.   The meatloaf is good, the Smokehouse Hickory Burger is great and the fish fry is pretty nice too.  Not a fan of the scalloped potatoes with ham... no matter how many times I try it and want it to be wonderful it dissapoints :(  Service is OK, always nice, usually on top of drinks... they just always seem to be in a rush, which I get on a Friday night, but on a Tuesday when the dining room is not quite full?  Good luck getting any attention if you aren't ordering or they aren't dropping off your food."}
{"text":"First visit to Hubbard Avenue Diner on a busy Saturday morning.  Sat at the counter as it was a 20-25 minute wait for a table.  Service was fast and efficient.  Bloody Mary was good.  Food was average at best.  Too many choices for better breakfast food in the Madison area, not sure I'd give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Great find..   Fresh and tasty ingredients, Breakfast was amazing.  From what i hear the baked goods, pies etc are amazing here and def worth tryiing.  Can't wait t come back"}
{"text":"EDIT:  After a few more experiences here, I'm knocking it down to three stars.  The pie is what's keeping it afloat for me.  Good selection and good flavors, but there are a lot of places in town that have superior food.  I haven't been here to eat non-pie food in months.  The Hubbard Avenue Diner was a little difficult for me to nail down.  I've been about five times in the last few months since arriving here.  I landed on four stars.  Cons first:  If I'm at a diner, there's a good chance that I want breakfast, and Hubbard gets dinged for not having breakfast available all the time.  The breakfast food I've had here is good, and I'd love to have it as an option all the time.  And maybe I just caught it on a bad day, but the chicken pot pie I had last visit was really bad.  The menu advertises \"a garden\" worth of vegetables, and this must have been a very small garden.  Also, the gravy in the pie was extremely watery.    Now for pros:  Good, solid diner food, a tick above usually greasy spoon diner fare.  The location is fantastic.  Parking is always easy.  There's never a wait.  The servers are pretty efficient, if not always super friendly.  The pie alone is worth the price of admission (chocolate walnut is excellent if you're into it).  I find myself wanting to go up here from where I live on the West Side a fair amount, but I never leave as happy as I hope I will.  It's a really good spot, but with a little bit of menu tinkering, it would be even better."}
{"text":"I was shocked I was in a diner! My friend took me here & said it was amazing & probably busy. I said on a Monday afternoon in little Middleton, Wisconsin? You betcha! My friend had a grilled salmon Caesar salad that was quite tasty. I had the NY Reuben with turkey, extra cheese & sauerkraut. Phenomenal! I got extra sauces with waffle fries and I have to say, this is the FIRST time in 20 different restaurant visits that I asked for Ranch dressing and it wasn't watered down! The place was packed on a Monday afternoon, so we ate at the counter. Hubbard's specializes in pies & baked goods. Overall, I was impressed. My sandwich with fries was about $10 and so worth it! I said I 'd be back next time I'm in Wisconsin. The service was prompt & friendly; kudos to the kitchen staff because even though it was a full diner, we received our food in a very timely manner and it was hot! I'm recommending this place to everyone in the Madison area!"}
{"text":"The phrase \"Good things come to those who wait\" comes to mind regarding Hubbard Avenue Diner.  This is a suburban diner that is quite popular. Located in the heart of the 'downtown' of a bedroom community, there is always a wait even mid-afternoon.   I come here strictly for the fried chicken special as I get my fry on the outside and do not cook that way at home. 5/5 on the chicken, veg, and mash! I don't know of a better place to get fried chicken than this. Fresh, hot, crispy.  Dining companions have got a variety of things. Fish, mehh. Burgers, acceptable. We discovered brunch exists on this most recent stop! Quiche comes with two options. The hash brown base was quite thick; we will select the pie base next time. In short, ask questions about preparation, etc. if you are concerned with high satisfaction on your entree.   As you may expect from a place that celebrates the numeral 3.14 with a Pie Day event, and pi t-shirts on the staff, the pies are where its at. Blueberry is my depth on that and its superb. Typically I get cake! They are high! They are mighty! They are classic! They are tasty! I'm a regular for carrot cake.  One star removed because the cookies have been stale 100 percent of the time. I don't know why but 100 percent of the time over several years the cookies are no good. Kids deserve quality items and I think they are getting ripped off along with the parents paying for them!   One star deduction because servers don't make it back after the food has been delivered! Staffing is lighter than it needs to be in this always-packed establishment. Management isn't visible. Perhaps they could check on folks and refill drinks! I can't say I've had friendly service here. People appear too busy to be pleasant.  Rating is not helped by the seating/decor. Go here with companions you enjoying conversation with because there is nothing else in the place to entertain you!  In summary, this is a reliable place for a decent meal when you have plenty of time. They know they are the pie place so dining menu is playing second fiddle. Value the wait time by perusing the pie case. Study the choices for the dessert decision that inevitably awaits!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had a meal at Hubbard that I haven't enjoyed. We tend to stop in here on lazy Sundays when we pathetically can't be parted with our pj's because they do a yummy brunch quiche special till 11:30 or 12:00.  I recently had the Huevos Rancheros on one of my better \"early\" mornings, and it was FANTASTIC. Crunchy corn tortillas, filling black beans, eggs your way, and cheese--because this IS Wisconsin. Good salsa verde with a kick on the side.   I was, however, deeply disappointed in the brownie i had them bag up for me, though. It was dry, and not rich. I didn't even finish it. I DIDN'T FINISH A BROWNIE.  Guess I gotta stick to the pie!"}
{"text":"CREME BRULE PIE IS THE BEST DESSERT IN TOWN!!!  This is my new go to brunch place on the west side.   My review is on the overall experience......not a huge menu, but they seem do get each dish right....service can be slow, but they are always packed so that is somehwat expected.  I have gotten the Southwester Eggs Benedict every time we go, and always good. Salsa Verde is as good as mine, and healthier choice than typical hollandaise sauce.    Hashbrowns are really crispy and great flavor (not too greasy).    Was there every Sunday the last month with out of town guests (usually get going around 11am), and do expect a 20ish minute wait, but it's been a blast to visit the mustard museum after putting our name in at the diner.  It's a great way to show guests around town, taste some amazing mustards, and then have a great brunch!    So, I had been waiting to try the creme brule pie when my mom was in town last weekend, but found out they only carry certain pies certain months (in the case).   I was all sad, asked the baker, and voila was able to pick up a mini pie the next day!  OMG, we were just going to have one bite, and then split the rest for later.   We stood at my kitchen counter and ate the ENTIRE mini pie!!!  It was so flipping amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I was very happy with my recent visit to the Hubbard Ave. Diner.  The place was surprisingly busy for a weekday evening, but I soon realized why--the food is delicious.  I ordered the beef stew and it was everything I hoped it would be. Luckily I still had room after the beef stew because I also ordered a cappuccino and a pie of Mississippi Mud pie and they were excellent.  The one negative was that it was really hard to decide upon what to get for dessert because all of the cakes, pies, and cupcakes looked wonderful."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars based on their peanut butter silk pie alone! I don't even care about what is on their food menu, this pie is worth the hour drive. TAKE ALL MY MONEY! It literally melts in your mouth. Each bite is the perfect combo of sweet and salty. I love that the crust isn't chocolate. And that the topping is real whipped cream. This pie is what dreams are made of."}
{"text":"Perfect diner atmosphere in downtown Middleton. Classic food done well, though nothing extremely exciting. Eat pie and enjoy the charm!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times and while I would not write home to mom about it, the breakfast is good if standard and the service is fine.  Coffee house coffee fans may be a bit disappointed, but it is the sort of place where most people can find something decent on the menu without breaking the bank.  The atmosphere is classic American dinner which is pretty nostalgic, but the place, including the bathrooms were clean the few times I ate here."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast on day 2 of our Southern Wisconsin mini vacation. We were waiting for the Mustard Museum to open and Hubbard Ave. Diner is literally right next door.  The breakfast food was ok. Chris had eggs, bacon and pancakes and I had potato pancakes with a side of bacon. It was nothing exciting or memorable, but good enough. It was a bit pricey for what we got.  We loved the Art Deco design and architecture of the place although it is new and not period construction. They have a large assortment of pies on display, though we didn't get a chance to try any.  The service was good and the restrooms were clean and handicapped accessible."}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan. I love this wonderful mid-century vibe style diner. This is the place that I take friends especially if they are visiting from overseas. Their staff is very friendly and attentive. I love their dessert offers, right when you come in you can see the display of dessert. My favorites are the key lime pie or carrot cake.  Regarding their food, I like their weekly specials and their burger and sandwiches. Last time I went I had their chicken salad croissant sandwich and it was excellent. Make sure to leave room for dessert or one of their fabulous milk shakes."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome pie. A little too pricey. Wonderful atmosphere.  Fun times. I go as often as I can afford. The prices are the only detractors for me but I have a tight budget. Nice big yummy salads. Crafted soups. Pie from Heaven. Deserts galore! Yummmy. When I was at Little America this summer the engineer that runs the little train told me he goes in there all the time because he loves it there. It made me smile when he said that because we talked about the pie while we were riding the train. That tells you how good the food is because that's a heck of a drive."}
{"text":"Good basic diner food with a decent veggie burger. Otherwise, vegan options are basically nonexistent. It is a shame that they do not have some vegan pies because the non-vegetarians in my family really enjoy them. It is also kind of odd that they are located about a block from a great, vegan-friendly bakery (Blooms), which should provide inspiration."}
{"text":"I've been to Hubbard Avenue Diner a few times, and the food is a mix of average and super-good.   Hits: Smokehouse Hickory Burger (subbing a black bean patty for meat), French Silk* pie. *Most FS pies are light and creamy; theirs is dense and fudgy. I wouldn't personally call it FS, but I will call it heavenly.  (Occasional) Misses: Their regular fries (I'm a potato gal, I've got high standards; on my last visit they were dry and over-cooked), the parmesan penne (bland), and the Italian Turkey BLT (the first time I tried it, it was amazing; the second time it was okay at best - can't put my finger on why).   The diner itself is adorable with a wonderful mid-century vibe, offers outdoor seating when the weather is nice, and has a friendly, attentive staff.   If the rest of their desserts are as good as the French Silk pie, a visit to Hubbard Avenue Diner is worth the visit for a treat alone."}
{"text":"This is one of more established and consistent Food Fight Restaurants in the greater Madison area. They are sort of famous for their pies.   I had beef stew. Companion had pot roast. Of the two I thought the beef stew had a richer flavor. The veggies that came with the pot roast were simply steamed. They would have better if they had been roasted with the pot roast.   Both the pot roast and the beef stew came with mashed potatoes. They were a bit thin for my taste but had decent flavor. Also since they were potatoes in the beef stew, I found the addition of the mashed potatoes with the beef stew to be a redundant filler.   Hubbard Street Diner is provides consist service and decent food - in the end I guess it's what a diner is supposed to do."}
{"text":"We just ordered pie tacos to go. Very very good and easy to eat. It may not be earth shattering once you have it, but it's the novelty that counts. It is a great way to eat pie sans utensils. All of the flavors are great."}
{"text":"Another fantastic Food Fight establishment. Food has always been great for the 15+ years iv been coming. Highly recommend the malts!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. You'd like it to be a diner with an enormous menu, along the lines of what Ella's Deli has. When it gets crowded, orders take a long time. Not particularly inexpensive. I'd like to see them up their menu, with more variety and better quality, but they've never changed in the last 8 years, so I am not expecting anything."}
{"text":"If my mother was a diner, she would be embodied by Hubbard Ave Diner..this place epitomizes home cooking. It makes me happy, warm, and fuzzy. Thank you Hubbard Ave."}
{"text":"One of the best places hands down! Amazing pie, shakes, food and service. Always prompt service and reasonable prices. Fun atmosphere and whole menu is delicious for any mealtime. Highly, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The reason this restaurant gets two stars instead of one is that our server was an all-star who handled a difficult situation to the best of her considerable ability. Unfortunately, the food did not match her service.  I ordered the soup of the day, which was a sausage vegetable soup. The soup was very oily, and went heavy on the garlic. While it is normal to have a little extra oil in a soup with sausage, this soup had a film of it around the sides and slightly undercooked carrots. It is difficult to get carrots properly soft in a soup, so I'm not dinging them for that, but I would be lying if I said that I wasn't a bit disappointed by the experience.  For my main course, I ordered \"Mother Hubbard's Chicken Pot Pie\" which should really have been called \"Mother Hubbard's Chicken Pot Soup.\" Chicken pot pie is supposed to be a thick, creamy, and flavorful dish with the consistency of a thick stew. This pot pie was a milky bland broth of the same consistency as my sausage soup, which contained rubbery chicken covered over by a puff pastry. I sent the dish back, which is the first time I have done so in any restaurant.   As a replacement for the pot pie, I ordered the 'Mediterranean Penne.' To Hubbard Ave's credit, they managed to get the dish out quickly, and when the check came it was the only entree they billed me for. To their detriment, the kalamata olives still contained pits, and the feta cheese was disappointing.   To finish off, I ordered cheese cake. It was adequate, but nothing that I'd write home about. If I return, I think I'll stick to the pie.  Review Update:  After my last experience, where the food could be categorized as dreadful, the General Manager, Jose, reached out to me over private message and apologized for the experience my wife and I had. He offered us another trip to the diner, on him, and we accepted. I did not order the Pot Pie this time as, although Jose assured me that he had seen to the error that turned it into a soup last time, I did not have faith in the kitchen's ability to turn the dish around.  This time, my wife and I were accompanied by a friend. We all ordered burgers, and I have to say, the blue cheese and bacon burger worked out a lot better than I thought it would given my last experience with a cheese here. The waffle fries were also excellent. For desert I ordered a slice of French silk pie, which was better than your standard restaurant desert by a pretty wide margin. My one complaint is that the service was a bit slow, even after the rush died down.   This experience was a 4/5, the previous one was a 2/5. Overall, I think it averages out to a bit above a three. Good enough for diner food, and I appreciate the effort their management went to in order to make things right after things were brought to their attention."}
{"text":"The first time I stopped here, was before a night out with my man. I was so hungry, and I still had 15 minutes until my table was ready at another restaurant. I saw that this diner was full with people, and people were even starting to wait outside the restaurant. This is how I knew I had to stop by. We shared a peach scone (DELICIOUS), then headed over to our dinner reservations.  The next weekend, late on a Sunday morning, we decided to go and try out the breakfast at the diner. We arrived at about 10am, and waited about 20 minutes for our table. Not too bad, considering how busy the diner was, and also because there was a full display of pies and other baked treats to look at. I ordered the breakfast quiche, with the buttery pastry crust. My boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict. They were both delicious, and extremely large portions. I previously planned to order a slice of pie to share, since they're known for their pies. But at the end of the meal, I knew I had to save the pie for a different day.   Good, cozy atmosphere. I would recommend coming earlier if possible, but even during its' busy hours, the wait was very tolerable. Good service, good food, what more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Went for post night-shift breakfast, because we were told we could drink here early in the AM. And we did-- the bloody marys are delicious, and spicy. The french toast is also delicious, not so spicy. All six of us enjoyed the hell out of our food, even though they made us wait out in the cold until they opened at 7.   Overall, a great diner breakfast experience."}
{"text":"The pies are totally overrated. Just because they offer like 100 different pie flavors doesn't mean they do them well. I've tried six different pie flavors from this place, ranging from fruit pies to chocolate pies, and in between. Each time I've just felt a little disappointed, and that the pies look better than they taste. Pies are supposed to be their big hit. Can't speak for anything else on the menu as I've only gone for pie."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. My honest assessment is that the food is average, but you come here more for the experience. By which I mean pie, obviously.  I most recently came on a Friday night after practice, at 8pm. The place was packed. I hadn't had dinner so I needed some food. Since it was Friday night, I felt like I had to get some fish fry but i was tempted by the breakfast food. That was a mistake. The fish fry is pretty mediocre. Fish is not crispy, kind of soggy and very soft inside, and essentially unflavored. The breakfast food that some of the rest of the group got looked average, but I mean that's diner food right?  That's all to say that you're coming here for the pie. They've got a pretty good selection, ranging from your fruit pies to cheesecake and silk pies. A slice is the same price for any flavor. Again, I wouldn't really consider any of the pies special - but the bit of chocolate silk I got from someone who couldn't finish her piece (I think it was the chocolate silk part of duo of silks) was not silky (fluffy) but more like a dense, creamy chocolate pie which I like much better than silk anyway!  They've also got a number of pie-related word play shirts and stickers."}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights  -great service -just like many Madison brunch spots be prepared to wait -good food  Came to Hubbard Avenue Diner on a busy Sunday morning around 11:30. The space resembles a 50's diner, particularly the bar area. We were told there was a 20 minute wait for a table or we could be seated at the bar whenever space was available. Two seats opened up right at the bar as soon as we got there (obviously fate). Sometimes you don't get great service when you sit at the bar, but that is NOT the case here. The service at the bar was excellent. There were a lot of great options on the menu but I finally landed on the southwest omelet and my boyfriend got the \"mile high\" (Denver) omelet. Both omelets were great and balanced the egg, extras, a cheese really well. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The Hubbard is okay. The food isn't bad, but it's not as outstanding as they think it is. Not is it as good as the price they charge.   Oh, and what they call apple sauce is really pie filling in a cup!"}
{"text":"I love the vanilla malts (and they're huge), and our 14-year-old son loves the burgers. It's a fun spot, in the classic diner style, though it's only 10 years old."}
{"text":"Like the true deli experience, the true diner experience is hard to find in these parts. The Food Fight group's twist on this slice of Americana nails it in most respects and misses it in just a few. Here are my key performance indicators for excellence in dinerology: - Simple food spun up by a short-order cook with a mouth that makes a sailor blush.  - Bad coffee brewed in a Bunn-O-Matic and poured by a gruff waitress who, with her smoker's voice and polyester uniform, can keep up the banter with the foul-mouthed cooks.  - Pie for dessert.  Here's my analysis of the KPIs:  - We didn't talk to the busy cooks, but the waitresses appear as if like they could hold their own in the kitchen. They don't wear polyester. That's OK. The food is simple: turkey dinner good, cole slaw good, skip the fish fry, eat the French fries. The patty melt is an old diner standby. Get it here, even if it's Lent and you're Catholic and it's Friday. If God has tried the fish, he'll excuse you.  - The coffee is OK, not terrible, and the pie is great. If you visit during the holiday season, do yourself a favor and get the candy cane pie and ginger cake."}
{"text":"This morning I got up early to join the boys' \"breakfast club\". It was pretty delicious! I'm a big hash brown fan, and the Morning Scramble special did not disappoint. My only complaint is that the edges of my eggs were slightly cold, and the cheese wasn't melted. But I can look past this, due to the savory browns.   The decor is somewhat 50's, with an odd collection of teapots and a wall painted with the names of all the pie flavors available. I love the plastic coffee thermos they leave on the table for you. Hood Half n Half! Domino Sugar! This spot is pretty authentic and the service was great.  Next time, I'm trying the Breakfast Quesadilla or Daily Double :) But for now, I'm sleeping in..."}
{"text":"The breakfast was very disappointing. I have not had any other meals here. However their desserts: cookies and pies are yummy. I don't think i would ever buy a meal here again. However i will stop in for a cookie or 2 ;)"}
{"text":"Three and a half stars. This place is a lot like Monty's-- the menu ought to be appealing, but isn't. The food is ok, and the service is a half notch above what you'd expect.  Oh, and yes, the pie is decent. Not amazing, but above average."}
{"text":"Solid old school diner in the heart of Old Middleton. The daily scrambler is always tasty and good size and comes with hash browns and a home made biscuit. I'm not a big fan of hash browns, so I wish they offered american fries as an option. That being said the hash browns are good. The coffee they serve is Colectivo and is a popular choice for people in the Madison area, but I find it a tad too dark & bitter for my liking. Overall Hubbard is a great pick for breakfast and the atmosphere is great and the customer service is stellar."}
{"text":"Waiting time way too long - also you can see available tables.  My omelet was \"2.5 out of 5\".....dry and not high quality.  Hush Brown was \"ok\".  ENGLISH muffins remind me the time ISRAEL was escape from Egypt......ston are less hard....  Not my first visit....they do have great pies tho, but we didn't order it this time"}
{"text":"don't matter. You need food? They got it, and lots of it! And pies  service is amiable. You pay at the front. There's parking. Writing is difficult. I love pie!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here in a group of 4 and it was a pretty good experience. I ordered one of their burgers with fries and, although it wasn't quite as good as some of the burgers from the classic pubs in downtown Madison, it wasn't a bad burger at all. I also order their fresh-squeezed orange juice and it was as fresh and as good as advertised. To be honest though, I was a little underwhelmed with their pies. Maybe it was because they hype them up so much that my expectations going in were too high but I just wasn't blown away by any of the 4 different ones that we ordered. Still, the atmosphere is really nice and the prices and portions are reasonable, so I'd definitely come here again and give a different pie another try."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday lunch yesterday, suggested by other members of our 4-pack. Collectively, I give Hubbard 3 stars but I'd give my meal 1 star. The corned beef on my Reuben was inedible, I pulled it all off and tried to enjoy what was left of it. I feel like they were getting rid of the leftovers from St. Patrick's day....it was thick, extremely tough, and dry. I attempted to cut it into smaller pieces but even a fork and knife couldn't tear through it. Another member of our party said her one piece was like that but the other was fine. My fries were average, but generous. My husband had the smokehouse burger that he said was amazing, and my grandpa's scalloped potatoes and ham was \"just ok\".   The service was attentive, but not overly friendly. She did notice my gift and let us know I got a free slice of pie for my birthday =)  We noticed they were on a wait when he left at 12:45p, so this place obviously stays busy.  The restaurant and bathrooms were incredibly clean.   The mint Oreo pie was delicious!"}
{"text":"Good spot if you are interested in an updated old style diner. Clean and friendly with a splash of unique foods. Main focus is on the pies which are 5 star."}
{"text":"Love love love!  They have great food all around, great service and  even better pie!  Its a go to joint for me when I visit family in the Madison area."}
{"text":"We stayed at the wonderful Country Inn and Suites in Middleton last weekend and volunteered for the Ironman WI. By the way all five of us girls ate on Monday morning, you would think WE all did the Ironman on Sunday....but we did all sign up for the Ironman 2013 in Madison. I had the BEST  Huevos Rancheros with hash browns. The homemade salsa verde has a definite kick so if you have a timid stomach, you may want to avoid it. Me: I asked for extra salsa. Great service, prompt delivery of our food and healthy portions.   We were all so full we didn't even have time for pie,which was very disappointing. It looked so delicious.  We asked the hotel for a local diner and we loathe Cracker Barrel for reasons I don't think appropriate to voice here.  Bravo Hubbard Avenue Diner!"}
{"text":"We visited the Hubbard Avenue Diner for the first time recently. We were looking for a place to go after taking in a movie nearby and after reviewing their menu and website decided to give them a try. The Hubbard Diner has a fairly extensive menu (a few more vegetarian/vegan options would be nice). While they are not bar-oriented, they still had some local crafts on tap and in bottles. My kids went for the Baked Mac & Cheese which they devoured. I had the black bean burger and fries. Which was good. Appeared to be a homemade patty (not pre-packaged). Our server was nice enough, but not overly friendly. Some of the other staff seemed a bit grumpy the night we were there (which was a Saturday around 8PM). They were out of several of their pies--including their key lime (which we probably would have sampled). The place itself seemed a bit worn, but nothing that would deter me from stopping again. Hoping for smiles and pie the next time we visit."}
{"text":"Hickory Smokehouse Burger - Excellent! I also had the Yellow cake with strawberry filling and butter cream frosting.  It looked like a Strawberry Shortcake....  It definitely looked better than it tasted.  It was dry and didn't have much flavor. The Vegetable beef stew was good. My biggest caveat...  No breakfast all day.  What kind of diner doesn't serve breakfast all day?  Breakfast is a huge moneymaker.  Sell it all day."}
{"text":"I was lucky a couple of weeks ago to get to visit the Hubbard Avenue Diner. I have heard so many good things about it so I was excited to finally get to visit for myself. First off it is just fun to eat there. It has a wonderful classic diner feel to it. I had a burger that was very tasty. We received great service from a very friendly waiter. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Sunday pot roast dinner.  Please, go on a Sunday.  Be overwhelmed.  It's just amazing roast beef (pull apart tender) with a giant helping of mashed and gravy along with a dinner roll and beans and carrots.  Our waitress was one of the nicest, most genuine servers I've ever had.  Ever.  She bounced from tables to the counter and always stopped to ask how we were doing, if we needed anything, and give us some tips on dining and sights around the area.  The pie.  Oh, the pie.  I had the duo of silks.  Out of this world good.  I highly recommend this place over Bluephie's (same restaurant group, different take at each place)."}
{"text":"This is another example of a restaurant that survives and thrives based more on reputation and perception, than actual food quality. When one claims to be a diner, the fundamentals of such a claim should start with breakfast. Frankly, how hard is it to screw up breakfast? You don't have to make an outstanding breakfast, but you have to make one that at least is as good as one would make in their own kitchen. Such is not the case with Hubbard Diner. If you read the reviews by Scott C and Hannah M, you will note that they are intrigued by the uniforms and t-shirts, rather than the food. If I want to go somewhere to see great uniforms, I would think of the Wynn in Vegas or the Borgata in Atlantic City. I came here for the diner food.  The scrambled eggs were dry and brown. The hash brown was bland and again, dry. The toast had a nice flavor but was hard and cold. The orange juice was not fresh squeezed but rather tasted like what McDonald's serves. How do you get away with serving this type of breakfast and still able to call yourself a diner? The decor is cute and kitschy. The use of the math symbol for pi is fun but not unique. All of that can't overcome the plain, and rather bland food.  I would like to thank the patrons who dined around me that morning for making me realize I am still in back-ass dumb-f*ck America. Despite the fact that less than a mile away is a Starbucks and other chain restaurants, rural america still exists. The table across from me was a group of gentlemen discussing electricity and wiring on a farm, while the table behind me had two older men talking about Jews, how cheap they are and how they go to their own temples to worship whatever they worship with their own people. Thanks fellow patrons for making me remember why I prefer urban centers and I am always much safer in Newark or Harlem than I ever will be in back-ass, farm lands."}
{"text":"I came back just to have a piece of pie but this time around dinner time the place was packed with the line out the door. I asked if this was a busy night because of the graduation weekend but was told this was a slow night, oh boy. Most of the pie case was emptied out so there were slim pickings to choose from. I lucked out and got a fudge bottom pie with Bavarian cream on top to get my fix. I ordered it to go and at it in the lobby at a high top. I wish they would have offered that option instead of trying to figure it out on my own. Love the pie but not willing to wait in the crazy line for it."}
{"text":"I had a positively delicious breakfast on a Sunday early afternoon.  I got the breakfast quesadilla stuffed with scrambled eggs, black beans, and not enough cheese. It also comes with a side of homemade salsa that was super pureed and did not have enough heat or chunks of tomato for my liking.  Seriously though, despite these two things it was still quite tasty.  The place was packed but our service was excellent.  The pies/cakes looked amazing, must try!"}
{"text":"Carrot cake is Devine! The best I've ever  had!"}
{"text":"I would take my parents here if they visited Wisconsin.  It's a cool old timey atmosphere with a spot-on quiche.  The selection of desserts and pastries this overwhelming for your eyes. However, I tried the Cherry Rhubarb pie, and I must say that my stomach was rather underwhelmed. I was prepared to be blown away, but I found the pie lackluster. The crust was soggy, and there was no pizazz to the filling. Even the ice cream was bland (not their fault).  To be fair, I tried one pie, but I wouldn't want to be disappointed by another one. I'm sure I'll try Hubbard again in the future, but it won't be anytime soon."}
{"text":"Generally tasty, nicer-than-typical diner food. There are better places in town for breakfast, but they cover the bases. For lunch and dinner, the NY Turkey Reuban and the chipotle chicken salad are two of my favorites.  I have never really cared for their pie crust, though the duo of silks pie is really good, and the mint brownie way surpasses the regular brownie.   Can get pretty busy during peak meal times, but the wait is never too-too long."}
{"text":"UPDATE! I have finally tried the food here. I got one of the chicken wraps with a small cup of chili, and the bf got the chicken and chips. Both dishes were well prepared and really hit the spot. The service was quick and attentive, and our food came out fast. I especially liked the fried chicken, it had the perfect amount of crunch and the chicken was surprisingly moist.   Great spot for comfort food!"}
{"text":"So I've only been once, but I can't see ever coming back. After a pretty ho-hum lunch I decided to get a slice of cherry pie to give the diner a chance at redemption. It was a chance they squandered.  Very average all the way around."}
{"text":"Just a point of clarification -- the Old Fashioned pie was flavored like the cocktail and they did a bang up job of it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Wisconsin regarding business.  On our way back home I decided I wanted to try apple pie somewhere there since I saw so many fresh apple trees in the area...I thought...the pies must be good here.  We asked a local restaurant we had lunch at for their recommendation and they recommended Hubbard Avenue Diner.  We were immediately greeted by Sam , he was friendly and extremely helpful in suggesting a few options.  I ordered the apple pie, which I originally came for ...crumbled apple pie that is...and my husband decided to go with an option of Sams.  Although not bad, the pie Sam recommended wasn't to my husband's liking...but Sam immediately replaced it with one my husband chose this time...well..the second one..my husband wasn't a fan of either..again..nothing wrong with the pie..i actually liked the second one ...but just wasn't what my husband was looking for...we didn't want to have Sam replace a second pie...but Sam came over to make sure we liked the pies we were tasting...and we let him know it wasn't what my husband was looking for but it was ok, not to worry about it..but Sam insisted to give us another one ..so i finally told my husband to go for the crumbled apple pie...which I was having...Sam packed one for us to go. He didn't have to care so much that we like the pie..but he did...he found it important that we drove all the way there to try their famous pie and that we left happy..and because of Sam..and that awesome crumbled pie...we definitely left very happy....i kind of wish i had gotten a large pie so i could be sitting here eating another slice now.  I highly recommend you order the crumbled apple pie and get it warm.  btw...they are very lucky to have an employee like Sam.  We own businesses and we know the importance of having an employee that exhibits such great customer service."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday for brunch and Hubbard Avenue Diner did not disappoint! We arrived around 1pm...the place was busy, but they seem to turn over tables fairly quickly. We only waited about 10 minutes to be seated. I LOVE all the pi references =)   We ordered coffee and the waitress brought a small carafe to the table for self-serve refills. Nice! For food, I ordered one of the daily brunch specials, an egg scramble with sausage, mushrooms, onions, and cheese served with hash browns and a biscuit. The scramble was cooked well and included the right balance of eggs and \"stuff.\" Hash browns were crispy and the biscuit was flaky and delicious. My breakfast mate ordered the daily quiche, which included a unique hash brown crust (rather than a pastry crust). I was told it was yummy =)   Overall, I'd come back to Hubbard for a solid, quality brunch. The breakfast menu is not super extensive, but they offer good options, plus the daily specials keep it interesting. I'd like to try some of the more unique dishes, such as Potato-Zucchini Pancakes or Breakfast Quesadilla."}
{"text":"FOUR AND A HALF STARS! When we first walked in for breakfast, we were amazed by the huge, delicious pies that this place is famous for making. We were seated immediately and our friendly waitress was very quick to deliver our food! Great portions, great prices, great atmosphere! I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants an authentic diner experience!"}
{"text":"A gem in Middleton Wisconsin.  The only place I want to go for breakfast on a Sunday morning, along with every other resident in the town!  Good food with a quality staff."}
{"text":"Food's good, but a bit pricey. $3.89 for a side of bacon, which consisted of three scrawny pieces is hardly worth it when you consider a whole pound costs a little more. Biscuits are good. Light and flluffy. Southwestern Eggs Benedict are delicious. Definitely will be back but never ordering side of bacon again"}
{"text":"I called ahead to order the new item:  Pie Tacos.  I placed an order for two dozen.  The flavors were Apple, Cherry, French Silk, and Key Lime.  I got there 30 minutes earlier than I said and the order was not yet put together.   I was fine with that.  It did take a while to get the order together and it was very messy.  I think carrying out a smaller number would stay nicer.  The fruit pies kept their shape the best in transit.  The cream pies with the whipped topping fared far worse.  The tastes of each pie were good...as reported to me by everyone who dug into the box of treats.  I personally sampled the Key Lime and French Silk.  The Key Lime had a soggy \"taco shell\" so it was hard to pick up.  The flavor was spot on but I wished for a spoon.  The French Silk's shell kept it's integrity but the whipped topping was easy to lose.  It has a good chocolate taste.  The box with the cream pies was a whipped cream mess.  I ordered these on the first day they were available.  So with that in mind, the packaging is forgiven as it was an experiment.  I am sure this will get improved in the future.  And the pies all tasted very good and are fun.  I would order the pie tacos again but would be more inclined to eat them in the restaurant or carry out only one or two for the road."}
{"text":"I went with colleagues and I had the meat loaf and mashed potatoes with gravy and salad. Meat loaf was tender and the food was pipping hot. The diner roll was excellent too! It was so good I didn't get a picture."}
{"text":"Just a great dinner!   If you're looking for a old fashion dinner this is the place. Great breakfast and great lunch.   If you want breakfast on the weekend come early or plan on waiting.  Loved their omelette!!! My wife got the eggs Benedict. We can't wait to go back. They have a huge selection of pies and we haven't even tried the, yet. Next time we'll save room."}
{"text":"Had Mac and Cheese with chicken and was completely satisfied, awesome pie and great service!"}
{"text":"Have not eaten here in years. Remember the food was good, but the service was terrible. Tonight we arrived just as they got really busy. Ordered the steak kabob at the server's suggestion. The veggies, sauce, and rice were really good. The meat was over cooked, dry, and inedible. My companion had the grilled cheese sandwich which was absolutely delicious-- the bread was grainy and wonderful, it was filled with melty fantastic cheese. Her fresh fruit was also good. The chocolate shake was great.   Service has improved dramatically- except that the server didn't ask how I wanted my meat and didn't check back with us until we were finished. She was very apologetic and gave us complimentary pie to make it alright. Not a bad experience, but not the greatest. I'll try again another time."}
{"text":"YES desserts!  Rest of food...be wary of what you order.  Hubbard diner and Monty's Blue Plate are like opposite sides of the spectrum--Hubbard celebrates being retro, Monty's says \"Yeah, we have a vegan version of that!\"  A lot of the menu items are the same, but somehow, Hubbard's versions usually suffer.  I once ordered the quiche and found it nearly inedible.  The quiche was like a dense scrambled egg pie.  If I ordered food again, I would stick with 1950s American classics like burgers, grilled cheeses, and tuna melts.  The desserts at Hubbard are fabulous.  Every pie option, from fruit pies to cream pies, are absolutely delicious. I recommend the Caramel Apple and the Duo of Silks. The Hot Fudge Brownie is insane...I thought it would be more like brownie a la mode but really it's like hot fudge brownie for 3 people.  And delicious.  I have also accompanied a friend for a wedding cake tasting here, and all the cakes we sampled were fabulous.   I'll happily stop by for dessert any time, but am hesistant to return for a meal. Get a slice of pie and sit down at the counter!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Breakfast lunch and dinner menus have such eclectic food choices, I truly believe there is something for everyone. And that doesn't even include DESSERT! The most important meal of the day! And Hubbard Avenue definitely puts their sweets in the limelight. My personal fav: Lemon Meringue. My kids LOVE the cookies! My husband loves the Chocolate silk pie!"}
{"text":"Great place.  First time here....the atmosphere is a diner with a 1950s type vibe inside and out.  Son said the pancakes were awesome but are heavy.    I had the Mile High omelet.  You can taste the fresh veggies that were in its  They are known for their pies and I hear they are AMAZING. Food is good and not easy...service is good too."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to visit this place! I heard about it first because of their famous pies. They have so many flavors and also season flavors that change. Was so hard to decide, but all of them were good.  I also chose to dine in. The meals are very tasty and in large portions."}
{"text":"I visited friend who recently moved to Middleton this weekend. She hasn't had the opportunity to fully explores that many places yet, so we took the advice of the gal at the Kinko's counter and had brunch at Hubbard Avenue Diner.  I always feel so much better about a place after I find a decent place to enjoy a meal...I think it's my favorite thing about traveling. Hubbard Avenue Diner provided an extremely comfortable environment to have conversation over coffee, get a decent meal, and have a piece of pie if you're so inclined.  Coffee was great. Breakfast cooked to perfection! Fresh biscuits, carnivore omelette was amazing with meat that tasted better than usual, hash browns weren't greasy like those those had after bar at Denny's the night before. Gross!  I will definitely make a return visit to Middleton and will definitely add brunch at Hubbard Ave Diner to my itinerary."}
{"text":"As always great service and food. Staff is friendly and they really know their pie! I think I ate too much but there can't really be such a thing as \"too much pie\" especially at this place. Every pie I've ever had here has been nothing short of orgasmic. The food is great too and the restaurant is in the heart of Middleton with ample parking and much to do nearby like the national mustard museum and the Middleton library. The price is a bit higher but there you're paying for location. I always make a point to stop here whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"It's a Food Fight restaurant, and this place has reliably decent food in big portions for reasonable prices.  It's very similar to Market Street Diner in Sun Prairie, and like there, the real star of the show is the pie.  I've only been here for dinner, and I've never had any complaints."}
{"text":"I think this place has a lot of potential, but for whatever reason just can't seem to get it together.  I'd heard only good things about it, by foody locals, so I thought I would be at least satisfied if not impressed. However, I left with an overwhelming felling of \"meh.\"  I'll give them another shot, but it won't be anytime soon. Maybe I'll buy one of their many pies next time? There's got to be some reason they stay afloat, right?"}
{"text":"I think I need to visit again, as I was slightly underwhelmed with my meal. I got the turkey with mashed potatoes, gravy and mixed veg. And a side of coleslaw, because I'm a sucker for coleslaw.  It really was average at best. The turkey was kind of dry, the mashed seemed instant, the gravy was good. The veg were meh. Bland and watery. The dinner roll was decent. The flavor was good. The coleslaw was too sloppy. Lots of mayo, but still fairly bland.  It's completely possible that I should visit again and try something from the breakfast menu. Or pie. My choice may not have been the best out of what they have to offer, so I will be back to try something new. And pie."}
{"text":"Great food, clean restaurant and restrooms. Absolutely packed, about a 20 minute wait but very nice waiting area. The meatloaf dinner was great but it could have used a larger portion of mashed potatoes. I like a good meat to potato ratio. There was a generous serving of vegetables and a roll, overall a really yummy meal. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Every time we go to Hubbard I really want it to be good but it's just OK at best. The atmosphere is suppose to be American diner-ish. We like to sit at the counter if we come for breakfast to avoid a wait. The pie is good but expensive. Service is OK, better at the counter then seated. The scrambled eggs are always a little overcooked and a pretty small portion. Same with the bacon overly cooked, slightly burnt, really small puny, pieces. I do like that they serve classic hash browns. And the pancakes are good. But overall breakfast is not as good as it should be for them pushing the \"classic diner\" theme. I think I've been once for lunch or dinner but not memorable and I remember our son's burger was way overcooked. Prices are comparable to other places or slightly more expensive, maybe because of the area they are in.  Its a nice place if you live in the neighborhood but we head to the Original pancake house or Monty's for stellar breakfast food for the similar prices, larger quantities and better quality."}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood diner, and it's not even my neighborhood.  Be sure to follow the diner on Facebook for specials. Today was free pie if you wear your Hubbard Diner T-shirt...YES!  My hubby and I grabbed two seats at the counter just before Noon. All counter seats filled up soon thereafter.  We each had a bowl of one of the soups of the day: Chicken Dumpling. It was delicious and so full of plump hunks of chicken, my hubby was like \"did you get any dumplings?\" Yes. I did.  Then the real hero of our lunch: pie. He had double crust cherry, and I tried Creme Brulee. Both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Always our go to for breakfast!  All other meals are wonderful too.  I order pie first with my coffee and then eggs to follow.  I have never been disappointed.  Other suggestion besides their outstanding pie:  biscuits, fried chicken, pot roast, and scalloped potatoes with ham"}
{"text":"This was my first time to Hubbard's, and I wanted to find out if this diner was living up to some of the reviews.    The vibe was cute and and had a fun atmosphere, and the hostess was organized.   After about a ten minute wait, we were seated.   The menu was what I expected for a diner which was breakfast, sandwiches, and traditional family dinners like a hot Turkey plate.    I knew coming here that their specialty was the desserts and I mean the pies, however, pies is not my thing. I ordered the two egg whites scrambled, bacon, and pancakes.   It was average and nothing exciting.   The others at the table ordered the Reuben and the vote was it was just ok.  I would have thought they would of had a killer Rueben since most diners do.   Oh well.   The service was good but did not give me a memorable experience.    Overall, it was a good try but with all the other options it didn't leave me wanting to go back."}
{"text":"We arrived around 10 and it was very busy. We did get a table after about 25-30 minutes so not too bad. We ordered our drinks and then our waitress had a medical emergency. We ended up waiting for about 30 more minutes before finally placing our order. The food was good and service was excellent after the wait. They did take care of us very well even though issues popped up that were out of their control. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Amazing place for breakfast, brunch, or lunch!  Great variety of food options for the entire family.  The food is a little priced, but the service you receive there is well worth it.  Everyone is always so willing to serve you, whether or not they are assigned to your table.  In addition to the food, the location really makes for a great experience.  After your meal, it's nice to walk around downtown Middleton looking at the different shops."}
{"text":"I don't get out to Middleton often enough to know the caliber of its restaurants.  My vague impression is that it's a bunch of middle end chain places (Macaroni Grill and the like).  Therefore, Hubbard gets extra points for at least being locally owned in a town of chains.  Menu is mostly comfort food staples.  Lots of different pasta bowls and sandwiches. Highlight is the  Meatloaf of the Gods.  However, like most Food Fight establishments, Hubbard is merely OK.  Big on presentation.  Lacking a bit in the really tasty food category."}
{"text":"Very tasty comfort foods. I love their chicken chili and their milkshakes/malts. I had a great experience with the brunch on Christmas eve morning.  We have also ordered cakes here and they are always beautiful and tasty. They are very very slow."}
{"text":"Went last with with the wife (who is vegetarian), I ordered a classic burger and she ordered a portobello burger. We both were impressed. Pie was good for desert. Service was good. Overall recommend!"}
{"text":"This terrific little downtown gem was just the spot to fill us up after a visit to the local brewery. Their homemade vegetable soup was flavored with dill and quite good. The star of our lunchtime was the ham and potato casserole smothered in delicious Wisconsin cheese. Savory and melty and gooey and wonderful. But.... also too good to pass up was their pie. We shared the cherry-rhubarb and were glad we tried it. Rhubarb - a first for us Phoenicians, but very tasty. I'd eat a little less lunch next time just so I could have more pie. Great service too - thanks a bunch!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat for good diner food. The fresh toast is especially good and the coffee is never ending....gotta love that. Great bakery case as well...pies galore!  Parking is ample, staff is friendly and if you get there around 7:45 on a Sunday morning seating is instant.  So, if in Middleton looking for a place to eat...that should be your choice."}
{"text":"I would rate Hubbard about a half a notch above \"typical\" diner food. I came for lunch on a weekday and was able to get a seat right away. My waitress was very prompt, though not overly friendly. I ordered the veggie bean burger, and though it was perfectly acceptable, it was not fantastic. I also ordered a slice of the apple pie and I must say I have tasted better. To me, the filling tasted like it came straight out of a can. Nonetheless, the menu is extensive and is sure the have something for everyone, and the bakery case is quite the eye-catcher to all who walk in the front door."}
{"text":"Loved the breakfast so much we went here two days in a row!  Pancakes and French toast were both awesome, as were the hashbrowns (cooked just how I like), biscuits, and veggi benedict.  Wish I would have had a chance to try the pies because they looked great too!  The service was very good both times."}
{"text":"Great little place!  The menu is pretty diverse and I always enjoy my meal.  SAVE ROOM FOR PIE for dessert!  You MUST try a slice of something!  Their pie selection is insane!  A MUST stop for breakfast or lunch if you're ever in Middleton!"}
{"text":"This diner in downtown Middleton was close to the hotel we were staying at. It was about a 10 min wait on a Monday evening.  I had the catfish sandwich with a chili side. The catfish sandwich was dry and the chili side was cold. My coworker had the pulled pork sandwich in which she described the buns as \"brick-line!\"  My second co-worker had the catfish bowl with cornbread which was just okay.  For dessert we had the boston creme pie which was very disappointing.  I had the strawberry rhubarb pie which was probably the highlight of the night. I heard that the lemon white chocolate pie was only good because the flavors were different.  Maybe it was just a bad night but I'd recommend to skip this diner and try somewhere else."}
