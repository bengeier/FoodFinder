{"text":"The Artichoke Grill is NOT closed! My husband and I had lunch there today. The bread gasket was yummy filled with many treats: banana bread, cranberry muffin, two types of crackers, bread slice and roll. All were made by students and delicious. Next I had the Monte Cristo sandwich with roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon and my husband had lamb with polenta. We both enjoyed our entrees. We shared the dessert sampler of tiramisu, creme brûlée and a nutty toffee like bar. The presentation was beautiful and all three were delicious. We plan to go back next month. The prices are reasonable ($21 including tip) for the two of us."}
{"text":"Greeted with you're early we're not ready.  We were 10 min early for reservation.  Menu was banquet style so we had no choice but to pay $15.50.  Was online same morning and they had regular a la cartel menu posted.  Asked about chicken dish. Was not told it was not boneless or skinless.  Just talked about vegetables and sauce.  Asked about desserts and comment was it was not wrotten  on board.  For end of semester students they have a lot to learn about front end.  Creme brûlée was one of desserts. It was like a runny custard and full of berries.  Fudge was ok but brownie like thing was awful. Nuts in two out of three desserts. Lots of folks have nut allergies.  Make some choices without nuts.  Salad was minuscule. Rolls were good. Not worth the price! Will not return."}
{"text":"Artichoke Grill serves up a mix of more standard type entrees, sandwiches, and desserts, for a very reasonable price.  Food preparation varies since they are all students cooking the food, but it provides them an opportunity to show off their cooking education.    We went today and had the sea bass with roasted beets, and shared some desserts.  Since they are towards the beginning of the semester, there are still some kinks to work out in the service and food department, but with patience, all will turn out all right.  It's a good deal, since there aren't many places (if at all) that you will find a sea bass entree meal for less than $7.  Unfortunately, my sea bass was still raw on the inside, but it was promptly returned, and they made a whole new entree for me.  It was probably a bit ambitious for me to try a harder-to-prepare dish for students just starting out, but like I said, I give them credit for trying!"}
