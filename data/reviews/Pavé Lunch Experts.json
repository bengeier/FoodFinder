{"text":"All sandwiches come with a choice of soup of the day, salad or chips... Go for the chips, they're the thick, kettle-type chips. Café Pavé is a great lunch option for a quick grab and go or stay and eat. From grain-fed chicken sandwiches, all out bacon-based sandwiches and vegetarian choices; fresh ingredients, prepared properly, the sandwiches are warm and substantial; a great alternative to your typical refrigerated cold cuts and loveless sliced cheese. Alternatively, they do offer whole wheat wraps and gluten free bread, but if those are not to your taste, the fresh ciabatta is the best way to go anyways."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh and energizing food (including gluten-free vegetarian), very friendly service. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. The food was delicious, the beer was cold, and the music was great. A must try!! The service was the best we've had in Montreal yet :)"}
{"text":"sandwiches are GREAT and full of flavor....soups are BAD. just order the chips. Great options for vegetarians and their ingredients are high quality. Employees are super friendly."}
{"text":"Wonderful little gem nearby Notre Dame. Great sandwiches, pleasant staff, and gluten free options to boot. Sandwich places are usually a no-go for me, but Café Pavé was a surprise exception. Their gluten free rolls are delicious. The Pavé Osaka is amazing. Pulled pork and goat cheese...how can you go wrong? A drink and salad are included in the price.  They also have glass bottles of soda for a small upcharge.  Make sure you drop by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Glad to have happened upon what really is a destination cafe for the freshest soups, sandwiches and friendly service.  Really, really good sausage sandwich with braised spinach and super roll.  A lentil soup (ordinarily not my favorite...too often gruel-like and mushy) which was filled with rough-cut veggies, fully cooked but firm lentils and a beautiful clear broth.   Daylight and sky pouring through the facade, gracious personnel.  When I met the chef owner, who walked the length of the cafe to serve me, I said what immediately came to mind: \"You obviously know what you're doing and love what you're doing.\"  But don't take my word for it.  Go there."}
{"text":"I work very near this café so I go here on a regular basis for lunch. So far I have not been disappointed.  For 9.99$ plus tx you get a sandwich with a choice of salad, chips or soup plus a beverage.  (bonus points for recognizing that the greatest accompaniment for a sandwich is chips! )   I usually go for the sandwich trio and being a vegetarian I am pleased that they have a good selection of veggie sandwiches, my favourite being the Paris, which is comprised of roasted zucchinis, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes which always taste as though they have been freshly sautéed and the sandwich is full of flavour and wonderful artichoke sauce and topped off with sunflower sprouts.  I haven't tried any of the sandwiches containing meat but my co-workers have given many rave reviews.   For 9.99$ plus tx you get a sandwich with a choice of salad, chips or soup plus a beverage.  (bonus points for recognizing that the greatest accompaniment for a sandwich is chips! )   The service is always friendly and I like the fact that after you order you take a small pail with all your cutlery and napkins and any needed accessories.  This is a great spot to find a reasonably priced, fresh and delicious lunch in Old Montréal.  I will continue to come back again and again."}
{"text":"Excellent food with very attentive and kind staff. Four of us had the Tunis, Louisville, and Philadelphia Paves along with a Java Naanwich, and all were delicious! The staff were very friendly and checked in on us several times to make sure all was well. Matt even took the time to help us with directions for our afternoon plans! Would highly recommend for both the food and the great folks who work there."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place near the cathedral in Montreal.  The place is small, but the flavor is big.  I had the Osaka pulled-pork sandwich.  It was delicious!  The sweetness of the pork was balanced perfectly by the freshness of the cucumber and the spiciness of the mayo.  The service was attentive and friendly as well.  Cafe Pave is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were on a trip to Montreal and stopped in here for lunch. The atmosphere is great. The service is wonderful. The food is amazing! I got the pulled pork and it was probably one of the best pulled pork I've ever had and I eat pulled pork everywhere I go. I would definitely go back here if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"So my son and I are in Montreal to see a hockey game and then visit some sites. Stopped by here based upon Yelp reviews and closeness to Notre Dame. We were not disappointed. I got the pulled pork sandwich with the spicy cilantro sauce and it was excellent. Being from the south, I know good pork and this is right up there. My son got the French version of a Philly cheese steak and it was excellent as well. Meat was high quality and done well. The soup today was a carrot and ginger which I didn't order it because I'm not a big fan of carrots in general. However, the owner, Matthew, brought us a cup to try and it was good, considering it was made with carrots! We also got to talk to Matthew for a few minutes and really enjoyed the conversation about hockey, family and the love for the food that he makes. I highly recommend the food and supporting great restaurants like this. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tasty, but the pulled pork had the mouthfeel of salmon salad. Kind of weird. The ambience is good, and the location is convenient to the business district.  For the location prices are very reasonable, but portions are small so don't expect a filling meal."}
{"text":"Our group had salads or sandwiches that came with a side and drink. Everything was very fresh with great flavors. I really enjoyed the cauliflower soup. Then we finished it off by sharing a delicious oatmeal cookie. Place was comfortable and service was excellent. I recommend this place for great lunches at a good value."}
{"text":"Stopped in from my journey to a local pharmacy, which is impossible in Montreal. Being from out of town, I just wanted a quick bite,and boy was I in for a treat. I got a smoked sandwich from selection of tantalizing options that instantly turned me sober. In all honesty the place is phenomenal, definitely a must try while your in town."}
{"text":"Service was incredible, very friendly staff. Food was AMAZING! Best sandwiches my partner and I have ever had. Recommendations are: sweet potato soup, salad, osaka pulled pork ciabatta, and louisville chicken. We will be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Un bon endroit pour le lunch !   Simple, rapide et différent ! Le cafe pavé est le meilleure spot pour manger un bonne sandwich de porc effiloché ou une pizza :)  Vous pouvez toujours prendre le repas du jour il est toujours excellent !"}
{"text":"I don't want to oversell it, but the Rio is probably my favorite sandwich ever.  The staff here is friendly, the décor of this restaurant is spot on, the soups are good, and the prices are fair.  I work around the corner and this is one of my regular lunch spots.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"the beshtttttt!!! sandwiches i have had....  pulled pork sandwich was awsomeeee....meat soooo tender....  i felt cheated when i learnt that they are closed on weekends....  why would you wanna even close down such a place....  Jealous of all the folks who work near this place and eat at this joint again and again....  I was visiting Montreal and i am happy to have stumbled over this location..."}
{"text":"Excellent quiet cafe across from a park. The owner was very patient and friendly.  He took the time to chat at each table. Food was fresh, interesting,and flavorful"}
{"text":"I came to get a take-out lunch and ordered soup and the Italia salad. The soup was a just passable purée of hard to define vegetables, and the flavor was mainly of cream and salt, although a hint of garlic was detectable. The salad. Oh dear. Well, I ordered it to go, and it was put in a liter soup container, so that the pieces of prosciutto, Parmesan cheese, and capers were on top, and the lettuce below. I had to wait quite a while, even though they were only moderately busy. As I was leaving the cook ran after me and gave me the dressing she had forgotten to put in the bag with my salad, so points for remembering and running after me, but demerits for having forgotten in the first place. When I got back to the office and peeled back the lid on my little salad treasure capsule, I spread the contents out on a plate. The prosciutto clung together in a prosciutto meat ball, and there were a few sprouts that had nothing to do with anything Italian, and then there were about five capers (anyone who knows me knows I am a huge caper fan, so demerits on the lack of capers too!;). On top of everything was some crumbled parmesan cheese. I tried the prodigal dressing, and it was awful. The trinity for this place seems to be cream, garlic, and salt, which is basically what the dressing was, and again, it had very little to do with Italian flavors, except for the garlic of course. If you're going to call a salad Italia, then a smattering of prosciutto, capers, and parmesan on lettuce is a poor attempt. At least add some grilled eggplant, zucchini, artichoke, pickled mushrooms to the aforementioned, and serve it with a nice olive oil vinaigrette. The cardinal sin for me though, was the fact that they hadn't even bothered to sort the bad lettuce from the good, and I wonder whether or not they didn't just reach in a bag of big bulk store restaurant lettuce, without washing it or looking at it to see if it was rotten before packing it up for me. I found about ten to fifteen pieces of edible lettuce, while the rest was wilted, rotting, brown, or just yuck. I have no idea why restaurants that charge $10 or more for a meal salad, don't ensure that the main component of that salad is not perfect, and moreover why people often let them get away with it - this isn't the first baby romaine disaster I've had in Montreal unfortunately. The bulk of my only giving two stars to this place lies with the lack of attention to detail that allowed me to receive a basically inedible $10 salad, and with the lack of imagination and poor execution in the dishes themselves. Maybe they make great stuff otherwise, and I just caught them in a bad moment, but there are too many other good places in the Old Port for me to give this one another chance. Sorry so negative! Happy thoughts from now on. Ommmm."}
{"text":"Very nice place with some healthy options. Meals include a drink and a side, although if you get a large salad, you probably don't want a side salad, and their soup isn't vegetarian, so chips it is."}
{"text":"Great little place for a quick bite! Also the only place I've seen that has gluten free bread, which was a selling point for me. I had a veggie sandwich on the GF bread, which was delicious, although seeing as how the gf bread is on the small side, the sandwich wasn't exactly large. My boyfriend's sandwich (Buenos Aires) on regular baguette was a more standard lunch sandwich portion, in my opinion. Your sandwich also comes with a soup or a salad, and for $9-$11 that's definitely one of the best deals I've seen for a meal in Montreal.  Great spot if you are looking to save a little money but still have a tasty meal!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. If you're looking for a good freshly made sandwich in old Montreal that's not a tourist trap - this place is a good bet. I work in old Montreal so it's a little pricey for every day but that's the neighbourhood. I love to eat here to support a local, independent cafe and would recommend this over the processed java-u (sorry) type place ANY DAY! I recommend the patros nanwich if you're into Greek salads because I love the bread it comes on. The owner, Matt, is super nice! This is also a default go-to for our company lunch meetings - they always put on a fabulous spread and are very accommodating. Into this place and wish there were more like it in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I have to say, the owner of this place has his menu down.  For those of us with gluten allergies, he has a dedicated menu to let us know which sandwiches can be safely made gluten free and which ones risk cross contamination.  Regrettably, the soup side is not gluten free (although so easily made that way), but I'm seriously happy to be able to eat these delicious sandwich creations.   Absolutely love the athena sandwich -- plenty of feta and fresh vegetables.  Come enjoy a meal here, celiacs and gluten intolerants! :)"}
{"text":"While in Montreal on a cold and windy afternoon, wandering around the city trying to find a good place to eat when I stumbled along Cafe Pave. The food gods must have been looking after me because this place. DROOL!  The pulled pork is to die for. The Osaka sandwich (which is heavily reviewed on Yelp and for good reason) was my choice and I would happily eat this sandwich forever. It had the delicious pulled pork, cucumber, cheese, and ginger. Somehow it reminded me of a Bahn Mi (perhaps it is the only sandwich were I felt the flavor lived up to that).   A cute, fast place to eat a delicious meal at a good price."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the perfect lunch experience for a local business-person.  If you are a tourist and you crave an excellent sandwich..try this place instead of Titanic which is always lined up...for good reason...but try Pave...it's eye-openingly good."}
{"text":"Located just a stone's throw away from Notre-Dame Basilica, Café Pavé is a great lunch option. They operate from Monday to Friday 8:00 am to 4:00 pm. Chef Matt is very passionate bout his food and you can see it in his sandwiches. They use ciabatta bread for most of their sandwiches, but they also have a Nanwich option where you can have your sandwich in a nan bread instead. Their pulled pork sandwiches are to die for. My personal favorites being the Lima & Monterey.  Did I mention its very reasonably priced?  A trio, Sandwich, Drink and a side (soup/salad/chips) is around 10-13 bucks. Not bad at all. Actually its one of the best lunch spots in the neighborhood. The service is quick and very friendly.  Definitely recommended   P.S. - Try their house \"Hot\" sauces  Food -  Good Service - Friendly Ambiance - Casual Worth the money - Oh Yeaaaah"}
{"text":"Just what we were looking for!  After trekking over to Notre Dame in the hot sun this past weekend, we were both weary and looking for some lunch before heading home to Vermont.  We were looking for something that was casual, inexpensive, not necessarily the full server experience but definitely something local and not a chain.  We stumbled upon Cafe Pave and were pleased with the menu outside so we wandered in.  We ordered two of the lunch specials - a sandwich with either the soup or a side salad and a drink for $9.99 + tax.  We both got the pulled pork sandwichs (the Monteray and the Osako, I believe) and side salads.  The Monteray, in particular, was AMAZING and we both loved the dijon dressing for the salads.  The breads for the sandwiches were just lovely - almost an English muffin consistency with a firm exterior.  We loved it.  The interior of the cafe was casual but fun and we the chalkboard paint on the walls in the back and bathrooms where patrons could leave quotes or comments was quite clever.  The service was very friendly as well and our dishes were brought to us promptly.  I bet this place is quite popular with the work crowd!  We took a business card and will definitely be back when we are in town again!"}
{"text":"Their pulled pork is roasted for 18 hours, y'all. It's absolutely delicious, like literal melt-in-your-mouth tender and packed with serious flavor.   Everything on Pave's menu sounds fantastic, but I had to narrow it down and choose something during our lunch excursion. I happily ended up with the Osaka sandwich: the perfect pulled pork, crisp english cucumber, tangy goat cheese, and a kamikaze sauce with candied ginger that tied the whole thing together with a mild spicy kick. The only part of the sandwich that wasn't fabulous was the gluten free bread, but I was extremely grateful they even had the option available. I think I'd rather just have the contents of the sandwich on their own (or on lettuce), however, since I found the GF bread to be especially dry and bland.  Pave has a ton of creative sandwiches that feature steak, pork, chicken, or bacon - plus an array of vegetarian selections. They also have breakfast, pizza, and desserts. The menu seemed a little bit all over the place, but Adam and I were satisfied with our orders. The kettle cooked potato chips made a great side and added some texture to my meal, and I think the portions were perfect for lunch.   My one regret? Not ordering the gluten free mango cheesecake. What is wrong with me!? Where will I find that again? I'm mildly upset about it you guys.   Otherwise, all positive thoughts when it comes to Cafe Pave!"}
{"text":"Un très bon choix dans le Vieux-Port pour l'heure du dîner! Les plats sont simples, mais vraiment délicieux et le service est quand même rapide, donc le tout se fait très bien en 1h.   Les pizzas sont sur pain Naan, donc ça fait changement et les salades sont suuuper belles (et méga grosses!). de plus, chaque plat vient avec une boisson et un chips ou une salade ou une soupe!  Il y a aussi l'option de prendre le plat du jour, ce qui est pas mal quand tu ne sais pas quoi manger!"}
{"text":"Very delicious! We stumped upon this established and glad we did.  The owner was very nice and accommodating.  We tried a total of 5 different sandwiches and they were all so delicious.  Will def. come back again!"}
{"text":"This place was one of the best cafes we went to on a recent business trip to Montreal.  The food was outstanding, affordable, menus were in English and French, and the staff was more than willing to help us out!  The gluten free bun at this cafe was one of the best that I have ever had.  Also, as visitors from the states, the staff gave us a map, told us cool places to go around town, and offered local insights.  They were just the sweetest people.  I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone in Montreal :)"}
{"text":"Wow! The food was delicious! Between 3 of us we got a Quebec salad, Genova and Coronado sandwich. The gluten free bread was the best bread I've ever had in my life! We had a chocolate tort for dessert...yum! The service was also outstanding! From the wait staff to the owner. This place is a real gem."}
{"text":"This cafe is ok. Sandwich was a regular sandwich... Nothing special to write home about! The gluten free sandwich was ok. Again, nothing fantastic there. Its a good place for lunch if your passing by with a gluten free friend and want a quick bite. A bit on the pricy side but that is to be expected considering their location."}
{"text":"Cute, almost hidden place in Old Port. I was on a lookout for lunch and decided to give it a try. They have a great selection of sandwiches + friendly service basically an ideal lunch spot. Will come back here again for lunch."}
{"text":"Great pulled pork, great sandwiches (Naanwhiches!), good dessert and they do unsweetened black iced tea which is surprisingly hard to get in Montreal.  The place is very Brooklyn in a good way, and the service was great."}
