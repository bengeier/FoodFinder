{"text":"I've been coming here since I moved to north town, ten yrs. Pats a great cook and fast! Don't be scared . Now selling beer!"}
{"text":"Not just closed, but erased. All the signs are down. Nothing to give you the impression that Pat's was ever there. Did they move?  I read that Mr Ginn would have been over 81 years old based on a Review Journal story in 2011. Did he pass?"}
{"text":"I have driven past Pat's on several occasions and had a vision of what I would want the Pat's Minimart experience to be - a little gem of a spot tucked into the corner of an aging, but clean convenient store, overseen by a charming old Chinese man with lots of stories and a big smile. However, whenever I would see the star rating on Yelp, I would decide it could never be what I hoped.   Lucky for me, I have an adventurous pal who insisted we just had to try Pat's, and as reality sometimes has a way of doing, the experience unfolded a bit like a storybook.   We didn't eat too much. We just ordered potstickers, but as we peered back into the kitchen we could see Pat hand crafting egg rolls, which led us to believe the potstickers were also homemade.   After we placed our order, Pat appeared from the kitchen filled with stories, the first of which was an explanation as to how he was an old man set in his ways and therefore it would take time for our potstickers because he had to prepare them the proper way. Subsequent stories included an explanation of his patriotic wear (he served in the Korean War); how he raised a bushel of children (punishing them all when just one did wrong), and how he had been asked by Ronald Reagan to serve in the SBA and used to serve Oscar Goodman noodles when he was a poor attorney.  I think it's easy to say that Pat is an iconic Las Vegan, and at least once in your time here, you should pull up a seat to his counter and have a snack. The potstickers did not disappoint."}
