{"text":"This is a one man show but, if you bring a nice bottle of wine and relax, you will be rewarded for your patience as Ennio prepares an authentic Italian meal from scratch with the freshest ingredients, as he has doing for over 50 years. He treats you like family in his home, and I wish I lived in Montreal so I could visit him more often. Having leftovers back home in the US is a small consultation."}
{"text":"Ennio himself will be there to greet, seat, and cook for you. Don't despair if you're the only customers...it just means you get this charming, Italian polyglot all to yourself. He has kept up the business for 37 years. Occasionally he has university students help him, but most nights he runs the show himself. Food is incredible. Just remember to BYOW."}
{"text":"What a terrific dinner in a very old-world setting.  In fact, it felt as if I were in a dining room in a european home!  The veal parmigiana was top notch and the side of Italian vegetables was a refreshing change of pace from the ubiquitous side of pasta and sauce.  The elderly gentleman handling the seven tables did a great job as well.  I was left wondering a few times if he was eating tables and cooking the dishes as well!  Whatever eh was doing, he pulled it off in a cheerful way.  I will definitely make this a staple of trips to Montreal!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Chez Ennio for dinner a few days ago and had a great time. Not only is Ennio's cooking fantastic, he's entertaining and creates a warm and welcoming atmosphere.The restaurant itself is definitely a throwback in terms of the decor, but this adds character in my opinion. We'll definitely be back the next time we visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Four of us visited for dinner Saturday night. The food was nearly perfect but the service was the least attentive and least knowledgeable I've encountered.  We were left unattended and unable to get our waitress's attention for nearly an hour after we finished our entrees. Then we waited another half an hour before our dessert arrived. We debated tipping less than standard but we gave 15%. For that, our waitress said \"Here you go\" as she handed us our receipt. No \"Thank you\". We had arrived at 7:30 pm with a reservation, and only able to leave at 10:30 pm. Sorry, but that isn't relaxing; it's frustrating.  So the food gets 5 starts but the service only gets 1 star, for an average of 3 stars."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had. The owner welcomes you, serves you, and cooks for you all by himself. He's very funny and laid back, and will make your stay totally worth it! Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"We were in town for Canada Day and found that Chez Ennio had one of the best Yelp reviews for Italian food.  A little hard to find as it is almost hidden below street level when viewed from across the street, this was a real treat.  GREAT food -- Ennio himself prepared it all, undoubtedly from old family recipes.  Truly deserves the 5-Star rating.  Go out of your way to check it out.  And, be sure to bring your own wine!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a little out of the way, which is perfect so it doesn't get the pass-by crowd. Since this was an \"Apportez votre vin\" (AVV - and apparently one of the few in the near downtown area), the costs were very fair and the food was excellent. The night we went, the owner, I think, was a one man show but was very amiable and amusing. If we had stumbled onto this place earlier in our stay, we would have returned."}
{"text":"Really wonderful food in an intimate setting. We were so happy to find this gem near our hotel. We were his only customers as we were there quite early. He shared a glass of our wine with us, and we felt so special as he was so friendly and discussed the meal preparations with us.  Great that you can take your own bottle of wine with no corkage fee. First time I had rabbit, it was incredible, but then the entire meal was. Very reasonably priced for authentic Italian meal."}
{"text":"The food here is exquisite!! The owner...and chef...very welcoming and friendly, and funny. I strongly recommend you try this place. It feels like you are eating at home. Everything is freshly made on the spot, and portions are very generous. A true gem of a restaurant. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant was half full on a Saturday evening. There was Ennio alone in the kitchen and 1 waitress who had her hands full with only 20 customers in the restaurant. She would only appear and disappear once in a blue moon.  We waited 2 hours for our lukewarm meal. I don't understand why a plate of pasta and a green salad could take 2 hours to arrive and be lukewarm.The food tasted good but was traditional, not italian traditional but more like 1970 traditional. But we expected that.  We didn't expect my water glass to be chipped all over the rim, the water pitcher left on our table was dirty with fingerprints all around it like it hadn't been washed that day, the tablecloth was filthy from a few days ago, and the doily table runner contained an impressive collection of hidden breadcrumbs from several days back.  When it was time to pay, and the waitress had disappeared, Ennio asked me if everything was okay. When I decided to say \"well, no\"  and politely explain why, starting with the fact that the food tasted good,  he clutched onto my Visa card and started arguing that my expectations were too high and that he was not running a 5-star restaurant, as if I didn't know that before walking through the door. I already expected the traditional food and the cheesy decor, the photos are on the internet. It can't be that difficult  to get hot pasta on a clean table.  When I finally got my Visa card back, I smiled and told Ennio not to ask for our opinion if he didn't want it. As we were walking out, Ennio swore loudly at us. It was humiliating. The whole place heard. Terrible evening!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant with family after a late night arrival in Montreal.  We were welcomed wholeheartedly into the restaurant by Ennio, and told to order anything off of the menu.  Ennio cooked our dinners on the spot, and brought them out promptly.  The pasta had been prepared fresh earlier that morning.  All of our meals were delicious.  Ennio runs the restaurant on his own now with little help, but serves delicious authentic Italian food with a huge smile on his face.  We honestly felt like we had entered the home of a very kind neighbor.  Highly recommend making this a regular stop while in the Westmount area of Montreal.  My family and I will certainly make Chez Ennio a regular stop on future trips to the city."}
{"text":"Yasssssss This is what you're looking for guys. This is it. Agree with above - do not worry if you are alone in the restaurant. You get the cutest 77-year-old Tuscan man to yourself. This is a one-man show. He is the business owner, cleaner, host, waiter, cook, and maitre d. The place is re^%#tedly cute see pics Food amazing good to last drop like the Italian uncle you don't have  And for a place downtown you get it to yourself ??  And byob  Try pasta"}
{"text":"1 old italien man and a young woman hostess...  cool kitchy interior, great food and not too expensive. Best thing about it is the atmosphere, its warm and fun and feels like a big family get together with out all the horrors of actually being with your own family.  Only thing to note is that becasue he is just one man the food can take a long time. Soonly  go if you are prepared to stay a while (which you should), don't go if you have an hour to eat before catching a film."}
{"text":"If you like to taste authentic Tuscan food right from the grandma's kitchen you must go there. Yes the service may not be fast because one person is doing everything from preparing the food to serving them, but what you will get is amazing from home made pasta to garden grown tomato salad and rabbit everything is great! Also If you are lucky you may get some recipe and useful cooking tip at the endl ;)"}
{"text":"Superbe endroit !!! Pour manger, car pour ce qui est de la déco ... Là où dans le salon de votre arrière grand mère .. Il n'y a pas de différence !! Par contre il cuisine comme si vous étiez chez vos grand parents !!cuisine antierement faite par lui !!! Et il fait ça très bien !!   Très copieux et Vraiment pas cher pour le prix !!! Son escalope milanaise est a tomber !! Elle me rappelle mon enfance a chaque fois que j'y vais !! Petite chose agréable c'est un apporté votre vin !! Plats excellent et grand mangeurs finissent difficilement leur assiette !! Aussi son café expresso est excellent ! Parlez avec lui c'est un sacré personnage !!  N'hésitez pas !"}
{"text":"Absolutely a delight! Great food and cozy atmosphere. Ennio is a fantastic cook and host. We strongly recommend it, definitely a must go for authentic italian food.  It is \"bring your own wine\"."}
{"text":"\"This is no fast food\", was one of the first things that Ennio told us as he was standing in the doorway at 6:30pm right after he opened the door. We really understood what he meant 2 hours later when he brought us the main dish. He was running the place by himself on that Wednesday night.   Going through the door, it feels like you are entering someone's dining room. And it is the charming and delightful dining room of grandparents! Just see the pictures; words can't do justice.   The food is very tasty. There is a good selection of Italian dishes. And if you want things done slightly differently, speak to Ennio and he will make suggestions. Don't feel bad if you can't finish you meal because the portions are huge and the four dishes we tried were all quite oily.   I would definitely like to go back here sometime, not for the food but for experiencing the atmosphere."}
{"text":"WHAT fun. All the positive reviews are correct already, but I'm posting this to add a couple of points they have not covered.   In a nutshell, this place is a gem of the type that can only be the product of a single personality, and only a chef-owner. And in this specific case, since Chef Ennio is getting on, it is a historical document of a particular style of hospitality and enjoyment of life that is as much a personal passion as a business.   Three major expressions of this are the decor, which clearly has not changed in 30 years (if that; see pix),\"; the sweet waitress, who relates to Ennio as both honorary granddaughter and sous-chef (and whose job was handed down to her by the prior waitress); and Ennio himself, who greets all guests, teasing, shaking hands, establishing himself and you as human beings in that specific place.  Yes he is the sole cook, but on our visit he clearly regulated the flow of guests to match his capacity.   And yes the food is really good. Mostly not five stars (those are for the overall place), though the veal with lemon and butter was.  And yes it takes hours - our mains arrived about 1 hour :40 after we sat down. It's part of the experience.  Relax into it and you will enjoy an encounter that is increasingly rare today."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for dinner on a Saturday evening, at about 8pm, without reservation: didn't know it was going to take me an hour and 45 minutes to get my dinner. Now I understand why people say this restaurant is the best to go to when you're the only one there, because there's only one chef who can make your food. If there's more than three tables sat down, you're done. Pasta was rather good, ordered the cannelloni and the chefs special pasta, but the wait definitely wasn't worth it. Ordered the smoked salmon appetizer too, which should be very simple assembly as it's just smoked salmon on a plate, but that itself took 45 minutes. Didn't get any apologies from the waitress either, even though we were leaving the restaurant at about 10:30 and the last ones there.  As others said, it really feels like your grandmothers house in there: maybe I'm young, but I thought it was a little more creepy than anything (especially with how it's underground.)  Take someone here for a date if you want to have a super long conversation with them!"}
{"text":"Ennio is a gem. He makes wonderful homemade style Italian food. Call ahead for the Osso Bucco, it is incredible. Veal Parmesan was also excellent. You will enjoy salad, main and pasta. You will be stuffed and have leftovers. A wonderful experience of you can enjoy a slower paced meal."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem this place is! Small restaurant run by the owner, Ennio, who is the nicest guy ever. The ambiance is pretty romantic, AND it's a BYOW!    It's an Italian restaurant and is really really delicious.  Ennio was very nice, and we had a great experience there. I can't remember what I had but I remember that the portion was too big and that I had to take it home. You really do have to chels out this place if you're tired of all the cookie cutter BYOWs in this city and are looking for some delicious Italian cuisine!"}
{"text":"I had the fixed price choice ($33) and chose the veal marsala.  It came wth soup, linguini in a clam sauce, salad and dessert (I had banana with ice cream and chocolate sauce.  It was excellent.)  The sauces were rich and had a strong, tasty flavor.    We met Chef Ennio as he was coming from the market with four bags of food and opening the.restaurant at 6:30PM.  He is the only cook, the kitchen is small and he had one waitress.  There are approximately twelve tables and it has an intimate, warm, old world charm to it.  A wine store is right next door by the way!"}
{"text":"Fantastic hidden gem of a find! The decor is old-world Italian and cozy. What a friendly, sweet, Italian owner. When we were there, he was the only employee in the entire restaurant and was as sweet as could be. Even with two other parties for dinner, he was attentive and refilled our wine and bread. It's BYOB, but if you forget, don't worry--there are a few shops nearby where you can buy a bottle.   Besides the charming host/cook/owner, the other best thing about the restaurant was the food. I think it was the most amazing Italian food I've ever had. We started with the eggplant parmesan and then split the gnocchi. Both dishes were out of this world. The gnocchi, which he told us he had made that morning, was a perfect texture. The tomato sauce has the perfect amount of spice. If you have some time to spare for a leisurely, delicious meal, don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Best Italian Food since eating at Cumpa Cosimo in Revello. Be prepared for a long meal- bring a great bottle of Chianti.  The food and the love of the Owner behind Ceez Ennio is legendary!   Wish more establishments put the love into their business like Ennio.  We will be back again . Going to be tough eating Italian anyplace else.   This was truly worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ennio is my BFF. I love him, I love his food, I love his jokes, I love his accent; he makes me smile and laugh so hard. He has shared so many stories with me, and at times his food has given me a glimpse of where he's been and what he's about.  My absolute favourites are the eggplant parm and cannelloni. I've also tried the escargot, gnocchi, and Chez Ennio pasta, all of which were great but didn't hold my attention for as long as the eggplant parm and cannelloni did. I would still absolutely recommend them, though!  This place definitely has some charm to it; it's cozy and feels like you're sitting in Ennio's living room while he prepares your meal and serves it to you. This is a one-man-show most nights, guys. So tolerate the slowness, go there and enjoy your evening, don't rush through it. Bring a bottle, or two or three, and enjoy the home-style meal with good company."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so very unique. The food was delicious and the owner Ennio is so personable and kind. The sauce has this special taste that I have never encountered and it made it so delicious. This place looks like you're at your grandparents house so be ready for the decor. If I'm ever back in the area this would definitely be on my list of places to visit again."}
{"text":"The food was great, the atmosphere super cozy and Ennio is awesome! Portions are big; we ordered mushrooms on toast first (delicious) and ended up taking half of our main dish home. My husband had osso bucco and loved it! It's not on the menu and not always available but ask Ennio, it's worth it. I had the fettuccine Di Ennio (mushrooms, ham, cream and cheese); it was delicious! Ennio takes care of both service and cooking and is a great host. Don't come here if you're in a hurry, Ennio takes his time and that's just the way we like it. You can get wine & soda next door. Would definitely come back here when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Now, this place has an amazing service this would be 5* without a question. Food, probably 3,5*. My pasta was a bit bland and my rabbit was overcooked because of  the long wait I was offered soup on a house! Dirty glasses 1*. I would come back though because it's BYOB"}
{"text":"Came for dinner on Saturday and were not given a table. There were many seats open but we were told we couldn't get a table because \"you won't get to eat\". Apparently they are under staffed."}
{"text":"If your are looking for a great Italian dinner and have plenty of time to enjoy the place.  Do not over order, the portions are genorus and filling.  The host, Einno, is a great person. We did not feel the time.   Cheff Einno is a one man restaurant, so have to be very patient waiting for your food.  It was one of the best dinners I had.  Chez Einno will be a place to go to, whenever I am back in Montreal."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, don't get me wrong, was great.Decor was like being in someone's grandma's place.  Service was friendly but man oh man was it slow. The waiter was the only one serving, not only that but we are 99% sure he was the only one in the kitchen cooking. We came at 7 30, left at 9 15. That's a long time. He was honestly a very sweet man, and was very nice but I think we waited too long for the food. I ordered a clam linguini which was just ok, and my friend had  a veal which was overcooked, my boyfriend had a tomato/parmesan sauce linguini which was also just ok. I appreciated the homemade cooking and work put into it though. I think the only dish I liked was the soup the most (chicken broth, egg, and spinach) But wait for the food was way too long, and the prices were a bit high for the food. Don't think I'd come back, as much I loved how nice the waiter was and the decor."}
{"text":"Great experience and food in a very intimate charming space.   Greeted by the 78-year-old owner Ennio we immediately were struck by his warmth and informality.    He immediately set to open our byob Argentinian wine and we were off and running.   House salad and vinegarette was delicious and made with care.   Very leisurely pacing and background music lent to a romantic setting.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"When reading the reviews for chez, my wife and I entered with extremely high expectations.   After 2.5 hours, we had experienced Montreal and Italian food like we've never done before.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Easily the best place we dined at during our stay.  The salad was amazing, the main dish was incredible, and the desert was divine.  This is NOT a fast food restaurant.  Plan on spending some time and getting to know the owner and enjoy his generosity and charm."}
{"text":"Worst meal I've had in a long time. Any review over two stars makes me think it's the owner's friends and family boosting his rating.   The lentil soup was marinara sauce with beans in it.   The fazzotelli pasta was absolutely disgusting. The owner said it was puréed veal in the pasta, but it looked and tasted like something you'd feed your cat.  The ravioli was basic ravioli. Not terrible, but the red sauce on it was the same sauce from the lentil soup.   The only good thing was that it's BYOB.  The owner was a one man show like in other reviews, which makes me also question the quality and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Slow as previously mentioned, so expected.  No reservations, but served just as fast as other patrons.  Food beyond par.  Veal piccata was best ever had. Tortellini fresh, al dente and plentiful.  Merci Monsieur Ennio."}
{"text":"Definately  unique place. It feels like youve been invited into their home, it's a quiet small restaurant decorated like my grand parents house. The food was a very good, the portions were average and the price was on par compared to similar restaurants. We did have to wait awhile for a our food but they gave us some salads while we waited. When I went to pay I realized why we had wait, all the food was prepared by itlian man in a tiny kitchen."}
{"text":"This was my favourite experience in Montreal. It is a quiet unassuming restaurant. We arrived at 9.30 and were the only ones in the restaurant. Ennio was our host and did not worry at all at how late it was. He made us feel special and created a family feel. The did is outstanding with fresh home made pasta and the melon and prosciutto is the best."}
{"text":"Was a little confused by the decor, but honestly, Ennio is the sweetest person you will ever meet. It really does feel like you're going home to your grandpa. After we were done eating, he brought us a plate of tortellini \"just to try\", and insisted we finish it. On top of that, this could be one of the best pastas I've ever had in my life. Would highly recommend for a long, comfortable, comfort dinner."}
{"text":"We loved this place! Very personal service, delicious food - come hungry, because the portions are VERY generous. Everything is made to order, so it's best if you aren't on a tight schedule - the owner cooks all of the food himself. I noticed that some of the reviews knock the decorations, but we loved them - it feels being at your Italian grandmother's house. Very cozy, a little eclectic, but mostly welcoming. Definitely a unique experience, and we'll make a point to come back every time we're in Montreal! :)"}
{"text":"I have been travelling to Montreal on business for 12 years and have tried countless restaurants and must say that Chez Ennio is the best of the best. Quaint decor, incredible value, incomparable taste and one of a kind service from Ennio himself. When we asked him what made his food taste so good he replied, \"Me!\"  So very true as I believe he makes the marvellous meals himself. Do yourself a favour and invest the time (our meal was three hours of glorious) and get yourself to this restaurant. Bring your own wine and if you forget, pop next door to the store and pick up a bottle. This is Montreal after all :-)"}
{"text":"We found a gem in Montreal...Chez Ennio!  We had the gnocchi and linguini with tomato sauce. Chef Ennio's sauce is delicious, he said its his mothers recipe! My son and my son in law both said the gnocchi is the best they've ever had. Chef Ennio is a character. You'll absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"Some of the most amazing Italian food I've ever had. Run but a cute old man that runs the place. This is truly a gem! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I adored my experience at Chez Ennio. Ennio is the cutest little man you'll ever meet. It shows that he genuinely cares about making your experience in his restaurant especially enjoyable. The atmosphere is charming, warm and romantic. If you're the type of person who favours high end, upscale restaurants then this is not the place for you. This is a simple, unique, traditionally decorated Italian restaurant. You really feel at home or as if you're visiting your grandparents house. I had the tortellini with Rose sauce dish and I could honestly say, it was the best I've ever had, and I've been to Italy.   Ennio makes all of his clients feel special, he's truly one of a kind. I really can't think of anything bad to say about this place, I feel so grateful to have found such a gem in a city full of similar restaurants. Definitely a new go to place."}
{"text":"Authentic, interesting place! We stumbled upon it for Christmas Eve and spent 3 lovely hours there. BYOB! So much fun. The chef owner is a dear. Our group loved the lapin!"}
{"text":"Ennio is hilarious. The service is amazing for a one man show that should realistically only seat 4 tables max. We weren't in a rush and were forwarned that the food would be out slow because the owner was the entire wait staff, cooking staff, dish washer, and grocery runner all wrapped into one affable man.  The decor makes you feel like you're in pre-war italy with a tank about to kool-aid man through the wall"}
{"text":"Absolutely charming restaurant tucked away off the street. Ennio is a fantastic host who was friendly, funny and completely endearing. The decor is both over the top and homely, and the whole experience was very relaxed and felt like a home trip.  Both food and service were fantastic. Portions were large, and all meals were thoroughly enjoyed (also the option to take home if not finished).   If you have the time, definitely go and visit for a wonderful experience in another small world."}
{"text":"I went to Chez Ennio more than a month ago and thought it was absolutely amazing (i blame the BYOW). I felt almost sinful for not eating my pasta completely. To make up for this I went again last week (NB- the two hour wait to get your food is legit), I couldn't go beyond two morsels as it was too thick. I took a doggy bag and tried having it for lunch the next day, to my disgust the pasta was loaded with oil (two week worth cooking oil)  I usually enjoy Italian food but this felt like a fast track road to clogged arteries. I would not recommend this place to anyone as it is extremely unhealthy. The only saving grace for this place would be the wonderful and sweet owner+cook.   Definitely not worth the wait and not worth the hospital bills that would follow."}
{"text":"Chez Ennio is your classic, old-school Italian restaurant. To be honest, being there really touched my heart because the decor totally reminded me of my uncle's house when I was a kid, having dinner with the family.  I went on a Thursday night to meet up with some old friends from out of town and we just couldn't get over the familiar decor. It was really quiet that night so Ennio was working completely on his own.  Ennio came out to great us, take our order, and we couldn't help but ask him some questions. Ennio is 78 years old and has been running this place for 39 years! He does everything on quiet nights and has Concordia and McGill students as servers on busy nights. He employs students to help them out and most of them are here studying from other countries. He talks about them with pride. It was so nice talking to him that we actually didn't want to say goodbye. What a great personality, I felt really at home.  The location is very central, close to St. Catherine street and the price is affordable. We ordered to eggplant parmigiana to start and I had the tortellini. Everything was very good, especially the bread and side of cooked broccoli with cheese & garlic.   We love Ennio :)"}
{"text":"This is really a charming place... Ennio is sweet-natured and we just warmed to him immediately.  He said he came from Toscan, Italy and had operated this restaurant for some 37 years.  He is alone on the quieter nights (mid-week) and on those nights, he would do everything himself (from taking your jacket at the door to serving food / drinks to clearing the table to cooking to giving you the bill etc etc...).     We came during a wintry mid-week evening and were almost alone in the restaurant. Wow, what a lovely evening it turned out to be. It was like being invited to have dinner in someone's cosy home. We ate slowly, matching the gentle pace of the place while allowing ourselves to be taken in by the ambience.   The food was excellent.  We especially enjoyed the ravioli with basil, which Ennio made himself.  I had the rabbit roll and it was great.  We will come back for the veal dishes."}
{"text":"The food is excellent but Ennio is even better.  He cooks and takes orders and still makes time to make small talk with customers.  Just be prepared, Ennio works on his own schedule and will send customers away if he is overwhelmed.  He clearly cares more about customers having a good experience than making more money and having people wait for 2 hours.  His food is excellent as well and prices are very reasonable. Simply an amazing experience, just bring a bit of patience and it will be totally worth your while!"}
{"text":"Just the food is probably 3.5* but with Ennio making all the difference, I give an overall 4*.  Enormous portions ~ do not over order!  So many times you go to a restaurant but complain that the portions are too small; well you're going to complain again but for portions being too big!  If you are not a big eater, I suggest you skip the entree and just go for he main dish. I was already full after my entree of vol au vent.   Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday so got to taste the dishes ordered by everyone. Some dishes were secondly better than others.   The entree of eggplant parmigiana was excellent! My vol au vent was just ok...you can skip it.  The rabbit was good, the chicken was juicy and the veal was also very tasty. My fettuccine a la Ennio wasn't to my liking. It was way too creamy and full of butter. I took 2 bites and had it to go. When reheated the next day, you can see all the butter at the bottom of the plate. Not a dish to order if you are in diet.  Overall decent restaurant."}
{"text":"Small byow owned and run by an older Sicilian couple. It has been a while since my last visit, but I have fond memories with friends, family and on dates.   The food is generally very good. Although on my last visit I ordered the trout and wasn't crazy about it (hence the 4 stars). I do recall enjoying the quail.   The setting is very homey, the walls are covered with all sorts of decorations and trinkets. It has a very relaxed atmosphere and the owners are simply delightful. One of the best choices of restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"TLDR: Walk into Nonna's home and have yummy authentic Italian fare including homemade pasta! Chez Ennio is also BYOB!  When you open the door to this quaint restaurant you are transported to someone's home. All the trinkets are beautiful and you know you are in for a treat. There were only three people working the evening we went. Ennio was in the kitchen with some help from two young ladies, who I believe may be his granddaughters, but that is just a presumption.  We each chose a different veal dish for our main. Each veal dish comes with a salad to start our meals. It was a simple green salad with a fun and tangy red wine vinaigrette.   When we learned that the pasta is homemade we had to get at least one pasta dish. We chose the fettucini alfredo, which they kindly split into three dishes for us. Despite the division, the portions were still very generously sized. We later saw a single serving and it was as large as our three dishes put together.  The fettucini was beautifully executed, and I mopped up the rest of the creamy alfredo sauce with the warm bread we were served prior to our meal.  I enjoyed one of the house specialities: Saltimbocca a la Romana, veal topped with prosciutto and sage. The dish delivered on the promise of its name as the flavours jumped in your mouth. My mother enjoyed the Veal Pizzaiola which was full flavoured with a rich tomato sauce and capers. My father got the winning veal in my opinion, the classic piccata. The lemony goodness was addictive. We also appreciated how most of the veals weren't breaded, I believe the waitress said only two of the six on the menu are.  To finish our meal, we were hoping to try the ice cream roll and cappuccino. Unfortunately, they were having trouble in the kitchen that evening, and they didn't have the roll that night, and the cappuccino machine was down. We went sans coffee and ordered to of the other desserts on the menu. The peche melba and the chocolate cake were a-ok, but I wouldn't highly recommend them. However, ice cream after the meal was highly appreciated.  Bring a bottle of wine and enjoy the deliciousness to come. Please note, the service time is nice and slow as they make the food to order If you are looking for someplace to eat quickly this is not the place for you. Despite the dessert, I would highly recommend this culinary experience."}
{"text":"Ein sehr netter charmanter Gastgeber, sehr familiär, leckeres Essen, grosse Portionen, alles sehr authentisch. Ein netter Abend."}
{"text":"This place was... Your grandmother's apartment - if your grandmother was starring in the next episode of Hoarding: Buried Alive. Knick knacks everywhere. E-V-E-R-Y-W-H-E-R-E. My boyfriend and I actually started to laugh when we came through the doors. I pretty much agree with what everyone else has been saying, which is to prepare to spend a couple hours there because there is one cook and one server. We had escargot, the Chez Ennio Pasta which was basically linguine alfredo with mushrooms and ham, and the veal parmesan. Everything tasted like it was made by your grandmother too. True home-cooked goodness. Our bill came to $57. Amazing. This place is BYOW which is a huge bonus too. We brought some champagne to have as an aperitif, but they didn't have champagne flutes which I thought was odd. The server said they didn't have the flutes because the place wasn't fancy. Love it. Go if you're not in a rush."}
{"text":"A great dining experience.  My son who is a foodie brought my wife and I to Ennio's.  You step off the busy Montreal city sidewalk down into a basement level room and you all of a sudden step into an old world Italian dining room.  Yes, the service is slow but who cares.  It gave us the time to talk and every hour have the fun adventure of one of us running out to feed the parking meter. Every morsel of food was excellently prepared and presented.  I could go into all the details but all you need to know is that Ennio's provides some of the best traditional Italian dining you will find. The convenience of being able to bring the wine you wanted to have was also a big plus.  A unique and very enjoyable dining experience!"}
{"text":"This is the best one man show in town. The service is a bit slow but well worth the wait.  Food was amazing. Hope to be going there for years to come."}
{"text":"Interesting that both reviews so far are from non-residents, because this place is sort of hidden, but its a treasure. Its in the basement of a building and feels exactly like my grandmother's house - lace doilies and all. Only 1 waiter - an older gentleman (possibly the owner?) was very gracious and the whole experience was pleasant. The food was classic northern Italian. Huge portions of pasta. The red clam sauce was particularly good. BYOB!!"}
{"text":"Okay, let us set the scene so you're not surprised: Ennio was here alone. That's right. One old, awesome, grandpa dude was waiter, cook, busboy, host, everything. Never again will you see a waiter with three tables and excuse them for being too busy to bring your check when you've seen this one man show perform his little miracle. And the food was. Good, solid, from-the-heart Italian. A little pricey but high quality and tons of it so you won't mind eating the leftovers."}
{"text":"I knew that it was going to be a long dinning experience from the yelp reviews. I would not have minded the 2 hour dinning experience on a Sunday night if the food was tasty, but in my opinion it was not.    The Melon and Italian dried ham appetizer was just thrown on top of some head lettuce. The melon was sweet, but the meat was really salty.  The dinner salad was just old head lettuce with a few cucumbers and sliced tomatoes. The dressing lacked any notes of garlic or spice.  Just plain oil and vinegar.   The veal and mushroom main dish was over cooked  and lacked flavor.   Sorry Ennio. You were a nice man, but the dinning experience was not very good.   I would not return to Chez Ennio."}
{"text":"Let me just say up front here that I am setting out to write Ennio the best God#$%@dam yelp review ever wrote. I can't imagine Ennio reads Yelp reviews. Maybe you can read it to him... and then explain to him in Italian what the hell Yelp is.   Ennio doesn't have time for Yelp reviews. Ennios has devoted every last moment of his life to providing you undeserving fools with the single greatest Italian dining experience available on this side of the Atlantic. Not that you deserve it. I mean there are even \"people\" that have given Ennio negative reviews here. They say \"the service is slow\", that \"the ambiance was creepy\". These people don't deserve Ennio. These people deserve to be chained up in the basement of the Olive Garden and force-fed used breadsticks until their colons explode.   You might be familiar with the \"slow food\" movement in Italy. Ennios is the slowest food. Ennio's food is served at absolute zero. Kelvin. If you have spent any time in Italy you might be familiar with Ennio's business model. The only way for it to be more italian is if Ennios grandmother was also there yelling at a football game in the dining room. North Americans might not understand what is going on here in the same way that Italians don't understand that McDonalds is \"Food\". You're not eating Italian food here, you have fallen through a wormhole to Italy.   You should not have to make a reservation at Chez Ennio. You should win a lottery to be allowed to eat there. You should happily give up the Lotto prize to be allowed to be seated. The pope should make a pilgrimage, on hand and knees to kiss Ennio's ring. Ennio is a saint. A literal saint. When he passes they should embalm him and keep him in a glass box in the dining room. His fettuccini cures cancer. The veal made PETA rewrite their policy to endorse his use of it. Just the sound of Ennio pounding veal cures migraine headaches and male impotence. After eating at Chez Ennio, the mere thought of the continued existence of an \"Old spaghetti factory\" will make you wretch in horror and curse yourself for ever have given your money to another restaurant. I will regret ever eating anywhere else again.   BYOB. Tip Generously."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night and arrived at around 6:45. Although the hours online say that the restaurant opens at 6:30, the doors were locked when we arrive. Ennio saw us waiting outside and let us in and said we can take a seat even though the restaurant wasn't officially opened. He greeted us and was really friendly. The restaurant is really unique as you don truly feel like you are in the home of Italian grandparents. He came and opened our wine himself and served us water because his waitress had not yet arrived.  While we looked over the menu, cute Italian music was playing and the waitress came and offered us bread. The bread rolls were not homemade and were served with rock solid butter (I'd avoiding filling up on this).  We ordered the eggplant parmesan, the gnocchi and the veal piccata.  We really enjoyed 2/3 dishes. The eggplant parmesan was served piping hot with an absolutely delicious sauce. The gnocchi which I assume is homemade was the best I'd ever had. It was also a huge portion so I got to take it home for a late night snack. The only disappointment was the veal. We enjoyed the salad and vegetables that it came with but found the veal to be overcooked and not a big enough portion.  Our waitress was friendly and not overwhelmed as there weren't that many customers there. We ended up leaving at around 9, which is not bad at all when one man is cooking all the food.   We found the atmosphere romantic, the music sweet and loved how it was byow. I'd recommend this restaurant for a date or for a night out with a friend but not for groups or kids.  Looking forward to our next visit!  Food 4/5 Atmosphere 5/5 Value 4/5 Service 4/5"}
{"text":"Selected this based on reviews and being close to our hotel, it was a chilly Sunday night and we were over the top happy with this place once we walked in, super charming and cozy and relaxed atmosphere. Food was amazing and you felt like you were eating at you grandparents home. We spent 2 1/2 hours there and enjoyed every bite! You can tell Ennio takes great pride in his food and restaurant and wanting you to truly enjoy every bite! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"You can't help but really want to like this place once you find out it's run by Ennio, the owner and his wife - an old Italian couple. It really feels like you're dining in someone's home. It's located in a tiny basement, dated decorations - everything looks traditional and homey, as is the food.  I noticed a few tourists dining here, could be because Hotel Du Fort is just next door.  Little dolls, figurines, fake plants, clocks, plates and numerous knick knacks are covering the walls and any available space in this restaurant. Cute and charming, but unfortunately through the years it all gathered dust and I find it just looks cluttered. I ran my finger on the side of a wall panel and it was black with dust.  We brought our own wine, we were served a jug of water and basket of bread to start. Lots of delicious butter, too bad the bread was dry.  Soup of the day was like a stew with beef, pasta and beans. Waitress described it to everyone with caution \"it has a bit of an after kick, it's spicy so watch out!\". Although it was deliciously un-spicy, nicely seasoned, very hearty. It was my favorite dish of the evening.   The house salad was pretty simple, lettuce, cucumber and tomatoes with a balsamic dressing.  I had the fazzoletti pasta with meat, spinach and tomato sauce (18$) Pretty good portion size, tasty, but not as good a sauce as the stew I had moments earlier.  My partner had the veal parmesan (22$) which is also a generous portion, it came with potatoes and broccoli on the side.  We were full so did not opt for dessert although they had a nice selection of cakes, fruit cups, banana split, ice cream etc.  The food is good although I can't consider this place \"fine dining\" like Chez Ennio describes itself on the menu - it's a traditional, home style meal with above average prices that are justifiable when you think this is how the guy and his wife make their living. It took us about 2 hours, like others have mentioned, you can't be in a rush. I was satisfied with my meal and the whole experience although there was nothing that particularly drew me in or wowed me so I'm not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an amazing dining experience, this is the place to go.   We walked in late one Sunday evening and were greeted. By the owner, who forewarned is that it was just him that night. There were two other tables of patrons in the place and we weren't in any rush, a decided to stay. Ennio is a charismatic man who has the ability to make all of his guests feel welcome.   We ordered the croûte au champignons (mushrooms sautéed in butter and garlic with cream sauce on bread) and my dining companion loved it so much that she wanted to lick the plate clean.   After much deliberation (everything on the menu looked delicious) we decided on the fettuccini a la Ennio and the gnocchi. Unfortunately the last table had used up all of his cheese and he ran out to get more for our meal!   When we finished our main course, it was almost closing time and we decided not to order desert so as not to keep our gracious host any longer than necessary, but he said it didn't matter to him if we wanted to stay. We ordered the peach Melba and he added some lychee for a twist.   In total, we were probably there for 2.5 hours, but time flies when you're enjoying yourself."}
{"text":"I hate to say it but the restaurant is so dated and the Chef/Owner is doings the cooking by himself and it takes forever.  I think it's time to just close the doors.  Needs a good cleaning and some kitchen help.  Sorry"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed that the menu I saw online did not exist in the actual restaurant. I am a vegetarian and there was one pasta for me. The chef was not willing to make any of the other pastas without meat or fish - there were four people in the place at the time... The server seemed to have been forced to work there, she was very shy, did not seem to know the menu, and very slow. The room is very kitchy, seemed more like a basement tea room. I would not have cared if I could have had a good meal but I had to settle for whatever they had that I could eat. There were only a few other diners and then a table of ladies and we could hear their entire conversation - loudly. The chef came out to chat and he was really nice, but I doubt I will return - I don't need to go out to be made to feel uncomfortable by awkward service and poor menu selection."}
{"text":"First review I have ever written but just couldn't help myself.   My husband and I found this restaurant through Yelp reviews and decided to check it out.  Ennio was a delight!  He called to confirm our reservation and was busily setting up our table when we arrived.  We ended up with the whole restaurant to ourselves (unbelievable, as this place was truly amazing!) all night. Food:  Delicious and freshly made by Ennio humming a tune in the kitchen.  Lentil soup with sausage was very hearty. Servings were huge.  Prosciutto and melon yummy.  And Ennio's Fettucine - worth the extra workout.  BTW, it's BYOW with no corkage fee. (Ennio says \"Why would I charge you when it takes 5 seconds with my wine opener on the counter?\") I hope the reason the restaurant was empty was because it was a holiday weekend; would hate to see this place close.  Ennio himself was a fascinating person (speaks five languages) with an incredible history and life story as well as being very personable and welcoming.  Thanks Ennio!  From Texas with Love."}
{"text":"Entering Ennio's is like entering a whole new world. It's such a special find. From the outside it appears a very simple place, but the decor inside is both cheesy and incredibly charming. It feels incredibly old world. The lighting is dim and the ambiance is so romantic.   The night we went, the chef was the only person running the restaurant. He was charming, funny, and ridiculously kind. It felt more like having dinner at a friend's house than a restaurant. I was very impressed by him cooking and serving for everyone. The meal was comfortably leisurely.   The food itself was incredible, and the portions were huge! I got the gnocchi and I easily had enough for two meals. The sauce was delicious and so flavorful, and the dumplings were prepared and cooked perfectly. I was so satisfied! Everyone in my party enjoyed their food immensely.   I had the most charming meal at Chez Ennio and so highly recommend that anyone in the area checks it out. Just keep in mind that it's BYOW!"}
