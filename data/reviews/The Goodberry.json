{"text":"Great healthy place to grab a smoothie!  I strongly recommend the coconut bar ... You won't go wrong for sure!  Faisal K approves."}
{"text":"Went for a walk around the neighbourhood and happened on this delightful place. As soon as we walked in we were warmly greeted by friendly staff and offered free samples of tea and frozen yoghurt. 

The inside is nicely decorated and overall the ambiance created is relaxing.

The frozen yoghurt on offer was delicious and they had flavours ranging from vanilla to caramel apple. There are various toppings on offer too including gummies and some rather interesting \"bobas\".

The tea and coffee here is excellent and there is a great selection. 

The woman who served us was friendly, talkative and liked to joke around. 

I would definitely come back here at the next opportunity."}
{"text":"So cute. Great flavors, lovely staff. A really nice space to sit and work or relax with friends. They also have take away options and good add ons for smoothies (protein - vegan and whey, chia seeds etc. )"}
