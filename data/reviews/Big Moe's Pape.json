{"text":"I've been to Big Moe's a few times.  Quite honestly it's grown on me. There something to be said when your burger has that nice crispy edge without a detriment to the flavour. The fries seem to be off and on good, but overall they could benefit from learning from other places that do fresh cut fries.

I've had most of their burgers (Juice Lucy, Triple B and Big Stack). All those burgers really have a messiness to them, in a good way. The burgers really have a fun sloppiness to them. They love to load on the sauce!

The cons are few but should be noted. You'll have to wait a bit for your burger. Normally I don't mind but the pace noticeably slow. The place is usually not busy, most likely because they are right next to a McDonalds. Which is a shame because it's a great burger.

They're one of the better burger joints on the east end. Fry game needs some work.

ALSO: They have a $2.50 Tuesday deal. But time to try their burger for the first time."}
{"text":"Burgers literally fried to a crisp--nearly burnt.  Can't taste the meat when it's so overcooked.  Too much mayo, not enough tomato and lettuce and onion.  Poutine was gloppy and soggy, with canned gravy.  I'm a burger lover, but I will never go back to Big Moe's."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers, average fries. I would suggest *not* getting one of the larger burgers - it'll turn into one of those \"eat it before it falls apart\" situations."}
{"text":"came here on a thursday night.   you can smell this place from a far.  

prepare to have your clothes smell like grease... the ventilation is pretty poor which makes the whole place smell like greasy oil.  

that being said, i think i waited about 25 minutes for my combo.  There was only one person working.  Taking orders and cooking with a short line up.  

the food was not bad .. the poutine i received is a great size and tasted good with ketchup.  although it would have been better with more cheese.

i would not recommend the juicy lucy as it takes long to make and a cheese burger tastes better in my opinion.  (also the juicy lucy i got was a bit overcooked and definitely not juicy.)

i give big moes 3 stars.. their only redemption is that everything taste like it should.. i expected greasy food and greasy food i got. Expectations were met."}
