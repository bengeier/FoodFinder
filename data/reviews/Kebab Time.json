{"text":"I tried it out the other day just as a \"eh, why the hell not?\" kind of experience.  You get what you pay for here. The price of their entrees are just about 5-10 dollars cheaper than neighbouring restaurants who offer similar meals. But that goes without saying that just like the price, the quality of the food goes down too.  I ordered takeout with my family on Good Friday. So I can review more than one thing here since I tried a little bit of multiple things.  Chicken Shish - actually pretty good, but very few pieces. The plate is mostly dominated by their white rice, which has a very weird, watery taste to them.  Chicken Shawarma (called Donne or something like that) - dry, tasteless, feels like I was eating paper. They give a lot of it and very little rice in comparison to the Chicken Shish, which sort of sucks since the rice tasted better in this case.  Hummus - I've tasted better hummus from Summer Fresh brands, and that brand SUCKS. Seriously, the hummus was so dull and tasteless.  Pita bread - Eh, it's okay. I mean, it's pita. Thankfully you can't mess that one up too badly.  Side salad (comes with meals) - very small portion. Bring it home and add your own dressing, because the one they give you is pretty much some super-diluted form of vinegar, water, and ranch. The dressing looked very unpleasing, in more ways than one.  Tzatziki sauce (comes with Chicken Shish) - look, I get it. This isn't a Greek restaurant. But don't give me white, opaque water and call that \"tzatziki.\" Ugh.  Hot sauce (comes with Chicken Shish) - actually okay. It's just tomato sauce that's bit more spicier than your mild store-bought Ragu sauce.  We ordered takeout, so I can't speak much for the interior, other than it looking pretty nice for the 10 minutes I was there. This place used to be a Country Style; sad to see it go, but the interior of Kebab Time is much nicer than what my memory serves me of Country Style.  Despite the amount of effort I poured in to this review, I say you shouldn't be bothering to come here. Sure, it's cheaper than the neighbouring restaurants (primarily Me Va Me, which is right across the street and has pretty much the same menu), but the quality of the food is just disappointing. I feel like this restaurant is going to attract a lot of customers for the first year or so of it being here, but if they won't amp up their culinary game, it's going to suffer."}
{"text":"Very good doner/shawarma. Service a little spotty need to ask 2-3 times for things like hot sauce/water. Other than that best turkish food ive had in toronto so far although I haven't been to too many. Would definitely recommend if in the area."}
{"text":"What a great place!!! Customer service 100% Real Turkish food YES Good prices YES The best tea and dessert, you do not need to go back to Turkey!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant. We had take out. Order was prepared quickly. We had a variety of dishes. The chicken doner and beef kofte were great. The chicken kebab was dry. The pide was excellent. They messed up the order somewhat but I should have double checked it before leaving. Overall pretty good."}
{"text":"Great addition to the area. Nice play on the name from Coffee Time to Kebab Time. Highly recommend their shawarma, be warned though. It can feed a little family in Africa"}
{"text":"Simply the best halal restaurant for me so far in town . Top quality food and  good generous portion. Price is atmost reasonable or bit low for its quality but I think the price wont stay low near future as its very new at this point. Location kinda hiding behind a gas-station and you may miss it if you drive by fast . Interior is good clean but I think this restaurant should change the location and improve its ambience a bit."}
{"text":"Food is just awful, tastes bad and nothing close to actual Turkish food, nade us sick. music is just terrible. Our first time going there and will never go back again ."}
{"text":"My family of 5 just ate at kebab Time. Food was great. Between us we had the beef doner, chicken doner and chicken kebab. Along with cigar rolls. Everything was delicious and not over salted. My only suggestion is to have a larger salad! We loved it!"}
{"text":"I work in the area and there are a few choices for kebabs and shawarma.  Generally I usually have to get double meat as places never come correct.  This place does it right with a proper meat ratio lol...doner has good flavor and is juicy.  You definitely get value for your money here.  Also bread is awesome. Fresh and homemade taste.  Reminds me of my grandma's bread.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We had a Adana Kebab and Lamb Shih Kebab. I really liked the Adana and Shish kebab was ok. The only thing I didn't like was rice that I think is in the way Turkish people cook it. For sure it worth trying and I'll be back for other meals too."}
{"text":"Tried this place after reading the reviews here. Not easy to find good kebab taste on this part of the world, so definitely give it a try to this place. I had a kebab plate with rice and salad and \"Ayran\" (yogurt based drink). I also like their traditional complimentary black tea service after meal. As good as it gets!.."}
{"text":"Walk in, you choose between dine in or takeout. Sort of like Paramount. This place was great! They even will bring you COMPLIMENTARY fresh baked pide bread! Wow. Located in a gas station area. However the food was A1! I ordered the chicken shawarma. Meat was flavourful. More meat than veggies. Chicken was well marinated, seasoned, and cooked. Ask them to bring you hot sauce and garlic sauce to your table! Be careful with the hot sauce, it splattered all over my white dress shirt. Had to get Tide 2 Go at the Shoppers next door. Chicken shawarma plate was the perfect portion. Rare that a places actually gives you MORE chicken than rice... The grilled tomatoes on the side were a great addition. Prices are very reasonable for the service and quality of the food. Definitely will recommend this spot to anyone on the hunt for good shawarma."}
{"text":"The Best Turkish Resturant in Toronto. Great People and Amazing Food. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the area :)   The country style that used to be here (local 24 hour study spots woo!) was a bit outdated, however they've done a beautiful job with the interior of the place, as its now very nicely lit, theres tv, radio, warm (-15 out today) and its in good shape now. Good use of the space!  Price range: full meals are about $12  Ingredients are fresh, meat well seasoned, was offered tea and service is kind.   I would come back, good for a casual lunch/dinner date"}
{"text":"A great addition to the neighborhood. I love Turkish food and the kebabs are great. Freshly grilled in front of you. Hospitality is typical Turkish, warm and always welcoming. Their portions are very good. HOWEVER, one critique, their salad portions should be bigger, much bigger and there should be option to just get the kebabs without the rice/fries."}
{"text":"Today, after a long while I decided to tryout this place. I ordered Iskandar kebab which in essence is Doner Kebab with tomato sauce and I must say it wasn't anything to write home about. They have a wide variety of dishes to choose from. For a fast food/casual restaurant, I find it a bit pricey. I'm willing to go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Kebab Time is a Turkish owned Mediterranean restaurant located on the Southwest corner of Bathurst St and Steeles Ave West.   I ordered the Kebab Time special ($13.99 plus tax) which consisted of 1 stick of chicken shish and 1 stick of adana kebab served with rice, hummus, a salad and a basket of complimentary pita bread. The chicken shish was juicy and tender, nicely seasoned and had a nice char on the outside. The adana kebab which is essentially hand chopped lamb, flavoured with red bell peppers was near perfect, right amount of seasoning, juicy and tender and also had a nice char on it. The salad, rice and basket of pita bread that accompanied the meal were pretty standard. The kebabs were really really good, I'm not sure if they serve the best kebabs in the city but it's definitely right up there.  The place was very clean, the service was friendly and there were ample amount of tables if you wanted to dine in. The kebabs were fantastic, the portions were a reasonable size and the prices were really reasonable and competitive."}
{"text":"Their food is very delicious, I tried their Iskander and Baba Ganoush and they were amazing. The service was 10/10, the lady who was serving us was really nice and everything was prefect. They bring you salad and bread before your food comes, and you can ask for tea afterward since it's free!"}
{"text":"One word: Bland! everything was so bland... there was no flavour what's so ever. Definitely not going back. Service were super nice though."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I've had high expectations for this place.   Having tried 3 different dishes, I can honestly say I'm disappointed.   The lamb was overly spicy, almost in an attempt to mask its taste (anyone saying it's Turkish cuisine - it isn't - spice usage in Turkey is proper, resulting in wonderful dishes), the chicken shish kebab was tasteless and the doner kebab was equally tasteless, if not for the salt in it.   The so called hummus was quite strange, and the rice was, well, rice.   The only saving grace was their hot sauce, but I will take my business elsewhere.   Not a repeat."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the food. the meat was hot, soft, and juicy. The interior is nice with exception of the takeout menu board. Beware of wet floors as the tiles get really slippery.   Coban Kaverma $11.99 This came with a salad, a basket of bread, the Lamb entree itself with rice (although it did not mention it comes with it). The Lamb itself was soft and juicy and not as gamy as I thought it would be. It made me think of eating beef. Overall though the rice and the entree were on the savoury side. It may be better to eat the salad alongside the entrees rather than before.  *****UPDATE***** The menu has changed since this review. Prices has also increased $1 or so per meal"}
{"text":"When I visited Germany last year I fell in love with their hotdog equivalent - doner. I've been searching for a while and this is the first place that's actually good. I come here regularly since it's close to where I work. The meat is really fresh and well seasoned, and the portion is HUGE ?something to keep in mind when you order)  I have recommended this to friends and they agree that this is a meat lover's paradise!"}
{"text":"First time in a Turkish restaurant that we attended with our Turkish hosts.  We really enjoyed the appetizers and desserts but we felt that the main courses a little on the bland side. The rice could use a bit of colour and vegetables to reduce the blandness. The meat were nicely cooked.  Good value for the money."}
{"text":"Great place. Great food. Portion size is great. Overall fantastic experience. For 2 people we ordered the appetizer platter and the chef selection. Plenty of food. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Amazing. I've had several different items on the menu and so far none have been anything less than great.  All the kebabs are great, especially the Adnan. The doner are perfect, never over or undercooked and in large portions, be it as a plate or a sandwich. The pide was great too!"}
{"text":"Ordered the beef shawarma plate. Was brought bread and some delicious cucumber/yogurt sauce as an accompaniment. Service was friendly, lots of smiles and they answered a lot of questions. The menu is huge.   The Shawarma was shaved thinly which was actually quite nice. The texture was fantastic and the flavours were very middle eastern. The rice was also very delicious as was the hearty salad served in its own bowl.   I was a little reluctant as it's located in a gas station, but like some other gems in Toronto tucked away in a gas station, you'll never know if you don't try.   If you're in the mood for some awesome quality tasting middle eastern food, pop into this place and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very nice \"casual\" format place for good Turkish food.  Excellent kebabs, good sized portions with salad included and wonderful baba ghanouj.  Try the pidi (Turkish pizza-like dishes) too.  Friendly and polite service.   I did find the chicken shawarma to be a bit dry.  Don't be put off by the location next to a gas station - it is not relevant."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 (foot long) sandwiches at $6.50 each:  Chicken adana, Kofte, Lamb shish.  Freshly made.  Very meaty. Better alternative to burgers and Subway sandwiches."}
{"text":"My rice and chicken were both dry when I came here. Expensive for food that didn't have much taste. There are definitely better kebab places to go to than this one. However, the staff is very friendly and the place is clean. That's the only positive I have for this place sadly."}
{"text":"This is a great Turkish fast food restaurant. Stopped by here during our visit to Canada. The place is nice and clean. It's a family run restaurant by Turkish people. Everything we tried from appetizers to kebabs were fresh and tasty. I highly recommend this place anyone looking for delicious food."}
{"text":"Just found this Turkish kebab restaurant, and have to say its really clean and nice inside.  I got a beef doner which was literally the size of a newborn, i ate it for 3 different meals.  The beef kebab is really good, they cook over charcoal so its got that bbq taste.  The only thing that was not great were the fries, they were mushy because if the way the container is designed and the lettuce in the salad was turning red (stale)."}
{"text":"I remember a time when this place used to be a Country Style for many years. After a really long time, this restaurant opened up! We got here on a weekday evening and waited to be seated, the older lady at the front stared at us blankly when we asked to be seated. She definitely was not very welcoming. The younger lady who served us was on the other hand very kind and welcoming!  I got the Kebab Time Special (Chicken Shish and Adana Kebab with rice). The food was nice and hot. The chicken shish looked very large. The chicken pieces looked like it brined in something which made the pieces seem swelled/plumped. I'm not too fond of this, as the plumpiness distracted me quite a bit. The pieces were very tender and juicy though. It was a very filling meal and pretty reasonably priced as I got a salad and some bread to go with it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and I've had good experiences all around.  It sure beats the old run down donut joint that use to be here.  I've had their schwarma and kabab time special which comes with a assortment of meats and rice and salad and bread.  For the portion you get and the variety, the price is very reasonable.  I've been asked if this place compares to Me Va Me which is across the street.  They're very different in taste and both offer their unique flavours to traditional grilled food from their regions.   I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Went here the other night with my BF and we can't wait to go again... we ordered the mixed meat plate for 20.99, wowww so much meat!  We also ordered the falafel , bread and babaganoush (eggplant dip)  The falafel was a little small compared to what I usually order @ other restaurants. The meat was all grilled to perfection and the bread and Babaganouch was fantastic, YUMMY.  love the atmosphere and energy in this restaurant, friendly staff, clean and can't wait to return xoxo  We got a complimentary salad , mmmm the dressing was so yummy."}
{"text":"I tried the chef special,  The platter is really big and it feeds two people easily. The restaurant uses frozen meat ,I guess, yet, food taste good. I liked how tinder was the meat in general. I did not like the sides though, it was too small.  Rice was oily and the amount was little, fries were not too good, I think they could use a different brand than the one they are using now.  The grilled veggies were not up to my expectations, it was only one slice of green pepper and one quarter of a tomato, last thing was the chopped onions which was just ok. In general food was good but I think it will be better if they focus more on side dishes."}
{"text":"We went into the restaurant for the first time and weren't sure if we should take a seat or order first then sit.  After standing there for a while we were asked if dining in or taking out.  After telling the cashier that we were eating in we were told to take a seat where they brought us menus.  We ordered chef mix plate and falafel plate.  The food came pretty quickly and started off with some bread and salad.  Nothing too special about either.  The chef mix had a good variety of meat and was enough to share between the two of us.  Thankfully the waitress informed us of the portion size when we ordered otherwise we wouldn't have been able to finish everything.  The doner was a bit dry and the lamb chop was bland but the shish taouk was flavorful and very juicy.  The kofta was also delicious!  The rice was aromatic and had a good texture.  The falafels were small but flavorful.  Halfway through the meal we realized we weren't provided any water or asked if we wanted any beverage and had to ask for water.  I would come back again but I'd order the shish taouk, kofta or try something new altogether."}
{"text":"A group of us went to Kebap Time tonight because the wait at nearby East Side Mario's was 45 minutes. We were really happy because they could accomodate the 6.5 of us immediately  and everything was great; the babaganoush was wonderfully smokey, the portions of iskender were just right, the kazan dibi was not too sweet, and the kunefe was delicious! The service was friendly and quick. The place has adequate parking in the plaza lot, large washrooms, and a second entrance from the rear. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and had the chicken Donar wrap. For $10 it's massive and I for sure could not finish eating it. Not only was I happy with the size of it but the filling was satisfying as well.  The chicken was plenty but a bit too salty for my liking hence the 3 stars. You get a choice of veggies inside which include onions, cucumbers, lettuce, pink cabbage, tomatoes etc. You also get a choice of hot sauce and garlic sauce. The best part is the actual wrap itself. It's thin, well cooked, big and soft. Hence easy to chew and swallow.  The service is also great as they will be quick to take your order and serve you with a big smile.  I will for sure come back to try out with something different on the menu and hope that it's less salty!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant twice recently and enjoyed it so much. The restaurant is big and clean and they got very comfortable seating. The price is also very reasonable compare to its competitor across the street which I am not a fan.   I ordered chicken kabob, chicken doner and the lentil soup. The soup tasted great. It was thick enough for my liking and not too salty.  The chicken doner sold out by 9pm the first time we got there. So if you want to get lamb or chicken doner, go earlier.   The chicken kabob and chicken doner both were so tender and they came with rice and grilled veggies. Their portion was so big, and I saw many people couldn't finish their dish. I recommend to share if you are not a  big eater.   They also served with salad and 4 big pieces of oven baked bread which was great if you are hungry!   And the best part.. they serve you turkish tea for FREE!!  I like the tea a lot and if you go to other turkish restaurant or turkish cafe, you have to pay at least 3 bucks for that."}
