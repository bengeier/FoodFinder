{"text":"Absolute worst service, the staff were extremely rude. Unfortunate because I regularly order take out from this place but won't be returning after the treatment I received on my last visit."}
{"text":"This restaurant surprises me each time.  For dinner, they have this special chicken soup with chinese herbs and goji berries.  So delicious and so full of healing juices from the chicken and the chinese herbs.  I always feel so energized after drinking this soup.

The next best item they've perfected and is a special for this restaurant is this boneless Basa Fillet Fish, steamed on a bed of bean thread vermicelli.  It was steamed very simply but tastes so good!  

These 2 items are on the special menu written in Chinese.

Very well done, Pavilion!"}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly great!

I say \"surprisingly\" because it is attached to a an old, run-down Husky gas station. 

Not only that, this out-dated gas station / Chinese restaurant is nestled in the middle of the Northern 'burbs. Strange!

But the food is great.
Not great in an elegant, \"Michelin star\" kinda way, but EVERY dish I tasted was completely satisfying.

The Peking Duck was good, the Salt and Pepper Seafood was tender and crispy, the Tofu Soup was full of ducky/gingery flavour, and the Egg Foo Yung was excellent.

I only hope to return sometime to try some of the more exotic offerings: Jelly Fish with Sour Cabbage, Dried Abalone with Special Sauce, Shark Fin with Yunnam Ham, Crispy Young Pigeon , Steamed Chicken with Fungus or the \"Precious Jewels in Snow Mountain.\""}
