{"text":"I fear Cosmos Cafe is in decline.  Apparently, others do too, because we were the first people seated in the large dining room at 6:10 pm, on an evening when uptown Charlotte was bustling with activity.  They were out of two items we ordered: given that we seemed to be the first dinner customers, perhaps they are giving up and not even stocking themselves to sell what is on their menu.  We ordered three small plates.  The falafel was bland, the spinach-artichoke dip ordinary.  It was a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Ate at cosmos on a Thursday bogo on tapas ordered chicken quesadilla n needed more sour cream n was charged 50 cent! Ridiculous I will never patronize again. Also the food is just ok not the greatest they should b glad u stop in with all the other choices."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and friendly and the martini selection is wonderful! I will soooo be going back!!"}
{"text":"I LOVED it! My food was great they also had a great deal 5-7pm buy one get one free appetizer the sushi was delicious! I got the steak It was cooked just the way I asked! The crab cakes were great too like I said loved this place and my waiter was awesome, a really great experience I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Met some friends for dinner/happy hour. Bogo tapas before 7pm was a draw. Ordered the Crostini and Crab con Queso...both were excellent. The burgers were great as well. This place has a cool, open atmosphere, however we were among the only ones in the restaurant at ~6pm on a Tuesday. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. Great place to meet up with friends...not too loud, not to crowded."}
{"text":"Ok, I walked in at 7:30pm and had to wonder whether they were open.  No hostess! So I walked in and stood at the bar for nearly a minute before I skated if they were open.  Finally some service!!!  Let me say that the drinks are fantastic!  The food not so much.  The rating is only due to the drinks."}
{"text":"I definitely love this place! The food is consistently good (especially the soups) and the service is typically good. 

My only not awesome remark would be in communications: You guys have great specials (Especially $5 martini night on Wednesdays), but you need to get the word out! Use Facebook, twitter, email, whatever....but get the word out!

UPDATE:
OK, this place has definitely gone downhill. It used to be very \"mature people (30's, 40's, 50's)\" friendly, and that is certainly not the case anymore. It has become just another nightclub that caters to the 20-somethings. I am not sure that I would call it ghetto (like a previous poster) at this point, but that is not too far off."}
{"text":"Cosmos was recommended to me by a co-worker, so when it was my turn to visit Charlotte for a week I made my way there.  I'm happy I did!

The place is modern yet unpretentious and the wait staff is friendly.  On Friday nights all wine glasses are $4 - what a deal - so I had two Reislings.  I started with a bowl of the tomato and red pepper bisque which was really delicious but very small for a \"bowl.\"  I would have considered it a cup.  For my main course I ordered the Curried Mussels - really, really good!  I was impressed with the amount - there were a lot of empty shells by the time I was done!  The only issue I had with the entree is that after a couple minutes I realized I didn't get the side of rice that was supposed to come with the dish, but when I alerted the waitress of it she was very apologetic and came back right away with it.  It was great to soak up the extra sauce with :-p

I heard there was salsa dancing on certain nights but I'm not sure when (not dinner time on a Friday night obviously).  Good food, good service.  I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Went alone for Sunday brunch, arrived as they opened. Friendly staff, the brunch menu, as above, was pretty standard and not abundant for $12.00. The  juice and coffee were  $2.00 each extra and when the bill came for $17.32, I handed the server a twenty and received $2.00 in change. When questioned about the change discrepancy , I was told Cosmos doesn't have change. I've NEVER been told that! When I requested the proper change, I was given another dollar and told to keep the change. Was that standard procedure? I won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"Dropped into Cosmos last night for dinner before the Michael Buble concert.  It was a nightmare.  First and foremost, they were serving a limited, special event menu.  Not a huge deal except the concept of a limited menu is to reduce the variety of entrees being prepped so you can get meals out of the kitchen faster when the place is packed.  Four diners at my table and all three entrees and my salad (more on that shortly) arrived at different times with the last one arriving 10 minutes after the first.  And brought to the table without apology.  

So why did I order a salad?  Becuase I wanted an entree with chicken as the protein and there was not a single chicken entree on the limited menu (I am not counting the chicken and shrimp jambalaya).  I also didn't appreciate that they served olives with the pits in a salad...a recipe for cracked or chipped dental work.  

Lastly, our waiter forgot our drinks and bread after several requests  and then messed up our bills (yes, we split checks...shame on us).  If you are going to go through the trouble of doing a special event menu to accomodate a crowd then round out the preparations by staffing appropriately (in the kitchen and the dining room)."}
{"text":"My husband and I headed over early on a Tuesday night.  To our surprise it is buy one get one tapas until 7 so upon realizing our luck we opted for 4 items to test the place out.  We were glad we did.

1)  Chicken satay: chicken was tender and the seasonings were minimal but the peanut sauce looked like it was scooped out of a jar, was thicker than peanut butter with a sticky texture.
2) Lucky 7 Roll: The menu says that it is homemade, but if it is I think it has since been reheated.  It had an interesting mix of flavors but the outside tasted more like a thin corn taco.
3) Crostini (Filet Mingon): 3 small, flavor and lifeless filets over jam on a white bread crostini.
4) Souvlaki (beef skish-kabobs): Again, light on flavor, over cooked.

I don't recommend this place, at least for tapas and I won't go back for a full dinner but the atmosphere was laid back, the service was very good and if you work in the area it seems like a good spot to stop in for a drink.  That said, living in 4th ward there are so many other choices on my walk between here and there, I probably won't make it intentional to go back."}
{"text":"I love the weekend brunch buffet they have.  It's around $12 for the buffet and the menu includes an ample amount of breakfast items as well as lunch items, salads and desserts.  The menu changes weekly so you feel that you're traveling the world!  The staff is very friendly and helpful and of course the atmosphere is top notch!"}
{"text":"Probably better known as a nightlife hot spot, Cosmo's is actually a pretty good place to go have lunch in uptown. The menu is very eclectic, ranging from sushi to Italian to Greek and American. The variety is good if you have lunch guests that are somewhat picky.

The lunch atmosphere is business casual, and business is steady but not busy. I've never had to wait for a table during lunch, and the service has always been good."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here on 3/7/15 - no hostess, 3/4 empty at 6:00 pm, and a 92 sanitation grade should have been enough of a warning. Finally a waitress came over & rudely said that they had a bunch of reservations for later & refused to seat us. Went across the street to Fuel Pizza & have YET to see anyone else go in."}
{"text":"After work hot spot! Good food, great staff. Best wood fired pizza ever!  Fresh mozzarella was a plus! Try the flat iron steak. Cooked to perfection. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, and the hostess was quick seating me on a busy weekday evening.  Decent, not expansive, beer selection.  Gyro was light on meat and heavy on sauce (with pickles?  maybe it's a NC thing?).  Overall the food was decent, but not outstanding.  With a lot of overpriced steakhouses in the area Cosmo's is good value.  Friendly employees and atmosphere.  If the food was a little better I'd bump it to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great place to salsa dance on a Saturday night!!  A brief lesson is given by some great professionals-check it out!!"}
{"text":"Love their Tapa's bogo special (chix skewers, yum) and enjoy eating outside on their patio is great!  Service is good and staff is personable."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Went for lunch with a group.  No one really bragged about their meal, especially me.  I told the waiter what I was debating between and he suggested the brisket saying it is good and \"very filling\".  I ordered the brisket.  It came out about 5 minutes after the rest of my table was served and the piece I was served was well over half pure fat.  Due to the fact that half was inedible to me I was hungry again within 3 hours.  If I am ever in Charlotte again I will find another place to eat."}
{"text":"Recently had lunch at Cosmos Cafe in uptown. I ordered the Steak Frites and wasn't asked how I'd like the steak cooked. It came prepared okay, but the meat was exceptionally gristly.

Food and service alone would be a perfectly average 3-stars. However, we were seated next to some piece of wall art at a two-top. A large flying type of bug (flying ant, maybe?) made it's way onto our table twice, from underneath the wall art. I flicked it to the floor, and about two minutes later, another one emerged from behind the art, hovering next to our table. I could imagine the first one was a wayward insect that had flown in the restaurant, but when I saw a second one I began to suspect that there might be an infestation in the restaurant. I won't be dining at this Cosmos location again."}
{"text":"I would NOT recommend this restaurant.  Uninteresting menu, overpriced tapas, and the atmosphere was strange.  It was a weekend night and there were few people in the restaurant.  The large size of the restaurant made the lack of people very noticeable.  The server was a very nice younger man and he did a great job, in spite of the mediocre food and weird atmosphere."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm visiting Charlotte for business from San Francisco

We decided to walk a couple block radius from our hotel to find dinner. The signage was appealing so we went in.

Good food and fairly good service. But salsa lessons started and we pretty much were bumped from our seats before completely done with dinner. Not a problem really, but why let us sit there if the space is going to be needed at some point. We weren't taking that long.

I'd seek the place out again on the next trip to town."}
{"text":"I went here with a social group for drinks/meal on a Thursday evening. We had the upstairs reserved just for us. The atmosphere was comfortable. The downstairs [outside of our group] was dead. The physical layout of this place is impressive. On the outside, it looks like a corner business. But its really a full restaurant with an upstairs area. 

Anyways back to the actual experience. They served food upstairs for our group, which was cool, but you had to put your credit card down as a tab. [Not an issue]. The bar selection is ok. The food was ok. 

The issue I have with this place is that when you go to pay out, they give you a post swiped transaction. This is the receipt that shows the total, card transaction details, tip, and total. They did not give a receipt detailing the full itemized service. After requesting the receipt and giving a quick look at it I paid, and put down a tip. 

After looking at the receipt later, it turns out that there was a gratuity charge already added to the receipt. I find this to be very deceptive and FRAUDULENT. Adding grautity to a bill doesn't bother me. It bothers me when 1. it was never stated that would be there, 2. when you don't have sitdown service with a waiter [the social group I was with was more of freeflowing in the bar area] 

To add insult to injury, they try to play the club vibe outside. They put up velvet ropes, and use a door man. There was no line, and secondly, giving an impression of an \"exclusive club\" is a joke when there is only a handful of people at the bar downstairs. 

Vibe: Dead
Food: Decent
Drinks: Typical selection
Drink price: $5 for a beer. [Mid range for downtown]

Would I go here again? No. Absolutely not.

I've been to the ballantyne location twice, and I can't say that's a bad place."}
{"text":"The food was good but not exceptional.  Sushi was not on the main menu but after I got my food found it was on a separate flier no one gave me.  Beer selection weak.  Might be cooler on a busier night, but I found it passable."}
{"text":"This is a top Latin club in Charlotte. 
Walking around at night, I happened to bump into this place with great sound music and cool vibe. Not a luxurious club at all but it is fun and the dance floor size is decent.
Once I saw a small waiting line outside with 4 gorgeous latin women about to walk into Cosmos, I knew I had found a spot to kick it for the rest of the night.
If you like listening and dancing salsa, raggeton or dig the latin atmosphere, check Cosmos at night.
Came in on Saturday night and the place was crowded. It's a bit of a battle trying to get a drink at the bar because of how crowded it gets but you won't mind with all the latin cuties in the house.

There is a 10$ admission for guys and I do believe women pay to get in as well. You can find tables to sit but arrive before 11pm to get one because it appears is -first come first serve- basis in here. The one thing that always gets me, it's how early clubs closed in the south. Maybe living in Vegas has messed me up but just not used to leaving clubs when I'm about to close the deal hehe.
Other than that, I enjoyed my night at this joint talking and hanging around Latinas. Que hermosas son ustedes! 
I'll definetely check it out again next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Go sit at the Bar.  The drinks are great and the SUSHI is very good.  The women in there are smokin hot."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Cosmos in Ballantyne last Thursday night for Prime Rib Night.
Came in with couple of friends. Food was excellent and service was good. Hostess open the door for us on our way in and out. I also find out they doing Brunch on Sunday. They have DJ every night from Tuesday- Saturday. I defiantly will be back at Cosmos and I really want to check out late night, seen like a good place for party."}
{"text":"My group of 12 came here for brunch after church. I enjoyed the breakfast bar and had a three star all loaded up in my mind.

There was a nice assortment of breakfast foods and desserts, not to mention deviled eggs. I love them, especially a finger food out of my own fridge for breakfast.

I wish the catsup was in the form of a bottle for me to douse my eggs with, and that's my only complaint.

Good service and Sunday atmosphere. I just maybe will not visit the evening scene here as is mentioned in the other reviews."}
{"text":"Cosmos is a great place for cheap drinks ($7-8 for a martini and $4 margaritas is a great deal) and good Latin music on Thursdays. Place gets pretty packed and the crowd is very diverse (mid 20s-early 40s). I would recommend heading going to the upstairs bar for much faster service."}
{"text":"We went there again and again.  

Tonight, we went there to dance again.  After a drink, when I asked for a glass of water in a plastic cup to go, the lady bar tender said, a glass of water is $1.-  I said,\"it was fine, please put in a plastic cup.  we are leaving.  She said they did not have plastic cup.  I was in a hurry and could not wait to bargain, we left."}
{"text":"From the first moment I entered Cosmos Cafe, I loved the modern feel of it.  It feels trendy, but isn't pretentious like some Uptown restaurants.  It's a great place to casually go before or after an Uptown show or event, especially if you can get there between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m. during the week because their tapas/appetizers are half-price!  Woo hoo!   And if we're lucky enough to go on a Wednesday evening, we can combine the half-price apps with half-price martinis.  You can really fill up on some gourmet food and classy, flavorful martinis...for cheap!   It does tend to get pretty crowded, though, on Wednesdays, so allow yourself enough time to be seated and get served all within that timeframe.  

Their regular menu is excellent, too.  They have gourmet American items, as well as a full sushi menu.  Their sushi is excellent and that's usually what I get if we're not there during happy hour.  The sushi can't beat places like Ru-San's or Nikko, but it's still pretty darn good...and very reasonably priced!  

My only disappointment with Cosmos Cafe would be that we went there once for my birthday (because that's where I wanted to go).  One of my friends made a reservation in advance and we were seated in a room by ourselves off to the side (their party room, I'm assuming).  Being in there  lost the atmosphere of Cosmos, but that wasn't all that went wrong.  We were handed limited menus.  There was some kind of event or show going on that night in Uptown (when isn't there anymore?) and Cosmos was providing a limited menu with only a few simple items (not even their gourmet options) so they could get people in and out quicker.  It was neither the Cosmos experience I was used to nor the birthday experience I wanted."}
{"text":"First time. Staff is nice. Typical bar and typical Charlotte food aka crap. But if you were born in the south you may like it. North people stay away"}
{"text":"Been here several times. This place has it all...apps, tapas, salad, pizza, sandwiches, sushi and dinner entrees. Great for drink specials, especially martinis. Had the chicken pretzel sandwich which was good. Could have done without the tangy relish, but overall is was a good chicken sandwich. If you need a place for a private party, this place can host any size."}
{"text":"Is it fair to review on the bar only!? What the hell...why not!?!

Some friends and I stopped in on a Saturday evening. It wasn't that late when we arrived but they had already cleared away most of the tables and had a DJ spinning on the ones and twos (wait...did I even say that right?!?). 

Anyhoo, the bar was stocked well and all the bartenders were friendly and heavy handed. That's always much appreciated. They had some drink and shot specials too! So if you're curious just make sure to ask before you order! 

So why just three stars....because place can get packed quick and parking is atrocious. Be prepared to drive around and around to find a spot or park in the shopping center across the street and walk over. Better yet, if you are coming with a group....definitely car pool! 

But I've got to get back here to try the food! I've heard good things about their brunch so I may start with that!"}
{"text":"On a Saturday when every other restaurant is packed in Charlotte, they are barely half-full. So decided to give them a try. We used to frequent the uptown location many years back. Once seated, we find they only have a Valentine's weekend Menu. It hasn't happened to us in a while, but we decided to pass on a rather lame menu and leave. The staff was pleasant and told us to come back when their regular menu is available. I guess Charlotte restaurant business isn't quite evolving much."}
{"text":"Cosmos never gets too crowded for lunch, which is surprising given its location. Food  is typical American. Overall, makes a good location to grab lunch and be able to hold a conversation."}
{"text":"Cosmos Cafe is yet another venue that is really a restaurant, but doubles as a nightlife hot spot on the weekends.  North Carolina's laws on serving alcohol make it nearly impossible to just open a \"club\", so you see a lot of these in Charlotte, especially downtown.  

The staff is super friendly and doesn't hassle you for walking in and realizing \"Saturday night\" hasn't started yet because the dining patrons still haven't cleared out.  So don't be afraid to check it at 11pm and then come back again at midnight or 1 if it's still slow.  I've never been here to eat but it's a great place to stop in for a late night weekend drink to see what's going on.  People dress nice and behave well.  So you can actually get an expensive drink and not worry about someone elbowing it across the room.  

There's plenty of seating on both the first and second floors and they have a respectable, if predictable, Scotch selection that helps me keep them in mind when I'm downtown, so I'm sure the rest of the liquor options are pretty good.  Coming from  Illinois where you can buy booze at grocery stores, it's depressing to walk into a bar in Charlotte and only have one or two choices.  Cosmos expands the horizons and I appreciate that."}
{"text":"I wish I could have given Cosmos @ Rea Rd a higher rating. I use to love the original on College street. 

I did not realize this place got rockin until 10pm on Saturdays. This would explain why my hubby and I were seated immediately around 8. Hey we did not complain. Our server, Kaitlyn? was FAB. Very attentive and she delivered a very tasty Extra Dirty Vodka Martini. Cheers to the Bartender! The atmosphere was groovy and the clientele were ALL women, except for my husband of course. It took me a minute to figure out what was going on. Once the staff started moving tables the light bulb clicked on. Apparently I am getting a little slow in my later years. 

The food, sigh, was not great. We ordered the Chicken Souvlaki, Lamb Sliders, a Spicy Tuna roll and the Grilled Octopus. The chicken was boring, the Lamb Sliders were very dry and the tuna was almost non existent BUT the Grilled Octopus was so delicious and tender, I could have munched on it all night. Who knew the octopus would be the star of the evening? Looks like this is my go to place when craving the eight legged creature.

As we were leaving the men started rolling in getting ready for the hunt. Play nice men, there are plenty of females to go around in there!"}
{"text":"This was (and will be) my only visit to this local establishment. Invited there for a friend's birthday party and it was not conducive to discussions without raising my voice above the steady vibrations of a huge audio speaker right near the table. THe table was on a raised platform next to another large party of about 30 people.  there were no other large tables to accomodate us. The food was expensive but not worth it. One young lady was the lone waitress for us and the other party (and several other tables it seems)  and she was running back and forth constantly. It is a large place and if I didn't know better it's strictly a sports/party bar that also serves food. What with so many restaurants competing in the S Charlotte/Ballantyne area for the same customers, you have to experience a place and then decide.  I've decided. Thanks."}
{"text":"Excellent place no matter what time you go. Food is very good and staff is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Cosmos uptown, but only have stopped in for beverages at  this location. The bar here is large, well appointed, and the bartenders are friendly. I like the layout and decor.   If you stop in right after work, it is not too crowded. However, later in the evening it is certainly more happening."}
{"text":"This 3 star would be a 4 star, but our service was terrible.  Yes we had a large group, but the server rarely came by and when she did acted like it was a problem to get anything.  I threw a surprise birthday party here and they catered to that well, except when people were ordering the one server skipped over every other person to take orders.  So some people had food while others didn't.  One person got their meal after everyone else was finished.  That being said I ordered the sushi and it was pretty good.  No one else complained about the food.  Just the service.   

This was a birthday party so, I was amazed at how it transformed from restaurant to dance club.  The lights came on and the music got louder and louder.  But that made it fun.  It was what we were looking for.  Uptown feel in Ballantyne.  $10 Cover after a certain point in the night, but were there early enough not to pay.  

My final thought is about the crowd.  Wow.  Pretty diverse.  Cougars, guidos, hipsters, some college age, and the guy who should not be dancing but is.  

Like I said fun atmosphere that completely changes at night, but work on hiring friendly staff!"}
{"text":"About 10 of my friends and I decided to head to uptown last night, and this was our first stop for a quick bite to eat and a few drinks to start the evening.  Most places are pretty terrible about accommodating 10 people, but not here, they put a few tables together for us in just a few minutes.  The server was really fast and attentive - the drinks were great, 3 dollar well drinks on a Friday night - can't really beat that in uptown!  We all got a variety of food, ranging from fries and calamari, to sushi and salads - everyone seemed pretty pleased with it, my sushi wasn't out of this world, but was great drinking food I'd have to say.  I really like the look and feel of the bar, feels a lot more upscale than what the prices actually are - it was surprisingly not very busy for a Friday night either.  I'd definitely recommend Cosmo's if you are going out on the town and want some food, drinks, or have a large group of people that want to go out and have some good times!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday.  Didn't order food because by the time we got there, they were on to the abbreviated late night menu.  Ordered several drinks, even one of the $10 martinis, and they were weak!  The service was shoddy (took 10 minutes for my server to get my credit card back to me) but the atmosphere was interesting.  People from all walks of life were there having fun.  I wouldn't go back unless I was tipsy beforehand!"}
{"text":"This is a great club to go to on Friday nights because there is no cover charge, no drink specials though. They play new hip hop and r&b! Had a good time last weekend and I usually always have a good time when I go on Friday nights"}
{"text":"I can't believe they charged me extra cover charge because I had on flats? This is very disturbing in this day and age that women have to be subjected to this type of sexisim! I wore and over the knee expensive and classy boot.  Because of this and the attitude of the girl at the door collecting $ I could not enjoy myself at all!"}
{"text":"Service & drinks both good.  Weeknights are like a ghost town.  Had a great time with a bartender in training."}
{"text":"Oh Cosmos you were so empty on a Friday night but you still managed to be a ton of fun as a first stop! 

Your margaritas tasted nice, your gin and tonic was very strong but not $8 strong. I liked the vodka martini selection, very nice though some of the flavors didn't work out that well.

Our bartender was super cool and nice. So are the patrons, it was pretty empty so we had a little dance party of our own. Then two girls jump in and were like we saw you dancing, and a fun time was had by all as we backed that thang up!

After a bit we were ready to head on to the next destination with a nice buzz and a fun time. Good job Cosmos!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch. The food was just average and service was awful. They were very understaffed - it took about 10 minutes for the server to take my order, and then about another 40 minutes to get my food. I was in a bit of a rush, so ended up speed eating. 

I had a Greek salad, and it was just ok. Ingredients were fresh, but the chicken was pretty dry. 

No bueno."}
{"text":"Forced into this place by my wife, way too crowded for my liking. Families were running out to escape the music, and drunken crowd. This place magically turns into a busy night club after dark. Too loud, service was terrible, and the food was worse."}
{"text":"No idea how this place is for food. Just went here to drink and party. It's quite a scene. Various nights have different types of music. Was there on a Wednesday when they played 80s music (LMAO) and then again on Thursday when they had salsa. They smoke here too but it's not as awful as some places with no air circulation. My favorite part about this place...no cover charge. God bless the South. Drinks were reasonable, and the people watching was entertaining. Worth popping your head into for a minute."}
{"text":"Terrible bar service!! The place was trashed, and they charged my card 3 times not once. I had overdraft fees they refused to pay, and never apologized. Bar manager said she didnt even close out my tab but gave it to another worker. Thats the only explanation i got. I will never visit again. Horrible service, and worse ownership."}
{"text":"This restaurant brings to mind the debate: which is more important, great food or great service?? If the answer is the former, then this restaurant deserves 4 starts, if the answer is the latter then it deserves 1 star.

We went here for a Father's Day brunch - had been here before for dinner but wanted something more family-friendly. It took a while for us to get seated because we wanted an outdoor table. We ended up getting placed at the far end of the patio, not a big deal (or so we thought). 

After this it got interesting. . .we had no silverware, no menu's and no drinks. A waitress came and said she'd be right with us. . .and never returned. After waiting about 10 minutes, we decided to just get in line inside thinking a waitress would eventually come out. 

Great buffet - stellar options and great variety, including an excellent egg dish, shrimp and grits, and prime rib. Very nice salad options and a fun dessert table. 

We got back to the table, still no waitress. . .at this point we started eating and were getting thirsty. Another waitress came by, made eye contact and then walked away. I was getting seriously frustrated because other tables were getting served so I stood up and walked over to the waiting station. I figured I'd just grab coffee and water on my own. A waiter there asked me what the problem was and said he'd take care of it. . .ten more minutes pass. At this point my three children were literally panting with thirst and I was starting to give up hope. A fourth waitress came around and I basically just asked for the manager. 

After another 5 minutes (at this point we'd gone up twice for food, grabbed random place settings from the waiting station and still didn't even have water) the manager came and asked how everything was. Long story short I \"shared\" my experience. I give him a lot of credit because he listened and wasn't defensive in the least. While he was there waiter #3 did finally arrive with our coffee and orange juice. . .50 minutes after we were seated.

The manager explained that they had dramatically underestimated the crowds to expect that day and that the restaurant was straining under the load. I shared with him that the food was very good but that the service really detracted from the overall experience. Again, he was very good about taking the feedback.

At the end of our meal we didn't receive a check for a loooonnnnggg time and just as I was thinking \"not again\" the manager came by and explained that the entire meal was complementary due to the experience we had. Very gracious gesture and we certainly left on a positive note.

So, which is more important - the food or the service? Not exactly sure but I know when either is off!!"}
{"text":"After finding out Hawthorne's next door had a 30 minute wait on a Friday night, my girlfriend and I popped over to Cosmos.  Oddly enough, we got right in.  There were maybe eight people at the bar and a few tables throughout the restaurant at 6:30 p.m.  

Our hostess seated us at a high-top table in the bar and asked if we wanted a server.  Ummm, as opposed to me walking over to the bar every time I want something?  Odd.  Bottles of wine were half off and appetizers were buy one get one, so we got a bottle of wine and split the Spanikopata and braised beef empanadas.  Both were warm, flaky and delicious!  

Cosmos has always had seemed to me like it's having an identity crisis.  It has inventive, delicious food and wine, and a classy, intimate atmosphere for a business lunch or dinner with friends.  However, at night, it oddly turns into a meat market with cougars and woo girls.  I much prefer the first Cosmos."}
{"text":"Ate there last night. Food was pretty good except the steak came out cold. The staff was friendly but the food was sooo slow to come out and any time we asked for something they either forgot it took a long time to bring it. It was NOT a busy night so it was a bit disappointing. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Good food - good apps (we mainly drop in for drinks and apps). Wife says: Ask for the bartender's signature \"Queen\" martini. The \"kalamari\" aoli is really good. I like the Moroccan Mini Lamb burgers (sliders). Have sampled their pizza and sushi too which as also good. On tap now is a beer from Raleigh (forget name) - a satisfying and hi-content wheat beer."}
{"text":"Cool area, not my crowd but I can see the attraction.  A little pricey, but huuuuge inside.  Could see it bring a decent place for large party.  Hate to say this but kind of reminds me of alley cats from downtown, only add about 20 years to the average age of the crowd and turn the music level down."}
{"text":"I have been to Cosmos' twice in my 18 years in North Carolina.  I must say the first time was a better experience.  I went during the CIAA the gratuity was 20%.  
A grilled chicken sandwich cost me $11.00 (overpriced), the taste was substandard and no seasoning.  I guess you can say we recieved third quality food at high end prices. It was terrible.  The the service was okay and I was atmosphere was not that great.  I do not see myself returning."}
{"text":"This place is a scam! I had a charge on my account that i did not make in addition to the correct charge. I contacted the manager and he rudely assured me he had both signed receipts and said both had different handwriting and signatures but IT WASNT HIS PROBLEM. He also said he doesnt waste his time checking every single persons id that uses their card there. Wow...so they will check everyones id that comes through the front door to make sure they are of age to protect temselves, but they wont check ids to protect the people that spend their money there? I wont EVER go back. I recommend to anyone who goes their to check their bank acounts after their visit.. This could happen to you. Fortunately, if you have a good bank like i do they will get your money back for you if you catch it :-)"}
{"text":"Definitely a fun place to go...but dress code is way too strict during night club time.  Apparently you have to have a collar shirt to get it...I've worn regular shirts (nice ones of course) many times and had no problem getting in.  Oh well, it's a private club so I can't argue it, but I'm still only giving them 2 stars."}
{"text":"I have only drank here but it is a great vibe!  I love the dance lessons - heck I dont even need a few drinks to invite the opportunity to make a fool of myself.  They had salsa lessons on a recent Saturday night that I was there.  The upstairs bartenders was fast and efficient.  There are couches were you can sit and chat with your friends.  Love the cool staircase and whole feel of the place!  :-D"}
{"text":"This place is very conveniently located off of Rea Rd in Ballantyne. We decided to go for lunch here since our colleague was here in town this week. We were welcomed by the manager and were seated. Suddenly my colleague noticed that the sofa wasn't clean since there were lots of crumbs. It could be because the material was velvet. So we were moved to different location. 

We ordered our beverage and I took out the napkin which had some sort of dark stain (huge) on it. I called our server and she handed me another one, it turned out that this one had green stain on it. I guess it wasn't a good day :(

We ordered our food and our server was kind enough to help me pick out my order. She kept checking on us if everything was ok every couple of minutes which is nice. Even the manager came and apologies for the napkin incident and explained they just have four new staff members who are in training. 

Our food came out and it was delicious. We all like our food which we ordered however my friend thought their sweet tea wasn't sweet enough. I guess he's got sweet tooth :)

All in all it was good experience where the place had very good modern decor, good service and good food. They just need to work on their consistency but who doesn't right LOL"}
{"text":"I had 8:30 PM reservations for New Years Eve and of course they required a credit card to secure the reservation. We arrived at 8:00 PM and were told that we had the next table. After 2 and 1/2 hours at 10:30 I was told that we may not get to eat. There were at least 50 other people left standing at the door that night. They acted as if they didn't care that they had ruined everyone's New Years Eve. It was pure greed that they simply over-booked so that they could be assured a full house. Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Never been here for food but I hear people rave about their lunches here and specifically the artichoke dip and chips.  All my experiences have been for after work drinks or night time social settings.  That being said, I like this place for a couple reasons.  First, it's never overly crowded much like you might find with some of the Epicenter bars.  Secondly, I've never been charged a cover to get in, again, much like the Epicenter places.  They have a nice bar upstairs for the times when the first floor gets to be crowded you can head up the stairs to another landing where there is a nice sized bar and plenty of room for socializing.

The second floor is a great spot to reserve for a birthday party, etc."}
{"text":"Only been here a couple of times, mostly during Saturday nights.  Most recently ventured out here because one of my co-workers who is recently separated and 55 y/o wanted to get out and my friend and I could think of no better place in the area for him than Cosmos on a Saturday night.

The place seems to be packed out on Saturday nights pretty regularly although I've not frequented this place very often, but the times I have it's always pretty full.  The service around the place was pretty darn good considering the density of the crowd.  The wait staff didn't leave us lingering all together too long.

The music is pretty much top 40 and some classics nothing too new age or out of the norm.  The crowds range from late 20's to late 50's it appeared to me."}
{"text":"I might have given this place 3 stars but I don't really feel it is worth it. 
I'm in town visiting and wanted somewhere that served brunch. So I tried Yelp. This seemed the closest place that had a full bar. They also offered a brunch buffet for $12, which didn't seem too bad. I didn't really see any reviews that mentioned brunch, which I guess in hind sight, should have been a red flag. But I digress. 
We arrived and our server Kenny was pretty prompt in coming to our table. Then again, they had just opened and there was only one other table of guests in the restaurant. Most of the staff just seemed to be standing around. 
Kenny didn't offer any information in regards to the buffet vs menu ordering when he came to our table to take our drink order. I ordered a bloody mary. He stated, \"Sorry, not until after 12\". Obviously if I ordered one, I'm not local and rather than explain the reason to me, he kind of just brushed it off and looked at me until I ordered something else. 
When I inquired about the buffet rules he stated, \"Kids are 3.50 but they get the same, everything that's up there\". That seems like a HUGE price difference. I understand kids generally eat less, but I've seen kids eat more and I paying more than triple the price for mine. Moving on... 
I had brought my nephew with us and he ordered hot chocolate. Rather than the server telling us they were out of hot chocolate, he improvised and brought something out. What he brought out was warm chocolate milk. The 8 year old I was with knew that wasn't hot chocolate, and stated such. The server still proceeded to charge me for it, rather than be courteous. I'm not looking for a hand out, but when you improvise with something that I didn't ask for, without telling me first, is a little irritating. 
When we went up to get our food everything looked good. Not great, but good. There wasn't a lot of variety. Scrambled eggs, home fries, an egg scramble that had home fries and vegetables, some grits, bacon, sausage, some tiny pieces of french toast and one or two other items. When I got back to the table, none of the food was hot. None of it. The eggs, were warm. The french toast was almost cold. The bacon was cold and the syrup wasn't even warmed up to make the french toast hotter. It was all very mediocre. Not the typed of condition I would expect the buffet to be, 20 minutes after the place opened. 
As we were finishing our first plate, our server brought us our check. He asked us once during the 24 minutes (yes, we knew exactly what time we sat down), if we need anything. But as we were still in the middle of our meal, we didn't. He brought the check to us without asking if there was anything else he could get for the table, or even offering to refill our drinks. My bf had to ask for a refill on his coffee and it wasn't until then that I was offered a refill my tea, that had been empty for some time. 
Brought check after we barely finished our first plate. Didn't bother to ask if we needed anything. This experience overall, was mediocre, and that is being generous. I would absolutely never come here for brunch again and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I have lived in Charlotte almost my whole life and Cosmos really did start out great. Unfortunately I've given them about 4 chances in the past year and every time I have been more disappointed than the last. The service is beyond awful there and the manager could really care less and that is something that is very apparent to any diner. We were sitting there at a table and they actually removed every single table from around us so we were the only one there...so awkward and really just odd. They were making a dance floor for later but the entire restaurant was empty so why they chose to seat us there I don't know. Every time I've gone I've had to wait at least 45 min for my food and it just isn't worth it. This place may be good for drinks but definitely not for dinner."}
{"text":"I went there for my last ladies night out before I went back to work. It was an experience.  We had about 6 in our party and everyone was attened to. However, it was happy hour and I felt that maybe the waitress was going a little slow to make sure we didn't get the Happy Hour prices. I mean people who come in before 7 are coming for the 2 for 1 apps. 

All the food was delicious though a little pricey for me for bar food, but comparable to other Uptown areas. I would definitely go again but during happy hour."}
{"text":"Just got back from Cosmos for dinner, all I can say is that $12 for 10 oz. prime rib special with bake potato and mix vegetables, you can't beat that! I definitely will go back for another round of good prime rib before this promotion ends!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and they get four stars from me because of their half off martinis and appetizer specials during the week. That part is awesome. Food is good,  service is always good and I like the atmosphere alot. Definitely a great after work spot."}
{"text":"I went to Cosmos once for lunch, and the Cajun chicken panini wasn't bad. I went back again for half off appetizers, and was horribly disappointed. We got the crab dip, which has no discernible pieces of crab meat and tasted as if the whole dip (including meat) had been pureed. We also got the stuffed mushrooms, which arrived shriveled and left too much to be desired."}
{"text":"For a Fri night, the service was slow. Not enough staff. DON'T order the Greek salad. DON'T order the dessert martinis. We had a party of six. Won't do that again."}
{"text":"Went here for my sister-in-law's birthday party and had a great time.  The staff was super friendly and had everything set up in fairly short order.  No complaints really."}
{"text":"This place has everything!  Popped in for lunch with a friend and a drink or few.  We sat at the bar in the center of the place and spoke with the very friendly bartender for suggestions.  She suggested a sushi lunch plate which we ended up sharing and the drink special.  Since the sushi chief worked right behind where we were stationed we got to watch the whole plate get created.  After a few rounds of the daily drink special we walked out tipsy and full for around $10 each, now that's a great lunch date in my book!"}
{"text":"A lot of people (girls) I know love this place, but to me it seems like much of the same in Uptown Charlotte: it's crowded, loud, and a little over-the-top. Again, though, as I've always said: this isn't always a bad thing. 

On Thursdays through Sundays, this place is pretty packed with twenty-somethings and maybe braver older adults looking to booze and get after it, probably before hitting a louder/dancier place nearby. There are plenty of food options (try their mini pizzas and other appetizers), so you can come here and grab a snick whilst you drink or before you head out to drink more. 

I've been told that their martinis (their selection and creativity is extensive) are awesome, so if you're into that you may wanna try them. And they usually have some great deals on those, so be sure to check that out."}
{"text":"Just an all around bad experience at Cosmos. The service was painfully slow, everyone just didn't seem to care that we were hungry and thirsty. Unfortunately when the food finally arrived it was terrible. With so many other choices for food & drink in South Charlotte I can guarantee I won't waste another dime at Cosmos!"}
{"text":"I've always loved this bar and have gone since it opened.  Love Paul, the best bartender in the world. Once he waits on you, you pretty much never have to tell him your order again. Great apps!  But I must admit I haven't gone lately due to having to pay to park after 5pm.  Think its ridiculous.  Great people watching !"}
{"text":"Went his past sat night and they have changed their menu.  There wasn't much that interested me and what we got was WRONG.  The crostini I got was burned black on one side and soggy on the other.  I'd suggest they go back to their old menu where there was more then 5 apps to choose from and work on their food quality.  Doubt I\"ll ever order food here again.  They should be ashamed."}
{"text":"It's a bar with fun latin nights.Haven't had the food but if you know how to salsa, or don't but like the vibe, Cosmos is probably one of the more fun places to go dancing."}
{"text":"Ah, Cosmos.  The corner almost at the end of Uptown.  Or Downtown.  I might just call it \"Town\", but that might be mistaken for that other restaurant that also calls itself Pie Town (sometimes).

Whatever the case, Cosmos is definitely an interesting beast.  Depending when you go, the place is almost empty.  When we went - a Tuesday, I think - the place was a ghost town.

The food at Cosmos sounds a lot more interesting on the menu than it is on the plate.  Partially because the portions just don't live up to the pricetag and partially because they just aren't that great.  The menu is eclectic, with a selection of appetizers, burgers, pizza, sushi - generally light bites, all of which falls into the same category of interesting and not quite what you would expect.

Service at Cosmos is decent but not outstanding.  If you happen to be on looking for something at that corner, check it out.  Otherwise, I just don't know if it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Drink prices are high but the dancing is fun!"}
{"text":"Cosmos is one if my go to places for some affordable eats before an event or a show uptown. My girlfriends and I thoroughly enjoy the half-price martinis on Wednesdays - my personal fave is the pineapple upside-down martini. Mmmm tastes like cake! Who doesn't like cake in a glass? 

I've eaten a variety of dishes on the menu and each dish I've had was both tasty and affordable enough to come back. Some of my favorites are the Fried Goat Cheese Salad, the Shepherd Pizza and Pasta Primavera. 

For those adult beverage seekers, the bar can get crowded during happy hour and special event evenings. I'm a fan of Cosmo's bar crowd, as compared to its neighbors, this bar attracts a well behaved crowd of upper 20s-late 30s. Not that I have an issue with a younger crowd, but I'm just jiving with the cages, swings and go-go dancers next door. 

Make sure to note that Cosmo's sports a limited menu on big event nights and offers half price apps from 5-7 pm. This is definitely a spot to make reservations during event nights!"}
{"text":"Went to Cosmos Cafe for dinner last night. Out of the reviews that are on here it looks like most were geared toward the night life, which we didn't stick around for. We came solely to try the food. 

Everything on the menu sounded so good, and they had a decent range of dishes for you to choose from, with the countries that the dish is from written on the side of each choice. I think it would be hard to come here and have a hard time finding something that sounds good to you, even for the pickiest of eaters. 

Our waitress was very friendly and had our drinks out pretty quickly, and she was great at helping us choose which dishes to go with. For appetizer we had the crab con queso - you MUST get this!! I can't even tell you how good it was, you just need to go experience it yourself. It was a crab dip blended together with cheeses, (hence, the name), and it was amazing. They serve it with nachos, and the waitress made a joke about how she literally needed to pry it from our hands because our entrees were about ready to come out and she wanted to clear our table. We also got the Dim Sum as an app, which were basically shrimp dumplings, and they came with a thai peanut dipping sauce that was very tasty. 

Then our entrees came out - Oh my Wild Mushroom Ravioli! I have to admit that when it first came out I was doubtful, because it didn't look like much, but it was a deep dish and the raviolis were a decent size. The mushroom brown sauce that the ravs were buried in was out of control. SO good. My fiancee ordered the Tuna Filet Mignon, rare, and it was excellent (of course I saved room for a sample). The only thing that wasn't so good was the \"mashed potatoes\" surrounded the filet, and I put it in quotations because they were definitely questionable. They tasted totally artificial, and if you hadn't told me they were mashed potatoes I would be stuck wondering what it was. Looked like someone stuck microwaveable cauliflower mystery mix and stuffed it through a pastry gun to make it look pretty. I'd order the dish but skip the \"mash\". 

Our bill came and we were pretty stunned that we had drinks, 2 apps, and two entrees, and it was only around $60. Definitely not bad! We will be back for sure, for dinner and to stick around for the night scene. We also liked how it had a casual vibe, yet everyone was dressed really nice. Just as a side-note about uptown: I am finding that about a lot of the places we visit; everyone looks really good, the girls dress so cute, but it's not uptight."}
{"text":"Went to this Cosmo's to celebrate a friends birthday. Food was sub par.  Either too salty or too bland.  Not much in the way of drink selections if you don't want a martini.  Service was very disappointing.  We were there before the late night crowd, but barely saw our waiter.  When the tables beside us filled with grey haired courgars our waiter reappeared and waited on them hand and foot???  Crowd is a weird mix of college students, suburb thugs ( guys trying to look and sound like Eminem or 50 cent..and  anyone can tell its an act and they are soft as kittens lol), cougars, and white haired suga daddies( some dressed like Eminem but you know they are someones granddad or great grandad).  I'll pass."}
{"text":"I visited the city for friends birthday celebration. I'm told Cosmos is a Cafe by day, club by night! We visited at night when the establishment was in club mode. While we had a great time, I can't really speak to the cafe part. This is a place that I'd visit again during normal business hours to check out the food selection. However, the night atmosphere was fun. It was a bit crowded for my taste, but the DJ played really good music and the bartenders moved with haste. There was a line, but that was because entry was FREE. You could skip the line for a fee, but you moved up to wait in another line. Get to the place before 12midnight to experience a good time in plenty of time. Everything in Charlotte closes at 2a.m."}
{"text":"We went there on Saturday night for the first time. The music was fantastic for dancing merengue, bachata, salsa but he also mixed it with a bit of hip hop. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. But food and drinks were disappointing. This place markets itself as \"Martini specialists\" but I had to ask for my martini to be remade a second time as it came without olives. Also - olives were standard jarred fair. A much better martini can be had at \"Urban Sip\" above the Ritz - they have Spanish giant olives hand-stuffed with blue cheese."}
{"text":"This place fcking sucked. It's been closed for years because it fcking sucked. NCAA was in town, so my group tried to give Cosmos a shot during an intermission. There was a long wait, which gave us plenty of time to notice that neither the customers or employees looked happy to be there. We should've bailed at that point, but didn't like our odds for getting seated anywhere else. As we were being shown our seats, we observed that none of the patrons had any food on their tables, whatsoever. Place was packed, and people were taking turns screaming at the manager in desperate attempt to figure out what was going on. Atmosphere was hostile. Felt dangerous being there. A random customer advised us to leave, after informing he'd been waiting an hour since placing his original order. His complaint made sense after overhearing a waitress confess to another table that the kitchen had run out of food... Yet Cosmos continued to seat people. We left.

Fck this place, and the ghost of this place."}
{"text":"Yeeeeaah, I know it's, y'know, power lunch by day and disco by night, but wow was the dinner I had here underwhelming. 

Like, boring, oily, scant salad, meh fries, expensive, bland beer selection. Our waitress was gone - either invisible, dropping things loudly and whisking off like she hadn't just startled the beejeezus out of us, or just that warm mix of fed up/bored/seriously, you want something? kind of service that screams for a 5% tip.

Somehow still managed to spend 20 bucks a head. And that'll be the last time I visit Cosmos."}
{"text":"Located in a shopping centre, Cosmos has a lively interior and loud music thumping after 9:30 pm, presumably to attract the older meet market that flocks here.

 The food was average to moderately good. We ordered the California dip - a spinach avocado dip with parmesan on top  and pita served on the side. The spinach tasted like it was straight out of a can, but otherwise the dip was serviceable and we gobbled it up due to sheer hunger. 

I had the fried goat cheese salad. Delicious croquette of fried cheese - how can you go wrong? sitting atop a well dressed salad with pistachios sprinkled on it as well.

Fellow guest had the lamb burgers. Spiced well, but overcooked with dry-ish buns. Accompanying fries tasted again like they were straight out of the freezer.

Big stumble of the night - we ordered molten lava cake, which somehow did not get made in the kitchen. The waiter disappeared for 25 mins while we waited, and we ended up having to hunt him down. He was apologetic, but nonetheless the experience was mostly ruined. He disappeared once again while we waited for the check. 

Final recommendation - come here just for drinks and dancing, and perhaps some tapas at the bar where the bartenders are attentively serving the patrons."}
{"text":"This place is a cool place in Charlotte.  They have Salsa dancing on Thursdays that can get pretty busy.

I usually come here midweek, but hear that  weekends are fun too.  The bald headed bartender was very friendly and knowledgable.  The IPA I had was really good (but just a tad warm).  I am staying at the Holiday Inn across the street so this is a good low-key find right next to my hotel.   Was described as a Bank Of America bar and not a Wachovia Bar, I guess the two of them compete in this town?!?!.........Kidding.  Have fun."}
{"text":"I've never been for the food but on a friday/saturday night love going for a great margarita and for a good price. I've tried margarita's all over charlotte, not to sound like a slush, but this one is the best by far."}
{"text":"Cosmos is a comfortable trendy stop spot.  Most of the crowd is bar crew that is stopping in quickly and heading somewhere else but that if fine.. That is what this place caters to.  

Food:  
Crostini:  4/5  It is like a little beef bruschetta delight.. Excellent choice.
Crab/Spinach Dip:  4/5  Delicious chunky crab dip that is delicious.  

Drinks:
Chocolate Raspberry Truffle:  5/5  The most \"healthy\" drink on the menu.  This drink is more beautiful than delicious (if that is possible).
Dirty Martini:  3/5  Just like it sounds.. Heavy olive juice plus olive juice. 
--Wed are 1/2 off all martinis and buy one get one app.  

Atmosphere:  Jumpin with after work and pregame people.  Always a lively crowd that is fun to be with..  Enjoy!

-Ian M."}
{"text":"I work in ITC. Some great places in the area. I'd consider Cosmo's as worth it, if you have about an hour to spare. 

My favorite thing on the menu- Flank Steak Salad. Imagine a plate of deliciousness that includes: lettuce, cherry tomato's, mushrooms, onions, flank steak, and french fries!!! I think I just saw Jesus as I wrote that.

It's a very trendy plcae inside. They have a little Sushi-bar area with a Sushi-dude that works his Sushi-hands a mile a minute making all your Sushi-dreams come true. 

It's never terribly packed inside whenever I go, but it has all the makings to becoming a food-warrior on the mean streets of Queen City. If you do have time, duck in, order the flank steak salad, and holla at the hotties that they have waiting tables. What's good?"}
{"text":"I stumbled into this place on a Monday night while I was attending a conference alone.  I had been wandering around looking for something with good food but not too pretentious.  I scanned the menu and went into Cosmos.  Since it was Monday it was not crowded and the wait staff was very attentive.  I ordered the Greek Salad to start and it was amazing.  The tomatoes were huge and plentiful (a requirement for me), the dressing was brilliant and the presentation was very nice.  

I know this is a pizza place but I am on a no bread diet so I ordered the Chicken Paillard.  again, this was out of this world.  The chicken was cooked perfectly, the potatoes were excellent, the sauce was mouth watering and the side of spinach was so well done.  I made a point of complimenting the chef to the waitress.  No dessert for me but I promised to give a great review of the place and then forgot to do it until now.

I would go back if I am ever in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Nice place to hangout Tuesday night salsa night cheap beer nice people. Friday and saturday are also good to hangout and dance club music"}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. To start off our server, Erin, was extremely slow at getting us drinks. She was behind the bar chatting with the staff. The food took forever and came out burnt and hardly edible. There was even an event menu... To top things off, no one came by to check in on us until we had to go ask for checks. At this point we hadn't complained. She added 20% gratuity, which was when we asked for a manager. The manager on duty never stopped by or said anything. The bar manager stepped up and took care of the situation. I will NOT be back. This kind of service is probably why your restaurant was empty on a Saturday night!

Also, don't leave fast food on a table in the dining area. It's not sanitary."}
{"text":"We wanted to try Cosmo's because it offers so many different kinds of food. In truth, the menu isn't that diverse and the sushi bar was closed when we were there. Bummer. What we did order--hubby got a gyro and I had a chicken gyro--was delicious. The onion rings were great so add them on if you go."}
{"text":"This place is a trip!  First, both the food and service are pretty good and I would certainly go back based on the menu and service alone; however the crowd is great!  Nowhere else in Ballantyne can you find 20 and 40+ year old women trying so hard to be 30, and it's obvious why.  The sheer amount of Gotti-wannabe's doing Jager-bombs is enough to get any desperate housewife excited.

Check it out- it's worth it."}
{"text":"Place gone from special date-night, to just okay. Staff disorganized, Greek chicken was dry, pitta bread stale, steak over seasoned and undercooked. No wonder empty on Friday night."}
{"text":"Cosmos Cafe is not a typical club. I think during the day it is some eating establishment that is converted to a dance club on Fridays and Saturdays. Fridays are fairly slow, but Saturdays get really packed. At times it is hard to find parking. There is a large bar area that is usually populated by a somewhat older crowd drinking and talking. The music is top 40, TVs stream music videos.There is an outside seating area where you can sit and chat. It is not a Suite at Epicenter experience, but a good place to dance all night."}
{"text":"Charlotte has a hit or miss club/bar scene.  Some of the places try to be better than they are and other places are awesome, but woefully under attended.  Comsos is an odd mix located deep in the Ballantyne area.

First off, there's a wide range of age groups who attend this joint from barely employed hipsters to silver haired money men.  Second, is the hybrid nature of the place, restaurant/bar by day and club by night.  Third are the NYC caliber DJ & bartenders stuck in a southern style city.  You wouldn't think this mash-up works, but somehow it all pulls together at the last moment.

DJ Spencer (semi-retired) is one of the best mixers I've seen in the CLT area, Stefan is THE MAN to know behind the bar (that bastard has been getting me hammered for of over 5 years now), and the security is on point taking out drunk fucks in 30 seconds or less.  This is one place I'd hit regularly on a Saturday night.

If you're looking for a hot spot without the hassle of uptown you definitely need to hit Comsos."}
