{"text":"For CNE food - this is great stuff. I'm not sure what people expect from CNE booths. It doesn't matter if it's healthy or vegan - they still are serving hundreds of people from 10am to 10pm. Their prices are a little expensive for on-the-street food, but not CNE. Across the way, french fries topped with vegan mayo and tiny bits of green onion and cucumbers cost the same as Wild Child's Portebello wrap - which was a good size and filling. It's what I eat when I go the CNE. It's the only choice that doesn't make you want to throw up afterwards ;)"}
{"text":"Wild Child's Kitchen in the Food Building, which is such a huge disappointment:

Apparently they are only in CNE. Thought I'd go a little healthier. Got their 3 Amigos tacos for $12.50 hoping they would be filling for that price. but I was shocked to see that they are 3 mini tacos! Bite sized and such a rip off. It wasn't filling at at all, it was more like an appetizer. I know CNE is generally overpriced but the ingredients aren't expensive to begin with; just beans, sweet potato and some chopped tomatoes. I could have gotten burgers for $8 which is a lot more filling.

On the taste end of it, the corn tortillas were not hot, slightly crispy, and one of the tacos barely had much beans in it. Horrible. You might as well pig out and get a good poutine."}
{"text":"One of the only healthy, vegan food vendors at the CNE this year, but hugely unsatisfying with the sloppy way they assemble food. The food is very, very basic - I ordered the Energize salad bowl (size: large, $13), which comes with quinoa, shredded beets and carrots, cherry tomatoes, lots of greens, sunflower seeds, all in an oily citrus-y dressing (on the side). I think a huge component of eating is about food presentation, so was disappointed to find a salad that looked like something I could have literally slapped together by dumping different ingredients on in under a minute. My partner ordered the nachos and said that it was not great. The nachos tasted like potato chips and the cheese sauce wasn't the best in terms of flavor. For the prices and portion sizes you're better off going to Kupfert and Kim, Fresh, or any other vegan places downtown."}
{"text":"I decided to go ahead and try this place because I like trying new vegan foods whenever I can. The Nacho-rama was an all vegan nacho dish, including sour cream, guac, some kind of substitute for meat and diced tomatoes. I don't know what it was but these nachos were amazing! You couldn't tell that the ingredients were vegan and it was even better than if it hadn't been vegan--I think it was either the guac or the meat substitute that did it for me. I wish I got a large, and I wish there was a real restaurant for this place."}
