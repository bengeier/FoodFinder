{"text":"I came here the other night for dinner and was not disappointed, but not incredibly impressed either. The meal starts with complimentary foccacia with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping which was very good. For an appetizer I got the carpaccio with arugula salad  and truffle olive oil. That I was impressed with - the meat was incredibly tender and the flavour from the oil complimented it very nicely. Best carpaccio I've had. For the entree I ordered a special which was orange roughy with a mushroom sauce. This was quite good, but I was not a fan of the texture of the fish as it was a bit mushy. However I have not had orange roughy before, so maybe that's just how the fish is. I tried a bit of the whole grilled sea bass, and I found that to be much better than my dish. Service was great, they were friendly, helpful, and not as slow as I expected for how busy it was and the fact that they were short two waiters that night.  As for cost, it was a little pricey, $135 plus tip for one appetizer, three entrees, some mineral water, pop, and cappuccino - not quite worth it, but not a complete rip-off either. I''ll be sure to return and  try other appetizers and entrees to see how their other dishes are."}
{"text":"This place is extremely over-priced and the food is very bland. Of course, my foodie red flag started waving when the parmesan cheese they offered to sprinkle over our food was the processed powder variety - the epitome of a bad Italian restaurant. A dinner for two children and two adults (one beer included for me as the wine selection by the glass was abysmal) was $145. Many, many more better dining choices in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"If I were going out for Italian this would not be my first choice. The pasta dishes are over priced and not worth the money..... There are many other restaurants in the area that charge the same money if not less and the quality is that much better  If you insist on eating there, the calamari are always a hit and the penne alla vodka  I have it a 3 based on food quality to price ratio"}
{"text":"A very nice place! Service is very friendly and professional. Setting is comfortable and even romantic. Good was great, totally worth its money. The only thing was that there was a big party for \"sweet 16\" birthday with bunch of loud girls. I would say that if it wasn't for them, we would stay there a bit longer. Otherwise very nice and totally professional."}
{"text":"Came here for a fundraising event. They did a good job hustling tables and getting a large group served quite efficiently. Nothing outstanding about the food. It is hard to accurately  judge based on the event's set menu. Perhaps another visit is warranted. I am rarely in the area but will keep it in mind. There is ample parking since it is located in a strip mall."}
{"text":"This place was suggested by a former colleague when we were trying to figure out a place for a catch up lunch meeting. Funny, I've lived in Richmond Hill almost my entire life and apparently this place has been here almost the same length of time. What?   This is #YelpLife as it were I suppose. Finding hidden gems right in your backyard. And in case you're wondering where you can find this spot, it's located in the plaza on the North-East corner of Bathurst and Carville Road (aka Rutherford).  It's simplistic enough from the outside but the modern open concept design that lays within is a refreshing look for an Italian restaurant.   Given that we were here for lunch, I didn't have anything to drink, but after hearing about some of their specials I couldn't resist the sound of the Risotto Giambieri (shrimp). It was a hearty portion for sure and the rice was cooked as it should be (and if you've ever watched Hells Kitchen, Gordon Ramsey would have you believe that this is a bloody big deal!)  My only complaint is the dish was a little light on the main attraction (the Shrimp), I counted 3 in my dish. Which I suppose is fair for a lunch but for the price I had hoped for a couple more. On the plus side the shrimp I did receive were a fair size.  I'd definitely return to give them another try, and sample some of my other fave Italian dishes.   Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Hired to photograph a event at the restaurant and my client said that I was able to request food if I was just hungry (it will be on their tab). I requested food and they said they were out of food and had no more. What kind of restaurant runs out of food during a weekend event and doesn't offer alternatives? The manager sounded rude and walked passed me without eye contact when I asked. I ended up drinking liquids as a meal for 4 hours. Would not recommend at all since there are better Italian restaurant alternatives."}
{"text":"It is not easy to find in Canada a nice, cozy, and NOT noisy place. Delicious food, quiet and relaxing atmosphere, and clean, service is good and it is not annoying (!!!), will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Visiting from the US.  Went to Piatto Vecchio with family.  I'm Italian born so I know a little bit about Italian food.  I Got the gnocchi.  Fantastic.  Everyone raved about the dish they ordered.  Definitely coming here on the next visit and the one after that."}
{"text":"Usually very quiet. Nice decor. Located in a small plaza in Richmond Hill with few Italian restaurants nearby.  Came here twice with a coupon that gets mailed out occasionally.  Food here is really good. Good amount that will be filling if you got just an entree and dessert. Prices are higher but with the coupon it was great value. However the service here deducts one point, I think it is the manager who is also the server on slow days, he was a bit rude when my bfs mom tried to present the voucher that they themselves sent out. Hope he knows to either stop mailing it out or be cooler about it."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Friday night. I heard many good things about this place from family and friends and thought I should try it for myself. However, I was pretty disappointed.   We went around 7:30 pm and place was pretty empty so we were seated immediately. They gave us some fresh bread with oil and vinegar to start. For the appetizer, we ordered the fried calamari and the portion was massive. It tasted okay but it was VERY oily.  As for the main meal, I had the spaghettini with shrimp and tomato sauce. It was okay but extremely oily so I couldn't finish my meal. Also, not to mention that the main meal took 30-40 mins to come and the restaurant was fairly empty.   When we were paying, our total bill came out to $61.50 (two meals and an appetizer) and I was supposed to receive $38.50 in change. However, the waiter gave me back $40 in change which was odd because he gave me an extra $1.50 (but I didn't pay attention to this until later). So after we left the tip, another waiter picked it up and took it to the cash. He came back to our table and basically told us that we hadn't tipped though and threw our tip back on our table. I've never experienced this kind of disrespectful behaviour at a restaurant before. I was already disappointed with the service, and food so I was pretty upset at this point.   All in all, I gave this place 2 stars because of its nice ambiance but that's about it. Service was slow and food was more expensive than usual. There are so many better Italian restaurants in the area and I probably will not be returning."}
{"text":"An excuse for an Italian restaurant, with bad service laced with attitude, and mediocre food - I don't really know when or where to stop.   As it was a long and sad affair, I will only offer a couple of highlights:  No bread was served, with a pathetic excuse (because if it was an attempt at humour, it was corny and lame) of \"I thought you all were on a diet\").   A risotto which drips oil when lifted from the plate is unpleasant, the least to say.    Overall, don't bother - there are plenty of other choices."}
{"text":"Very good GF pasta! Apetizers excellent.  Creme brulee ruined a perfect dinner Waiters very friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Food is always great. Large portions and everything on the menu is amazing. Try the lamb it does not disappoint. Service is top notch and they keep the ac on in the summer. Can't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Their shrimp risotto was the best I've had in a long time. Great service and good wine list. Will defiantly be coming back"}
{"text":"This place has been here for YEARS and I have always wanted to go but for one reason or another just never did, and I lived about 2 minutes away from it for my entire life. Finally, I got around to trying the place a few weeks back after having move downtown! Funny the way things work out.  Had some sort of pasta with a sun-dried tomato cream sauce and chicken - it was delicious! The restaurant was pretty empty so can't comment much on the atmosphere, but the decor was very nice. It would probably do much better in a different location, but they've managed to stick around there for about 16 years so they must be doing ok. The menu is rather limited, but I would definitely give it another try... maybe in another 16 years, but hopefully sooner!  Based on my experience I'd say it's one of the better restaurants in the area, but unfortunately I didn't try any more dishes than my own. Oh wait... Their mushroom soup was also amazing!"}
{"text":"Been at Piatto Vecchio for a couple of times, a real nice Italian place, authentic flavour. I'm not an expert in Italian restaurants but I have tried quite a few and this really comes up high in there. I had ordered their risotto and the linguini with black or tiger shrimp and these were absolutely delicious!  I really like the design as well, with some authentic prints and pictures, nice bar setup... For some reason it gives me an impression like i'm in Cecilia or something! If you're in Richmond hilll and you haven't tried this place yet, or visiting this town and in the mood for Italian food, look nowhere else and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went here this past Sunday for a 25th wedding anniversay. This was the fist time I have ever been here and loved it. I felt as if i was in a typical Italian hall for a wedding. The atomosphere was nice, we got out own private section off the the side of the resturant. I also noticed the place was closed to the public which made it nice to have just a couple of parties going on. The decor of the place was modern and stylish.  The pre set menu was exactly what I expected. The first course was the antipasta, the second was the pasta (red and white) the third wad the main meat dish and dessert was shorbert plus cake and italian cookies my aunt had made. By the end of this meal I was stuffed... exactly how I usually feel at every family function. I'd like to reurn back when I am able to see what they offer on a regular day and the quality of service then. All in all great day out within a great enviroment!"}
