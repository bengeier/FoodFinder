{"text":"Overwhelming menu. So many choices for breakfast. We had the cinnamon bun french toast. They were delicious, probably the best I ever had. It can get pricey when you start to add side dishes to the meal. Bakery items are fresh and warm, made right in their kitchen. Located next to the Hooters hotel/casino."}
{"text":"\"Cheap Ass Breakfast\" is what this place should be renamed. After a long night in Vegas and all your friends are sad they lost all their money you can come here and be happier. Because Coco's only asks for about $5 and you can have a decent breakfast. The breakfast specials are what I would say are equivalent to a \"grand slam\" at another restaurant. Other than that it is a typical diner menu. The wait staff was friendly and patient with our large group. I think the pure cheapness would make me want to come back here again, other than that nothing really stands out this place."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.. 5 people 5 different meals and 4 out of 5 were made wrong.. 2 of the 4 were made wrong twice!!! They can't even toast a muffin! They burnt it 3 times.. and then they didn't even give us any kind if discount for the bad experience!! It's making me put a star.. but they don't even deserve one!!!!! Will never go back!!"}
{"text":"Five of us went to this restaurant only because it was close to the Tropicana hotel.  There were 2-3 waittresses working and the restaurant was not busy but service was SLOW.  One of us had to get up and ask for coffee refills.  Someone wanted to order crepes but the waittress said they were out but blinzes are available.  So that means the crepes are frozen and not fresh!  I am not expecting alot from Coco's but crepes are made with about 3 ingredients and the cooks can't make them from scratch?  The food we did eat was bland and dry.  If I could give it zero star or 1/2 star, I would."}
{"text":"We used to go this restaurant over two years ago and usually 2 to 3 times per week.  The service at dinner time is bad, bad, bad.  Poor management and only one waiter or waitress.  We try to go back once or twice a year, hoping it gets better.  I enjoy the food and it is in the neighborhood.  I can understand why they don't pack them in anymore.  Seems like corporate would look at these reviews and make sure the service is brought up to par!  Won't be returning for at least 2 more years.  And that is probably only a MAYBE!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is dirty.  The plate my food was served on was dirty, our waitress's apron was dirty, and the booth we sat in was dirty; it left a huge grease stain on my daughter's pants.   This place is disgusting."}
{"text":"Yeah!  This wasn't Denny's.  I appreciate the quality of the food. The deserts were fresh. Just a bit slow in getting food as a cook called off.  It's that deal...we will be back for more. I had the cinnamon roll French toast. It was awesome."}
{"text":"We stayed away from Coco's for a couple of years, due to HORRIBLE service at the 7th St and McDowell, and bad service @ the Priest & Elliot one. We have started going back to them recently. We went to this one today for a late breakfast. The service was a bit slow, but not as bad as we have seen. The food was delicious! The coffeecake is wonderful.  In general, we have learned to not expect great service at Coco's, but that the food will usually (mostly at least) make up for it."}
{"text":"Bottomline up front: Service is terrible, slow and the buliding looks a little run down.  Once I did get my food, which was over 20 min it was good and hot. I had the Seafood platter and I have to say that it was good, not the best but if your coming in from the hotel and need something to eat, dont go here if you dont want to wait."}
{"text":"Utter crap.   This being part of a chain, I honestly expected better service and quality (although I think I was the only one unhappy with my food).   Our group of 6 walked in around 1, so it wasn't terribly busy.  We were seated after a short wait, given menus, and left alone for a good ten minutes. The waiter came back to take our drink orders, delivered the drinks, then disappeared for another twenty minutes.  TWENTY minutes, really? I mean, I can understand that there were only three waiters on the floor at the time, so maybe they were just busy.. Nope. There were about four other tables with guests at the time, so that's almost a ratio of 1:1. Plus, a table that was seated after us got their food before we'd even ordered ours. That kind of thing always, always irks me.   We finally placed our orders (I wasn't too TOO hungry, so I just asked for a \"buttery croissant\" and a fruit cup...yum). Everyone else's food came out before mine...and they all seemed to love what they ordered.  Then the waiter delivered my croissant. It was toasted to the point where it's realllly brown, really brittle, and pretty hard. Not very buttery at all. The waiter asked us if there was anything else, and I asked about my fruit. Another five minutes to get that...BUT in the end I wasn't charged for it. I figured he probably forgot to put it on the original bill since he didn't serve it until I asked, so I was pretty glad...I didn't want to get charged $2+ for a tiny cup of fruit (I'm talkin maybe ten chunks of watermelon and cantaloupe).   So after we paid our bill, we went our separate ways; my friends back to Minnesota and Wisconsin, and me back to California. And that was when it hit me: the bubbleguts. Imagine getting horribly, violently sick on a 300-mile drive with only two rest stops on the way. Yeah...it was bad. But while I was stuck doing the head-ass-toilet dance in a Target in Victorville, I suddenly wondered if the fruit was free because it had gone bad. At that point, I wasn't quite so happy about it being gratis."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Coco's despite the not-so-good reviews. We were greeted by the friendly host as soon as we walked in.  While we just got dessert to go, from what we saw the restaurant looked a little older, but clean.  We ordered a slice of the raspberry swirl cheesecake and a piece of boysenberry pie. The pie was good and the cheesecake was even better. I would definitely go back and try out their dine-in service."}
{"text":"Okay, so it's Coco's ... we've all been there (probably sans gramps and grandma).  Nothing to write home about, right?  WRONG!    This particular Coco's far surpassed any Coco's experience I could have ever hoped for.  Everything from their amazing breakfast specials to their downhome service and friendly atmosphere, they really made a regular old breakfast in Las Vegas particularly splashing!  Yeah, so it's no Rio buffet or Wynn's elegant restaurant fusion restaurants -- but believe me, the downhome, local and genuine service along w/their yummy breakfast will make a difference.  Skip the damn lines at the buffets ... Coco's is where it's at!!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in here relatively late on a Saturday evening for a fast dinner for five, but it turned out to be nearly an all-night ordeal.  The service was just awful, what with an inexperienced waiter and staffing that did not match the number of people on a Saturday night.  Our order was simple- burgers, etc., but it took nearly a half hour to be served.  The restaurant is relatively large but only one small area was open to guests and that made it very loud and gave a crowded feeling to dinner.  When we did get our order, there was little or no  follow-up with more coffee, etc.  The evening was full of apologies and reassurances.  It may have been a fluke, but that evening, the place was not even up to  the moderate service standard at most Coco's.  The coconut custard pie was excellent, though, when it finally arrived.  I'd give them another try, I suppose, but there are lots of other places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this...I normally would never eat at Coco's but we needed to find lunch on Thanksgiving before our evening meal, so what can you do? Coco's was the only place we could find that was open. It took too long to get sat. Once we were seated, a very sketchy server took our drink order and never came back. We waited for about 10-15 minutes and watched four other tables get up and leave. Needless to say, we followed them.  I understand that Coco's is not an upscale establishment and that you get what you pay for, but this was unacceptable. I've had better service at Taco Bell. The place was dirty, unorganized, and a terrible place for anyone to spend the holiday. I mostly felt sorry for the people I saw there trying to enjoy a Thanksgiving dinner."}
{"text":"Where does one begin?  Sat ourselves at a booth.  Had to wait 15 minutes for someone to ask us if we would like something to drink.  Took for ever to order food.  Food came out individually over the course of 10 minutes....  The food order was wrong and it did not taste that great.  Here are a few things that you will experience when you go if you decided to go at all.  Wait 5 to 10 minutes to be seated...... Wait 5 to 10 minutes to get drinks ordered...... Wait 5 to 10 minutes to get food ordered..... Wait 5 to 10 minutes before you get all of you food to the table....  Not worth the experience...  Not worth the money....   OverEasy is far far better!"}
{"text":"I came here on the 30th for brunch with some friends. I got the ham omlette. I'm not a big fan of omlettes, but I got it anyway. It was good with the side of potatoes and pancakes. The service was good and the food wasn't bad compare to all the fast food junk we had for the week."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre & service was even worse. I've been to Coco's in Cali & remember it was much better than this. If you're eating at Sunset Station, do yourself a favor & choose a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Usually we have decent to good service at this Coco's, but yesterday it was pretty darn slow / below average / meh!  The food was still good though, but super filling! We both had the cinnamon roll french toast combo.... with eggs and bacon for me. Good stuff, just... super filling!  The coffee was just okay today.   Will we go back? Of course -- it's literally right around the corner from us.   It was a new server today that we've never had before, but food was still good."}
{"text":"Close to the house and a good place to get eggs in the morning the staff is allways nice but not fancy by any means."}
