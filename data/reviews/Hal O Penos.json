{"text":"Fundido style! Ok- we had a little bit of most dishes, including the sampler to see which items they do best at Hal's. The answer? Everything was so tasty! We will just have to get the sampler I suppose. Totally decent margarita. And chimichanga fundido style is ridiculously good. (I don't recommend the seafood one though)   Enjoy, I know we do."}
{"text":"Glad it's back! They a generous with the portions, the service and food is great and fast and they are reasonable and we have been eating there for 10+ years. They still offer the 10% senior discount a big help to those on a fixed income.   Ordered the #9 shredded beef taco, green chili burrito and tostada. Was excellent as usual.   Tried the special of the day the Fry Bread with green chili. Was not happy, the fried bread tasted like burned oil and the green chili pork was not good. I ordered extra cheese didn't see any of that on it either. I contacted them and it was handled professionally, so we will be back.  Weird note, they wanted me to bring the fried bread back in, I asked if that couldn't be excused so I wouldn't have to get redressed and drive back there. It was! If we would have eaten in, there wouldn't have been such confusion. They have to protect themselves from fraud, and I understand as a former food service employee it does happen. Cudos to Jerrie (sp) or Gerrie (sp) for handling the situation professionally.  Lastly I ordered the Shredded Chicken Chimichanga: Fundito style with extra jalapeño cream cheese on top. Delish as usual l!!!  Everything was special order, and it was all present and accounted for! A rarity anywhere today! Superior way to do things right.   Anyone who special orders knows the hell we usually deal with. NEVER a problem or attitude from the staff. Thanks again Hal O Penos for being our favorite neighborhood Mexican restaurant. Much rather help them the a 'Berto' 5 stars for deliciousness, prices, attention to detail, portions size and the excellent customer service.  See you next week!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there and if you want Mexican food on the west side, this is it!!  Great lunch special and their salsa is WOW, the best.  I recommend it as a top of the list for the best Mexican food.  YUM"}
{"text":"The neighborhood staple is back in the neighborhood!  Count me in for a #9 Red, maybe Fajitas, a Chile Relleno, or an excellent Taco Salad!  There isn't a dish you can go wrong with here."}
{"text":"Their food is very good, MOST of the time. I don't really understand the inconsistency with their quality of their food. I'm assuming one of their cooks isn't trained the same as others. When the food is good, it's great. When it's not good, it's terrible. Luckily it's good most if the time.  But, with that said, try their cheese crisp cooked extra crispy. So delicious."}
{"text":"man chasing theses guy's all the time hopfulley they stay hare for for a long time because there food is always on point and they are going to start serving beer Finley check them out and get there special hot sauce don't know the name of it but it's the best ever"}
{"text":"Place is horrible and the owners are so rude. They yelled and screamed at us. Never going back again."}
{"text":"After a very bad experience at there last location on 51st Ave & Northern I thought after reading a good review on Next Door maybe things had changed. Well I wish in would have gone with my gut feeling and stayed awsy. I got a been burrito deep fried Enchlada style and wife got a red chillie burrito we each ordered a taco 1 beef 1 chicken we were going to share out burritos. The red chille tasted off but thought it was just us. The bean burrito was okay nothing great the tacos were very oily. About 4 hrs latter we were both very sick. Throwing up and running to the bathroom. We had not eaten anything else before this.  The place was very old looking inside. I used to love this place years ago. It's not the same and I will never go back."}
{"text":"This place is great! The service was fantastic. The food was delicious and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Been going here for years. Today was the worst. No jalapeños in the cream cheese. Taco was soggy. Salsa had a strong taste of vinegar. Sour cream was bad.  The rice was good. I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Had a less than okay experience. In the past we order chicken faijitas and are pleased. Tried two other dishes and neither of us liked our meals. One waitress for entire restaurant, harried and abrupt at that. Agree with another reviewer that the restaurant could use a good cleaning and sprucing up. Kind of worn and shabby look. Not eager to go back."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed. Very good food. Good staff. Glad to have them back in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went here with friends tonight after trying to find it in Google search. I found 3 addresses. Very  confusing. It is located at 3515 W Northern if you want the correct address. The food was yummy and HOT! Not luke warm like many other places, but oven hot. LOVE IT! Had the cheese Enchiladas and the mini chimi appatizer, both wonderful. Great place, delish food. Will be back (Now that I can find it)"}
{"text":"This place had closed at a different location and opened recently at this location. This location has had several different types of restaurants mostly Asian. As each new place opened no updates were done to the old dirty rundown walls, carpets, booths, etc. And Halopeno's unfortunately did not think cleaning, painting, repairing, and updating mattered either. The walls are dirty as are the carpet. The booth table tops are worn and chipped. The booth seats are worn and torn. It is the same old worn stuff the past several failed restaurants had in their place. If this is how they take care of and present what the public can see I hate to think how dirty the area are that we can't see, like where they cook our food. And let's talk about the food. Chips appeared out of a bag. Salsa was forgettable. The food, I had a Burrito and my wife had Chili Relleno. Neither of us wanted to finish our meal. With so many Mexican restaurants with environments that will enhance your dining experience instead of ruin your appetite and have you wonder if you might get food poisoning, why go here. And really, the food although not terrible, was just OK. Filberto's just across the street that is a drive through has much better food. There is absolutely no excuse for a restaurant to open in such a run down dirty condition."}
