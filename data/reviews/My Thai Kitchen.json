{"text":"This has become our regular spot for authentic Thai cuisine. The servers are pleasant and helpful in making menu choices. The whole fish and cashew chicken curry along with a green mango salad all make us happy.   P.S. There's usually lots of metered parking N. on Montgomery."}
{"text":"Order from here every week. The spicy lamb is intensely complex, delicious! Every dish is wonderful. There shrimp rolls to start are a real treat."}
{"text":"Flavorless rolls that tasted old and stale. So-so chicken curry, could get it anywhere but not be ripped off by ten bucks (realized when we got home). The only reason this joint is still alive is because of the area it's in. Lackluster, dead in the water, overpriced junk."}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering delivery from this restaurant. Although our order arrived very quickly, we found two pieces of hair on the bottom of our plates. When I called the restaurant to let them know and to be more cautious when prepping food, the woman was apologetic, but what's done is done.  If you plan on ordering from this restaurant, the food was actually quite good: pad Thai, basil chicken, spring rolls, and mango salad. But the green curry was watery and lacked flavour.  Unfortunately, due to the hair incidences, I won't be ordering from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with a bunch of work colleagues.  They have set lunch menus that include soup or salad and a spring roll for $8.95.  Food came pretty quickly which is important for a work lunch!  Spring roll was crispy and tasty.  The hot and sour soup was tasty although a bit more watery than I like.  The veggie pad Thai with veggies was also watery.  I see a theme here.  Veggies were basically a pile of chinese Napa cabbage and some carrots.  Watery pad Thai is not a good thing.   Pad thai soup is not a top seller.  The curries with rice looked better.   Will try that next time.  Apparently they will make a veggie curry for you if you ask.  Would have been nice to know this at the front end...."}
{"text":"Given that there is really only this place or the Thai Express in the food court across the street when it comes to thai food in this area, I'll give this place a passing score.   I came here to take advantage of their lunch special. For $8.95 I got 2 spring rolls (normally a spring roll and salad or soup) and a large plate of steaming hot pad thai, fresh from the kitchen. Overall, it was all good as everything was fresh made. Admittedly nothing really stood as amazing, but I left full and satisfied about the $10 + tip that lunch works out to, so I'll come back again."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service.  The inside of the restaurant is very clean and the tables are pristine. Each table has a table cloth and cutlery, glasses all layed out and neat.  Not your typical wooden tables and chairs china town type of place.  Our waitress was very friendly and quick. She took the time to explain the dishes and make sure our spicyness level was just right. My friend and I both ordered the chicken in peanut sauce dish.  The dish was perfectly cooked with alot of very fresh veggies, and not overly peanutty like when places but too much peanuts or peanut butter in their sauce.  We both had a beer, and the bill was under 30$.  You get what you pay for in this above average Thai restaurant in the west end."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've ever had...Was out with my wife, we ordered the shrimp chips, chicken spring rolls and tom yum gai soup to start and for mains we had the cashew chicken and basil lamb...Each dish just kept getting better and better...I'm a huge fan of tom yum soup and this was the best I've had to date...Highly recommend coming here!!!"}
{"text":"Nicely done interior, super-friendly and attentive staff, delicious food and very reasonable prices -- I think I found my new favourite lunch spot!  You can just feel that the owners put a lot of effort into the place, which gives you that warm fuzzy feeling inside when you leave (or maybe that's the chili peppers!?)."}
{"text":"I really, really like this place; it's small but very clean, bright and charming.  I went with about five colleagues for lunch and the food was outstanding.  I had the spicy chicken with steamed rice + spring roll and hot and sour soup.  My boss had the chicken pad thai special and it looked really good.  Everyone's food arrived all at once, in decent time (which is important as we had to get back to work), piping hot, delicious and the service was very friendly.  I think I paid about $10.50 (tax + tip included) so it was quite reasonable.  I definitely plan to go back soon!"}
{"text":"So here's what I'm going to tell you, and you can make up your own mind:  I wanted Pad Thai.  The thing is, the only Pad Thai they had was the Tiger Shrimp Pad Thai.   So I ordered that.  I'm told I could have said, \"no shrimp,\" but would that have really worked out for me?  I don't know.  But I didn't.  I went in looking forward to picking out all the unwanted shirmp they gave me.  Here's the thing - I split this between three people, and there was no shrimp.  Not one piece of shrimp.  When we finally went back through the dregs at the bottom, we found one.  ONE piece of Tiger Shrimp.  I guess Shrimp Pad Thai literally means one piece.  And for me, I was happy.  But, man, if I had wanted that shrimp, and that's what they gave me?  I would have been more than annoyed.  Also - kind of expensive.  But, that's to be expected from most Thai places these days.  That being said, I'd expect shirmp in my shirmp meal at other places."}
{"text":"They have another location at 1675 Bloor St W - close to Keele Subway. I found this at lunch time, it is hiding between a pub and a rock bar.   Their food is really awesome and I had a spring roll for free, just because they wanted to be nice to me (restaurant was empty, etc).   I ordered a Tom Kha Gai - chicken soup - it's CHEAP and delicious. I'm addicted to it. The waiter had some fun with me trying to speak \"Tom Kha Gai\" correctly. Obviously I can't speak thai and she could ;)   I wonder if they have delivery, it would be awesome to enjoy their food on a rainy Sunday without having to leave home."}
{"text":"Aside from the Thai paintings and decorations that adorn the walls of My Thai Kitchen, the friendly servers wear elegant floor length dresses that are reminiscent of the Singapore Airlines uniform (sadly, that is the closest I have been to real Southeast Asian fashion). The food, although rather small in portion size, was delicious.   A petite appetizer of shrimp chips with salty shrimp paste dip were a nice gratuit beginning to the meal. My friend's surprisingly pale pad thai was reported to be mild yet flavourful, unlike so many butchered tomato paste-reliant versions that are served in this city. My request to substitute the chicken for tofu in my pad woon sen resulted in generous triangles of not too crispy deep fried tofu, but only two medium sized shrimp on a bed of flavourful stir fried glass noodles.   The basement bathrooms are decorated and some of the neatest and cleanest I've found in an affordable restaurant in a while."}
