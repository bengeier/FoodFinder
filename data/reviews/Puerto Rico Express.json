{"text":"Truly comida Boricua, great customer service, and super delicious!!! Perfect for foodies, seasoned Boricua cuisine diners, and those new to Boricua cuisine."}
{"text":"It was delicious and juicy.. we had puerco  frito with white rice and beans. Plus steak sandwich and beef empanadas. Bomb.com!"}
{"text":"Authentic puerto rican food that is fresh and not frozen like another puerto Rican place in town. We tried the chicken fricasse and the flavors reminded my wife of her mother's cooking. We just wish it was hotter and with a little more chicken. Definitely going back to try literally everything else they have, yummmm"}
{"text":"I am proud Puerto Rican and can honestly say this food is as close to my Mammas home made food as it gets. The Arroz con Gandules are on point. The green garlic salsa is amazing. I poured it on everything. The portions are very generous. It is a must that I go here anytime I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price! Big portions, my husband and I could have split the cubano after we each had a beef empanada. Their green chile sauce is AMAZING. I stepped out of my food comfort zone and chicken fricasse, which I've never tried, I wasn't a huge fan, but my husband liked it!"}
{"text":"Good customer service ,great music playing and tasty Puerto Rican food...i will come back for more ..im in a food coma now lol ;)"}
{"text":"Everything we got was absolutely amazing, so much flavor! The guys who were working were very friendly and the customer service was great! I am obsessed with the spicy salsa, I've been thinking about it every day since we ate there. The flan was the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Beans and rice and beans and rice!!! And boyyyyyyy these were good!

Now there is not whole lot of vegan here, but who cares! Those BEANS!!!!!!

The plantains were bomb and their hot sauce is to die for!

Now I'm all about garlic but unfortunately theirs is more like an oil chutney. I drained off the oil and ate the garlic. 

If you could eat beans and rice everyday 3x a day...go here and get them BEANS!!!! 
They have a lot of love in them.

Owner is very sweet! Check out my pics!"}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall that has no indoor seating--like a kiosk.  Has stools near the outside counter where you order.  That being said, this place is the bomb.com.  They put out delicious, authentic PuertoRican food in plentiful portions at a good price.  
We had a mofongo with crackling in it.  The side broth was not as flavorful as it should be but it was good enough.  We also ordered an alcapurria and an empanada.  I loved the empanada.  The alcapurria was made with yuca and I prefer them with masa (green banana masa not the corn masa).  But they were craftily made for what they were.  We ordered the chicken breast with sautéed onions with arroz con gandules.  Excellent. Fresh and delicious--and the chicken was tender enough to cut with a plastic fork.  The rice was nicely seasoned and fluffy.  I hate sticky rice.  
The service was super friendly and accommodating.  This is a place you want to stop by when you are in Las Vegas.  It is on the northern part of the strip near the Stratosphere Hotel.  They have extended hours too.  
Don't miss out on this great food for little money.  They have been open for only 10 months so this is a place that needs your patronage to keep open."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and eat here!!!! I've been to Vegas many, many times and never knew this place existed! From the people who work there to the food, this place is completely authentic(I would know, I'm from PR). Eating here took me back to the trips I would take with my grandpa to the island. Tastes just as good as the places you'd find on the rural roads in PR. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very happy to finally have a PR place in town. Although the carne inside the pastelillo was a bit on the salty side, the food is pretty decent. I would for sure come back. I still have so much to try. Since it was my first time, I only ordered the arroz con gandules and pastelillo de carne. If you mess that up, I won't come back. They passed the test. My friend ordered mofongo,  which I tried. It was pretty good. Nice and garlicky. Just wish they added more chicharones inside as it was kinda empty."}
{"text":"Wow!  First time here and had the mofongo with lechon asado!  Amazing!!  Alcapurrias were delicious!  Will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Best stop for Puerto Rican food in Las Vegas. Price is very reasonable, I can tell you as I lived 5 years in Puerto Rico. This is truly Boricua food, the Mofongo and the Fried Pork chops are to die for..Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great prices and location! Arroz con gandules was a bit undercooked with some hard grains, tostones were just ok, the chicken and steak sandwiches were bomb. The mofongo was also ok and the empanadas were skimpy on the meat. My mother liked them but thats because she prefers only a little meat versus me. I would go back again to tey them out, they just opened up so they may need to just wlrk out some kinks, all good though. I'm happy to support a small business especially a Boricua owned one! Buen provecho a todos!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service.   We went next door to Dino's to grab a beer while we waited for the food to be cooked.   The roasted pork was so delicious.   I don't mind having onion and garlic breath if the food is this good!"}
{"text":"I hate giving three stars because I feel I should be supporting my people but the food was just OK. There was nothing that made their food stand out and wanting me to go back. I ordered arroz con gandules, lechon, mofongo, and alcapurria. The rice was bland and I had to add salt at home. The lechon tastes like crockpot lechon. The alcapurria was OK but a little too bland for me. The mofongo was good but it tasted more boiled than fried. I will be giving them another shot but at this point it's hard to compare to Sofrito Rico's food."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Decent prices. Didn't like all the bums/drug addicts in the area though. Took the food to go."}
{"text":"I just order from there an orders a beard steak and I didn't get the beard steak.. I'm very upset ! Because I just order from there just yesterday and got the same thing that I didn't order tonight! I wish they had a number so I could let them know for 2 nights I didn't get what I wanted."}
{"text":"Very good taste, however the chicharrones de pollo were not crispy and full of bones, the maduros could have been better and the alcapurrias were aweful! The tostones with garlic were amazing and everything is made to order, so be ready to wait.  The rice with pigeon peas had good flavor but the texture could be improved. Loved the Malta?"}
{"text":"The food is great but the Cuban torta was way to salty for my taste I had a couple of Cuban torta but it's not for me. I wouldn't reconsider. The pork chop with yellow rice .. the rice tasted old and the pork chop needed more flavored... but the desert was excellent"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The roasted pork sandwhich is awesome. Crispy, juicy and all around yummy."}
{"text":"Delicious Authentic Puerto Rican food cooked homemade by real true Boriquas!!! Plenty of choices. Fresh hot so so yummy!!@ Thank you Angel & Miquel"}
{"text":"I am impressed. These guys are authentic Puerto Rican food, not Americanized whatsoever.  I'm Puerto Rican and I can compare it to traditional food stands in Puerto Rico. But these guys have superior customer service and are friendly and treat you like family.  The bistec encebollado was to die for. And I give them credit for not raping you on traditional Las Vegas prices."}
{"text":"I'm from NJ/NYC & this is truly a taste from home. Portions are generous and my tastebuds are very happy. Hands down the best Spanish food I had in Vegas since I moved here years ago. Thank you and please don't leave!"}
{"text":"Had the Cubano sandwich and it was great! I wouldn't say it was the best I've had but it was dam good. The spot is cool, the cook/cashier was super nice, and to top it off, they allow you to grab drinks from the bar in the same lot to go with the delicious food!"}
{"text":"This place was so delicious! We came here because the other place we had wanted to go was too busy, and so we took a chance at this place and were pleasantly surprised. The food is flavorful, hot, fresh and fast. Awesome roast pork sandwich and amazing Cuban sandwich. We will definitely be coming back. Glad we came here!"}
{"text":"Found this place on the strip and loved the food. Very authentic great flavors.. had the pernil chicken fricase Cuban sandwich empanadas and flan.. can't wait to go back glad theirs competition in this town finally when it comes to puertorican food!!"}
{"text":"My first time here and the food is wonderful. I absolutely love it! I ordered the Chicken Fricassee with yellow rice for $7.95!"}
{"text":"It's a take out place a few outside seats. The churrasco is overpriced for the location, they should have alcapuria and other frituras. That's was the negative but the positive is the mofongo is good I had it with pechuga ala plancha my hubby had it with chicharrónes de pollo. I will visit again when in Vegas"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! There are some vegetarian and vegan options. The rice and beans, empanadas, mofongo and Cuban sandwich are some of my family's favorites. Save some room for desert! Flan is so yummy. The place is clean and service is prompt. People there are friendly. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Hate to say I was expecting more flavor from my order of rice but it was bland. Wish it was better :("}
{"text":"I love right across the street from Puerto Rico express. I've been to Puerto Rico and this is defiantly authentic food. I always get the arroz con granules and tostones.  The empanadas are also on point. And the price is good for what you get."}
{"text":"BOMB! So flavorful. Absolutely amazing. Highly recommend! 
Got the steak sandwich is it was delicious. Will be returning every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Stopped by here to grab a quick bite to eat hoping to catch some of the flavors of the city. I've got to say that the food here is solid. I ordered a chicken sandwich and let Me tell you, it was pretty dang solid as far as sandwiches go. The ingredients blended amazingly well. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good bite to eat! Only catch is the minimal   seating, while there are stools to the left of the window, there really isn't of a place to actually sit I only see that as a slight drawback. Happy eating."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. This place is so Amazing! It's an authentic Puerto Rican stand that reminds me of being back on the island. Food was yummy was craving it the next day. You have to try the coconut flan it's the best! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"If you come to Las Vegas and feel like eat Puerto Rican meal. Here is the spot for the carne frita, pork chop, pernil, mofongo and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, flavorful and (can't think of a 'f' word for affordable)! Had the chicken stew thing with creole sauce for about 8 bucks. Amazing taste and very tender. I'll be back anytime Im around this area hungry or not"}
{"text":"The best in town! Never tried a lechón like that one! The wait time is perfect 15 min for a FRESH meal worth! Thanks guys for the hard job that you are doing!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend who is Puerto Rican says this is the best Puerto Rican food he's eaten besides home cooked meals. Why isn't there be a place like this is San Diego?? I would definitely frequent this place often if I was living in San Diego. We had a Cuban sandwich, mofongo, tostones, alcapurrias, Habichuelas Rojas, and a Malta of course. Be sure to make the quick stop here while on your visit. It's a small stand which a few stools around the outside to eat, but it's definitely a to-go type of place. Looking forward to stopping by again on our next visit."}
{"text":"I've never tried Puerto Rican food, but I do know good food when I taste it! 

Puerto Rico Express is a little \"stand\" outside of Dino's on LVBLVD. Viva Arepas and The Goodwich both used to occupy this small space, so they have tough shoes to fill.

I've never had Puerto Rican food but I found they use a lot of garlic and the flavors are very subtle and savory- not too much spiciness or acid.

The main parts of the menu are sandwiches and then a meat plate- there's about 8 choices on both sides. I was most interested in their plate entrees because I like rice and beans. They have chicken, steak, shrimp, and pork chops. Each entree plate comes with traditional rice and beans or you can upgrade for two dollars and get mofongo which is mashed plantains with chicharon or fried pork skin. Although I'm a rice and beans guy I went for a steak with grilled onions plate and a mofongo upgrade. I also tried their empanada with spicy garlic sauce and a pineapple soda.

I did eat this outside at like 110 degree weather but I really liked the food."}
{"text":"I'm still in the middle of recovering from and reviewing a road trip involving massive amounts of food, but when one of my best friends invited me to dinner tonight, I couldn't resist. The deliciousness of the food made it even better.

Puerto Rico Express is the latest occupant of the shack on Wyoming and Las Vegas Blvd. I've had so many great experiences eating at this place, mostly during the fabled run of the Goodwich that culminated in their subsequent relocation to a true brick-and-mortar not too far up the road, and the ghosts of past meals loomed mightily as I parked in the familiar tiny Dino's-adjacent lot.

As with the past occupants, there is one window for order and pickup. The metal stools are still here too. The kitchen space is still mostly if not all flattop grills. The counter space for those who would dare to eat outside in the desert heat have been slightly expanded. For the most part, it's a familiar sight if you've been here before.

The menu comes in both English and Spanish, and it is surprisingly vast, with five sandwiches, eight \"specials\" (served with a side of some sort of rice, or a +$2 premium substitution of mofongo and chicken broth), various sides, and even a couple of desserts. I was initially going to share some chicken dishes with my friend, but I got pretty involved into my own order and let those go. He seemed to like them though.

Here's what I had:

Empanadilla Carne / Beef Empanadilla ($2): the best bite of the meal was my first. Crunchy shell around a misleadingly small yet ridiculous pocket full of ground beef and juices. You can't not like this unless you somehow hate beef in general.

Mofongo ($4.95): my first taste of this dish which is almost interchangeably associated with Puerto Rican cuisine. Green plantains were mashed into a consistency that's soft, not mushy or chewy. Pork cracklings aren't crunchy but I'm sure lent flavor. Fresh garlic topping was kinda insane. Wish it'd simply been crushed and mixed into the rest of the mofongo. This came with a piping hot chicken broth that simply added richness.

Sandwich de Bistec / Steak Sandwich ($6.95): this hefty sandwich is highly reminiscent of a steak torta. The beef is tender and the bread is crunchy from the flattop, but it doesn't get in the way. Lettuce, tomatoes, Swiss, grilled onions, are all delicious. For better or worse, the mayo dominates the flavor profile after a while. I would veer toward slightly better.

Chuletas Asadas / Grilled Pork Chops ($8.95): when I asked the cashier, she said that she preferred this to the Lechon Asado (Roasted Pork), so I made it my choice. Two big pork chops come with your choice of rice. I went with white rice w/ red beans, and I realized a bit too late that there really were no beans in this for some reason. At least the rice was seasoned and not just some boring bystander. I'll probably try the yellow rice and pigeon peas next time anyway.

Regardless of the starch support, you're getting two pork chops in this bad boy, bone-in and all. I was fortunate that I got home before dealing with the bones because I always clean off the bones, and that can get a little messy. The pork chops were definitely tender, properly seasoned, and simply delicious. The grilled onions were crunchy and made for the perfect garnish.

Flan (~$3): I was definitely eyeing the pie de pancha, aka passion fruit pie, but they were out of that at the time. However, my buddy Bronsen picked up the flan and shared it with me. Nice caramelized crust, thick and creamy flan, and delicious syrup at the bottom all contributed to a wonderful rendition of the custardy dessert.

This wasn't an altogether perfect series of dishes, but I was definitely pleased with my meal at Puerto Rico Express. I'm sure I'll be back to try the rest of their menu if and when the heat lets up a bit."}
{"text":"I ordered mofongo and it was very yummy! But the real winner here is their Cuban Sandwich!!!!! Best Cuban I have ever had!!! So much meat which was flavorful and juicy! Very filling also. I will definitely be making a stop here on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Great little gem. There's not many options for Puerto Rican food in Vegas. This place just opened and I can say the food was really good. We are from Puerto Rico so we know our food. Had chicken fricasee with white rice and beans, my daughter had grilled pork chops with white rice and red beans, yummy! My husband had a tostadas con queso and one beef empanadilla. Everything was very tasty. The are located in a corner in Las Vegas Boulevard. The prices are awesome! They close late. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get a quick bite to eat. I expected a little more flavor because I know what it should taste like. It didn't have that extra flavor I was looking for. I would go back though, and you can beat the price. I still want to try other dishes from the menu."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I absolutely love the empanadas! They're so delicious. I love both the chicken & the beef! My favorite place to get Puerto Rican Food! I highly recommend Puerto Rico Express! It will be your favorite too!"}
{"text":"The pernil was good!  Everything else was a waste of money we had rice and pigeon peas blah it wasn't mushy or soggy but it wasn't Puerto Rican (flavorful)!  Rice and beans wasn't good.  It's a weird location.  They have a few bar stools where you can sit and eat.  They had Malta Oh yea!"}
{"text":"Great Customer Service. Food is authentic and reasonable price. Mofongo with lechón is my favorite! All is Great! Thank you for the traditional food away from the Island!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious , authentic and  large portions. We ordered the monfongo with chicken and the flan. We will definitely be coming back. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I love to support my people so I had to check this place out. The food is horrible and has no flavor. They say they don't sell pasteles because it's too much work. The Alcapurrias don't have no taste. The Arroz con gandules is ok but the steak had no flavor either. They don't sell cola champagne and to top it off the customer service is BAD. I'm not sure how this place has good reviews or 4 stars lol please cook better and represent us Puerto Rican's the right way. We only have two places in Las Vegas who sell Puerto Rican food. DO NOT TRUST THESE GOOD REVIEWS Stay away! This food has no FLAVOR"}
{"text":"I've been all over but this hidden jem was amazing! Everything we ordered was \"the best I ever had!\". Seriously! I had the camarofongo which was extremely fresh and delicious. My kids loved the sandwiches and their arroz con gandules tasted as good as my Mamas!"}
{"text":"Delicious !!! Very kind people who you can tell make the food with love and care about making their customers happy. I feel like they cook with the same passion as if they were cooking for their own family. We had the lechón asado, mofongo and empanada, all delicious. Even their plain white rice was delicious, the beans were packed with flavor ! 
Will definitely be back again next time we visit from Utah"}
{"text":"Food was OK... a bit overpriced I thought. Seating outside only...in WINDY Vegas not a good experience. Friendly staff, food was descent...but needs indoor seating. Hot dog stand setup deminishes the otherwise descent food."}
{"text":"Don't dismiss this little corner shack when you are walking or driving down The STRIP.  The Mrs. and I had some really cheap and good tasting Puerto Rico foods.  The beef empanada, mofongo, and pork plate with yellow rice we ordered were some of the best Latin foods we had ever eaten. Make sure to ask for extra garlic/olive oil sauce, very addicting. Friendly and fast service at the walk up ordering window.  No hesitation in visiting again when we come back to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"MOFONGOOOO!!!

When I hear about Puerto Rican restaurants, I can't help but get excited over mofongo. I only know maybe 2 places that serve Puerto Rican food in town. Thanks to a friend from PR, we found this place...where Goodwich used to be (small shack at the same lot as Dino's).

Lechon Asado:
Roast pork. Nice, tender and a bit smokey. 4/5

Mofongo:
Green plantains mashed with garlic and chicharon - best eaten when freshly made and still hot. Re-heating does it no justice. Their version is really garlicky just the way I like it. Soooo good. A side order may be slit between 2 people because it tends to heavy once it hits your belly. *buuuuurrrrp!* 5/5

They have chicken, fried pork (also good), yellow rice, tostones, etc. I have to try the other menu items instead of sticking to a pork dish + mofongo.

This place is open til about midnight. Expect to wait about 20 minutes or so as they make your food to order."}
{"text":"This place is amazing better then the Puerto Rican spots in New Jersey! Love that there is a authentic Puerto Rican in the middle of the desert and their prices are unbeatable for the quantity and quality. Highly recommended if you're tired of Mexican food at every corner."}
{"text":"I was hoping for a little better since really good Cuban sandwiches are harder and harder to come by in Las Vegas. The sandwich was pretty good but perhaps a little greasy on the outside. I ordered it with extra pork which was not needed. In the plus column they use sliced pork not pulled and real Swiss cheese not that gooey tasteless Swiss American."}
{"text":"A friend of mine, who is from Miami, referred me to this place after hearing me complain that there are no good places in Vegas to get a decent Cuban sandwich. Yes, it's labeled Puerto Rican express but they make possibly the best Cuban sandwiches in the valley! They're not close to my side of town, which is probably a good thing for my bank account, otherwise I'd go broke spending all my money on their Cuban sandwiches... If you're craving a good Cuban sandwich, please go here!"}
{"text":"Arcapurias, mofongo, and ariz de gondules were all delisiouso. Prices very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food.. Seasoning was great and the service was great.. If I visit Vegas again I will definitely come here again!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how long they have been here but Wow! 
I lived in Puerto Rico for 2 years and this place is the real deal if you want to taste what Puerto Rican food is like come here. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Wow!..munch..munch..Wow!..munch..
What a blast of flavor from this yummy tiny walk up location! Green plantain chicharrones seasoned roasted pork garlic garlic sauce and I had to add some sweet plantains..Oh Baby!!"}
{"text":"Booooomb!!

Woke up a little hungover today and hungry!

Puerto Rico express saved the day!

They do not shy away from garlic and I cannot be mad I love it!

The Cuban sand which hit the spot it was crunchy and filled with porky goodness 

The tostones are awesome Garlic sauce on top. 

All for $10 and some change. 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Had my heart set on some Tacos El
Gordo and found this magnificent little gem.   The sandwich de lechon was incredible and the flan was so creamy and amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great food in the neighborhood. Honestly some of the best empanadas I've ever had! Great salsa. Amazing sandwiches. This place is amazing!"}
{"text":"They catered an event with some of their delicious tostones and maduros with different sauces. It was a hit! The price and flavor could not be beat."}
{"text":"Most flavorful place I've eaten. Had the fried pork chunks special, steak sandwich and beef empanada. Everything was absolutely amazing. Will definitely be coming back and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"In you're not on the island and you want some \"Puerto Rican soul food\" done right, this is your place. It's just a small shack on the side of the road, but the food is right and the people are nice. My wife and I had Chicken Fricassee and Carne Frita with arroz con gandules (yellow rice and pigeon peas) and Tostones (fried plantains). It tasted like my Abuelita's cooking and that's saying something!"}
{"text":"Love this place way better than any other place around town, I wish their prices were a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Great food, I was happy and excited to see this place. I had to pull over with my entire family and support our people!

The alcapuria and empanadas were delicious! The Malta was cold and refreshing. I hope they do well. I will stop by again before I leave Vegas."}
{"text":"Today I visited this place for the 2nd time and it did not disappoint. The food was exceptional, the portion were generous, and the prices are fair. I'm not Puerto Rican but being from Miami I enjoy Carribean food. I've been living in Vegas for nearly 16 years and this food definitely reminds me of home. I would highly recommend this to anyone."}
