{"text":"Actually served this owner at my previous workplace so I thought the experience would be superb but boy was I mistaken!!!!  This 1st time I ordered was about mid May 2014 and the person I spoke with on the phone was highly unprofessional and made me feel like I was doing her a disservice by calling in an order. So I brush it off I mean this is cleveland and good service is almost impossible here.  I order about 50$ worth of food for me and my children and was told the wait time would be 45 minutes so after about 2 hours I call and ask what is delaying our food and again get treated like an inconvenience by yet another employee.  I guess they were so busy they had to have the owner come in and help ( I was under the impression being busy was a good thing) so I spoke to this owner George who I served many times at my previous restsraunt and he assures me that my food will get to me hot and delicious well let's just say when it got to me it was anything but. My wafer fries were cold and disgusting and my cheese sticks were cold as well (yum). Go figure lol. Well before we got off the phone George told me my next order would be discounted.  Fast forward month. My hubby has to be at work at 5 pm so we decide to grab a bite before he goes.  Me and my great ideas want to give Mr hero (ride and denison) another shot because maybe they were just having a bad day? WRONG!!!!! I order 1 roman burger 2 large wafer fries 1 order mozzarella stocks. And she argues with me saying the 9 weer never gives discounts. Twenty five minutes pass after I had already ordered and the grumpy girl says (We ain't got no mozzarella sticks you gone have to order something else) no explanation no apologies just straight up rudeness. So I order buffalo wings hoping the food might just arrive before my hubby has to leave. 45 minutes pass and guess who calls back? yep you guessed it they have no wings either. The \"manager\" I speak to says that she is tired of me ordering complicated items and that if I 2 on accept something \"easier\" that I can just eat somewhere else. Wow I almost list it but I am a mother trying to set the right example so I ask if the owner could kindly call me back. (oh yeah I end up canceling my order ) when he finally calls me he said that 8 his own words \" he cannot find good help in the ghetto\" and that he will not do anything because he simply does not care. I believe him about not caring because it was quite evident in his tone and verbal demeanor.  He also argued with me saying he never offered me any discount . This place is is a joke and unfortunately had deterred me from ever eating at any Mr hero no matter the location.  My advice if you're thinking about eating here DON'T."}
{"text":"As a person who grew up in the Cleveland area I went to Mr. Hero quite a bit. Over time I noticed the price increasing and the quality of food decreasing but I love their hot buttered cheese sandwiches. Two times again there was hardly any cheese or butter on the sandwich which was more than a disappoint...vowed not to go back. Then I had a taste for the sandwich about two weeks ago and asked them to make sure to put enough cheese sauce and butter on it which they did and it was great! Now today, I hit the three strikes your out rule. I will not go back again. What a complete disappointment! I again asked if they could make sure enough sauce was on it. Not only was there not enough cheese/butter/sauce on there, the bread wasn't baked, the meat was burned on the ends (see pics), and when I went back in to ask for more sauce they said they put the butter on the buns all the while the woman who was talking to me was also on a personal cell phone call. I finally said never mind and left.  I called once I got home to get the corporate number. The Indian guy who answered hung up on me. Then I called back 11 times with them either picking up/hanging up the phone or not answering it. Considering there was nobody in the store at 2pm I can't imagine them being so busy they couldn't answer the phone. The fact that the guy hung up after I asked for corporate number, wouldn't answer the phone, etc.. REALLY solidified any thoughts of ever going back to this or any other Mr. Hero. When paying over eight dollars for a meal this price includes a certain level of service which doesn't include hanging up on a customer asking for a phone number then not answering or answering and hanging up right away.  I found a number on the web which I think was corporate. The woman was really nice and apologetic. It is too bad they don't have a quality assurance program that actually evaluates the product and quality of service/experience the customer is receiving.   What a shame........I am only giving two stars because I used to LOVE their hot buttered cheesesteak but as stated above, they aren't what they used to be."}
{"text":"Best location. Clean, friendly, fast, & always good. I only get the Romanburger but they don't have an issue customizing an order."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches in the world!!! The best meats. The best breads. The best veggies. Every time I drive by my girlfriend just raves about the roman burger and the curly fries with a giant load of cheese. She loves this place. Some times I wish she had as much respect for me as she does for Mr. Hero."}
{"text":"Ordered a 10\" Roman with double patties and came home to find they had forgot the the double patties that I paid for. Returned to store the next day and they would not refund nor just add extra patties to my new order. New order was messed up and had to go back again (Wrong sandwich and a hair stuck to the cheese on the wraper) to where the Store Manger decided to flip out and talk to me like I was a dog. I was told I WAS WRONG AND THAT SHE WAS TO BUSY TO FIX MY PROBLEM. I told her I would be calling corprate and she said verbatium \"GO AHEAD YOU AINT GOT NUTTIN ON ME ITS YOUR FAULT\" and \"Your husband should of came and ordered his own food insted of sending you\" all of this took place inside of a very busy store with a line of customers. I ended up walking out with my $17 dollars worth of food with a hair in it that I definatly was not eating nor my husband. I have tried calling the store several times to speak with the owner or get information but they ethier do not answer or hang up on me."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. The people working here are some of the most rude people I have ever met. All three workers were on the phone when we walked in and \"Rose\" the cashier was texting on her phone the whole time she was taking our order. Wouldn't even look up from her phone. Get it together. You are better then this Mr. Hero. Hire someone that works and fire Rose."}
{"text":"Wtf is this crap they were laughing at us and they got our order wrong. They could have put jiz and toenails on the burger and it would have been better. Would not recommend one star. PS they are cuntbags there DO NOT GO THERE IF YOU WANT TO BE DISAPOINTED LIKE I WAS."}
{"text":"Kitchen's behind. No big deal.  Staff is nice but being forced to watch wolf Blitzer while waiting is torture."}
{"text":"Ugh! Didn't get my food yet and already sorry I came. Wasn't sure what I wanted, as I've never been here and the menus aren't very descriptive. Woman behind counter wasn neither helpful nor patient. Now the ENTIRE time she's preparing my food she is screaming in a foreign language at somebody on the phone and practically in tears. Sorry for whatever is wrong in her life, but it's kinda impossible to enjoy your food with so much drama. I would have left by now if I hadn't paid for my food when ordering.  I ordered a cheese steak and waffle fries, which were tasty, but certainly nothing special."}
{"text":"Back home in Cleveland for the weekend and there aren't any Mr. Hero's where I live now. So, I had to have a Romanburger before we went back. We got in there at about 9:15 pm....they close at 9:30 pm. I have a rule that you never go to a restaurant right before closing. This is for many reasons, but mainly because they're trying to close up and get out of there and serving you is the last thing they're thinking about. I had to have it though. Anyway, there was a lady in front of us that ordered a hamburger with turkey on it. Hey, it might actually be good...probably not though. When her order was ready she did not respond when they announced it as a hamburger so they handed it to me. It threw me off because I ordered a Romanburger. About a minute later (still waiting for my wife's order) they realized their mistake and the lady freaked out and wanted fresh fries. The owner was a little irritated because he didn't think the fries were cold. As they argued back and forth, my wife and I just gave each other that, \"you know you're in Cleveland when\" look.  Nonetheless, my Mr. Hero fix was satisfied with a 10\" Romanburger and waffle fries. Yumm-diggity.  Funny how you always want what you can't have. Went here every blue moon when I lived here."}
{"text":"I like this place, the owners seem like good people and you get your food quick.  Make no mistake this fast food so don't expect a 5 star meal.  I usually get the Roman Burger and the waffle fries and it is consistently good, no complaints here.  The location is good and they keep it pretty clean.  Overall for a Mr. Hero they do a decent job."}
{"text":"The owner and the manager  of this establishment is very rude, mean, never smiles doesn't care about the customers even the mr hero on 18 in medina I took a family members in for lunch. The female counter person never smiled did not care about the customer u name it. We even had to clean are own table from other people mess.       Water on the floor in the dining room not one single employee offered to clean it so I had to do their work. Oh that not the only thing a family member found plastic or something from the employee in her sandwich. I could of notified the health department to have both locations shut down."}
{"text":"Worst Mr Hero I've visited. The owner is a cheap jerk! They screwed up my order by putting tomatoes on it when I said no tomatoes. I was at work by the time I realized it and couldn't eat it because I'm allergic to tomatoes. The only way he would give me credit is to bring it back right now. When I said I can't now because I'm at work he acted like I was trying to get over on him over a $6 sandwich. He was totally unprofessional and rude. Me hero is my favorite sandwich place to eat but I'll drive to w 117th for now on instead. It's much cleaner me hero anyways."}
{"text":"I love Mr hero and I'm not sure why I never think of going here. This location is the original location for Elyria and in desperate need of a facelift. But it's always clean when I stop in and the crew is very pleasant and I've always been super happy with the speed and accuracy of my order. So I'll continue to make this location my go to"}
{"text":"Food was prepared fresh when i order .store was super clean and staff is really friendly. Best mrhero in town."}
{"text":"Dirty inside. Employee who can't add when I ordered a 7 in Roman meal for $9.00 there was a special I didn't see 10 in Roman meal for $8.05 she said oh well it's about the same price.  I said no it's 10 inches and less.  Then the guy mopping the floor used hand sanitizer and then went and cooked the food without putting on gloves."}
{"text":"My favorite Mr Hero sandwich is the Romanburger. Can only find these in Ohio, and usually the first thing I get en route to my hotel. It is a perfect combo of a cheeseburger and an Italian hero. While I am not a fast food junkie, these are quite addictive. Many friends that have moved out of state also talk about having these when visiting Mentor. I happened to stumble upon a copycat recipe and it helped when I craved a Romanburger, but nothing beats the real thing. The seared deli meats, over the burger patties with cheese, then tomatoes, white onion for that little zing, and just right amount of Italian dressing or sub dressing with just a tad of mayo. Greasy goodness all at once.....SOOOO good! This location is always super clean, and staff very friendly. Looking forward to my annual visit already.  I remember when Mr Hero was originally around the corner from current location. It was always a fave for me eons ago"}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with a hot buttered cheesesteak!  There are some better locations, but gets the job done."}
{"text":"Apparently you love it or you don't. My husband grew up with Mr. Hero or my reference is 'that romanburger place'.  I'm a big fan of burger and fry joints, this place just doesn't do it for me. The romanburger is basically a cheeseburger (not a great one) with a piece of ham on it and for some reason, I think that's this places biggest draw.  Now, if my husband or in-laws were to read this review, I'm sure...rather, I know, they would beg to differ with my rating."}
{"text":"This Mr hero has the best food but the guy who works in the front as the cashier I'm sure he has to be the owner or close to him cuz he treats the cooks like crap screams yells and had my 6 year daughter scared very poor service will probably never go there again."}
{"text":"So I went to this mr. hero last Monday... the sign said they close at 9 I got there around 7:30 and the doors were locked. Employees inside just looking and my mother and I trying to open the doors. I was so confused because it was so early and I knew they weren't supposed to be closed. So disappointed because this is my favorite location. Lost customers for sure."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks sooooo good . Completely new look, fresh and modern, it all comes together. I think they have a new owner. The staff is very friendly.... will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Don't eat here!! They don't deserve your money. The owner is this rude old Indian man. He's very unfriendly. I went there today and got food for myself and my sister. I told him it was to go and he said, \"Yeah I hope it's to go.\" I am a larger person and he was making comments about my weight and how he hopes I'm not eating the food by myself. I'm sorry, but it's none of your business and your comments are not appreciated. The more I thought about it I wanted to get my money back and just leave, but I couldn't get his attention until he handed me my order so I left. Never eating here again and I hope more people will follow. They're extremely over priced to begin with. And anyone that treats customers like that does not deserve to get business."}
{"text":"Haven't been in here in years and heard a commercial on the radio and had to go get a romanburger.  The manager at this location is awesome and takes pride in his restaurant.  Nice job!"}
{"text":"I have been eating nothing but roman burgers from here since I was in high school! The workers are not so professional and ghetto but the food is always good so who cares lol"}
{"text":"The crew is always nice and knows regulars by name. Foods always made right after 2 years of eating at this location is have never had a order wrong or a bad experience."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero, I would. The old owner was great, whoever runs this place now has no place in the restaurant/food industry. Beyond rude. I will never go here again. I'm being polite here, don't give your business to them."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a hot Philly cheese steak to go, there is no better option in Streetsboro. The food is really good, however it's pricy, and eating there is almost guaranteed a bad idea. (call ahead and get it to go, try the Sicilian parmesan or the new chicken subs.)"}
{"text":"Just went here awesome place was very clean and they made the fries fresh no old fries here food was put together and not thrown together and they have churros yumm"}
{"text":"I'm posting a review for positive karma. I realize they're a local fast food chain, so whatevs, since they don't exist near my hood. It's nothing spectacular imo, so take it or leave it. It's not the worst i've had, and there are equally mediocre fare within walking distance. Food: 2.5 out of 5  Kudos to the friendly dude at the counter. Order was correct and he made sure we were good on condiments, utensils, napkins, etc. Service: 4/5.   The dining room looked relatively clean, and the place was empty. I didn't look to closely because we got ours to go and there's no drive-thru. Vibe: 3.75/5  It's a change if you're looking to expand your rotation from BK McWendys or Dunkin Queen."}
{"text":"Yum! Nothing better than a greasy cheesy sandwich that is made on a grill that has been getting seasoned for at least 15 years now...mmm..so good! Everytime I am in Cleveland,  I make sure to stop by here for my hero fix!"}
{"text":"1 star only because I could not give them a LOWER rating. First visit ordered a Phillie CHEESE STEAK which I asked if they could do one the same as their chicken phillie they said Yes got home it was just a plain deluxe steak no green peppers. Ordered a cheese cake and didn't get it. I didn't complain or anything figured we all mess up sometimes as I myself work in food service and once upon a time actually worked at a mr.hero.  I live in mentor but the closest mr hero is in mentor on the lake not a long drive but a long drive for just some burgers. Don't care if they have aROMAN BURGER or not I never cared for the Roman burger nor has anyone in my family THERE FOR I WOULD NOT ORDER ONE EVER!! So this time I took a different approach I ordered a DELUXE STEAK WITH GREEN PEPPERS the girl even repeated it back to me and said \"you want the deluxe with green peppers right ?\" And I said \"YES\"  order is ready she repeated the whole thing back to me but again forgot the cheese cake but at least I remembered it before I got home. So I leave get home and as my father took a bite of his DELUXE STEAK WITH GREEN PEPPERS he proclaimed! \"WHATS THIS IS THIS YOURS? It's not what I ordered!\" Lo and behold they gave us a ROMAN BURGER I called the store and told the person who took my order that they gave us a Roman burger which she quickly replied \"THATS WHAT YOU ORDERED I REPEATED IT BACK TO YOU\". How do you get ROMAN BURGER OUT OF DELUXE STEAK?!!!  I was told to come back and bring the sandwich with me and they would give me another sandwich but now because I have to waste more of my time and gas to go get the sandwich they should have made in the first place now all my food is going to be cold and nasty reheating burgers in the microwave is not recommended by ANYONE I KNOW they are pretty gross to say the least. But I told them I'm on my way. When I got there I gave them back there sandwich which they promptly checked the bag to see if I did indeed bring it to them the girl said he's going to make it \"NOW\" seriously they didn't even start making the replacement one yet!! So I'm waiting a couple minutes and she comes out of the kitchen and says \" YOU ORDERED A STEAK SUB RIGHT?\" Once again I said \"YES A DELUXE STEAK WITH GREEN PEPPERS\" she does something on the register and goes in back and I can hear her tell the man what next? Do I charge her for it??  EXCUSE ME!!!?? Your asking if your going to charge me AGAIN!! for a sandwich you never gave me after taking the wrong one back?!!!! Luckily the man in back said \"no\" if he had said \"yes\" I would have went ballistic!! So once again I get my sandwich go home give it To my dad and he takes a bite and it was a deluxe steak with green pepper but of course I guess they charge xtra to \"GRILL\" the green pepper!!!!!  Seriously ?? Yeah right I want a deluxe steak with GRILLED onion GRILLED mushroom and RAW green peppers!!!  And these idiots say the work to hard they want $15.00 an hour.  Can't even get an order right and on top of that any business would have AT LEAST appollogized but I guess they don't get paid enough to do that either!!!  MORONS TOTAL AND COMPLETE MORONS!!"}
{"text":"We where told by a local this is a must eat while in Cleveland. While to food is just ok it is a different experience for anyone visiting out of time but needs a fast food time restriction. They smaller style sandwich are a nice change of pace from pizza and burgers."}
{"text":"It's true I grew up in Cleveland and you cannot find this fast food restaurant anywhere else.  I'm addicted to the Roman Burger to the point that I've ordered it unassembled to take back to Chicago to make fresh for all my friends.  I've even attempted to re-create it many times with moderate to good success.  If in Cleveland you must try this sandwich and I most definitely want to hear your thoughts??????"}
{"text":"Mr hero is good but overpriced. However, this store itself gets a 1 star. The woman at the counter said some very sexist things about the food I was ordering, then the wrong food was cooked...needless to say, it didnt leave a good taste in my mouth.  if you dont care about that or the price, go ahead and eat there. Otherwise, theres another one literally a mile up the road."}
{"text":"The hogie I got was just lack luster, I wouldn't call it bad, I wouldn't call it great either.  I wouldn't say I'd make a second trip to this sandwich peddler."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in town I need my Romanburger fix! Wish they had these in the mid- Atlantic area."}
{"text":"This Mr Hero is the best!!!!!! Love the people that run this place.   So kind and polite. Recommend everyone to eat here"}
{"text":"After going next door to Skyline Chili for my wife, I decided to go to Mr Heros and get a sandwich. I ordered a large Chicken Philly sandwich.  The lady at the counter was friendly and engaged in some small talk while we waited for my order. The restaurant seemed clean. The only thing I noticed that needed attention was a table being leveled off by napkins and the baby high chair that seemed well used and dirty.   My sandwich didn't seem to be up to standards. The chicken was chewy and didn't have very many green peppers. I would probably try them again."}
{"text":"Just ok, it was prepared kinda sloppy. Still don't know why the prep area is behind a dark piece of glass, what are you guys trying to hide?"}
{"text":"Pretty good fast food but nothing amazing. The staff was nice. The place was clean. Plenty of parking. No drive thru. Good prices."}
{"text":"The Kent Mr. Hero is well executed and staffs some of the friendliest employees in the city.  The food is prepared fresh with much love and excitement.  My sandwich tasted great along with the sides that I ordered.  Despite making the sandwiches fresh after you order them, the wait time was no longer than 5 minutes.  Amazing service, amazing quality.  I look forward to going back every time."}
{"text":"Walk in and place carry out orders. No dining room available. Has been there for at least 25 years. Quick service. Nice people. Yummy Mr Hero food!"}
{"text":"Do not go here. bobby the owner/manager of this store tried to ask me not to use my discover debit card and use something else. When I could not pay with something else. He rang it out with an extra $0.50 charge to my card without telling me and tried to forget to give me the receipt until I insisted. That my friends is bad business, he tried to pass the fees onto the customer. I did get my $0.50 back although I had to confront him about it. Not only this but I ordered a Roman burger BTE which is supposed to have the thicker/bigger burgers and I was given a regular sandwich for the same cost. This business is shady do not go here."}
{"text":"Negative 1 star. First time ever at a Mr. Hero. Smelled if grease upon entrance and food was just as bad. Gross."}
{"text":"OK, so unless you're one of those unreal people who don't think Mr. Hero is delicious, you know damn well this stuff is delicious. You know, those folks who swear they never have a cheat day here or there... whatever. You know they're lying.   Because Mr. Hero is stuff dirty dreams are made of...  Is it the most non-sketchy food choice you can make? Probably not. But this location rocks more than any other weirdo one I've been to. Why? It's big, clean and has lots of seating!   Whether you Romanburger it (holy caloric intake for the month, but worth it) or you get the hot buttered cheesesteak (holy cow) you're in for a treat. And if you even get those wafer fries without the cheese sauce, I'm not sure we can be friends.   Make it your one cheat meal for the next year or so. Go hard or go home."}
{"text":"Overall, I love Mr. Hero. For the decade I was out of the area I craved it. From a corporate standpoint, they really need to work on their franchise management.  Be forewarned that if you order here you have to specify size or they will charge you the most expensive way possible. They will even give you generic straws to save a buck (branded ones of to the side).  While my order was made when I placed it, the ingredients were not the freshest. Somehow this store managed to make a good turkey sub completely bland. Waffer fries were good, as was the nuclear hot cheese sauce. Person taking my order made me feel rushed, as if annoyed I wanted to order.  Store is clean overall. Plaza is on the sketchy side (especially after dark). Usually has a beggar playing some sort of instrument."}
{"text":"Called for pickup order, 5 min away. Done on time and good Roman Burger. 2 for $8, great deal."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is great and the food is amazing. They just newly remodeled the place and it looks beautiful. If you're in cleveland and have never tried mr heros, I would highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Waited 15 min for a sandwich. The lettuce smelled bad and tasted putrid. Lemonade served warm with no ice. Worst sandwich ever."}
{"text":"Mr Hero can save anyones taste buds with its delicious options! I loved eating here from time to time. The cheesesteaks are so good whether beef or chicken, they do such a great job doing their best Philly impression. Their trademarked romanburger is awesome, please go look at the website to see what it looks like, always a great choice.  For sides I LOVE their waffle fries with cheese sauce, mmmm mmm. Then the breaded mushrooms are worth a try if you want something different you can't always find at some places.  They do have cheesecake for desert that has a great rich flavor. As I right this I really didn't appreciate this place as much as I should have when I lived in Ohio. Talking with people I grew up with, we all loved Mr Hero, but we never raved about it for some reason? So I guess this review is giving it some due justice from me. What a great place, wish I had some right now1"}
{"text":"This Mr Hero in the plaza by Dollar Tree, is the best one around. The one behind Parmatown Mall, is disgusting. The one on Stumph is so-so, the employees are usually not friendly and the place looks dirty.  I always go to this location. The person behind the counter is always friendly, quick to take my order, the food is always good. I also appreciate the cleanliness of the dining area. They always decorate for the season, they have a tv on for guests eating in or waiting for their order.   Highly recommend this one!"}
{"text":"Meh. First time at this chain. It was alright, I guess. The cashier seemed to hate her life. My gyro was just okay. The Texan Fries, or whatever the side dish is called, were incredibly bland and disappointing."}
{"text":"The Roman Burger - that's all you need to have! I miss them oh so much!"}
{"text":"Went there for a Roman burger after not having one for several years and it was not a good sandwich.  You could barely taste any meat.  It was all lettuce and oil.  It wasn't the old sandwich and was a total disappointment.  I will never go back!"}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving this location a 1 star heres the reason why. I came in after a very long time to give this location another chance. The first time I was back it was the same people working which they looked kind of shocked. Well anyways I got the same thing last time when they messed everything up for me. I got the 10inch cheese stake with the cheddar cheese sauce only no american swiss, and a I got the combo along with a cheese cup for my fries. The girl told me she had to ask her boss if they could do that which he said yes that wouldn't be a problem, and since I walked there I asked if they cared if I sat, and ate. She responds with let me ask my boss which he said yes, and she told me that they were closing soon which I knew that that's why I asked if it was okay.   Well the other day I went for a walk last week, and I had a taste for a cheese steak so I walked up there, and I left my house at 8.30pm a half hour before they closed, and got there at 8.45pm which was the same time I got there the last time. Well another girl, and I walked in she was asking if they were closed I told her they shouldn't be we have a good 15 minutes before they close. Well we walked in, and this moron with long hair goes we're closed, and laughs at us thinking its funny that we walked in to get food, and they were closed which this made me think that he started closing at 8.30 instead of 9 at night which I thought was dumb due to the fact that the customer is the boss, and is always right. When I worked at papa joes mentor, and eastlake if people walked in 1 minute before closing time we had to take their order. It didn't matter if we wanted to get out the business wanted the money so thats what we did. I see why they are always dead though honestly the fact that the guy laughed at us, and goes sorry we're closed okay dude you were just about to make money from the 2 of us sorry you're lazy, and don't want to work. My question is why is it all these people who are from India that are working at them.   Well today after taking a nap since I didn't get much sleep last night I walked up to mr.hero I told myself I'd like a cheese steak. I would go to papa joes since they are cheaper, but long story short the owner got the police involved he had them tell me that they don't want my business granted his wife made up lies about me, but thats besides the point since I don't want any drama I choose to come here rather than papa joes. So today I had a coupon for a 10 inch cheese steak which it was 2.50 extra for the combo. Well I walk in, and right away there is a indian girl who looks miserable doesn't say hello or ask how I'm doing. I give her my coupon, and tell her that I wanted to do the combo, and on my cheese steak I didn't want swiss american cheese on it I just wanted the cheddar cheese sauce. She looks at me, and says we don'g have cheddar cheese sauce. I pointed behind her telling her thats the cheese I want she says oh as if she was trying to play stupid. Well the cook told me he could give me a cheese cup, and I could pour it on myself. I told him that they put the cheese on there for me, and didn't want the swiss american. He tells me that it was going to be 12.50 for everything, and the girl was about the ring me up. I stopped her before she could, and told her I had a coupon for the 10 inch combo meal. She had the coupon in her hand the entire time she goes oh, and punches in my coupon. She then tells me that it'll be 10.50 which whatever just give me my food so I can eat, and get out of here.   I pay, and she goes in back after doesn't give me my cup or anything she starts doing other things when she came back out front I asked her nicely if I could have my cup to fill while I'm waiting for my order. She goes oh yeah here she was completely rude, and unfriendly. After I get my drink my food comes up she puts everything in a bag for me which she never asked me if I wanted my food for there or to go I thought that wasn't right. When my food was almost ready I saw the cook he had swiss american cheese on my sandwich after I told the girl that I didn't want that on there I just wanted the cheddar cheese sauce only, and I told her no other cheese. The cook was nice he went in back, and picked it off he came told me that there was only a little bit left on the sandwich, and if I wanted he would make me another one.  I respected that. Granted he should of made me a new one when the moron girl didn't take my order correctly. I wasn't going to get mad at him for that it wasn't his fault that people don't listen, and act like morons.   When my food came she put it in a bag, and handed it to me she didn't say anything like have a great day or anything like that she just said here. I thought that was completely rude since shes in customer service, and can't even be polite to someone even if she thinks they're being rude she. They should consider getting ride of her due to the fact that she is rude to people."}

{"text":"RECOMMENDED: Romanburger, \"Waffer\" fries with cheese sauce AMBIANCE: Trashed/depressing, even by fast food standards.  ...  (Disclaimer: this review is specific to this branch only.  I'm told the branch in North Royalton rocks, so maybe y'all should head over for a better experience.)  As a Mr. Hero virgin up till yesterday, I'll be generous.  The Romanburger, the signature menu item for the chain, is genuinely good. So good that it bumps up what would've been a 0.5 star review to a 3 star one.  Too much?  I'll leave others to bring it down--I haven't quite the heart to do it.  For fast food, the sandwiches here taste deceptively light.  The bread is lighter, fluffier, and much less dense than Subway's buns.  The amount of filler is also on the thin side--think, Wendy's-Jr.-Burger-thin, but if that burger were stretched to 7 or 10 inches.  Meals here can actually be light with a little portion control, which I like.  Half a 7\" Hot Buttered Cheesesteak and a third of the 10\" Romanburger, \"Waffer\" (waffle) fries with cheese dipping sauce filled me up just right.  (Ok, not exactly the smallest portion, but with a little bit more control, I could've done without one of the sandwiches).  The 10\" Romanburger (which can be ordered at less-intimidating lengths, ahem) features three, small, thin burger-esque \"Italian luncheon loaf\" patties as well as salami slices and swiss cheese on top of a bed of refreshing, vinegarette-tossed shredded lettuce, tomatoes, onions and mayonnaise.  The combination of the salami, loaf patties, lettuce and mayonnaise was exquisite.  The \"Waffer\" fries were crispy and surprisingly under-salted/seasoned, but perfect for dipping in the cheese sauce, which reminded me--no, tasted EXACTLY like Taco Bell/movie theater nacho cheese sauce.  Despite its tantalizing name, my Hot Buttered Cheesesteak was not so impressive.  That it came with grilled onions, mushrooms and swiss--I liked.  But the steak, alas, bore no resemblance to anything I've encountered calling itself steak.  While the Romanburger patties could've passed for actual burger patties, the product developers over at Mr. Hero's clearly didn't even try to hide the fact that the \"steak\" was anything but.  Fluffy, air-injected, thin-cut slabs of spam-like lunchmeat, dyed brown that had no business crouching there between the buns of my cheesesteak sandwich, waiting to ambush me.  Aghast, I turned to my fellow diners.  Where was my beloved paper-thin slices of juicy ribeye that mixed so well with gobs of melted swiss?    Certainly nowhere to be found in this depressingly forlorn, shadow-filled dining room, its ugly, crumb-spattered carpeting and stickily stained formica tables not doing much for the only decor for the entire joint: color-faded closeups of glistening sandwiches and burgers that clearly COULDN'T be ordered off the menu.  The entire place had the dismal air of a neglected Ross/Kohl's/TJ Maxx/Marshall's fitting room or recently sanitized motel room after a crime scene.  Except not so clean.  No joke.  (Some will claim that Mr. Hero bears a uniquely Cleveland taste and that the lunchmeat texture should be appreciated as such.  I call bull.)  Service was quick--but then again, we were the only ones there the first five minutes.  There were three workers behind the counter that we could see, yet the trash bins were overflowing.  I've worked in fast food before--there's no reason that should ever happen.  The rest of the dining room as before mentioned, was ill-lit and ill-kept.    If I ever come back, it'll be for the Romanburger, and it'll be for takeout, thanks very much.  Hot Buttered Cheeesesteak, may we never see each other again.  (Penn Station, just across the parking lot, offers a Philadelphia Cheesesteak that's only, oh, 10,000,000,000 times superior.)  If you decide to dine there, just make sure you know what you're in for--or if you're too drunk to care.  Otherwise, sitting on the curb outside if the sun's out might actually make you feel better."}
{"text":"Fairly new location so it's nice and clean.  Always take my food to go so I can't comment on the inside seating but I don't think I would want to. It's not separate from the ordering counter, therefore, everyone coming in and waiting for their food would kinda be in your face as your eating - no bueno.  The wait is about 8 minutes but I don't mind as it's semi fresher than eating McD's and the like.  I've only ever gotten the roman burger, waffle fries and the cheese sauce (which is better tasting than Chic-fil-A cheese). I do, from time to time buy their Bavarian cream churros - *dissolves into a pile of yes* So very good!  No complaints - good food, pretty fast service, and clean facilities = happy Bri."}
{"text":"quick service but what is with the elderly lady at the register? She ALWAYS has a frown and not very friendly..just her the look on her face is terrible.Will continue to eat there I'm just sayin"}
{"text":"For a fast food place this place has great subs.  The romanburger is great and as are the waffle fries.  The service is also great and easily the best of any Mr. Hero I have been too."}
{"text":"Joyce was the cashier during my visit. She seemed to be very irritated, or just tired of her job. I will let that slide, as we all have our moments but the store was not busy, only 1-2 orders were working in the back.. the reason for my 3 stars is the food was not up to Mr. Hero standards. The bun wasn't toasted, it was cold and crumbly and I think something was wrong w the cheese, it tasted plasticy. Haven't had Mr. Hero in a long time and was looking forward to it. Unfortunately, it wasn't that great."}
{"text":"I want to give Mr Hero 5 stars but it's just never consistent like it used to be the biggest problem is the famous Roman Burger they hardly put any of that sandwich dressing on sandwich. I had the buttered cheese steak today it was pretty good ! Come on the sandwich is supposed to be a little oily not dry! This location has a friendly staff and is a clean orderly restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I have to say a great loaction with good food. I mean it's not a 5 star meal it's mr hero. The builing is newly remodled and very clean. The employees are always friendly and curtious. The food is Mr. Hhero food. Not sure what anyone can complain about. The roman burger is spot on as well is the hot butter cheesesteak with extra mushroom. When you get a value meal make sure that you order a side of cheese. It is amazing with there fries. Also DO NOT do the extra dollar for the BTE it makes the sandwhich very sloppy. All in all a good meal."}
{"text":"Mr. Hero is always consistent and I can't get a Romanburger anywhere else! I can get a Romanburger....a Gyro....waffle fries...and more all in one place.  Its always cooked to order and always delicious....I just wish we had a few in LA. The price isn't bad and the service is always decent and get you on your way.  Consistent, good, and a few options to play with.....can't go wrong with that.....I always make sure to make a stop in here."}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches they make here! They are fresh, big and sooo good! The Italian is my favorite which comes with all kinds of good meats! I don't have one of these in Chicago by me so when I come home I'm sure to stop in here! I think it's better than Subway or Quizno's."}
{"text":"Place always clean, food hot and fresh....have to wait but well worth it when its hot and fresh..."}
{"text":"Hubby took me here and I wasn't crazy excited... However, the first bite changed my mind immediately. The bread is how bread should be, however rarely is. It was crispy and soft, the Italian-mayo sauce was complimenting the bread as well as the salami (I think that's what's in the Roman) and the beef patties that taste like steak... I'm beginning to salivate!! Lettuce, onion, and tomato completed this juicy perfection.  The fries are yummy with nacho cheese sauce and it's so cheap right now for $5.55 which includes a 20oz drink. I love that we live super close to Mr. Heroes. Definitely my new favorite fast food joint now!"}
{"text":"This crew is a well oiled machine! I love these guys! The food is always DELICIOUS, HOT and FRESH! There are several Mr Heros around me...I ALWAYS make the drive to this one...Kudos and THANKS for doing it perfectly! YUMMMMMMMMM"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Mr. Hero in YEARS.  Since there isn't one in my area, I rarely have the opportunity to eat Mr. Hero.  I have always loved Mr. Hero, so my visit was a treat.    This location was under renovation, so I will not comment on the décor.  The staff was pleasant and unusual for a fast food restaurant.  There were two ladies about my age running the place.  One was at the counter and one cooking.  It was not run by a bunch of high school kids.  They were knowledgeable about the menu items and very polite, sadly something that lacks in the current generation.   Mr. Hero sandwiches are a fresh, alternative to the typical quick service restaurant.  They actually COOK your order when you order.  It's not like other fast food operations that have food waiting under hot lights.  They do not use microwaves or warming trays.    Some of the signature items at Mr. Hero are the Romanburger and Hot Buttered Cheesesteak, along with other steak and burger products, chicken, a deli line, and variety of side items.    All I can saw is that I don't eat fast food too often.  I truly enjoyed my meal at Mr. Hero and I am sad I have to be so far away from home to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Zesty fries? Great Roman Burger? Fantastic Tuna buddy? GET IN MAH BELLEH  Seriously, mr hero's is good stuff.  Good for you? HEEEEELLLL naw, but it's so tasty you'll be smiling as the ambulance carries you away to Robinson memorial."}
{"text":"Mr. Hero is the one franchise in Ohio where you can rely on food nostalgia. The food here tastes exactly the same as it did when I was young. That's not very common amongst other fast food places these days. This particular location is one of the best in the Cleveland area. Extremely friendly service, super clean environment and excellent food. Some of the best Roman burgers around!"}
