{"text":"The first time I went there they were closed after I made a serious trek from.Brampton so I was a little disappointes. I went there yesterday and they were open. The decor is nice and very casual like a coffee/tea shop. Went through their interesting menu and ordered the Crepe burger and the person I was with ordered the ceasar chicken crepe. I have to say the crepe burger was Fantastic! One of the best burgers I have ever had. The meat was perfectly cooked and the flavors worked really really well. The owner Mohammed came around to introduce himself and that made the experience more personal which was also amazing. Definitely going back and definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"So heard a lot about this place from my friends in Markham. Being from Mississauga, there are plenty of places to choose from that are very good.  This place is nothin special. It was below average. As an example, i tried the burger crepe. It was dry, no sauce and when i asked three people for mayonnaise, no one came back to me to tell me that they have NO mayonnaise.  How silly is that? Lastly, the service was good, and the staff friendly. I would pass on this restaurant as there are way better choices in Mississauga and Markham.  Disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday, early afternoon on a Sunday for brunch. 2nd time coming here, and I can say the food is pretty good. Nice ambience, great options for desert, drinks and food. Definitely worth trying their chicken & cheese quesadilla! The only thing that may need improvement is the waiting time for ordering...but it's not a big deal. The owner is really nice and definitely made up for the waiting time with his customer service! This place can be compared to Demetres, except it's a lot better- as there are many more options and it's all halal meat!"}
{"text":"Been a customer since week one of opening and has been my go-to place for amazing savory crepes! I must admit that I've had a bit of a hit or miss experience here but mostly hits. Perhaps consistency might be the problem here.   Service has been a bit awkward at times but they are pretty accommodating (got the brunch menu items past the brunch hours).   Biggest selling point for me is the price; you can have a savory and dessert crepe (if you are a fatty, like me) for a little over 20 bucks.  Recommendations: Aztec (Veggie) Fusion Burger BRUNCH!"}
{"text":"This place recently opened up in Aug 2014. Went there with a couple of friends, and none of us liked our food.  We ordered 2 cheeseburger crepes, and one chicken ceaser crepe. The beef was hard, smelled strange, and was not juicy at all. The chicken crepe on the other hand barely had any chicken! It was mostly just mushrooms.  Even the glasses we received water in had a funny smell- they smelled like dead fish.   Also, our waitress was not friendly. Seemed like she did not want to be there. We did not finish our food and in fact, went to another restaurant afterwards because we were still  hungry! Will definitely not return!"}
{"text":"Passed by this place a numerous times driving my car on a busy markham road, and I figured I give it a try on a Saturday night. Place was a bit quiet for a weekend night, but a nice setting for a couple to dine. However with the weird dance music going on somewhat loud in the background, the ambience is ruined. Service was subpar with limited attentiveness though place was not busy. We ordered the $9 \"fettucini dessert crepe\" with two teas. The teas were average and tasted weak, but the crepes was just horrible. The only reason it was called fettucini was because the crepe was cut up as spaghetthis..what a joke. And not only that it was served cold with overload of artificial sweet sauces, they also messed up on our choice of gelato ice cream which btw tasted like a cheap supermarket budget brand of ice cream, non-gelato. The server gave us the additonal \"gelato\" of our choice thinking that it was a compensation for their mistake...but geez they had the nerve to charge us on the bill for the mistake they've made. For the crappy crepe, two overcharge of average teas, and an extra charge for the cheap wannabe mistake of gelato, we've got ripped off of $19 or so for bill (tips not included). It was the first and last time we've stepped our foots into this establishment. There are for sure other better crepe joints out there."}
{"text":"We recently visited with a party of 9. The entire dinner took about 2.5 hours !! To make it easier for them to accommodate a big group, i had made a reservation and was surprised to see that they were not prepared/did not know about this party of 9. 2 orders were wrong yet we were charged for both, and one crepe was \"forgotten\" and came after most other people of the party were well into their meal. Food is tasty but the service makes it hard to go again. Go with a full stomach as you can build your appetite during the long wait for food!"}
{"text":"I ordered a waffle but got a crepe that was $15. The crepe was not hot and there was wayy too much ice cream in it."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and brunch at the very least (have yet to try dinner and dessert ). Definitely not one of those cafés serving \"bland food\".   Had their fusion burger crepe (burger was juicy and the mix of spices was perfect) followed by green tea Sahara mint drink.  Will definitely revisit them."}
{"text":"Very bad we went yesterday and ordered chocolate lava cake it was not at all fresh my friends me me got sick n so much tummy pain it was my first n last time there my advice stay away from this place if u don't wanna get sick!!!!"}
{"text":"So, it comes as a shock to me that someone would want to open up a crepe restaurant in Scarborough. What's even more shocking is that it has stayed open since August 2014. Who eats crepes in Scarborough?    As a culinary adventurer, I am willing to give it a try, so, I took my whole family. The restaurant is located in a mini-mall that overlooks Markham Road. I must admit, I have driven past it several times and wondered what it was all about. In fact, I have almost caved and stopped to try it out more than once. The parking lot has ample parking, although the spots are kind of small. You have to ask about the free wifi.   The décor is done well and what you would expect for a high-end dessert place. I was surprised to see a big subset of patrons from individuals, friends, business associates, couples and even large whole families who eat here. What surprised me even more is the idea of a savory crepe has caught on and people are giving it up in lieu of what would traditionally be served on bread. The menu is 2 or 3 pages of savory crepes from the traditional cheeseburger onwards.   Our visit was solely for the dessert, here's what we found.  We were greeted almost immediately and were seated. On our way to the table, we noticed the non-crepe desserts which were on display, which were actually very reasonably priced.   Sweet Crepes - We ordered 3 sweet crepes and enjoyed them. We ordered the vanilla bomb, which had ice cream and fruit inside, the S'mores crepe and the fruit crepe. Each one was delicious in it's own right; however, we found that the crepe itself was very difficult to cut through, so much so, that we would rock the plate, table and floor but the crepe was immovable. The S'mores crepe used whole graham crackers on top of the marshmallows and chocolate. This made it hard and dry, when a sprinkling of crushed crackers would be enough.   We weren't told how the restaurant worked, for instance, the waitress knew it was our  first time and neglected to tell us that with every crepe order, we would only pay $2 for tea. Had we known, we may have ordered it.   The service here is lacking, other than the waitress not telling us about the discount on tea for every crepe, we found that the service was slow to get someone to take your order. The seconds turned to minutes, the minutes into hours, the hours into days, that's how it felt. So, hopefully, you have time to spend when you come here, otherwise, I would eat somewhere else.   When it was time to pay, we didn't want to risk having to wait another century for service, so, we approached the counter and were dealt with right away.   My summary: Flavour was excellent. Food needs minor work. Water had no smell as previously stated. Service was SLOW!!!! Price was high, considering their crepe price was 30% higher than their regular dessert price."}
{"text":"Would not return to this place at all. Warm drinks didn't taste like anything and the crepe was very overdone. Nice place but the food was below mediocre."}
{"text":"We were recommended to come to here by a friend. My friends and I were impressed at the savory choices they had and all of our crepe's were delicious. The waffle sundae dessert was really good! We also ordered a pistachio cheesecake however we weren't completely impressed with it. It was lacking something and the sauce they topped it with was not that great. But overall dinner and other desserts were delicious! I also got a waffle dessert to go for my sister and she loved it!"}
{"text":"Burrito Wrap and the Strawberry and Banana Crepe were amazing. Really good prices too. We really enjoyed it here. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This place is nicely decorated that's a plus. It's very nice ambience. I would love to love this place.  I think they revamped the place and menu since I came last. Looks great!!  The crepes are okay- how can you go wrong with Nutella and fruit. I'll tell you what- if you pay $14 for that crepe it's too much. We ordered a side of ice cream or gelato for my niece .let me tell you- the other gelato places around Markham stuff the cup--- not here.  It's decent food, a nice atmosphere but stingy portions of ice cream and a high price I don't know if it's worth it. The location is convenient I guess.   With lower prices, better looking pastries/cakes and a better gelato section maybe I'll give it another shot.   It's good- just too expensive. Knock the prices down by 5 bucks and you've got a better sell."}
{"text":"Just left a la crepes just now. The chef was NOT IN. So the waitress told us they were CLOSED. This is the 2ND TIME I have tried to eat here and they were closed when they should have been OPENED. how can you run a business like that? I am so disappointed.   ALSO, they never picked up the phone when I called beforehand to make sure they were OPEN. The waitress said she \"just got it\". Unbelievable."}
{"text":"They have a huge selection of tea and if you order a crepe, you can add a pot of tea on the side for just $2! I had the classic crepe and found it a little dry. My friends ordered a milkshake (delicious!), the hearty breakfast crepe (which wasn't very flavorful), the chicken Caesar crepe (decent) and the rocky road brownie (sooo decadent). I had high expectations for their crepes but it seems like their tea and desserts stole the show!"}
{"text":"I've been to A la Crepes twice now, everytime for a late night sweet crepe ($5-9/crepe). The decor is very nice, great for a date. Service could be a bit more attentive. Not a fan of seeing my crepe sit out getting cold for over two minutes while the server has a personal conversation with the crepe maker. I'm hungee! :( at this point my bf had to calm my melodramatic crying. Feed me! :'(  As for the crepes, the bf and I have tried a different one  each time. Highlights: S'mores crepe has an excellent flavour profile for those looking to indulge. It is stuffed full with marshmallows, chocolate and crushed grahman crackers. However, after your crepe cools for 5-10 min the marshmallows go from ooey-gooey bliss to chewy and tough (as expected). This should really be made with marshmallow fluff or homemade marshmallows.  Berry sensation crepe is really good. The berries are fresh and seasonal. The signature cream is foamy and light. Despite the warmth of the crepe it doesn't melt into a liquid, but keeps it's texture.   Teas! Lots of options, but all black teas. I would have liked to see a couple herbal teas, but the ones they do offer are all unique and come with helpful flavour descriptions.  Gelato! One of my favourite frozen treats. I am not sure where they get theirs from or if they make it themselves. However, both times I tried it I found it a bit icy. Perhaps this is due to the fact that there isn't a proper cover for the ice cream display. It's like a fabric roll screen instead of a glass door. The temperature in there definitely flucuates!"}
{"text":"delicious !! great service and fun ambience. the lamb was delicious but the pina colada smoothie was heavenly. the place is very cozy and is great for comfortable meetings with friends and family. i would definitely recommend this place to you !"}
{"text":"Order two crepes(strawberry/banana&berry) and 2 teas. Order took about half hour! The crepes were cold and thick  as if they had been sitting around. We told the manger about this and he explained that how crepes were suppose to be , he did not apologize  or offer to remake our crepes . We decided to just pay and leave. We had a horrible experience and would never come back."}
{"text":"I would give this place very high reviews based on the finished product....but when you show up and the cook isn't present, the mood is ruined straight away. This lead to an unnecessary wait time which was just filled with tea.  I shall return on another occasion to sample things off the menu, and hope to experience better customer service."}
{"text":"Had a great meal today evening. And the service was really good. Would definitely recommend it. The sandwiches are not too good but the crepes are really nice."}
{"text":"We arrived at a la crepe late in the evening on a thursday for some dessert. I loved the environment; very chill, laid back and with nice ambience. Our waiter was very informative and patient. The manager also stopped by our table to give us some of his personal suggestions. We decided to go with the suggestions: Chocolate Banana, Vanilla Bomb, and the Strawberry Banana Chocolate. We also ordered Jasmine tea to start which was delightful and a great opener to what we were about get. I have to say the Chocolate Banana suggestion by the manager was on point, it tasted absolutely heavenly! I would urge those who've never tried to go by next time and order it! I'm glad I found this little gem. I'd definitely go back in the near future for more dessert at a la crepes."}
{"text":"Read all the mixed reviews of this place, and decided to try it for myself.  First impressions of the place was it looked decent on the outside, looked like a nice cafe style establishment.   As we walked closer towards the entrance, we noticed the restaurant was pretty much empty, with only two other tables seated. The doors were opened as there was no A/C.  We were seated towards the back of the restaurant with he couches and immediately noticed how dirty the floors were. There were literally garbage (used paper napkins, food bits, leaves, etc) around the area.   As we sat, one of the two tables got up and left, I think I heard a \"this is ridiculous\" as they left. I noted that on their table were just glasses of water and unused cutlery.  I also want to mention, that the server who seated us and took our order, had probably the least amount of enthusiasm/energy I have ever seen on someone who worked in the restaurant industry. It seemed she'd had just given up and have zero care for anything that was happening.   6:20 - We ordered. Three iced teas: Mango Tango, White Champagne Mist, and Fruit Punch. Food wise, the Fusion Burger crepe, the Great Caesar Chicken crepe, and the Oriental Shrimp crepe.  6:40 - Our teas finally arrive. They were mediocre at best. Though it was refreshing in the humid heated atmosphere.  7:15 - 2 out of the 3 dishes arrive. Like come one, no way does it take almost an hour to prepare 3 crepes in an empty restaurant. What if they were busy, I don't think the cook(s) in this place would be able to handle it.  Fusion Burger: Nothing spectacular, it is what it is, a burger in a crepe.  Caesar Chicken: Flavor was okay.  Oriental Shrimp: Salt bomb. Saltiest thing I have ever tasted. The sauce used seemed like it was literally thickened soy sauce sprinkled with sesame seeds and they used A LOT of sauce. What I found funny was they provided a side dish of extra sauce, as if you'd need it with the soggy mess of a crepe. As if they were proud of this sauce. SMH.  Definitely will not be returning. Slow service, mediocre food. I don't see this place lasting."}
{"text":"Desserts are suppose to make you happy but I left this place with a huge :(   Apple peach iced tea $4 - tasted like medicine  Cappuccino $4 - luke warm at best and probaby because they added to much milk.  Molten Lava cake $9 - the cake was the size of a little cupcake and the center is suppose to be hot like lava hence the name but it was luke warm at best once again.  S'mores crepe $9 + $2 for a scoop of ice cream - basically a crepe stuffed with chocolate, graham crackers and marshmellows. Tasted terrible in my opinon and watching the guy prepare it with his bare hands made me even more disgusted.   Service was the only good thing about this place but there was only one other table being served. Price is way too high based on the quality they provide you. Just to compare I had an amazing molten lava cake the very next day at Canyon Creek for $7.95 - yeah...that's how disappointed I was of this place. I had to eat another molten lava cake the very next day just to erase the memory of the lava cake I had here."}
{"text":"100% Halal. That means the meat is slaughtered in the most humane way possible.   If you like variety, a trendy place to hang, and good service at reasonable prices, this is your place!  I came to this new restaurant for a late night dinner with a friend. We ordered the Fusion Burger Crepes and The Aztec Crepes, and two black teas.  Additionally we ordered a chocolate mousse and S'mores crepes for dessert.  Firstly, the place is decorated in modern trendy décor, from the lighting to the wallpaper.  There is a variety of seating options: barstool by the counter, tables, booths, couches at tables, and couches around coffee tables.  So if you want to sit with your family, you have the single tables and chairs, and if you wanna throw back with friends, you have the couches!   Yes, its a place for you and your boys, you and your girls, or the fam.  I've never seen such an extensive tea menu at a restaurant. So many options. It was fun to look through it.  The crepes and sandwich menu was also very cosmopolitan and extensive.  They had everything from Indian to Mexican to Japanese flavors.    The staff was extremely attentive. They checked in often, asked for feedback, and cleared the dishes promptly.  The orders came quite promptly and when we requested other items like hot sauce or honey, they brought it quickly.  The staff was very nice; everyone.    Food was great, tea was great, dessert was great.  So many options in the menu.  Interesting and exciting options.  The price was also reasonable.  $9.00 for the burger crepes, $9.00 for the desert crepes.  At this point, if you ordered crepes, a lil teapot of tea (about 4 tea cups worth) was just $2.00!!! You can't beat that!!!  Okay go there!!"}
