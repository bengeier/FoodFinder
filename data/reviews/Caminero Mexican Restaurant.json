{"text":"I love this place!  So much better than Top Shelf across the street and it's a good feeling to be able to support a local business!  My favorites are the chorizo breakfast and the chicken fundito.  The chips are great too.  The staff is friendly and always accomodating.  I will be a regular here as long as I live in the area."}
{"text":"Mexican food doesn't get much better than this. The fish tacos and shrimp burrito are both amazing as is everything else my husband and I have tried.  Caminero's is delicious, affordable, and quick."}
{"text":"Stopped in at the last minute, between the three of us we had a California burrito (very tender slow cooked chicken,  beans, cheese, avocados),  a carne asada burrito, shredded beef taco, cheese enchilada and chips/salsa. Not only was our bill less than $20, every single thing we tried was delicious! Not a chain, just a great family owned operation.  Not much on atmosphere, but we are there for the food! A must try!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and have been remiss for not reviewing it sooner.  Customer service is great, ambiance is great (given about 200 sq/ft of dining space) and food is delicious texmex style Mexican food.

I have only ever dined in at Caminero and a real testament to their awesomeness is the fact that I have never gotten my order before they fulfilled a takeout order.

Some might say that's bad customer service, but I look at it as though Caminero has so much takeout business that no matter what day I go in, someone else already has an order in. 

Similarly, I've never waited more than 10 minutes for food, so I can't really complain.  The menu is simple yet varied and I have never been disappointed with an order.  Even if I were, I'm sure they'd make it right; they once tried to comp my entire order ($30) because they had run out of shredded beef for my ONE taco and would have to substitute ground beef. 

If you're local and don't know about Caminero, go there.  If you're visiting, go there too."}
{"text":"This place is my only stop for Mexican food.  The food is always amazing.  I have turned my friends and family into it.  Always, I get excellent service, great food, and the essence of how a smaller restaurant should feel."}
{"text":"The BEST CHORIZO BURRITOS in town!! My entire family love's this restaurant.
My wife and I love the chorizo and bacon, cheese and potato  burritos.
My daughter love's their beef tacos and bean/cheese burritos"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews my friend and I headed over here.  We weren't disappointed. Very good food!!
Not a long wait either, as another posted. The employees were as really nice too. It's clean. I was happy with everything. 
I will definitely be back. I want to try the chimis!!!"}
{"text":"Love it here. Everything is delicious. Authentic Mexican food!
I work next door and eat there a couple times a week. My favorites are the chili rellenos and soft chicken tacos. But it's all really good. Especially the salsas."}
{"text":"Husband and I ate here for the first time.  Pollo fundido was very good.  Shredded chicken, which is always best. With a great flavor,  not dry. Caminero burrito, husband liked very much. Only bad thing is salsa needs some work."}
{"text":"Best best best !!!! So glad we found this place!!! Salsa is so good food is amazing!! Will be going there often!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for what it is. I always forget it's there. The breakfast burrito is bomb. Pretty good for a fast food Mexican place."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad. Little salty. But portion size was a joke. Their tostadas were so very small. Taco Bell is bigger. $4 for a pork tostadas.  We laughed when we saw it. Don't expect much lettuce. It was a dash of lettuce. I'm still laughing at how small it was. Only 1 other person inside. Will not go again."}
{"text":"This place has RUINED all other salsa, for me. In fact, it's ruined most Mexican food for me, since my husband and I compare everything to Caminero's food, now. 

The family that owns and runs this restaurant is so friendly, sweet and helpful. We tell everyone we know to visit this place and even had them cater our 10th wedding anniversary party (I didn't even get any food, because everyone else ate it ALL!).

My husband is here every weekday morning for breakfast (I'm more jealous of that, than if he was meeting another woman) and we've been known to eat here multiple times a week! 

Fantastic food, fresh fruit drinks daily, decent prices and excellent service. Oh... and stop ordering Christmas tamales!!! They're all mine!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food!  It's family run and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Been in Phoenix 20 years. This is the first place even close to the food in Tucson."}
{"text":"Let's just say I'm going to have to up my gym routine if this addiction continues. We have been here 3 times in 2 weeks!

I can't believe all of the money that is wasted across the street on bland food and bad service! This place is Peoria's best kept secret!"}
{"text":"Oh love... It's a good bond between a girl and a restaurant. I wish I could eat here all the time! The chips they give you are so yummy! They have an avocado creamy salsa makes me so happy. I love the chimichangas and there is a burrito similar to a chimichanga with chicken and a white cheesy sauce! During Christmas they make tamales... can you say heaven? :)"}
{"text":"Very good food at a fair price. Very friendly staff. I thought the salsas were a little bland. Recommend adding the bottled sauces they have to flavor and spice it up. The funditos are exceptional!"}
{"text":"Great local hole in the wall!  Food is great, the family is super nice and friendly.  Call in orders sometimes get screwed up but we just roll with it.  Much better than your everyday \"ertos\" drive thrus you come across.  The el pastor is delish!  Love the nachos and street tacos."}
{"text":"Really good place! The chips and salsa are delicious. Homemade tortillas. Will definitely be adding this into the rotation."}
{"text":"Menudo and chorizo burrito with potatoes were both very good.  Had a lime fresh water freshly made also very good.  Will for sure be returning and try the chilaquiles."}
{"text":"Iv been coming here since high school (10 years ago ) the food is amazing ! Always fresh and the family inside is Always extremely nice Im actually out front  waiting for them to open for breakfast"}
{"text":"Just ordered a quesadilla with grilled chicken and cheese. Went I got home and opened it up, it was nothing but cheese. I went back with my quesadilla but the guy was completely rude! He was completely defensive saying that we didn't order the quesadilla with chicken, and that we'd be charged extra. At first it was assumed charged just to add the chicken to the original quesadilla, but when rang up, it's was another $7. He wouldn't accept his mistake and make us another one free of charge. We've been customer for years and never have received such service as this. We did end up paying for it because what's a meal without meat, just wish I could take the tip I gave them after the first order! NEVER AGAIN WILL WE BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"The 3 mini tacos are Legen....dary!!!! If you like the little street tacos that you get all over the place in rocky point and really anywhere in mexico. You will love these tacos. Also the crunchy shredded beef tacos and nachos are unbelievable"}
{"text":"This place is one of THE best on the west side. Awesome mini tacos, carne asada burritos, chimis, sauces, rice, beans you name it. The people who work here are so nice and you won't regret eating here!"}
{"text":"Caminero is like my mistress. I wake up thinking about you. You make me happy and never judge me. You don't get mad when I cheat on you and when I come back into your arms feeling guilty you give me a big hug. I can even bring my wife around you, although I here she is now making solo visits and not letting me watch.

My latest hug was the Chorizo Breakfast burrito. Its the best I've had. Perfect blend of cheese, chorizo and eggs. The hug before that was the chicken taquitos, which might I say are hand rolled and very meaty, not from a box like that ugly whore \"Berto\" down the street.

See you soon my love."}
{"text":"Simple on the outside and delicious on the inside...just like all the best hidden gems wherever you go."}
{"text":"This was not the best place to pick!!! I can usually deal with less than best taste, and move on, but good service and cleanliness are a must wherever I stop at!!  It took at least 10 minutes before we were even asked what we wanted to order, (at the counter, mind you) and then the guy had no expression on his face.  He acted like we were a bother instead of a customer!  Well, I never!  In fact, I WON'T be back!!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and wanted some Mexican food. We found this place on yelp and it was very very good. I had carne asada rice and beans and the wife had cheese enchiladas. Nice portions the steak had a nice char was tender and juicy. This will be our new favorite for sure"}
{"text":"Great food! Good service amazing salsa. Love this place, my husband literally wants a burrito from here every other day"}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican place on the west side! My husband actually makes \"yum\" noises every time he eats their refried beans. He says they taste just like his mom used to make, and he's right. Great salsa choices at the salsa bar and everything is sooooo good!"}
{"text":"This is the best mexican food I have tasted in a very long time. We ordered the Asada burrito and the Asada Super Nachos and was very impressed. We will be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"This place has really awesome, quick mexican food. They have a lot of options on their menu and have a big selection of sauces. They even have a really spicy salsa that my boyfriend is obsessed with because its the hottest he has been able to find. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"awesome food but the place is super dirty, you have to go through the kitchen to get to the bathroom which is pretty disgusting but my food is always amazing I probably wouldn't recommend it for cleanness but good food."}
{"text":"I always order a chile relleno when trying a Mexican restaurant for the first time. Right or wrong, I use this one dish I like to decide if I'll return to try other items. It was one of the best I've had in some time. Served with rice (okay but not great) and spectacular beans, the relleno was simple and tasty.  I will return. Small but comfortable place."}
{"text":"Caminero is my favorite local Mexican dive.  The place is small and crowded with cheap tables, but the food is fresh and TexMex authentic.  I like the chorizo and eggs for breakfast and the chicken burrito is my default for dinner.  They do a fair takeout business, so don't hesitate to call ahead.  Skip the fancy and come for the food."}
{"text":"While the chimichanga tasted great, i had diarrhea for atleast a week. Place did not look clean. I lived in guatemala for a while, and i like street food, but this just looked dirty.  Their sanitation standards looked sketchy"}
{"text":"I've been back a couple times and the food has consistently gotten worse.  Last time I ordered a dorado taco and a carne asada burrito.  

The taco tasted like it sat out and they threw it in the frier when I ordered it.  The meat in the carne asada was burnt and stale.  It also must have sat out for hours.  

You can seriously get better mexican food at the filibertos down the road.  I wont be back."}
{"text":"What a dive, in a good way.  This is one of those run down divey places you will just love to go too.  The food was spot on, I had the chicken fajita tacos.  My son had the nachos and can't wait to go back-he is a very picky eater.  Four stars for they barely give you any chips and salsa, and it could be cleaned a little.  Dives are nice but it needs some spring cleaning.  Absolutely worth a visit though-not like it is just filthy."}
{"text":"Great cheap Mexican food in the area. Salsa bar, great pricing and they don't charge you for every little extra thing like annoying Mi Familia. Caminero is definitely a Mom and Pop style Mexican Restaurant with a understanding of mexican spices for flavorful food, which I appreciate, We are lucky to have family businesses that still care about what they're serving to their customers. I love eating the  Burritos, Chimi's , Nacho's and tamales that I stick in the freezer for a quick meal during the days I don't want to cook."}
{"text":"Menudo is bomb! Great spice to it, flavor is amazing! You do have to get there early, they tend to run out quick! Friendly service!"}
{"text":"Say what this place is not good at all. Please pass unless you liked over cooked and over priced Mexican Food. Never again will we eat this nasty food."}
{"text":"I love the tacos al pastor. Nice people with good food. Another solid recommendation is the fajita tacos."}
{"text":"I had the seafood enchiladas and they were delicious! We had just made it in from Montana for a visit and craved Mexican Food and this was just what we needed. My boyfriend had a smothered Carne Burrito and it was sooo good! Big too :)"}
{"text":"The burrito I chose was ok. It was asada with the pico de gallo and guacamole but it wasn't the best I had tried. I was excited seeing the reviews it had and how it was overall rated but was disappointed. Tortillas were t as good and the meat quality of the tacos weren't as good as well. I would come back and try something else maybe what I got wasn't good compared to something else they might have."}
{"text":"I looooooove the green chili here! My go to is always the green chili pork burrito. The meat is always tender here and the green chili to pork to tortilla ratio is perfect. My brother and sister in law always order the carne asada plate and the carne asada tacos and they love it. The price for size if very reasonable and it's always quick service here. I will mention that if you order take out you should check your order before you leave as I've had slightly incorrect orders several times, usually not a huge deal but it's worth mentioning!"}
{"text":"Love this place, family owned and great food.  Small but colorful dining room with salsa bar.   Can't beat the fresh and delicious Mexican food.  I usually get the chicken fajitas with flour tortillas.  Comes perfectly seasons with grilled vegetables.  Quite a few diners, but they do a brisk takeout business.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"We go here for their breakfast burritos. They are huge! Always fill you up and most the time i never finish the last of it. They have bomb salsa and chips also. Love this place! My hubby gets the watermelon drink and loves it i dont care for watermelon but it's actually good!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny little place in a shopping center. Good Mexican fast food, but a bit pricy. I got a Bean & Cheese burrito and its was over $5?!
It would make sense if it came with some rice and another side item. Their salsa section looks dirty and uninviting."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I had some errands to run in the area last weekend, and went looking for a place to eat breakfast.  We were in the mood for breakfast, but wanted some good \"OG\" Mexican food.

She had a breakfast burrito, and I had Eggs and Chorizo plate.  Simply put everything, down to the hot-sauce, it simply awesome.  I visit Arizona quite often and this is the only place I have ate thus far that really tastes like home cooking and it's watered down mexican food.

If you are in the mood for good food, then you need to go here!"}
{"text":"Don't be dissuaded by Caminero's underwhelming storefront presence, THE FOOD IS SO GOOD! Tacos Al Pastor and the Chorizo Breakfast Burrito are standouts. Be sure to try all the offerings at their salsa bar. The interior is modest but the flavors are robust. Friendly service to boot!"}
{"text":"I visited this place based on the reviews. Must say that I was not disappointed . The man at the front taking orders was friendly. I ordered two tacos al pastor (marinated pork) and a breakfast chorizo burrito ( Mexican spicy sausage)
The burritos are huge and very good tasting. A must if you like chorizo. The tacos come on a standalone size corn tortilla, as opposed to the smaller street taco size. The meat was well marinated and I could taste all the spices it had the right amount of pineapple to it. Also a must. I will definitely come back and try Tue other items on the menu.. Would have given a 5 star but they don't offer complimentary chips with the order, they charge a dollar . But still worth trying out the food, at least what I ate was delicious.."}
{"text":"First time eating at Caminero. I figured it'd be good because it has been at the same location for years and thought it'd be good to try as I was walking out of my hair salon. Got a shredded beef and cheese burrito and a chicken enchilada combo with rice and beans. Overall, the food was okay. First couple of bites tasted good. My boyfriend was a bit disappointed in his burrito, being that I expected it to be just beef and cheese - but they cook their beef with onions, tomatoes and peppers. My combo platter was okay but the meal was so hot temperature wise (which is good..) it melted the styrofoam box they put it in. The rest of the meal tasted like styrofoam and I ended up throwing it out. Decently priced but they need to better describe their food on their menu and put it in better packaging for take out. Might try again and dine in instead just to give it a fair chance."}
{"text":"While waiting for our food and 1st time here, saw 2-3 cockroaches crawling on the wall and floor. The one on the floor was killed by a person waiting for their food.  Ugggg."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful !! The kids and I have been here two days in a row. Little hole in the wall place with fabulous food! Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The only reason for 4 stars is they need more seating.  

They make a mean chimi, and their Tacos al Pastor are mindblowingly good, but the absolute best thing possible is the housemade Horchata!  Wow.  Never had better."}
{"text":"Love this place! We go here often for delicious Mexican food. Recommend the chimi deluxe, mini chimis and their regular salsa is very tasty. Can't beat the shredded beef tacos either. Have not gone wrong eating here. 

It is one of our go to places."}
{"text":"The food is so good here and folks that work here are so nice too.  Really good authentic food and will need to try the street tacos everyone is talking about.  So happy we discovered this place."}
{"text":"If you like food, you need to eat here. My husband and I are new to the Vistancia area and since this is Arizona we thought there would be a nearby Mexican restaurant. There isn't. However at 83rd Ave. and deer Valley, there is this delightful little Mexican food place. We have eaten both lunch and breakfast at Caminero and it was delicious and fresh both times. I'm always afraid to order chorizo at restaurants because it's usually greasy, I ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito here and not only was it not greasy but it was so damn delicious I wish I had room in my stomach for two.  We met the owner on the first visit and she was extremely kind and helpful. We absolutely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is just amazing!!!! Their chorizo burrito is hands down the best in the Valley!!! The chicken flautas are hand rolled and awesome. The beans have the perfect amount of saltiness... And the rice is moist just like it should be. The tomatillo salsa is amazing with a great flavor...and the guacamole is sooooo good!!! You wi not be disappointed trying Camineros!!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican eatery I have found.  Everything on the menu is delicious.  Been eating here religiously for the past year and it never disappoints.  The chicken fajita tacos and Arizona breakfast burrito are my favorites.  
This is a small restaurant and takes roughly 10min to cook your food once ordered.  I usually call in my order and they have it packaged to go under 10 minutes."}
{"text":"We have ate here a number of times. The food was always good however last night it was only far we got the #3 combo green or red chili burrito rice and beans we got the green it did not have a good flaver had much better before. The beans tasted burnt the rice was good.  This was the first time it was not good.  Will try again but not the green burrito."}
{"text":"Just fell into this spot! Great tacos, burritos, and green chili! Taco salad wasn't bad but not great either."}
{"text":"Holy guacamole! Great authentic Mexican joint. We had the carne asada plate, tacos dorados, tacos al pastor, and kids had the bean tostada. All were fresh and tasty! They get four stars simply because the seating area is tight. Like other reviewers noted, they do a ton of takeout."}
{"text":"This place is GOOD. Red chili is good stuff, rice and beans are on point. Enchilada sauce is unique. Not bad, actually quite good but different. All in All I definately have a new mexican food fav and will be back for more. Best part is that Top Shelf is right across the road and the dummies eating there don't know what they are missing!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food in the valley! Not only is it inexpensive but the food and service is impeccable. 
On s Friday night, instead of pizza me and the kids pig out on quesadillas and enchiladas!!! Whether breakfast in the morning or dinner at night this is a favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"Our family loves to grab a quick bite on a week night. It's a tiny little shop and the food is great. I like authentic tasting Mexican food and if it ever tastes generic, I will not return. I have never had that issue here. The only reason I give 4 stars and. It 5 is that the takeout containers could be a little better. I get kind of weirded out when the styrofoam is melted from my food being so hot. Obviously hot food is a very good thing, but consuming byproducts from melted styrofoam is not. Nevertheless it does not stop me from eating there!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.   I walked in and there was no other customers in the place. Their was 2 dirty tables and the salsa bar was a mess. There was no lids either for take out.   When I left with my take out the two tables had still not been cleaned up and there still was no other customers.

We ordered a bean and cheese burrito, California burrito, and the taco plate. 
Bean burrito tasted old, California was just ok the meat was really fatty, the tacos seemed to be fried in old oil and was really greasy. 
The workers were not that friendly, not mean... They were just there to take an order and nothing more was the attitude.  

I had seen good reviews on this place I was hoping for a new Mexican hole in the wall but this is not it. 

Doubtful I would go back. There are much more fast food Mexican places in the area that I feel are better for the same price."}
{"text":"We ate here this past Wednesday for the first time after driving by it for YEARS... WOW we should have stopped in a long time ago! Great family run place with great food! DO NOT KEEP DRIVING BY HERE!!! STOP!!! It's good!"}
{"text":"Just moved into the area. Wasn't sure what was going to be around here for good Mexican food. Wow was it good. Better then all the other bertos out there. Cost was very good. Best burrito I have had in AZ since moving here 22 yrs ago. My new hangout."}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers.  I was looking for great Mexican food and you guys and gals were great.  We came here Friday after a game and I was impressed.

To begin it is not a sit down restaraunt.  You place your order at the counter then find a table.  I ordered the carne asada tacos and they were awesome.  They had onions and cilantro.  The slasa was great.  These little tacos were a great way to end the day.  Now if they sold tequila it would be perfect.  But I do recomend it for those who want delicious tacos."}
{"text":"Caminero is a small mexican restaurant located in a shopping district. 

1. They dont have bathrooms (so wash ur hands before or eat with dirty hands lol up to u!)

2. Their tacos are AMAZING. My friend ordered the california burrito and said it was really good as well. 

3. The owner always offers me a water cup even if i dont ask. Hes really nice 

4. Their salsa is so good. The red one is spicy and the salsa verde is great too. (I get them together)

Would recommend to all my friends because cheap prices and great food"}
{"text":"Pretty average mexican food.  The portion sizes are big for the price, but the taste is just okay.  I'll give them another shot because they are so close to where I live, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Just went here for the 1st time today! Best chimi I have ever had! Authentic Mexican food! Loved it!!! We will be regulars for sure!"}
{"text":"Caminero replaced my favorite taco shop Bisteces a few years back, they changed the meat in the burrito and it wasn't quite as good, Bisteces probably had my favorite burrito and salsa ever.

Food - 4/5
Quality burrito, I get carne asada with avacado, cheese and sour cream and load up on the Tomatillo salsa which you can (and recommend you do) buy by the pint. You can tell when they get fresh made tortillas, the burritos are especially good on those days.

Service - 4/5
They get busy but the guys here are quick, helpful and polite.

Atmosphere - 3/5
If you eat at the restaurant it can get cramped I usually just grab a burrito and soda to go.

Price - 5/5
Cant beat a quality burrito for around $5.

Overall - Quick and delicious I'd recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall is well worth finding. The quality is amazing. My favorite is the Enchilladas Suizas. Great flavor in the verde sauce, perfect shredded chicken. I have also had the chile relleno and green chile burrito. My husband loves the mini street tacos al pastor ($4.99!). I have to take home half of my enchillada dinner. Never disappointed - except they don't serve margueritas!"}
{"text":"Probably a little more traditional then what I was expecting, and more along the quick take-out side of Mexican food. 

The meat in the beef chimi was more the moist, it was watery. The mini platter was worth the $7 and that was probably the best thing we ordered.

The carne asada taco was the exact opposite of the beef chimi and was dry.

Over all the food was about average, the portions were above average, but so was the price. There are just better places to get Mexican food in the area for the same amount of money."}
{"text":"We stopped by Caminero Mexican Restaurant the other day for breakfast.  We wanted a change to the \"norm\" breakfast routine and we found it at Caminero.  

They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and offer dine it and take out.  They are small and a \"dive-ish\" type of place but serve good food.  
I had their huevos con chorizo plate served with re-fried beans, rice and a flour/corn tortilla.  It was a huge plate full of Mexican goodness all for $5.99.  We also had their Mexican omelet which is made using three eggs, green chili's and your choice of meat smothered in their green sauce and cheese.  It too was a lot of food and tasty.

They are some what of a \"fast food\" place but with very good service and they use real plates for their customer's when dinning in, so don't let the \"dive-ish\" ambiance deter you from trying them.  You won't be disappointed. I'm looking forward to going back very soon for lunch/dinner.  Hope to see you there."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Food is fucking delicious I love the  Carne asada breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"I live right down the street and decided I needed a hang-over breakfast burrito. It did not disappoint. Quality ingredients. Not greasy. Just perfect. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Good food. My husband and I liked it, I thought the pricing was reasonable. My only complain would be that they don't have aguas (horchata, Jamaica,Melon, etc.) just soda (Fanta,Coca-cola)..... other than that good food-Good price!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Hands down the best Mexican food on this side of town."}
{"text":"The crispy tacos were very tasty. The torta and enchilada were good but not great. Very friendly staff and very reasonably priced. I would recommend giving it a try if your in the mood for some family inspired Mexican cooking."}
{"text":"Best Carnitas, burritos or chimis. Fresh salsa, I always order a big cup to go!! Awesome, authentic mexican street food!!"}
{"text":"Walk up and order. Chips are bland, salsa watered down. The ref ride beans and rice were pretty good and deserve 4 stars. My taco's could of had more meat and the shell seemed to be very oily??
The price seemed reasonable, ambiance is less than fair, customer service fair. Big take out establishment. I will give it another try to see if it can live up to its YELP reputation."}
{"text":"I Love Mexican food and have had it all my life. Their chimi deluxe is the best!  I like to take it to go but also like their chips and salsa so sometimes eat there.  I love that it is family owned - I like to support local businesses and this one is easy to support."}
{"text":"This is our family's go to Mexican food if your looking for something fast and on the go. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu and it's locally owned business so the service both in person and over the phone is fantastic."}
{"text":"This our our neighborhood \"hole-in-the-wall\" that we frequent weekly! Best Chimichangas I've ever had! The chicken is moist, shredded white and dark meat. I get the supreme which is drenched in their amazing enchilada sauce! Even their rice and beans are delish!"}
{"text":"I feel like I'm eating my families recipe!! Authentic Mexican food here :). I'll definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The favorite Mexican food place of my entire extended family.  We all eat here as often as we can and have never been disappointed.  Anything with their green chili sauce on it is excellent, but their tacos al pastor are a favorite.  For something light, try a plate of 3 street tacos."}
{"text":"Very delicious, got a breakfast burrito and it wasn't greasy like most are. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!!! By far the best Mexican food around. The avocado sauce is amazing. My favorite for breakfast,  lunch or dinner. We're definitely regulars and the food has been fantastic every single time...never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Very good taco place in the west valley/peoria area. Tortas are very good. Same thing for tacos. Good salsas available and chips!!!
Recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the caminero chicken burrito, my 3 year old had a bean and cheese and my husband and 16 year old step-son had the caminero shredded beef; ALL were amazing! Tasty beans, tender, flavorful meat and fresh ingredients. Even though we're in Arizona, these burritos took me right back home to California-style burritos. If you're in the mood for Mexican and need something delicious and fast, this is he place to go! Better than Filibertos and Federicos."}
{"text":"I wanted to give a better rating but can't. I ordered the caminero burrito with chicken. I was served a beef caminero burrito. The shredded beef was tasty but again, I had ordered chicken. Both my and my son's burritos were luke warm. The cheese was not fully melted due to not being heated properly. The tortillas were WAY inferior to our favorite local Mexican restaurant. The tortillas were dry and very tough. My son said his breakfast burrito was \"ok\""}
{"text":"A local secret, this one takes the whole enchilada. We native Phoenicians know that when most of the patrons are hardworking Hispanic locals and the Abuela (grandmother) is the head cook, it's GUNNA be legit. There are no frills to the tiny 6 table restaurant: you order off the bright menu above the register, fill your own salsa to go cups, and sip on in-house horchata while watching whatever channel is running on the tiny flatscreen in the corner. The mini-chimis are like golden nuggets sent from heaven: crispy, filled with perfectly cooked shredded chicken or beef(you can get 1/2 and 1/2 upon request), and ask for their jalepeño cream cheese to dip these gems into--a local secret. 
 Everything is made fresh to order, I just tried the shredded chicken tacos and it did NOT disappoint, freshly fried corn tortilla stuffed full of machaca chicken, lettuce, and shredded cheese & a side of their flavorful red rice, I literally walked in at 10am just to have these puppies. 

Pro-Tip: there's a beverage cooler located next to the soda fountain that holds a special avocado salsa that will blow your mind. Look for the clear ketchup bottle filled with this green gold and smother it on every bite. I literally have my mom ship this stuff to me in Nashville I'm that obsessed. I'll add pics soon, I just keep forgetting to snap them before I inhale every ounce of food on my plate! 

Not sure why I'm divulging all my secrets other than the fact that this hard working family has been making fresh authentic meals for years and they deserve a crown and a bag of gold for maintaining my favorite joint close to my family home. Let me know what you order and what you thought, cuz this place is where I hang my sombrero."}
{"text":"Best fast food Mexican near my home is all I have to say.  I was told about this place from a friend of mine that lives in the area and looks like Arlin B has checked it out as well.  I ordered 2 beef enchiladas plate and man was it fantastic.  The enchilada sauce was great, beans were awesome.  My wife had the floutas (rolled tacos to gringos) and they were awesome as well.  I have to go back and have a breakfast burrito which my friend swears is the best ever.  Also noticed the 2 beef tamale plate for $5.50 special that I want to give a shot as well.  This place is really clean and doesn't has a terrible odor like most Filberto locations.  The dining room is small with only about 10 tables, a TV, salsa bar, & soda fountain with no drive thru.  If you live in the area it is next to the Subway across from Top Shelf (which has terrible Mexican food)."}
{"text":"What a great place. We were in Glendale working and stopped.
Only bad thing about this place is it's not in Gilbert.....
Stop looking for Mexican food if you are in the area and eat here you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  This is my go to place when I want to impress friends and family with Mexican Food.  I buy quarts of Beans, Green chili with pork, Red chili with beef, tasty chicken in sauce and fresh tortillas and pack them all home in my corning ware containers.   I make a blender of margaritas at home and everyone makes their own burritos or tacos.  Easy and always a hit!  Everything on the extensive menu is excellent and as fresh as \"just out of the  pot\".  We have been counting on Caminero's for Christmas Eve dinner and New Year's Day Brunch for years.  Wonderful, caring people run this perfect, corner place in Peoria.  Consistent high quality food at very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"3 words: Licked the Plate!

I had all but given up on a good fast food Mexican restaurant in the Norhwest Valley. This place is it!"}
{"text":"First time here. Found a coupon in the Entertainment Guide so we ate lunch for $13 approximately which is fantastic. The only catch is you have to pay with cash which isn't listed on the coupon. Luckily we had cash. I had the chimi with chicken and he had the chicken fajitas. Both were good and enjoyable. The chicken was really tasty and the chimi was fried perfect. I enjoyed a Strawberry Fanta too. Kind of out of my usual route but worth it. I will return if I happen to be in that area again and need a cheap Mexican fix."}
{"text":"They lie about their prices online. Meal was $12 more because they said it was an old menu."}
{"text":"Honesty, I thought I was walking in to a full service restaurant, so I was a bit disappointed at first, that all went a way the moment I bit into my deluxe chimi. We, it was excellent. Their hit sales has a little kick and is very good. Next time I'm on this SSE of town I will definitely stop in."}
{"text":"This is a great family run business. This is a little hole in the wall not well-known restaurant in North Peoria. The food is great and the customer service is even better. I have nothing negative to say about this place"}
{"text":"Great little Mexican restaurant!  Breakfast is awesome.  No frills; just really good food.  Lots of folks getting to-go orders in the morning.  And during the week construction workers coming in for early lunch.  I'm glad I found this place.  That place across the street has lost my business forever."}
{"text":"This place is so good...we ate there twice in one day.  The tacos, chimis, and enchiladas are amazing.  The staff are friendly.  Go here!"}
{"text":"Great place and reasonable prices.  By far the best place for Mexican food in the NW Peoria area."}
{"text":"Weak..small portions for the price, lard..not very flavorful"}
{"text":"I really love the flavor of the food here but damn them, they never give you enough. The burritos and chimichangas come in looking nice and big and fat, but as soon as you tear into it you find out their deep dark secret, all tortilla, little meat. I think the ratio is a conservative 70/30 ratio, with the tortilla on the higher end. And the worst part, the absolute worst part, is when they don't have the green avocado salsa that they keep in the cooler."}
{"text":"I was in Glendale back in July for 2 weeks, had rented a house, and this place was a mile from where I was staying. I saw all the good reviews and had to try it. This will be now the metric I use to compare all Mexican food I get now. I ate here probably at least 6-7 times in a two week period, sampling several different dishes. I even had breakfast here a couple of times. Everything is homemade and fresh. It's like I just sat down and had a home cooked meal."}
{"text":"i'll make this short and sweet. best chips and hot sauce. They make them fresh to order. steak fajita tacos!! The meat melts in your mouth.. soft corn tortillas and peppers and onions!!! Hell yes! great place for some legit Mexican food! staff is always friendly too... which who cares with food this good!! :)"}
{"text":"Great food. This is our new go to place for take out Mexican food. Food is fresh and the Salsa Bar is awesome. Fantastic local restaurant."}
{"text":"We order take out all the time from Caminero.  This is a small family run business and they truly appreciate you coming.  We love their food.  Prices are great."}
{"text":"I am sad to say I only discovered this place and the fact that they sell the real deal street tacos, only about a year ago.

I love this place, I always order to go, the place is pretty divey, but they sure stay busy. 

They have breakfast, lunch and dinner here and are open Monday-sat 8am- 9pm. Sunday is shorter hours.

But my tried and true and something I crave is the street tacos and this is the only place I've been able to find the real deal in North West valley/north Peoria. They are right down the road from my house and it's great. I need to remember to check in more often. :)

This place is much better food wise than Too Shelf which is located across the street. There food doesn't even compare to this place.

If you're looking for a good place to have some real Mexican food and you're around this area, I highly suggest coming here and enjoying some real Mexican food. You won't be disappointed. 

You'll thank me later.
Adios!"}
{"text":"Excellent food for the price. It had flavor with some spice and the food came out fast. Looks like a family Restaurant with friendly service.

The reason for not giving 5 stars is the the decor needs some serious updating."}
{"text":"what this restaurant lacks in size it sure makes up for it in flavor.  The Pollo fundido is to die for."}
