{"text":"It has been how many Saturdays that probably they are so busy , they hang up the phone and when we went there to order, the sales person said it was because he was busy. Maybe they don't want customers anymore? Ordered chicken at Glass Nickel after that."}
{"text":"After visiting j&j in Milwaukee, I was happy to see them open an outlet here. Initially, the food was great. It was fried to order and the size of the chicken pieces were much larger than you would get at other places. I stopped last Sunday and ordered a leg and thigh combo. The size of the chicken they serve has gotten significantly smaller. It also tasted more like catfish than chicken. I think the management has changed hands several times. Sigh. Too bad"}
{"text":"Friendly Staff, Good Pricing. Every order is made fresh. Different size shrimp or Fish Plates. Ordered TO GO but, I could not wait until I got home to eat. I had to have some in the car. My new spot for fried food."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Spent 18 dollars on two meals I got three wings and mozzarella sticks when I got to my house the marinara sauce was expired and it was a brown color. Then my wings were stale tasting almost like you can taste that they used old or very cheap. I threw it out and ate my cheese sticks"}
{"text":"Had the perch and my partner had the catfish. Both were cooked perfectly I love the place. I wasn't expecting much from a strip mall fish place but damn it was good!"}
{"text":"Nasty over price hard wings! I paid $7 for this their menu says whole wings but you get 4 wing dings for $6.00. So very disappointing and the chicken has no taste!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time. Upon entering, it seemed very clean, so we placed our order. However, as we waited for our food we noticed dirty tables, and to  our disgust we saw a ROACH crawl down the wall and onto the table!!!... WE WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN! !!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! I was actually hung up on while preserving my food because the man didn't want to clean the grill."}
{"text":"I took a gamble on trying somewhere that I haven't eaten at before. I used Post Mates and got a philly sub and was very happy with it. I will definitely order from there again."}
{"text":"Paid $24.82 for 2 meals. 10 wing and a Talpa 2 piece. Wings were regular nothing special. Fish taste like warm up. For some reason I the edges of the fish were hard to bite and chewy but hard to swallow. Did I mention the fish had no taste. Slaw was the best thing I had. SMH. Btw I forgot to take a picture, mainly because the food was barely warm when we got it."}
{"text":"don't order the popcorn Popcorn Shrimp Plate. I ordered Postmates ($100 in free delivery with code 3K2B) and anticipated this meal because my last order was good.It's not even worth eating honestly. It's like eating fried cornmeal."}
{"text":"First time there and last. I got there and the place was empty should have been my first sign. Place was refer by Dosh. I got the jumbo shrimp and tender combo. I waited 20mins for a half ass meal and the food was warm not even hot."}
{"text":"The flounder would have been good if it was seasoned.i must say that im highly offended at the fact that this place serves kraft box mac n cheese. Everybody knows those skinny noodles when you see them. Please stop. I gave 2 stars because the fish was fried nicely."}
{"text":"the review below \"sounds\" suspicious.  They are very over priced. Never seen more than 3 cars in the parking lot (unless all the employee's CAR POOLED I would think at least 2 cars are employee cars). A buddy of mine and myself came here for lunch one day and after the total price was given.... We desided to walk across the street to Sunrise Resturant.... Better food, Better prices, a parking lot FULL OF CARS... (That has to mean something... RIGHT???.. more cars, more business, meaning better food, service, prices, customer service, etc...)  When I read the (ONLY) REVIEW below, I had to add my \"2 cents\".   If a resturant is name has \"fish, chichen\" something tells me that anything ELSE is probably not the best. \"Philly Cheese Steak\"... MEHHHH i'll pass on that \"JJ Fish & Chicken\"... I'll pass on that!!!"}
{"text":"They give you a good bit of food I guess but the taste is mediocre at best. The food taste like it had been sitting out and then warmed up in the microwave when I ordered. I had bold honey BBQ wings and jalape√±o poppers.  My friend had fish and shrimp she says hers were good but she says that about everything LoL."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place for years.  I'm always looking for a good quick bite on the east side, and finally stopped there tonight.  This is not typical fast food, it is not typical fried food - - though it IS fried food - - but it is still real revelation.   This is super tasty short-order food,  well conceived, well prepared.    Ordered a $9.95 catfish & shrimp dinner for take out, and the first great indicator was that although there were only one or two others there, it took them maybe 15 or 20 minutes for this simple order.    That's because it wasn't just scraped up out of a trough - - the product was carefully prepared.   The catfish had bones so you had to be careful where you bit,  but was beautifully crusted on the outside, and flaky/tender on the inside;  the shrimp were the plumpest, most succulent, most flavorful things that I have experience under the rubric of \"shrimp\" in memory, perhaps ever.   This is CLEARLY an establishment (I avoided it in the past because it looked chain-like, and didn't fit any stereotyped standards, and it IS kind of a chain) that actually produces thoughtful, carefully/systematically prepared product (fried product, I admit) of rare QUALITY (it appears to appeal to a certain ethnic stratum - - one that DEFINITELY knows what great food is!).   It puts the rest of take-out civilizatiton to shame, and it is great to have a place like this on the east-sider radar that can  offer things 12-shades of tasty at very good prices with very rare dedication to righteous ingredients prepared with great attention to (o.k., it is fried food - - but wow!)  detail."}
{"text":"There's fried fish like Long John Silver's and then there's places like Jj's, the fried chicken is the closest your going to find to Brown's outside of Schaumburg. Or Chicagoland period for that matter. Just try to avoid the rush times unless congested waiting in the Ghetto's of Madison is a perk or bonus for you - this place is small and is located in Madison's fashionable East side Red Letter News porno palace/Car title loan & urban wear District. Mostly a food-court gangsta paradise, but scary to the 92% townies turned cultured Emo kids that populate the Ithsmus.  I'm out.   Peace."}
