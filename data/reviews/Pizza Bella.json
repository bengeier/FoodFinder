{"text":"The worst pizza i have ever had. I love pizza and eat it twice a week . pizza bella makes greasy pizza using cheap quality toppings. if you dont know what good pizza is then pizza bella is for you."}
{"text":"I'm actually writing about the new location on Eglinton. I'm starting to think I may be one of their first customers. As the foremost pizza connoisseur of my neighbourhood, I would not be surprised if I actually was their first.

When I order pizza I play by some basic rules;
- I always ask for my pizza to be well done, especially if the store likes to rush the job (I'm looking at you, P.P.)
- I remind the driver about dipping sauces, cuz they forget to give them 90% of the time (seriously, D.'s, get your $*&% together)
- Even if they offer Interac they don't always bring it with them, so gotta ask (P.H. has never once remembered)
- The drivers and order-takers are sometimes the worst ppl to talk to (P.N. ugh)
- Toppings are often wrong on first orders (I'll never forgive you Mama)

I wasn't sure what to expect when I called. The order-taker was super nice and smart, got all my info down quickly, was easy to understand, and made the call short. He knew the product and wanted to make a sale. He was so friendly I forgot about my rules.

When the order arrived in less than 30 minutes, I started kicking myself for not getting it well done. The driver was even MORE pleasant, and he brought Interac \"just in case\", so I forgot to ask for dipping sauces as well.

So yeah, I really wasn't sure what to expect when I opened the pizza box. 

But a tear came to my eye when I saw the pizzas were perfectly cooked, all the toppings were correct, the two dipping sauces were nestled snugly against the cardboard corners in a strangely cute way, and it was just plain ol' delicious pizza.

I don't always shed a tear, but when I do, its over beautiful food. 10/10 would let them restore my faith in pizza delivery service again.

Summary: great prices, amazing friendly service, nothing fancy but it is the best pizza option in North York for its price range at the moment"}
{"text":"Delivery guys are awesome they are the fastest in Vegas. I always have to wait with other places but not with Pizza Bella."}
{"text":"I was traveling in the area on business and needed a quick bite for lunch.   I jumped on yelp and saw Madre's review about Pizza Bella.  The meatball sandwich sounded good (and better than the Subway in the same strip center).  So, I went for the small version (8\") of the Meatball Hoagie.

Great sandwich and plenty of food for a fast lunch.   Luckily, I wanted my to go as Pizza Bella is not set up for sitting down.  To go (or delivery, I assume) only.

I would recommend to anybody in a similar situation.  And, more importantly, I would visit them again."}
{"text":"You'll eat like a king for $5 bucks!

Quality :

The food isn't rave-worthy, but it is dirt cheap and filling. The cuisine is Canadian with a middle eastern twist. 

Service :

Don't expect Ritz-Calton services here. Do expect a rushed experience, but that's okay.

Environment/Decor :

The crowd is mostly students from Concordia University. It a small restaurant located in Guy-Concordia metro.

Recommend menu items :

Merguez/Lebanese sausage pizza

Overall impression :

If I had the time to go somewhere better, I would, but if I'm on a rush and need to eat before class in under 15 minutes, this is a good bet.

{"text":"We took a vote and gave this one star because 1 star is the lowest we could choose. Tahiti village, where we are staying, recommended this Pizza but take our word for it and DON'T GET PIZZA FROM THIS PLACE !"}
{"text":"We were in town on business. I drove down from the hotel and picked up a few Italian Hoagies. Super-friendly service, and the best hoagies we've had. Fresh lettuce, tomatoes and onion, and great sliced meats. Can't wait to return to the area to get more!"}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for our food, and it was pretty gross. Breadsticks were dry, bland and near inedible. Pizza was overcooked and unimpressive. Also ordered a cup of ranch, and it was slimy and thin. Not like any ranch dressing I've ever seen! Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great pizza at great prices.  Personally I love the Hawaiian pizza from here.  I tried it at a friends house and have been coming here every since.  A large Hawaiian pizza will run you around $11 which is a great price, and they are extremely quick.  I have called in my order when driving through the neighborhood, and have only waited about 10 - 15 minutes for it to be ready.  The owners are friendly and efficient, and  the pizza is great....what more do you need?"}
{"text":"As a student at Concordia, I would eat at Pizza Bella all the time and it's awesome! Quick, cheap yet really good, it is one of the best places to grab lunch between classes."}
{"text":"I ordered from these guys and was told delivery time was going to take an hour and a half. I had no problem with that since I was still in the casino gambling and could wait. Placed my order and the amount was $48.58 for a Large pepperoni, soda, and half bucket of wings. I thought that was pretty expensive but it was cheaper than the hotel food so it was whatever. 2 hours passed, no food... no call.... nobody picking up their phone. After about 10 tries, they finally picked up and said they ran out of food. I could not believe how ridiculous the  service was and how careless these people are. I strongly suggest do not even give these guys the oppurtunity to rip you off and piss you off on your vacation."}
{"text":"Over time we've come to categorize pizza as either pizza or Pizza Hut (or Dominoes). Pizza Bella has pizza. It's a mom and pop joint that makes delicious pizza as well as other items. We constantly get the pepperoni and at times a sandwich which are also good as well as HUGE. Ingredients never seem less than fresh. I can agree that the sauce might be canned, but so are ones used at most other places and besides it doesn't harm the over all flavor a bit. Customer service has always and I mean always been at worst, good. I once walked in to order a pizza and didn't realize it was during lunch hour. The lady there was the only one attending both the counter and phones. She took my order then began to also take phone orders as well as prep food! At one point I saw her get frustrated, but here's the thing, she never while I was there took her frustration out on a caller. Very professional, great food and spectacular service has made Pizza Bella our go to pizza joint in town. Good luck."}
{"text":"I am a regular at Pizza Bella.. why?  Because this establishment knows how to run a business..
Order accuracy: always 
Delivery: always on time
Cost:  pretty reasonable 
Quality of food: always fresh
The only downfall is that they do not carry pepsi products only coke
I recommend the spinach and feta pizza !"}
{"text":"I put in an order with them late at night pretty much because it was the only thing that was open for delivery at that time. I ordered some cheesy garlic bread. So first of all, it took an insane amount of time to come. This was especially inconvenient since it was so late at night. However, that was the least of the problems. When the food arrived the delivery driver called me and demanded I come downstairs. Now I live in an apartment building and it's very easy to buzz up, the system works perfectly, it's just a button so I kind of expects delivery drivers to bring the food up. Having worked as a delivery driver myself, this is pretty standard, so I told him to come upstairs. He then yelled at me and said he can't come up because there is nowhere to park. I look out of my balcony and there are dozens of spots available, so he was just lying. 

When I finally got the food, their idea of garlic bread with cheese was literally old stale french bread with a dash of garlic powder and a touch of cheese.

Extremely terrible experience"}
{"text":"This place has the worst quality pizza you can find in vegas. I've tried a lot of pizza places but this place is just horrible. If I could I would give this place no stars. If your hotel is nearby please do not order from here. There's a pizza place much better and it's called Joe's NY pizza located on Harmon and paradise next to the cvs. Trust my words I work at one of the hotels around there and there is many complains about PIZZA BELLA! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR APPETITE!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful craving and its on my way home, so yes it needs to be larger but it tasted amazing"}
{"text":"My slice of pizza was still slightly cold when served, and the toppings were not very generous. The cashier was also pretty rude.

The food is pretty cheap however, they serve 6 kinds of pizza, poutine, and shish taouk.

The dining area was very messy, no one cleans the table, and the table arrangements were very awkward.

They only accept cash by the way."}
{"text":"Meh. That is about the best word I can come up with. Ordered online, delivery was fast. One of the pizza's looked like it had been cooked 3 hours prior. That was gross. The other pizza was decent, but this would probably rank the lowest of all the pizza places I've been to. I really want to like small places like this, but it just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"This place is worse than pizza pizza, everything they have is stale. The garlic bread was so nasty that we didn't even eat it. My girlfriend and I had the runs after eating from here. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS FUCKING PLACE.

So cheap, so fast and so yummy yum yum!

All of their prices are obviously there for students, they serve it quickly and it's cheap too! Friendly staff even though you can EASILY TELL English/French is not their main language.

3.50$ for a poutine man! And they ACTUALLY melt the cheese so I'm not stuck with random bits of cold cheese curds.

Removed a point because most do not wear hair nets aaaaaaand their arms are kind of hairy. I found a hair twice in my poutine :(."}
{"text":"This place is just horrible if I could rate it 0 stars I would. The owner is not customer friendly at all whatsoever. And the food is gross at best."}
{"text":"Got their flyer under our hotel room door. I am a flight attendant and really appreciate places open late. I called the number on the flyer, since it said they were open till midnight. The time was about 1120pm. No one answered and I even tried calling from another number. I was very disappointed to not get an answer. I will talk to the hotel staff in the morning. Hopefully they can advise them to not state false info to the hotel guests who are hungry and tired."}
{"text":"I was staying a few blocks away from here for the week on business. My hotel tried to direct me to a place called Hometown Pizza, but they literally only make pizza. I'd like a few options.

I ordered a pepperoni and ham calzone. First, I love when pizza joints put sauce IN the calzone In NY, I don't see that often. There aren't many things more difficult than trying to dip a bite of calzone into a sauce cup.

The sauce had great flavor to it. The calzone, while filled with cheese, wasn't overflowing with it, so the ingredients and sauce still stood out to me. The bread was also good and didn't have any air pockets, as some calzones do.

Fast delivery to my room. I'll definitely order from here again if I'm staying in the same area."}
{"text":"Came in for a few slices... They sell by the slice.  Nice and hot and deeeeeeeelicious.  Little hole in the wall, but that's a plus for me!"}

{"text":"I just ordered Buffalo chicken pizza. It test like just chicken and nothing to do with Buffalo chicken. Still test is fine, but I am disappointed.
I give this pizza 1 star only."}
{"text":"Let's be real, this place is dirt cheap so don't expect the Ritz. It is located in the Concordia tunnel close to the guy metro. This place is always busy with Concordia students grabbing food to go and walking by you'll normally see a line up of people waiting to order. Don't worry though, the line goes quickly and your food is ready in no time.

This place serves big slices of thin crust pizza ($2.25), poutine ($3.50), and shish taouk ($7). (Prices include tax). 

It took me a long time of always walking by before I decided to actually try it. There are very few places to sit, the ventilation is bad, the lighting is dingy; you don't come here for the ambiance. I'm glad I did though, when I'm in the mood for a cheap/quick/fatty/yummy meal between classes this is where I go. 

The pizza is decent, the shish taouk plate is pretty good - they give you lots of chicken and the garlic sauce is not so garlicky yet still addictive, and the poutine is seriously REALLY GOOD. They put tons of curds and gravy in their poutine, just the way I like it :). Considering this place rivals Tim Hortons for the being the busiest food establishment on campus you know that theres a high turnover of food. PS - it is cash only."}
{"text":"Food was good. The buffalo fries were not what my girlfriend expected, so she was a tad pissed. But all in all I thought the food well prepared.  Prices average. Only in the area for a couple days, would return if I needed food."}
{"text":"I always figured I would try this pizza place one day. I see it every time I go to Concordia.
4$ for a slice and a drink? I was sold.

The pizza is decent, wouldn't get it alllll the time but it hit the spot when I was starving and broke. 

Will try their poutine next time."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza I've ever had! I really wanted to give it more stars because the guy who helped us was nice. :( 

Ok so here's my beef with all these little pizza places and this one falls into the same category: pizza joint with Italian names or wording and no one in there is Italian!!!! 

As an Italian it offends me! And don't even say it's Spanish because you aren't calling yourself the taco bella! Use another name! Because this isn't beautiful pizza!

We ordered a plain cheese pie. There was sooooo much grease on top that it dropped off the pizza, real mozzarella doesn't do that! 
The sauce tastes like tomatoes out of a can and oregano dumped in it. 

This was a Sunday and the place across the street was closed :( 

Not going back."}
{"text":"A quick sneak peek into my (unhealthy) lifestyle. I get off at the subway around 10am-ish, go to Tims, order an extra large coffee with 2 milk and 1 sugar, then I swing by Pizza Bella to grab a slice as a breakfast.

Is it the greatest Pizza slice in the world? No, it's not. Is it a decent slice that goes down well at 9h45-10AM when I'm walking toward the office? Yes it is.

Some of the slices tends to be better than the others. The Mushroom, ''Mexican'', and ''Lebanese'' slices are particularly decent. 

Plus it pairs well with Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"In a hurry and hungry? It's a great place to stop by for pretty fresh pizza considering how busy the Guy side of Concordia metro gets with hungry students! The thing that makes it good is the price - $5 can fill you up to survive for a couple hours and they have a few options from vegetarian, to chicken and halal meat pizzas. Their pizza slices are quite generous, cut from an extra large pizza.  There's a narrow eating area but it's not the cleanest, with pizza crumbs, leftover paper plates and soda cans. Don't expect first class service as this isn't the point.  It is functional and effective and you can even eat your pizza slice on the go by folding your thin paper plate to make it a pizza burrito! Their pizza is served quite toasty inside the display and they don't do anything to warm it up, but I would say that it's warmer than any delivery pizza you could order. I would say it is a student-approved meal on the go."}
{"text":"Visiting my sister from San Diego and had a hankering for pizza...because after all, it's football night across the nation. She wanted to order her usual pizza from Vocelli's but after reading the reviews (what little there were) I decided to find out what my fellow yelpers had to say.

Pizza Bella happens to be right down the road from my sister's house. There may be better or worse for that matter but the reality is that you can only read reviews from folks who have taken the time to write down their thoughts...here are mine.

We have some excellent pizza in San Diego, there are many kinds and tonight's pizza was good, decent actually but not fab. The gentleman on the phone was friendly and I have an idea he was the one that delivered it as well. He tried to tell me all that they had but there was really too much to describe. They don't have a menu online so maybe, just maybe you drop by one day and pick one up. I saw a few things that I would've like to try besides my pizza but that's neither here nor there.

Like the other gal said, they have good customer service, great specials and the dough is handmade fresh, (I know because I asked)..not premade cracker dough but hand thrown I think. It's light, slightly chewy and the toppings were just past the point of being a tad skimpy...but hey, everything's bigger in Cali right? Or is that Texas?

The only bummer was the sauce...a good sauce could make a turd pizza taste good, this was not it. It pretty much tasted like a canned, ready made sauce, that's why they only got three stars. The meatball sandwich was huge (16\") and I believe they used the same sauce but the bread was as soft and fresh as an angel and the meatballs were surprinsingly very good. Lots of mozza cheese and you could def call that a meal.

I uploaded a couple of pics so you could see what the smallest size looked like...the sandwich wouldn't even fit in the pic...what??? It was better than Dominoes or Papa John's...wait...do you guys even have those places here?"}
{"text":"I'm attaching a photo which shows the generous portion size for the salad. Food was delicious and fresh. Friendly welcome when I arrived."}
{"text":"Having been there zillions of time when I was at Concordia, i can say their service is fast, efficient and cheap. Single slice is 2.75$ which is totally worth it. Strongly recommend poutine, chicken slice and Shishtauk."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the nice delivery guy. The pizza tasted like something you would find at your local CiCi's pizza. The spaghetti sauce was very acidic and flavorless. The chicken burrito was dry and the Caesar salad came hot and with a spring mix lettuce instead of the classic romaine that one would expect. Save your money and order Napolis pizza instead..."}
{"text":"Placed an order online for a couple of pizzas at this restaurant and they got the order late.  I called to inquire the status because it was supposed to be there 10 minutes earlier.  I was told they just got the order 25 minutes ago and I would have to wait.  No apology no time for how long or anything.  Just \"You have to wait.\"  They also didn't answer the phone nicely just \"hello\"  Sorry, but if you can't have good customer service, you can't have my business."}
{"text":"I understand the motto of \"you get what you pay for\" but in this case my husband and I simply walked away without ordering anything. Based on the reviews, we stopped by but it was obvious the pizzas had been sitting under the light for quite some time. We walked away after we had to tell the man behind the counter that there was a fly on the pizza. Better upkeep is expected regardless of the price."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area, very flavourful and affordable, beats pizzaville from down the street any day"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Moon in my opinion. We order here regularly, and the people are always very friendly and keep with the times they give you over the phone. The sauce is good and the pizza overall is very good. Their wings are also very good and they have a buffalo chicken hoagie that is delicious. I recommend giving them a try if you live in the area and haven't yet. Everyone has their own taste for good pizza, but you can't beat their fast friendly service.   Like another reviewer said, delivery or take out only as there is nowhere to sit."}
{"text":"Tried a few different dishes from here and never had a bad one. Definitely the pizzas are delicious, calzones yummy and even the salad is good.
People from pizza Bella are always nice and when I order for delivery they have always been on time if not a few mins earlier from what the quoted time was."}
{"text":"Besides the cashier being a bit unsure of menu items, and the place needing a facelift, we got our food in decent time and it was nice and hot!  Glad we didn't leave due to all the negative reviews."}
{"text":"Tried this for something different...and I am pleased.
Came before the estimated time and was hot.

My pizza was good, my tandoori gyro was ok....I spiced it up a bit and it was really good.
The cheddar pasta was plentiful and pretty good as well.

I will be ordering again....thanks!!!"}
{"text":"The owner wouldn't let me use the bathroom because I came from the gay bar, he said it was broken and kicked me out."}
{"text":"Always happy with purchases here.  The pizzas have the right blend of cheese and sauce for us, and are cooked just right.  They are ready fast, and nice and hot.  We have never had delivery, we always get it ourselves so can't comment on that.

Only gave 4 stars because they used to have slightly better deals and pricing.  It gets pricey if you want anything other than large plain cheese pizza (but as a side note, we're also cheapskates!)"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend anyone getting food from here. We were tired so we got their flyer under our hotel door decided to order their pizza, chicken and lasagna. The pizza was nasty crust was hard and chewy; very little pepperoni and the mushroom was not fresh they used canned oyster mushroom NEVER had pizza that tast like this before. Going on to the chicken it was hard and crispy it's like they fried it and poured BBQ sauce on top and the lasagna nothing to rave about the frozen Stouffers lasagna is much tastier than this one. I would never ordered any foods out this establishment again. I spent $50 on worthless foods that we ended up not finishing anything and throwing it out after a few bites. The food, quality and taste is not worth it all thought it was pricy!!!! UGH GROSS and pissed that I spent that much on worthless foods."}
{"text":"My favorite small pizza place, especially for chicken pizza. I lived on Guy & de Maisonneuve so it was perfect to stop by for a fresh full chicken pizza for $7.50. When I did promotional contracts they would regularly swap our free stuff for food. The workers are nice and the food is good/quick for a decent price."}
{"text":"Place sucks .. I got my menu in my hotel room said they were open till 1 am . whoever answered the phone said they closed early.. I will never call this place for anything ever again... Will just be another unsucessful restraunt! This is a Vegas do not!!"}
{"text":"I drive the magic bus in the up up and away in the puffy clouds, our airline relocated us to the pleasant Sheraton down the road for our layovers about 5 years ago. Since then I've made the short hike up the road and through the USPS to Pizza Bella many, many times and boy is it worth it. Their sandwiches are exceptional and so are their perfect pizzas, (NOT Quiet New York but it's got its own vibe) their Italian wedding soup does not disappoint as well.....I always recommend it to my coworkers. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Wow.  Pizza delivered within a half hour of ordering.  Tasty, in expensive pizza delivered to my hotel room.  Wonderful!"}
{"text":"I swear the Guy Concordia metro station is stacked with great places to eat for cheap! Pizza Bella is an institution for all who pass through, especially Concordia students who need a quick bite before and after class. 

$5 can set you up with a simple shishtaouk pita, or 2 slices of pizza. Maybe not the best you'll ever have but definately the best for the price you are paying. The pizza slices are dressed with generous amounts of toppings and are a decent size. Their wraps hold respectable meat-to-veg ratio, and are savoury on every bite. 

 Because this place is so popular they have a high turnover on pizza, meaning you are often eating freshly prepped food. A good feeling."}
{"text":"Pizza blows.  Greasy and flavorless.  Not what we expected.   Based on price we expected better"}
{"text":"As a student at Concordia University, I really appreciate having a pizza place near my school and that is so cheap. Pizza is good, shish taouk is good, workers are really efficient, and even though they do not talk a lot of english or french, we can see that they are really trying hard to communicate with us and be nice.
Only reason I do not give this place a 5 star is because it is a bit dirty."}
{"text":"In Vegas for a few days and needed food delivered to the hotel.  The hotel provided Pizza Bella's menu in the room's booklet so figured why not. 

The pizza is OVERPRICED and tasted and looked like cardboard. TERRIBLE. Paid $3 for toppings and got maybe two pineapples and three tomato chunks on each slice. 


Salad was basically a bunch of lettuce with goat cheese. 

Paid $24 because they also included a $3 delivery charge plus a $2 debit card fee which they don't tell you on the phone.  They also don't give you the fees on the menu, just say delivery charge may apply and surcharge for credit cards. 

On top of that they don't allow you specify how much you want to submit for a tip if you use debit card. Cheapest amount you can leave is fifteen percent so pretty much paid $30 for cardboard, lettuce and goat cheese. 

Buyer beware"}
{"text":"Pizza Bella offers the best pizza in downtown core at great prices. It is very accessible from all Concordia building in downtown without going out in the cold weather. 

Prices are impressive for large pizza portions and very neat ."}
{"text":"Two stars because i have to try the food yet. Hopefully it makes up for the oddest delivery ever.

I am staying at a hotel for the past month. This is the second time I have stayed here both times it's been month long stays. Tonight after work I decided to go out of comfort zone and try this place.

The food was delivered half hour late. Glad they called to say they were coming and about 10 min out because I fell asleep. Then they called again to say they were 2 min away to meet them at front door? Uhhhh that has never happened before... like ever. If I hadn't already paid a tip on the app I was using I wouldn't have. I ordered delivery not half way there late delivery. 
I also had written I needed a paper receipt for work expenses. This guy that I had to talk into actually doing his job and delivered to my door didn't even look at me just tossed my food in my hands and started to talk away. I had to look down the hallway to ask for my receipt.
I prolly will order from somewhere else.

Edit: one star... 
food was not even close to what was expected to be. My 13 year old niece could make it better. 
Also Since when does baklava have green stuff on top? Was it cut with a knife that was used on something else? That is NOT food safe. It's was actually gross. 
The garlic bread was warmed bread with butter. Not toasted with garlic butter.
Garlic noodles....seriously was noodles, garlic, speck of cheese and little bit (yes lil bit) of chicken. Can grantee the $25 I spent on this I could have made this for cheaper then that.  
Gross food horrible costumer service... 
sad every place else I have tried in Madison was lovely... not this place."}
{"text":"There is nothing bella about this place. I am local and i give places a chance, but this kinda sucked. I came in to order , and it said on the window 7.99 for a LARGE cheese pizza carry out. So I ordered that and 10 BBQ wings for 7.99 as well. Went down the street and came back to pick up my food. The box was seriously the size of a SMALL. MAYBE MEDIUM pizza. Large my asshole, this was DEF NOT a large pizza. At the local pizza place i usually go to you can get an x-large just cheese for 8.99 and you get an x-LARGE pizza. So i know what the difference is... When i asked \"is this really a large?\" The dude laughed and it seemed he mocked me by saying - \" Extra large!\" I was like - yeah ok. 
The wings sucked, I have had beef jerkey that was better. They were NOT BBQ flavored, they just had a brown sauce on them,... If i had to guess, I'd say they forgot what flavor I ordered and just gave me mild whatever. Duno how they forgot my wing flavor, I was the only customer there. Oh yeah no ranch or blue cheese either, was not surprised. This place is for drunk people who stumble over from the Double Down, this is not a sit down, or purchase a WHOLE pizza type place. Its a by the slice type of joint.

Prob wont go back. Going to look for a new after work pizza place."}
{"text":"It was a mistake to order \"supreme\" pizza and salad from this place: expensive, tasteless. They say on the flyer: \"winner of numerous awards\" - what a lie! This is a scam. The mixed salad was probably purchased in a local grocery store and just transferred to a container."}
{"text":"Are you a hungry student with only a toonie in your pocket?  Here is your place then!!

Pizza slices are 1.50 for cheese and 2 for anything else, and it is damn good!

They also have falafel, and shishtaouk wraps.

For 6.50 you can a large pizza.

Service is quick and easy."}
