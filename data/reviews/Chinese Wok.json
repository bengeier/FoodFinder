{"text":"This place just opened and had the opportunity to make a great first impression in the neighbourhood.. but sadly, this was not to be. Largely due to poor planning, foresight and customer service.

We had a hankering for Hakka food and went to the website, it looked great, the prices were reasonable so we placed an order with the intent to pay with cash on delivery. I got an email stating what we had ordered and a confirmation. So we waited...and waited...until finally I called to find out what the deal was. Where was the food at?

The man on the phone was confused and not very helpful..his response to our dilemma? 'oh we just launched the website, the takeout doesn't work, we're not delivering right now.' EXCUSE ME? why was it possible to put an order through? Why is there zero no mention of this on the website? 

So I placed an order on the phone, as by that time we were getting hangry and frustrated. It turns out the menu items listed on their online website are not actually available to order! We had to substitute an item last minute b/c it was just a concept on the menu. We went in to pick up the order and there was no 'hello' no friendly smiles of greeting, nothing... we waited patiently as the girl at the cash stood and whispered with her colleague and had to finally ask 'is the food ready?' We explained the situation and were disappointed with the insincere apologies. A bizarre experience.  

What kind of joke is this? Jumping the gun a bit on the website - if you're going to go live on the web, make sure everything is in order. How many customers did these guys turn off with this misstep? 

The truly sad part? The food wasn't bad. The salt and pepper beef was crispy and enjoyable and the food had a good level of heat. It's unfortunate that the customer service was so lacklustre. We are unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Overpriced and the food was like Chinese McDonald's...Horrible quality. Eddie'e Wok and Roll, Ming Room and Chill Chicken House are all way better options. I wanted this to be great since there isn't Hakka nearby but it was a serious lunch bag let down."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Waited 45 minutes for our food and they talked like we weren't even there. Clearly forgot to make our order of rice while the rest of the food was done and when they faced us they said \"It's very busy\". I told them to be honest and just tell us they forgot to make one of our dishes and they just nodded. Absolutely no organization or structure in this place and everyone waiting for their food got quite frustrated. At one point we had to start helping each other figure out who's food was coming out because they had no idea which dish went with which order. AVOID!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible. So off the Hakka game. 
Ordered a chilli chicken, it took twenty minutes for me to get it and on top of that it wasn't even decent. Chilli chicken house is way better by a long shot, and that's not even the best Hakka place out there. Honestly, I so wanted this place to be good, which made the letdown that much more upsetting. 

I made give this place another try, but definitely not the chilli chicken."}
{"text":"Awful. I rarely give 1* star reviews, but this place warrants it. Located in the Erin Mills area, we were hopeful that this place would pop up as the next new and awesome Hakka spot in west Mississauga. Unfortunately, it's the absolute opposite.

The staff mixes up orders very often (yes, my parents and I tried to give this place a chance and ordered from here a few times because of convenience). The food itself is just terrible - very strange colouring (our beef was almost green.... I know, green meat). The flavour is something you never want to experience, and the dishes taste almost like plastic with a really, really awful aftertaste.

Avoid. Definitely avoid."}
