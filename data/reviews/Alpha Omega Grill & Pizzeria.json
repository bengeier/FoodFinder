{"text":"I have been waiting on this place to open and it was DEFINITELY worth the wait! Food is delicious, service is amazing and everyone really goes out of their way to make sure you have a pleasant meal."}
{"text":"My company gave us all lunch from Alpha Omega Pizzeria today.  Holy Smokes, was it good!!  This was the best pizza I have ever had.  I think mostly due to the sauce.  I am not a huge fan of pizza sauce and usually ask for the minimum amount.  This sauce was delicious and so was the cheese!  I am glad this place is not near my house.  I would eat there all the time, but I am looking for forward for our next company lunch from there.  I did not have any wings today, but those who did raved on and on about them.  It all came with a fabulous salad as well.  It was a perfect lunch."}
{"text":"Came to this place for lunch. The place was virtually empty, and they wanted to sit our party of 5 in a booth for 4! They would not sit us in a table because some party of 30 was going to arrive in an hour. In an hour!!!Terrible service! I guess your party of 30 will be going there every day to keep you in business."}
{"text":"BEST FOOD IN NORTH CAROLINA!!! A is a must for anyone in the Charlotte area. The staff is fast, friendly,  & locally owned and operated by a wonderful Greek family. Chefs specials are amazing! Dessert is to die for!"}
{"text":"Good pizza place ever!!!! They're very good take care of customer. I was order salmon gill it's really nice. Owner of this restaurant are very friendly! Love them!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! This place was needed in the area! It is so yummy! I've already been twice. The first time I had the calzone and my hubby had the gyro. The second time he had the lasagna and I had pesto pasta with chicken. We got the cheese stick appetizer. There's so many choices on the menu I'm just going to have to keep coming to try things! It also has a family feel. The owner's wife walks around and speaks to everyone in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Alpha Omega Grill &Pizzeria is a great place to grab something to eat. There is truly something for everyone, from Greek to Italian food, burgers, sandwiches, seafood, and pizza. I only stopped in for take out, and grabbed the flounder and shrimp plate. I have to say I was a bit skeptical ordering seafood at a Pizza place, but it was wonderful with generous portions of food. I can't wait to go back and try their pizza! The staff is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I wanted to be the first to welcome back such a wonderful family with amazing food that is only topped by their hospitality.  It was like being back at Dino's in Harrisburg.  First night open at the new spot and a pretty good crowd excited for the new look but same great food.  You will not make it through the door without being greeted by someone.  To be opening night, the service staff kept things rolling and were very helpful and attentive.  I ordered my usual which is eggplant parmesan but penne instead of spaghetti and meat sauce.  Its a little odd but that speaks to the level of detail and personalization they give to every customer.  The rest of the table had pizzas and they came out hot and cooked to perfection.  Be sure to ask the server about desserts as they are cool, fresh, and big enough for more than one person.  Make sure to stop by and join the family for a great meal!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING Greek style pizza made lovingly by the owner and his wife who are always on the property. This restaurant is very clean, the service is prompt, the prices very reasonable and the pizza was...again....OUTSTANDING, AMAZING and about as good as it gets.   With 6 varieties of draft beer, including local Old Mech, the variety of food opportunities are numerous and all sound awesome. We had the 14\" Greek Pizza and it was so packed with cheese (including big chunks of feta) that we had to take 2 slices home...I don't do that often.   Conveniently located about a 10 minute walk from the PNC Music venue, this is a must when visiting the area. Your visit will make your wallet glad as well...and for goodness sake, get your fill of beer here before the show at the PNC because, at the concert aight they charge you over $16 for a 24 ounce can of beer....that's not a misprint!!!! $16+."}
{"text":"This place made me really happy tonight for two reasons: 1) It's like, a mile away from my house and 2) The food was ridiculously good! After 6 months of moving into the University neighborhood, it's great to find a solid place for Italian.  Walked in on a Thursday night around 8pm and was immediately seated. We ordered mozzarella sticks, cheese tortellini, and a NY Style Stromboli, all to share. Two Caesar salads to start as well.  Salads were good, but pretty much the only gripe of the night was that it appeared to have ranch dressing on a Caesar salad. Instead of light & complex, we got thick and fatty dressing. These were small side salads anyway so we took them as-is.  The mozzarella sticks were outstanding. Great, homemade sauce with a light fry on the mozzarella. No grease dripping from the food, such a relief. Big fan of the appetizer.  The Stromboli was quite literally a work of art on its own. They cut the pastry in such a way that made presentation a noteworthy part of dinner, check out the photos below! Assembled to order and cooked perfectly, this was one of the best Strombolis I've ever had. Fresh meats, cheeses, and tomato. I believe the sauce was the same as the one with the Mozzarella sticks. It'll be very difficult to order something else next time after trying this!  Cheese tortellini had a great, light alfredo sauce with homemade pasta joining it. You can add broccoli or mushrooms for $1. Pairing this with the Stromboli and splitting both was a great choice.  Pepsi products only, but after such a great meal I can't dock 'em for that. I did have a laugh when the radio station that was on in the restaurant played a very, very long Coca-Cola commercial.  Again, just happy happy HAPPY that they're so close-by. A huge success!"}
{"text":"Yummy Greek shrimp in a tomato sauce with feta cheese served over rice. The Greek salad was ok. A good amount of kalamata olives and feta cheese over fairly standard side salad ingredients. My 14 year old labeled his cheese pizza as \"Almost as good as Papa John's\". The waiter hovered. And even started telling us about a diet another patron is on. TMI!!  I ate with my teenager for $29 plus tip and we both brought about half of our meals home in boxes. And they have APPLE PAY!!!  Yayyyyy!!!"}
{"text":"First visit tonight and was very disappointed. Ordered the \"House\" pizza. After a reasonable wait it was delivered to the table without plates to eat it on. When we did put a slice on our plates it was barely Luke warm but the real kicker was a portion of the pizza crust was BLUE, yes I said blue. Looked for our waitress and could not locate her so I took my plate with the blue pizza to the register and showed it to the owner who took it and gave it to the cook. The real problem was they just did not seem to care! We promptly left and will not be returning. Make sure you check your pizza crust before you eat it if you go there."}
{"text":"The owners of this pizza place formerly owned Dino's in Harrisburg, and this new place is just as good, if not better. The pizza is delicious, the place is nice, and the staff and especially the owners are so friendly! I love this place and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting for ages for this place to open! This is the family that used to own Dino's in Harrisburg. Everything was awesome there, and at their new place, it did not disappoint. Everything is awesome!  I am so happy the finally opened. It is my new favorite place to eat!"}
{"text":"Great food and good portions, service was ok. As soon as we walked in, we stand there for a minute waiting to get seated but no one came. 3 waiters walked pass us and didn't even welcome us or say hey."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian and Greek Dishes. If you are familiar with the restaurant Dino's in Harrisburg you know that they have closed it's doors. However, if you loved their food you can find it all here!!!! They have opened at this new location. Same great taste, as well as some new dishes on the menu! You can't go wrong. Stop by and enjoy the friendly hospitality. Great family place!"}
{"text":"I had the gyro plate, I really loved the salad and the meat and pita bread. Next time I'm in town I'm trying the pizza. I'm hoping the add dolmades. Those would complete this lol, and some Greek potatoes. Really enjoyed."}
{"text":"I live nearby and I'm so glad to welcome the former \"Dino's\" family back to the area!  Their food is so good and the pizza's are to die for.  This is my \"go to\" Italian spot...great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Visit date 3/6/18:   FOOD: I had the create you own Stromboli (see photo) and It was REALLY GOOD and pretty BIG. I also had the baklava which was also REALLY GOOD (see photo).   INSIDE: they have 3 Big TV about a 55 or 65 inch playing sports channel on. It's clean inside. With plenty of seats and table. They have a outdoors seating area, I did not see any chairs and tables outside but I'm sure they will have them outside soon.   EMPLOYEES: they have a lot of teens working, thats good because they are giving teens job opportunities. I overheard one manager tell one the waiter \"it's ok to make mistake because that's how you learn and as long as you learn from it\", I thought that was nice to teach them.   TIP TO MANAGEMENT: I would have a sign maybe hanging up letting people know where to go like a \"pay here/ Togo orders\". I walked in and told them I wanted to place a togo order. So I looked at the menu. When I was done looking at the menu I got up where the hostess would stand. Finally after standing there for about 1 minute or so I was informed where to order."}
{"text":"Great selection and good service. I got chicken tenders and salad. Prices are pretty good also."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have another great dinner spot in the University area! I have now been by 3 times and will  be back. The menu has a nice assortment of Italian, Pizza, American so you can meet almost any craving and appeal to anyone in your party. The pizza is good, not what I would consider New York style but hearty and delicious. The chicken tenders are homemade and appear to be breaded in house. My personal favorite is the cheese/loaded fries! Great cheese and bacon and a garlic flavor on the fries to make them even more delicious!"}
{"text":"Formally Dino's in Harrisburg  Best food!! Missed this place when it closed. Highly recommended this for Pizza and all Italian foods. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"I discovered this place picking up a customer.. I drive for Lyft part time in the evening. Her food smelled so good I turned around and came right back after dropping her off. I ordered Chicken Parm, way more and way better than expected. I will be back! Friendly, quick service.."}
{"text":"We dined in, I ordered a calzone.  They brought the wrong one by accident which I had already cut into, it was supposed to go to the table next to us.  Waitress took it away. There was no apology.  The guy whose calzone I almost ate got a new one, ate it and paid all before I got my new one.  It was 40 minutes.  No apology.  Went up to the counter to pay was was surprised the calzone was actually still on my bill.  I pointed it out to the guy behind the register, he said to The manager (owner I'm assuming?). \"This is the lady that got the wrong calzone\". I heard her mumble something, never turned around to apologize for the inconvenience.  They took the calzone off the bill but still charged me for the two toppings.  The calzone was delicious , but I'll never dine in again."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Tons of seating and great atmosphere. The restaurant was decorated nice and service was great! Missed these guys when they were Dinos and I am happy to see their success continue to serve their locals their amazing dishes. I missed my Dinos, so when they opened I knew what I was going to get and let me tell you, it did NOT disappoint!  Welcome back guys! Your #1 fan!"}
{"text":"Fantastic affordable dining. A variety of entrees to choose from. A+ service The Buffalo shrimp is really good. Have tried Pizza, sandwiches and pasta they are EXCELLENT. Large servings at affordable price."}
{"text":"I'll be back!! Service and food were great! I think I've found my favorite pizzeria! My stromboli was perfect! Can't wait to have room for dessert."}
