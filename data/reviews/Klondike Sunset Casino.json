{"text":"STOP EVERYTHING! There's a baller in the house.  This place roles out the red carpet for you if you spend $40 bucks, its the best.  Me and a couple of guys came here and spend maybe $60 between us all.  They gave us drinks the whole time and even opend up a table for us.  They have 10 cent roulette and $2 black jack.  Take $100 bucks there and go ape shit! It will be money well spent."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went to Klondike Friday nite for the breakfast special and OMG it was so good! Everything we ordered was perfect! This is the place to go for food and play!"}
{"text":"This was the most depressing casino I'd ever been in in my life. The place looks like it's ready to die. Half of the tv's and machines at the bar were turned off. The tables were covered and dusty and the beer on tap tasted skunky and old. The woman at the cashier was in to her book and and there was no excitement or energy in the place. If you've dealt with tragedy and adversity and need to feel better about yourself go to the Klondike and be reminded that it could always be worse."}
{"text":"Second time there. Went for their $1.49 breakfast which was not bad. Went again tonight to try the dinners. first of all after about a 10 minute wait (only 3 tables occupied) one of the servers told our server we were waiting, his remark to her was I already have a table, you take care of them. After about 20 minutes someone came to take our order. I had the prime rib which was absolutely horrible, it came cold and could not chew. Husband had the Nachos which was a huge portion but was cold and chips were stale. Could not get any ones attention to send both orders back. Would NOT recommend this place to anyone. Sorry I did not go to the Rainbow Casino they have the best prime rib and you get a choice of soup or salad with your dinner. The Casino only had about 15 people playing and it was dinner time.  STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"Review for Sarah's . Just had breakfast. Ok casino food. But 2.29 for coffee, give me a break. That was half of my total. Next time, I'm bringing my own or just sticking to water. Quit ripping off customers."}
{"text":"came here on Friday morning to have breakfast bacon and eggs  2.99 can't beat it. The hostess greeted us she was very nice & and the server was also very nice. I like the fact that you could look outside when your dining it's going to be very nice to sit outside and eat breakfast in a local Casino Restaurant Sarah's Diner"}
{"text":"Food is good service is very bad. The chefs assistant encouraged us to stay. Lipstick on my water glass. Not returning. So sad"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this casino for its breakfast food since 2004. HANDS DOWN this is the best bang for your breakfast buck. No joke you could feed an army on even the tightest budget. The service has gone down hill since the asian or hispanic girl (sorry Im an ass I cant tell what she is) replaced the regular waitress whos been theyre for like 5+ years BUT if your willing to put up with bad service you wont be disapointed cause this is where quality meets value and thats a rare marriage! Ohh also BONUS if you go early on sundays youll get to here the chatter of the older gentlemean talking about politics, the war, how things are today... its really entertaining. I love em!! And they are all totally chill with toddlers.. We got a 1.5 y/o and shes pretty well behaved, the older crowd really dig her. On a gay note, no one cares. lol"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite breakfast place. Great breakfast choices and very affordable..."}
{"text":"The new Klondike should not still have reviews from the old Klondike.  Brings their stars down unnecessarily.  That being said.  Got the $4.99 breakfast special Chicken Fried Steak.  Tender enough to use a fork.  The gravy was amazing.  BF got the $5.99 Steak and Eggs.  Tender quality meat and cooked exactly as he asked.  Definitely look forward to more meals here.  Great prices.  Great food."}
{"text":"It's date night, was looking for something new and close to home. The service ,food and games are great.  We will be back."}
{"text":"So unorganized. Flies in the food area, since they opened the doors to the outside. Visited ONLY to see a free comedy show. There is no \"comedy club\". It was held in Sarah's Kitchen, where other people were eating and didn't know about a show. Why would they put a show in there, when they cannot accomodate accordingly? Very, very small venue. Would not recommend, even for a free show. Would not trust the food, with the flies roaming around - they were so overwhelmed that so many ready plates were left on the counter for the flies to taste before the customers - made us change our mind about ordering.. Would not come back ever again because even the customers that come here are such trash that they don't even understand the concept of a line. No courtesy, just cut. It's ridiculous to come here and stress my party and I did not have to deal with."}
{"text":"Wow! After a year,  Paul,  the bartender is a NINJA!  We've been coming here for a year. .. yet, when he refills a drink we never see him, he's a ninja... omg!  Best service in henderson!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying that one of the great things about the original Klondike, was the value. For $1.99 you could get a great cheeseburger, made of freshly ground beef, on a toasted bun, with steak fries. The taste was fantastic. So I eagerly awaited the re-opening of this place, hoping that once again I would have a place to get a great old school cheese burger. Today I tried the new Klondike, yes the price of the burger increased 500%, I expected that, things have gone up in the last 15 years. However I did not expect the burger I got. It was a 1/2 pound frozen patty on a type of bun that was called a name I could not pronounce. The burger was totally tasteless, it had all the flavor of a piece of cardboard. The fries were nothing special. And when I asked the waitress to please leave the pickle off the plate, because I don't like the taste of pickles, it comes with one anyway so my crappy bun is soaking up the pickle juice. I could not even finish this terrible meal. All this at 500% more. I won't be back. It a shame that the current generation running these places has zero concept of the value this town was built on. I guess old Vegas truly is gone for good."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast today... Once sitted it took a while for the waitress to get our order, after waiting at least 30 minutes and watching 2 tables that came in after us being served we left of course paying for 2 cups of coffee and a hot tea ( which water was cold couldn't get the waitress attention) which was 6.00 plus tax outrageous. We will not be back"}
{"text":"Some people should not work in a Casino or with customers. Last night had a very good example of why this statement is true and I am looking for a new home among other small scale casinos.  Also do not eat there at the restaurant as they are not competitive with small business casinos in the area.  I  eat when I am upset, but I became more upset from poor pricing.  They have one more chance to upset me before I walk out and not return for good."}
{"text":"I don't know what was worse, the food or the service, it wasn't even busy. Not worth it."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Klondike, and so I ordered the $1.50 Breakfast special to check the staple selling point of this place.  I've had Rainbows breakfast special, and wanted to see how they stack up w Klondike. Service was a bit awkward, the wait staff isn't really confident...it's not awful but definitely choppy.  Cafe is clean and open and not too smoky smelling. We sat outside as it was a nice morning.  The food was good-I being a vegan only ate my toast and hash browns (to which I had them add some veggies and it came out delicious!). They charged me $.50 per veggie added.  I also got hot tea, which I liked the mug size was big & good, and the honey plentiful. Thumbs up on that.  I'll definitely come here again. It's nothing fancy -but fits the bill for a quick-cheapy-breaky fix."}
{"text":"If you ever find yourself in the middle of the desert off the beaten path from Vegas, you need to stop by the Klondike Sunset Casino.  Parking is easy.  The lot is well lit and the staff are friendly and welcoming.  This is a non hotel casino that offers a bar, cafe, slots but no table games.  It is a small place that appeals to few locals and me.    I popped in here with a buddy as we were on a quest to visit each casino that we haven't already been to.  This was one on the list.   I liked the layout of the place.  The selection of slots was decent too.  There were only a handful of people in here, including staff which was perfect.    I noticed it wasn't smokey at all, which is what you'd expect with a smaller casino.  There's a small sports betting area with huge Tvs.  They were showing old wrestling matches of Ric Flair. Wooooooooooooooooooooooo!  The cafe was closed off with chairs blocking access but apparently it was open.  You just have to order with the bartender.   Made some money after a few minutes and was back on the road.   Will probably be back again as we plan on visiting the Skyline and Jokers Wild Casino on our next trip.  Thanks Klondike Sunset Casino, be back soon."}
{"text":"This is another little out of the way locals casino (Non Hotel). This was an upbeat, lively place. They have a KILLER happy hour from 3p-6p. The Happy Hour consists of a PITCHER of beer and wings for $5! I had to ask that a couple of times because i didn't believe it. You can also get 1/2 price drinks at happy hour. Unlike other joints, they'll serve you their entire menu while you sit at the bar and not just a limited menu (score!!)  Prices here are very reasonable, oh and if you smell popcorn ask the bartender for some- they give it out complimentary while you are at the bar as well.  Nice place."}
{"text":"OK, so first off this is not a mega casino so don't go there expecting a Caesar's or MGM property layout. That being said I went there for the affordable meals have to see what that was all about. The casino area itself is a bit smokey so I couldn't hang very long due to asthma. I read the digital sign outside that told me of the 5.55 deal on the prime rib special so I went to the rewards center area to grab my rewards card. The lady working the rewards area was very nice and friendly and she gave me the scoop on the different specials going on in the casino and in a minute or two I have my rewards card. I proceeded to the diner which was really nice and dealt with a very pleasant staff. The layout is really cool it looks partially like a diner and has the stools near the counter and also booths and tables. The menu Isn't that large but does offer quite a bit of variety so there's a little something for everyone. You can't beat the prices on the menu they offer early bird specials as well as late night. FYI on Thursdays seniors get to eat for half off not including the specials.  my mom and I opted for the prime rib special which includes potato and veggies originally 8.99 but with our Rewards member card 5.55. I'm not a very big prime rib fan but for the price it was pretty good. Will gladly come by again to give their breakfast ago or anytime I'm trying to grab a meal on the cheap."}
{"text":"Just a little update-  The Klondike no longer offers any table games. So no more 10 cent roulette and no more $2 blackjack. This was a huge surprise because the 10 cent roulette was the huge draw of this joint. Without the table games, all you're left with is an extremely run down casino that has such a thick layer of cigarette smoke wafting around that it's like you're walking through a Vegas gambler's fog. I think the only thing that's left are the slot machines... I wouldn't be surprised if they tear this place down and start over from scratch. Might be the best thing. (by the way, I was going to rate this place 4 stars if they still offered the table games, but with those gone, there's nothing left to draw you in)"}
{"text":"As my family and I were heading back Home from LA we decided to stop by this place because my mom was dying for some Prime Rib. I've never heard of this place before, but my mom said she had been there previously when it opened or reopened (I was told that they remodeled).  Easy to find off of Sunset Rd and they have their own parking lot! As I walked in I noticed that it's actually a Casino with a restaurant. I can't speak much for the Casino side other than it definitely does look remodeled and more modern than those station casinos and is very well catered to locals :) I did also notice that the casino portion had lots of 3x points on certain days, so check that out if you like slots!   The restaurant portion looked clean and modern as well, but the stars go out for the specials at this place! They have daily specials as well as dinner and breakfast specials! I definitely recommend the Prime Rib! (I got it as a dinner special and it came as a large piece of prime rib with potatoes and veggies, as well as a heaping bowl of au jus!) Cashiers as well as servers were pretty enthusiastic and I'm glad that they have great customer service. Thanks, Florentino! I'll definitely be back when I'm craving Prime Rib!"}
{"text":"Three words:  Ten.  Cent.  Roulette.  The restaurant isn't open anymore.  The blackjack tables are also closed now.  But roulette, oh ever so loving, ever so cheap, ever so wonderful way to kill time while you're in Vegas.  And of course, you get drinks - while you play ... TEN CENT ROULETTE.  I hope this place never closes.  We go here everytime, just to make sure.  Just to make 'one last visit.'  In case our next trip doesn't grant us the luxury.  Don't worry about it being far from the strip - your wallet will thank you.  Most of the staff has been transferred to Jokers Wild already, so they do have some new ones in, but well, you can't blame em.  After all, they are getting tipped off dimes, not dollars.  They also have the Leroy's kiosk for your UFC bets (or whatever other sports you must bet on)."}
{"text":"This is a rejuvenated place very spacious and clean, full bar Paul bartender is extremely down to earth person very friendly makes you feel at home, staff are also very friendly, I highly recommend this place, the restaurant also has a full restaurant menu will be visiting this place more often you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great prime rib dinner for only $5.50 with players card. Cheapest prime rib dinner in vegas. That's in Sarah's kitchen."}
{"text":"Always a good time at the Klondike! 10 cent roulette cannot be any better. Can easily play with $20-40 while getting free drinks. We go with friends and bring out of town guests. They usually only have 1 table open, sometimes two. I don't know their exact hours but good times to go are Sun-Thur 3-8pm. Sometimes I'll call ahead to see if there are any colors available. Nice and fun staff there too!"}
{"text":"After the unfortunate death of the Klondike's owner back in 2014 when they closed it down they brought upon new owners to recognize that there still could be some revenue that could be generated from this casino. I know when I cruised through it back in 2007-ish it was very smokey and didn't appeal to me much at all. Now they have cleaned it up some, it wasn't as smokey as before, it looks to be ok now for locals to go in be entertained.   The floorman greeted me at the door when I enter through. It's still a very small casino with the main bar in the middle of the casino floor. They have a sports betting area, no table betting but lots of slot machine's play. The cocktail waitresses were looking pretty good, had everyone serviced at a pretty steady and good pace. I went and tried their only restaurant in the casino to see how it was (review coming up). All-in-all a decent casino if you want small, not so crowded slot play fun and entertainment."}
{"text":"We once again visited this casino for the $1.49 breakfast special that includes a pair eggs, 3 slices of bacon, toast and home fries.  On arrival there were tables available, but they had not been bused so we had to wait for several minutes.  On being seated in a booth it took several minutes for the waiter, aka the sloth, to acknowledge our existence and bring us menus.  Several minutes later when he returned to take our order we took the opportunity to request silverware.  The breakfast very good especially considering the nominal price tag.  Whether we return is dependent on the casino's bankruptcy proceedings because it is either going to be closed or sold to new owners who may or may not continue the special."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty decent casino for locals. Their payouts are better than average and their staff is always friendly.  This place used to be a total dive casino a few years ago. It actually closed down and new owners recently bought it and renovated it. It looks nothing like it used to and everything is new.  The bar has a small draft selection, including 805 and one local offering in the form of Crafthaus's IPA. The bartenders are always friendly and they comp quarter play. Just remember to take care of them by tipping.  As mentioned above, the payouts, at least at the quarter level and higher, are better than your average casino or bar. Places with payouts this good are getting harder to find (any place the stations own, like the wildfires, will be tighter).  There are no tables here, but they do have the machine versions of roulette and craps. They have your usual selection of slots and the place isn't usually that crowded.  The players club runs a lot of fun events like free bingo on certain days of the week. They also run promotions like giving out Smiths gift cards for play. My only gripe is that when this place first opened they gave out lots of free play, and now we're lucky to get five dollars. I've even overheard employees talking about how stingier the free play is now than it used to be.  Note, this review is on the Casino only. Their restaurant is called Sarah's Kitchen and I reviewed it separately. The Café is decent, with some good specials, but nothing to go out of your way for.  This is a pretty good casino and I would recommend it over Wildfire Sunset (or Sunset Station) if you want to gamble a bit."}
{"text":"I like this casino. Kind of folksy. Clean. I happened to visit on a Thursday so my meal(senior) was half price. Decent good. They have free bingo games for seniors too. So you can visit with little to no money!"}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Klondike Casino. I came here to basically have some breakfst in their amazing cafe/diner. I stayed and played a little on the machines. I was only playing a few minutes when I was offered a drink which arrived promptly. Only a diet Coke since it was still early in the day. I won a little on one machine. (was only playing nickles). And was able to play for a bit longer. Killed some great time while waiting for my windows to be tinted down the road.  Thank you for hanging at the Klondike. It's a local casino with not many machines but lots of character. Stop, eat and play."}
{"text":"Sahara kitchen....very reasonable prices specials all day 24/7....I ordered fried chicken mashed potatoes gravy side 2 biscuits big fresh green beans came with bowl French onion soup to die for. Classidy waitress was very nice a little slow but worth it , my daughter had prime rib and shrimp. First one was to tough, she got another one it was perfect. We also ordered food to go. My brother got 1/2 lb burger fries yum. Also the big club sandwich. All was worth the money. Smoke free plenty of seating. The booths were huge for people with a tummy lol. 4dinners 1soup 2 waters 42.00 bucks!!!! 3tip. Not sure if i left her enough but i felt it was,,,,,I Can't wait to go back and try the liver and onions"}
{"text":"Terrible service! It's everybody else's fault! The  food is pretty good. The prices are average. The casino managers could care less!"}
{"text":"Arrived around 10:45am restaurant was pretty busy got seated within 5 minutes busboy took my drink order then I waited and I waited waitresses walked by and I waited watched a couple of walk out (shame). Finally I stopped a passing waitress who thought someone else had taken my order. She took my order and within minutes my breakfast was served. All I can say is wow, 4.99 chicken fried steak n eggs were fantastic. The server more than repaired the frustration. I'll be back"}
