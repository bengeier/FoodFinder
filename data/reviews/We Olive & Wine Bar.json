{"text":"Lovely place.  It is great to have an upscale wine tasting bar in this area.  The owner/s are charming people and excellent hosts.   I have visited twice this week, once alone and once with a group - in both situations the service was excellent as was the cuisine and, of course, the wine.  Can't wait until I can visit again.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Soooo....My godmother and I happened upon this gem about 6 months ago and since then, we've been back numerous times. Normally, we go for the olive oils and balsamic vinaigrettes, which are amazingly fresh and flavorful. However, today we decided to dine in and we could not have been happier. The food was wonderful, and that along with the stellar service and overall kindness of Vaughn, Karen and Ms. Glenda ensured that we will be coming back as regulars. You all are doing an awesome job there and we will be back asap...with friends!"}
{"text":"I visited this place on a Sunday afternoon and it was not busy at all which was nice. It's very clean and organized and the staff were very friendly. Von, I believe knew so much about wine and everything that goes with it. You can tell him and the other employee are very passionate about their craft. I'm pretty uneducated when it comes to wine so it was very nice to learn from these gentleman. The food was great and the wine was too. We even got a free sample of several of their olive oils. I highly recommend we olive wine bar! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Vaughan and Karen have it going on. The elegance of a wine bar and a tasting of awesome cooking oils. We have been there a few times and will always go back. The food is perfect and they both are amazing at paring wine with food. Oh, if you are not a wine drinker, no worries, the beer selection is phenomenal."}
{"text":"What a gem this place is! I am from out of town and walked in by myself. I was immediately greeted with a smile and warm welcome. The owners were engaging and delightful and the food was wonderful. Great place! I will go out of my way to visit again when I am back in Arizona."}
{"text":"The wife and I tried this place on our date night tonight. Short story, awesome atmosphere, friendly staff, and very good wine and food. We will be back."}
{"text":"Glad to have a wine bar in the west valley! These guys know their stuff too. They took care in picking in the wines they put on their menus. They have some great craft beers available as well. Have not tried the olive oils they carry, but I'm sure they'll compare to the wine choices. Great atmosphere, very inviting and I like the music choice."}
{"text":"This place is NOT a wine bar! The wines are terrible and the food (appetizers)over priced! The entire time all they did was try to sell us their over priced olive oils! Don't see this place staying in business long! Will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, relaxing place for a glass of wine and light bite to eat.  Owners are gracious and so pleasant.  Olive oils and balsamic's are fresh and flavorful!  Love this place!  Also some different bottled craft beers."}
{"text":"Just tried this place. The food is great and the service is informative and friendly. I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Very nice surprise.  Nice clean relaxing atmosphere.  Soft Jazz music set to the perfect volume.  Karen and her staff were very friendly.  Definitely be back next Friday for their wine tasting event."}
{"text":"Lauren and I were looking for a place to go for our Thursday outing.  What an amazing time we had.  The staff was wonderful and knew so much.  I am looking forward to going back for a number of their events.  Like the wine maker one,  olive oil 101 and we can't forget the vinegar.  Space is limited so reserve yours now.  While we were there we recorded a bit about We Olive.  Check it out on Medelberg's Travel Services."}
{"text":"Just attended my second wine tasting at We Olive.  I had such an awesome time.  Pours were very generous and Jeff McCarty, the Sommelier, was extremely knowledge.  This place is a hidden jewel.  Tucked in a corner storefront in the Kohls, Joann's, Beauty Brands and Sprouts shopping area right on the north west side of McDowell and Litchfield Road.  The owners, Karen and Vaughan offer a great selection of wines, numerous interesting flavors of balsamic vinegars, premium olive oils, and a great selection of jams, spreads, and hot sauces.  They have a small kitchen that turns out the most wonderful interesting noshes.  Service is always above and beyond.  Wednesdays they offer half priced bottles of wine and select appetizers.  I loved the goat cheese stuffed, prosciutto wrapped dates with orange balsamic reduction.  Their charcuterie platter includes duck salami.  It's a must try.  They serve speciality cheeses and homemade dips. Yeah, I am loving this place."}
{"text":"Just finished spending time here. What an awesome experience. The owners are beautiful people, kind, caring and very knowledgeable. We bought some jalapeño olive oil and some pear balsamic vinegar. Tried the BBQ flatbread and it was so good we ordered another one!  Had a great time here. Will be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  the service was fantastic and the wine was desirable.   I had the unique Balsamic Champaign.   the flavor was new but i would recommend it to anyone with a sensitive pallet."}
{"text":"All of us at Medelberg's Travel Services had an amazing time at We Olive the staff are so knowledgeable and kind! We made a video about it! Go to our YouTube channel Medelberg's Travel Services to view it!"}
{"text":"Super cute little place in Avondale. Unexpectedly good! Appetizers were yummy and happy hour wine deals were reasonable. Owner was very sweet and knowledgeable. Will definitely be coming back here. Not very many tables, but wasn't overcrowded which was nice. Really enjoyed my time here. Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!  Came in to buy some olive oil and ended up with wine , dinner and snacks!  My husband liked the craft beer too.  Amazing place! Owners were very knowledgeable about olive oil.  They were fun to talk to."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've done a review on here. But I had to mention this place we visited last night.

First: when you walk in, you'll notice a clean environment and well maintained area. Very relaxed atmosphere with very nice music playing in the background.

Second: because there isn't a lot of seating, there is more of a one on one feeling with the owner Karen at the bar discussing her knowledgeable reviews and opinions on wines to your individual tastes. (Even for those of us who know nothing about the intricacies of wine). But she was a delight to talk to.

Third: the wine and food were amazing. If your worried about price..........then go to McDonald's. This place is worth the time I spent with my fiancée talking, listening to relaxing music, eating delicious food and having a glass of wine together. 

Forth: it was nice to meet Vaughn and let him know the food was amazing. When he brought the cheese, dip and meat platter out, he was very knowledgeable and explained each individual item on the plate to us without even asking. He also recommended some classes coming up with olive oil 101, which the fiancée and I are interested in because we cook with olive oil instead of butter any day.

Fifth but not least: we had a long discussion with Cheyenne about olive oils and healthy eating and I was amazed at her knowledge of these areas. It's nice to come to a place where you feel welcomed and everyone knows their job. Cheyenne recommended a lot of great ideas and the fiancée walked out with a bottle of garlic olive oil for the night. 

I highly recommend trying this place out. You won't regret it. Again, if your worried about price.....go to some dive bar where you can be treated like dirt for free....or enjoy a relaxed atmosphere, with your loved one or friends, where you just feel welcomed.

Four thumbs up for We Olive, from my fiancée and I."}
{"text":"Great shop, friendly owners and knowledgeable staff. The wine bar and special dishes featuring their products were unique and delicious. Looking forward to visiting them again"}
{"text":"Wow, we had an absolutely amazing experience. The owners are incredibly knowledgeable. I will definitely frequent this establishment."}
{"text":"Stopped by with the hubby today and this place is a hidden jem. Great wine, excellent olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The really great thing about this place is the people. This is a family owned and operated business. They are incredibly knowledgeable and very friendly. We were very impressed, bought way too much, and will certainly come again."}
{"text":"Very knowledgeable staff that provide excellent customer service. A warm and friendly place ideal for date night or a fun night out with friends; either way it's the place to go to enjoy fine wine tastings, beer, food along with the highest quality olives oils and vinegars that you can enjoy and take home. Highly recommend Camp Verde Provisioner red blend. Bon appetito!!!"}
{"text":"I can not say enough nice things about Karen and Vaughn. We came in not knowing what to expect and Vaughn explained everything to us in a way that had us hanging on his every word. Never could I have imagined how detailed and complex olive oils could be. These are the nicest people you could ever meet and they work hard to earn you patronage. They serve great food, delicious wines and unique exciting beers and they do it without breaking your wallet. If you don't think a wine and olive bar is your thing, think again. Even though the space is gorgeous and has an air of sophistication, there is no pretentiousness here. You're eyes will be opened
and your taste buds will thank you. Allow yourself this experience."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Very informative.  Great food & wine.  Bought some goodies......(Pear Balsamic Vinegar, Sake/Wasabi Mustard & Truffle Cheese Salt).  Cannot wait to use them!"}
{"text":"We went if for date night. Food and wine were excellent.  We had the dates wrapped in prosciutto with a balsamic vinegar that was thick and amazing.  The owners were there and very knowledgeable about the food and wine.  I was a little confused about the name of the place and why so much of the space was retail space for their flavored olive oils.  If you are looking for specialty olive oils, they have them. We were not. The west side needs a fun place to have wine with gourmet appetizers."}
{"text":"A group of 8 did an \"after-work-happy hour\" and it was the best decision I made that day to attend.  Half bottles of wine on Wednesday, discounted very tasty appetizers 4-6pm,  superb customer service while relaxing to jazz music and great wine.  My first time visiting the establishment but will not be my last. OH!  if you like olive oils drop in to do free tastings and grab some of their recipe cards for happy cooking."}
{"text":"Definitely a must try the owner is very friendly.. the atmosphere is relaxing and you also get to try the olive oils which are awesome!"}
{"text":"Have you ever walked into a specialty shop, looked around, and thought to yourself \"oh crap, I love this place and I'm going to spend a lot of money here!\"?  We knew the moment that we walked in the door that we were going to walk away wanting everything, and we weren't disappointed. 

We were told about this by our waiter from a restaurant we frequently go to down the street.  He told us that there were big kegs of all kinds of delicious olive oils and vinegars and even though it sounded weird we had to go and check it out.

We walked in just at closing time but were welcomed anyway.  The owner, Vaughn was unbelievably helpful and spent a lot of time with us.  We went away with some olive oil, the best aged balsamic vinegar we have EVER had, and some spices.  Yes, balsamic vinegar and olive oil, I can't even explain to you how good it is.  I couldn't wait to open our bottles and start using it.  The very next day I made some homemade Italian bread and used the oil and vinegar to dip (so good!)  we have used it to marinate meats, and so much more.  

We haven't eaten in the restaurant but we are excited to dine and try some wines.  After talking with the owner and hearing his passion for good food, we know it's all going to be delicious!  

What I did see with the restaurant is that Vaughn and Karen treat each and every customer as though they are guests in their home.  We walked away feeling like we had made some great new friends.  I always love a small restaurant with that feel.  We will be back very soon for some more goodies from the store and a nice dinner with some great people."}
{"text":"Excellent array of wine choices as well as superb small bites to please any palette. I highly recommend and definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Finally!  A gourmet experience in Avondale.  Owners offer excellent customer service.  Very knowledgeable and so friendly.  Please support this beautiful store."}
{"text":"I have nothing to say except:
- a calm environment
- delectable, gourmet food
- exclusive and select wines
- sweetest owners ever!!

Seriously, what more could you ask for? 1/2 off wine bottles on Wednesdays? They have that too"}
{"text":"OMG.. Von, Karen and Cheyenne.. great hosts, great wine and fantastic dates with goat cheese, walnuts, blood orange balsamic, Meyer lemon olive oil. Best value for great wine and food in the Avondale area."}
{"text":"I love finding gems like this, especially in the west valley. Locally owned, friendly service and yummy food and wine. While it's a small dining area in the back of the store, the ambience was nice enough for a casual anniversary lunch date. We ordered the wrapped/stuffed dates (would have preferred crispy bacon or cold prosciutto instead of the heated prosciutto), caprese panini and side salad, and charcuterie plate. All very tasty and worth coming back for. Great spot for a date, lunch with friends or spot for out of town guests. Ask about the rewards program too."}
{"text":"Great venue with amazing service. I would suggest this place to all my friends and family. We will be back! We suggest tasting the wines and then ordering a glass you love. Fun!!"}
{"text":"A hidden Gem

We Olive & Wine has an excellent choices of wines. 
The atmosphere is welcoming and friendly. In addition, to the amazing wine selection, We Olive & Wine offers a light fare; cheese and meat, panini's, small salads. 

So nice to have a place with a great atmosphere, service, great wine and light fare. You can also shop for fine olive oils; that have been correctly pressed and not overly processed.

A \"hidden gem\" in the shopping mall, close to Kohls and Sprouts, once you find We Olive and Wine, it will become your hidden gem."}
{"text":"Came for a bite with my hubby and my friend joined us! The service was amazing and so top-notch:) the food was fresh and superb with the olive oil they sell right here. The location is great for lunch or dinner, especially after shopping at the department stores next door."}
{"text":"Amazing wine. Olive oils, and apps! I had a mimosa with peach olive oil and it was superb!! You have to stop by!"}
{"text":"This is going to be one of me and my husband's favorite spots! I walked in and immediately called my husband to come and meet me. They have a nice selection of great quality and flavored oils and balsamic vinegars. There is also a nice bar and tables for wine sampling, meat/cheese plates and small dishes. It was a nice, relaxing atmosphere. We sampled a little of everything and we left with wine, oil, and mustard. I'll definitely be back soon! Please check out and support this small business!"}
{"text":"Good wine and small plates.  The staff was excellent.  A very welcoming place.  Handled our Meet-up group of 12 people with ease.  Can't wait to try my olive oil with lemon.  I wish them the very best in their endeavor."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. Bought some of their own olive oil. They do flights to taste. I bought the lemon Meyer oil with aged white vinegar. So amazing. The owners are very nice. They also have custom bottles for party favors, gift baskets, etc. Worth the drive from the north valley! Highly suggested."}
{"text":"We celebrated a birthday at WeOlive and had a wonderful time.  WeOlive has it all - beautiful atmosphere, tasty wine and top-notch food.  Thank you Karen for taking excellent care of us and accommodating our large group! I recommend WeOlive to everyone!"}
{"text":"went here to enjoy some wine for my birthday.  It's a really low key spot that's also an olive oil store- who wouldn't love shopping while drinking wine? it was cozy and welcoming.  Don't remember the name of the staff, but looking through the pics;one was the co owner.  They were all so helpful and diligent.  We didn't feel rushed- mind you 2 of us sat to finish a bottle, lol.  I would recommend this place to anyone interested in enjoying a glass of wine with a side of conversation. :)"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to unwind at the end of the week. Service is outstanding and the atmosphere is peaceful. The food is perfect for wine or craft beer and is geared toward snacking while catching up with friends. I have built a large selection of different olive oils, rubs and vinegar's from their store as well."}
{"text":"Love this place I get the best olive oil and balsamic vinegars from here! They always have a killer wine menu with good appetizers to share here too. If you're looking for high quality and good sourced California olive oil this is the place to get it."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Very knowledgeable and polite, huge plus the restrooms were clean and smelled great!!! Enjoyed hearing about the different wines and olive oil. Great for lunch or just a small intimate convo with a date."}
{"text":"Good wine, delicious bites, fun selection of oils and balsamics. I would recommend stopping by to check it out for a taste or even a light meal."}
{"text":"Anytime I'm in Avondale, I'll be stopping here. The couple that run this are adorable, food is AMAZING, and wine is fantastic. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Support local. I've been here once and can't wait to go back. The wine selection was excellent. I ordered the albariño. I also ordered the meat plate, to die for! Everything paired well and very flavorful. The service was excellent!  I was able to meet the husband and wife owners. They were so friendly and personable.  The place was very clean and well decorated. There seems to be a good selection of olive oils and balsamic vinegars, which I can't wait to try. Do yourself a huge favor and come to this place."}
{"text":"Ridiculously overpriced and completely misleading when you actually see the food that you get.

I will never be getting food from this place again. It's a joke. There's nothing \"artisan\" about the food. Bread from Walmart, cheese from Sprouts or Trader Joe's. 

If you have money to waste and are craving Super Bowl appetizers that are a bit fancied up, knock yourself out."}
{"text":"Spectacular service, warm and friendly environment, delicious food at a great price. Great selection of craft beers and custom wine selection.  Offers awesome selection of oils and vinegars, difficult to leave without a few bottles of something special."}
{"text":"This is a fun and friendly place with great food and tasty olive oils and balsamics. The wine bar makes it a great place to meet up with friends and the staff was super helpful."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Such a breath of fresh air from the normal chain restaurants and shops. The service is friendly and the owners are readily available to answer questions and offer assistance. This shop/restaurant is 30 miles from my home but worth the drive."}
{"text":"You have to go here and meet Karen and Vaughn.  I think you can get wine to fit all types of personalities.  However, the quaint atmosphere and owners make this place a hot spot to visit.  Wednesday's they have 1/2 price wine."}
{"text":"Met up with a couple of friends for the cheese and charcuterie plate as well as the hummus with dukkah. The food was pretty good but portions were small. I personally thought the hummus was the more memorable appetizer as it was topped with tapenade and dukkah spices.

As an olive oil connoisseur, I was disappointed with the selection. I stick to unflavored oils with lots of peppery and grassy notes. There was only one oil that met that criteria. There were many other gourmet goodies to consider though and this is a nice little shop for any foodie."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic in every way! Came here with a friend for drinks and appetizers and got so much more! The service was great, the food was awesome, and the experience is one I would like to repeat. I look forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I visited this location a few times and was never open. The hours placed on the door are 10:am to 6:pm. Although visiting on various times still not open I would like to try again."}
{"text":"We were in town for Spring Training and looking for a nice but comfortable place for dinner and saw We Olive on Yelp.  Our actual experience was even better than the other reviews! Karen and her husband warmly welcomed us and treated us like family.  

We enjoyed wine tastings and selected a glass to have with food, while my hubby had a craft beer.  I liked the wine selections and the option to buy tastings (I bought multiple tastings to make a flight). The cheese and charcuterie plate was good, but the most memorable dishes were the proscuitto wrapped dates in blood orange olive oil (I want them again now!) and the dips.  I'm watching my carbs, and they gladly brought extra veggies for the dips to have as an alternative to crackers.  

Overall, it was a very fun evening with nice wines, tasty foods and amazing hospitality! We just wish we could've brought the little shoppe home with us, and look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Love! Ambience is amazing and their food menu was difficult to choose from because everything sounded delicious. The Parmesan asiago dip was amazing, if i knew they had it available in a jar to go I would have stocked up.  The chopped salad was perfect.  This is def a new fav of mine and is perfect for catching up with friends"}
