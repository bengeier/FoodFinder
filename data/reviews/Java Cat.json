{"text":"I like to come here to focus on a project.  Great coffee house vibe.  The staff clearly likes being here.  Everything is unique and delicious.  I had the soup of the day.  Baja chicken.  Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Great first-time visit.  The owner was on premises & personally welcomed me.  Very comfortable seating with fireplace.  Great choice in Tea & Bakery items.  I will be back!  Friendly neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"Java Cat is reliably wonderful. Great gelato, warm, friendly service and excellent coffee! They won't let you down!"}
{"text":"Didn't think I'd like this place (I don't like cats), but gave it a try and then another try and then I found myself stopping in a lot. Great service (!), delicious drinks and gelato. And as a mom of three kids, I am so thankful for the drive-thru. Now I just wish they'd expand to the space right next door!"}
{"text":"Reneé is amazing!  Extremely friendly and welcoming.  Great coffee, and free wifi.  I will definitely be back . Also the breakfast quesadilla was fantastic!  Thanks again!!!"}
{"text":"First time here in a few years. I definitely won't wait to come back. Coffee was excellent, service friendly and music very enjoyable. Nice job Nick."}
{"text":"I really enjoy The Java Cats house espresso roast, very smooth yet complex and full, very similar to Illy Cafe--epsresso roast, or Torrefazione Italia-- Perugia blend. I have tried well over one hundred blends and roasters over the years as an espresso business owner in Seattle, and find the Jave Cat coffee to be very well done and is worth a try if you really care what your coffee tastes like and how it is prepared. They have a great \"coffee house\" atmosphere with live music on weekends and serve fresh \"in-house\" baked goods, sandwiches, salads, and soup. Java Cats also offers superb home made gelatin and italian ices made daily, yumm."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great coffee, good food, and a comfy place to hang out and get some work done. I can't believe how friendly and efficient the staff are, even with a drive thru window to tend to as well!"}
{"text":"Java Cat! Kinda cute little place that serves a good cup of coffee along with great soups, better sandwiches, and amazing gelato.   Had a Monte Cristo there with maple syrup and chips and was very pleased. Partner was hesitant after I described it and one bite and she nearly took the entire sandwich away! Whenever we go past, we check if it is open.  Very polite staff, helpful, patient.  Only thing I have had that was not fantastic was a spiced apple cider which had about three times as much cinnamon as it should have. Serious burning pain up my nose on the first whiff."}
{"text":"Just experienced a vanilla latte at  Java Cat. Best latte I have had. Nick Mathews playing guitar really adds to the experience!"}
{"text":"Great food, especially the gelato and the breakfasts - but the sandwiches and bakery items are good also.  Can be hard to get a table on weekend mornings,  more so in the winter."}
{"text":"First time here. The place seems like every other run-of-the-mill coffee shop. The children's artwork of cats on the walls is a nice touch.  The thing that takes this place to the next level is the gelato and gelato-based drinks. I got a javalato with Mud Pie gelato, and it was great.  Definitely looking forward to coming back with my girlfriend."}
{"text":"Really happy with this place.  Only gone there a couple times but the coffee is great, affordable, and tons of options.  I really like their breakfast sandwiches, you can customize them and they make the eggs fresh for each sandwich which is definitely a plus.  Their bakery goods are really tasty too!  I've only had a muffin and lemon bar, but they were both priced nicely and quality ingredients.    Overall, this is my favorite local coffee spot so far.  Good coffee, good bakery goods, all day breakfast sandwiches, and everything is affordable.  High marks for me!"}
{"text":"Good coffee and gelato if you're hungry. The cat theme of the place borders on the extreme, but I love it. The baristas are always very considerate. Not a good place for wifi, but that's fine. Sometimes, I shouldn't be on the computer. The place can crowd up very quickly being on a busy intersection, but the quiet times make it a welcome Eastside refuge."}
{"text":"Best customer service in town; the owner introduced herself by name and gave me time to browse the menu and ask questions, without making me feel rushed.  Cozy place with lots of natural light and a cute fireplace in the corner.  The cat decor can be a little much if you're not a cat person (like myself) but that's easily made up for by the quality of the coffee and the pleasantness of the staff!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I was hesitant to stop here but when a coworker asked specifically for a breakfast sandwich from here I was thankful and hooked. Tired of the chain places, appreciate that this is local, fair trade coffee and that I can get a solid, fresh breakfast sandwich (or a yummy donut which is often my preference). The bonus of a drive up window seals the deal. I've been here four times since discovering it a month ago."}
{"text":"Awesome! Outstanding selection of coffees and teas, great baked goods and memorable daily soups. The staff are wonderful!"}
{"text":"I'm downgrading my review substantially today after making another visit to Java Cat.  The space is funky, at least for this neighborhood, and the coffee house tries to be gourmet, but there are numerous failings.  First, and it may seem trivial, but when you walk into a dark cave of a space in the summer, you don't want to see garish \"cool white\" CFL light bulbs in the track lighting.  Track lighting is meant to give warm, pinpoint accent lighting and the CFL's are harsh and blue.  Second, I ordered a BLT imagining it would be hard to screw up this sandwich.  I sat and waited way too long as the ladies behind the counter chatted away.  After more than 10 minutes someone yelled out \"did someone order a BLT?\" gesturing at the counter, where my sandwich had obviously been sitting for a while.  At no point in the ordering process did they tell me how my sandwich would be delivered or announced.  Apparently I was supposed to watch the counter.  On to the sandwich.  The BLT came on flavorless, doughy-white ciabatta type of bread and had lettuce hanging out a good two inches on all sides.  The ingredients were jammed in in an unceremonious fashion, but nevermind, I thought.  If it tastes good, I am happy.  After folding the lettuce over so that I could actually take a bite, I realized that the bacon was extremely salty and tough.  I lifted off the bread and saw that they had used bacon shaped into rounds, obviously  manufactured for use on bacon cheeseburgers and other fast-food nastiness.  The bacon was so salty and nasty that I couldn't taste the rest of the sandwich and literally had to choke the thing down.    I'm afraid that Java Cat really falls short in a city that aspires to much more.  Just down the road Crema Café does everything much better, with a flourish and a flair and with a real sense of customer service.  The new Madison Sourdough cafe on Willy Street is a great gem of a place, raising the bar on casual breakfast and lunch fare even higher.  The only thing that could possibly recommend Java Cat is their gelato, which is an unusual and refreshing offering on this side of the lake."}
{"text":"Like the coffee, love the tea!  Very nice group of people!"}
{"text":"Java Cat is a wonderful addition to our neighborhood, and an overall great little cafe. The coffee is strong, the baked goods are tasty, and the Wi-Fi is fast. I love that this spot is within a short walk of my house -- a little funky flavor reminiscent of our old Willy Street 'hood.   The only things I'd change are the hours (wish they were open later!), the temperature (it's always so cold, as another reviewer mentioned -- on one of our 95-degree days earlier this summer, I was in there wearing a hoodie); and the furniture -- it's not the coziest arrangement of bare wood tables and chairs. I love the ambiance of Mother Fools and Lazy Jane's, and I wish the owners of Java Cat would take a bit of time cozying things up in a similar way."}
{"text":"It was my first time going to Java Cat and the baristas were so helpful and very friendly. The espresso gelato was tastey and I felt like I got a good portion for the price. I will be back!"}
{"text":"It was a 90 degrees day and we didn't want to leave the car, decided to utilize the drive through. We waited 20+ minutes for the person ahead of us before it was our turn, note to self: it's faster to just go in next time.  Just needed a little pick me up and ordered iced coffee, $3.41 for a 16 oz.  Not bad, the coffee tasted decent, but kinda overpriced for plain coffee served over ice."}
{"text":"Meow Meow!  I have only had the coffee and gelato and yeh I loved them both so much I have been back many times.  The service is awesome and the baristas here are always on top of their game, and super friendly as well.    They have an drive thru which I think is awesome, especially for the east side... The Cat is pretty much the only one for good drive thru coffee in this area..  There is a large patio for spring/summer!   They also have sandwiches and soups which I am excited to get down there soon and try those out as well.   I would strongly suggest you grab a drink at the Java Cat.. you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The coffee seriously taste better from Java Cat than any other place on earth. Pure taste bud delight and always served by the friendliest staff. You can tell the owners put their heart into it! I mostly go through the drive through on my way  to work. Which is really saying something because its not really on my way to work and I work right next to a coffee shop. Java cats coffee tastes better, cost less for the quantity than most places around, including the place next to my job.   The only reason I am not giving it a 5 is its not my favorite decor style in side, kinda dark and dated looking. They really are not very accommodating to children either but I kinda love them for that, and I do have kids. If I wanted to listen to my kids loud banter while I sipped my coffee I would have drank it at home.  I do think they could use some help with the vegetarian section of the menu but personally the coffee flavor and Love I feel when I go in there make up for any short comings. Im actually sipping on a cup of joe from the shop next to my work because I was desperate and wishing it were from Java Cat instead. Which is what made me think of writing this review. Tomorrow I will leave for work earlier... Java Cat stole my heart.."}
{"text":"This little locally-owned coffee shop is a great addition to this east side neighborhood. I bought a house in the area just before Java Cat opened. In all honesty, I was concerned about how it would survive. I was totally wrong.  Several years later, Java Cat is thriving. It's always crowded and for good reason. The food is excellent. The coffee is very tasty. And don't get me started on the gelato...to die for!!   Don't forget they provide computers if you want to get some work done!  The best part about Java Cat: the drive through! What a fantastic idea. I'm happy to see this place is doing well. It's definitely worth your time and money. Very good!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to Java Cat for a few coffees before running errands on a Sunday afternoon. Java Cat definitely has that old school coffee shop vibe with an obvious love for cats. There are signs hung up all over the walls with coffee and cat lingo. Plenty of tables are available if you're in the mood to drink your coffee in House. They have bakery and hot breakfast items and some soup and sandwich type options for lunch. They also have pastry and dessert items, including gelato. Can't go wrong there.   Our coffees tasted great. I ordered an americano with a splash of steamed soy milk. It was perfect. My friend ordered an almond milk caramel latte, which she said was average, and my partner ordered a black americano. While it's hard to mess up coffees, what sets Java Cat apart from other coffee shops is its neighborhood flare, cat inspired decor and food. A nice option for those in Monona."}
{"text":"HOMEMADE GELATO. Oh, and friendly service and clientele."}
{"text":"Good strong coffee, tasty baked goods, free WiFi, friendly service and yummy gelato, combined with a diverse clientele and nice vibe--Java Cat is head and shoulders above any of the coffee chains. Really the only drawback is the very limited parking, which sometimes necessitates a bit of a walk, not a problem in good weather, but not fun during our much too long Wisconsin winter."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, good fair trade coffee and great baristas. Also love all the community outreach things they do."}
{"text":"Thank you to the Java Cat Coffee staff this morning.  Customer service was spot on- friendly, suggested menu item to me and asked the owner to make it, as she does best. Perfect cup of coffee and the best breakfast wrap in town!"}
{"text":"They take samsung pay... they have gelato... and they will make me an off menu veggie coissant sandwiches (which ROCK.  they custom make it with all the veggies, avacado, egg, and cheese).   I wish they had a larger cold brew at a slightly lower cost... but only because I want more!   Ps.  Thet have a kid frliendly area with toys.  Gotta love that."}
{"text":"I love Java Cat.  Yummy soups, sandwiches and gelato.  Love that they have maple flavoring for coffee drinks!!  The drive through rocks."}
{"text":"The good: friendly staff, convenient location, inviting atmosphere, gelato!   The 'Meh': coffee.   I'd never talk you out of going to Java Cat. The staff is awesome and the service is quick. My only gripe is the coffee is just mediocre. It's the nearest cafe to our home but I often find myself going out of my way to get something better."}
{"text":"My go to stop for coffee before work in the morning! I use the drive through most days, and it's always fast and friendly service. I've only had regular coffee & cold brew, but both are always excellent. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Heard great things, went for brunch, had eggs and toast, a bacon egg cheese sandwich on a brioche bun and a raspberry pastry. None of it was very good.  The raspberry pastry we shared was just okay but better than the mostly inedible eggs and toast. When I was looking for jam for the dry and tasteless white toast the barista just walked the other way so we tried it with honey and managed to choke down a half a piece and a bite.  The eggs were the rubbery rounds used in McMuffins with a slightly better taste, chopped up and not worth the effort of chewing. We ended up sharing the sandwich featuring overdone bacon with common cheese slice, egg round and a so-so brioche bun that tasted too sweet and shouldn't have been a choice for this sandwich. We waited too long considering only one other couple ordered food although every chair but one was filled with people on laptops and smart phones. They seem to do a brisk drive-thru business but someone reading a newspaper not eating or drinking anything was there when we arrived and left occupying the only spot not on top of everyone else. I spent over $15 bucks on a mediocre bacon, egg, cheese biscuit on a brioche bun and a pastry I wouldn't get again.  Even the cat isn't interested in the leftovers which we had to take home in a paper bag. Drive-thru coffee drinkers and cheapskates looking for free wi-fi might like this place. Parking is limited and you have to cross over steady drive-thru traffic to get to the door. Seating is cramped, there's no finesse or presentation and the service is lax. Maybe they have coffee or a kind of pastry or sandwich worth your while but I'll never go back to find out. The have a case of gelato by the door but only one of the wi-fi vampires got free samples."}
{"text":"I love the drive through on my way to work and go there about once a week.  The coffee is yummy.  I never go there for food because it isn't all that great.  They also are not at all kid friendly.  No toys or books and no changing area in the bathroom even though there's space.  If they got rid of the old computers that not many people use they'd have a nice little area for kids.  Happy Bambino is right around the corner so I think it would get used."}
{"text":"So Java Cat is tasty. It is convenient, I love their drive thru, but it is incredibly slow. Their prices are a little high but in a pinch, I pay it. I have  not had any food or gelato. Apparently, I am only addicted to their coffee. I will probably keep going back."}
{"text":"Stop what you're doing and get yourself a JavaLato! It's coffee blended with gelato and it's to die for! I get a JavaLato with chocolate gelato. The staff here is very friendly and the atmosphere is super chill. I like seeing their different art displays that show local art every time I visit the shop."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service in addition to a warm and welcoming environment will keep me a life long customer. This morning, I went to two other coffee shops trying to find the little stickers that you put over the opening on a to-go cup. I wanted it for a holiday gift for the coffee lover on my list. Everybody had them but nobody was willing to sell them until I stopped at Java Cat. Thank you for an outstanding customer service experience!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place! One of my weekend pit stops for a coffee and a single order of biscuits and gravy. Their b&g are delicious! They have a great variety of baked goods, sandwiches, breakfast all day, and gelato (plus gelato blended drinks!).   The staff are always friendly. Nice kids area on the side of the cafe for the kiddos. Fresh catnip mice for sale by the register for your furbabe and local rotating art on their wall. I love coming in to see what new art they have displayed."}
{"text":"OHMYGODJAVACATIWOULDDIEWITHOUTYOU.  For serious though, I am at Java Cat at least 2 or 3 times a week. Here's why: -The iced coffee is LITERALLY the best iced coffee I have ever had. -The breakfast sammies are DELISH. The boom boom is really good, but the veggie egg wrap is my faves. -Super ridiculously yummy bakery/donuts/bagels. -Really nice staff. -Opens at 6am during the week, which is so lovely for someone like me who needs coffee early. -GELATO. Let me clarify, GOOD gelato in toooons of fun flavors.  And most importantly,  ITS FULL OF CAT KNICK KNACKS.   Skip the chain and give Java Cat a try!"}
{"text":"I do t get this place, coffee is weak, sandwiches are terrible and service is confused and slow. If I want gelato it's great, but seriously better food at Crema down the road."}
{"text":"I like this place. There usually aren't any screaming kids bothering me. Also, they have old computers that people can use to do useful things, like search the internet and write yelp reviews expressing their valid and not-so-valid opinions."}
{"text":"Great place.  Drive by 100 times at least.  Kicking myself for not stopping before.  Staff and owners are amazing. They are selling my lip balm there too.  Even if they weren't this would be my new go to place when in the area.  Highly recommend for coffee, Bakery and a comfortable friendly environment."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick coffee while in the car with my kid.  It's nice when the independent coffee joints have drive thru's because I really feel disgusted when I have to get Starbucks just because they deal drugs on every corner.  I'm always more than happy to go a little out of my way for real coffee.  Java Cat delivered!"}
{"text":"Their gelato is out of this world!!!! Plus their baked goods are well done. Wide selection of coffee brews and the staff are pretty chill.   You can buy a catnip-filled toy for your cat AND it's a neat little place to study... Not many outlets though."}
{"text":"Had a chance to get back to Java Cat today. Seriously. If you love frozen treats and you haven't been here yet, I am shedding a tear for you.   The best gelato I've had, hands down. Both in quality, and creativity of flavors.   (as a side note, the man and I split a BLT today as well, which was also yummy in that good-old-classic-sandwich kind of way)."}
{"text":"Java Cat is a 3-4 star coffee shop. Latte prices are comparable but a tad on the high side for the market.   The coffee is consistently good and they have a nice selection of sandwiches and rotation soups. They also have a decent pastry selection and a little gelato counter.   Java Cat is go to coffee joint when I'm in the neighborhood.  It's consistent and has decent hours."}
{"text":"Great little coffee spot, and a welcome addition to the area. The coffee is good with lots of choices (Javalato, anyone?). There are also lots of food options - hot and cold sandwiches, soups, lots of pastries, and chocolates from local chocolatiers. Just once you have to try the squares of cake & butter cream frosting dipped in chocolate ganache.  Most coffee shops have wi-fi these days, but how many actually provide the computers? There are three, they're free, and far less busy than you would think. I've only had to wait twice in my dozens of visits.  Java Cat hosts music on the weekends, and usually really good acts. I'll never forget the 9-year-old accompanying his dad's Irish jigs on the bodhran - really well, too! And the rotating gallery art is always worth a look. (As opposed to the permanent collection, which is....excessively cat themed.)  Oh, and the drive through. Yay!  So why did I give it only three stars?  Let's start with the atmosphere. Dark purple walls, black ceiling and a lot of grey make for one gloomy room. If not for the warm wooden furniture and the large front window, the place would be downright depressing.  Then there's the temperature: freezing. One day this summer I noticed that I wasn't the only one huddled in a sweater and asked if they could turn the AC down, They said they have to keep the ambient temperature at 60 to keep the gelato from melting. Really? The freezer doesn't do that? Now, I don't know if that's the official line, but I do know that Java Cat is often uncomfortably cold.  And finally, it's no place for small children. There is one high chair and one booster seat, and neither has any straps/buckles to hold a kid in. There's no changing table in the bathroom, even though there's plenty of space for one. Changing diapers on the floor of a public bathroom sucks. And they actually removed the small kids' area they used to have. If I didn't know better, I'd think Java Cat was deliberately making it hard for people with babies to hang out there. Actually, I'm pretty sure that's exactly what they're doing."}
{"text":"Fresh baked pastries, homemade gelato and excellent coffee, just some of the items which Java Cat excels at!! The Cat has lots of live music too, not just the random hippie stuff or starving artist but decent music from different cultures! The building is tight and can get crowded but the outside patio can handle any spill-over no problem. The fact that they're open early (5:30 am) means you can get the freshest coffee and bakery anywhere before heading off to work!! Bravo Java Cat, bravo!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best brewed coffee in Madison.  They serve Just Coffee and always have a strong dark roast. Drive-thru is very convenient on the way to work."}
{"text":"The best anywhere!  This place has atmosphere, great people, yummy coffee and tasty goods."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff who prepare the drinks to perfection. A perfect place to grab a well made espresso drink whether you are on the go or hanging out. Their food menu also has a good variety."}
{"text":"Pershing Doughnut was yummy and the Americano was nice and bold.   Came here for a quick cup of java.    Service was awesome and the place has hoppin with local folks.  Enjoy the local artists pieces on the walls."}
{"text":"this place is fantastic! their gelato alone is reason to travel across town to check it out. i'm not one for coffee, so i can't speak about that, but the gelato is certainly killer, especially on a hot day by the lake.   the website above is wrong though, the actual website is here: http://www.javacatmadison.com/"}
{"text":"Best coffee in Madison, in my opinion.  The blueberry scones are extra good as well. If you're in the area it's totally worth a stop. Oh, the staff is very nice as well!"}
{"text":"I came here on two different occasions.  The first being for a study session and the second purely for gelato.  I had a mocha purely by their suggestion and was not at all impressed.  It was weak and very watery.  I also got a cookie which was only ok.  The baristas did not seem as if they were totally confident or really knowledgeable about the food or coffee either.  When I ask for suggestions at coffee shops, they usually have a great, creative drink waiting to suggest or at least ask for what kind of drink I am looking for.  She said the mocha was their most popular so I figured it had to be good.  But it was not.  Now, the gelato.  The gelato is great.  I had party cake or was it birthday cake?  Cake batter?  Something to that extent.  It was really good.  They have a good variety and they let you sample ones before you choose.  Not sure how it compares to Michaels down the street but I would go back for the gelato."}
{"text":"This review is for the service and the gelato. Both get five stars from me!   Every time I have been here I have been blown away at how helpful the staff is. They are always friendly and they never seem irked if I ask for a sample. Sweet stuff.  The gelato - oh the gelato is tasty! I love that you can get two flavors - even in the small which runs right under $4 but is a hearty small for certain. I almost always get some cake batter (because I'm an addict) and then try something else on the other side. I have never had a bad experience here. Definitely a must stop on summer bike rides or after walking around Olbrich Gardens."}
{"text":"Cute eclectic coffee shop in Monona. Delicious coffee, sammies, sweets n' treats and even a drive through window. Love it all"}
{"text":"Huge bakery items and a lot to choose from.  If you tell them your drink is NOT to go, you get it in a hard plastic glass.  They also have outside seating, sandwiches, gelato and other bottled drinks/sodas.  I'm usually fussy in my chai teas but was  pleasantly surprised on the flavor of an iced chai and liked it a lot.  I'm meeting up with a friend so this place is not in my neck of the woods but if I'm ever in the area I would happily stop here instead of searching out the closest Starbucks.  Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"Meow, Java Cat. You are so good to us! Now that you have a Cuban and a Reuben sandwich, my lunch partner has a new \"usual\" (the Cuban, no cheese). :9   And, now that the road construction is dying down, I can once again park in your lot easily. I look forward to what you'll make of your new, admittedly smaller front patio area. Umbrellas or some kind of shade will be great, and perhaps a tall wooden stick fence or some such... I know you're on it.   Also, thank you for the coffee warm ups when I take it to go... kind women, may your tip jar never be hungry.   The only thing that would add to your awesomeness are later hours. Like, 11 or midnight? It'd be so nice to have a non-alcoholic venue to compute at late nights... pleeeeease?"}
{"text":"Great caffeine stop.  Nice location right by the lake and within walking distance to the botanical gardens and the lakefront park. They really ran with the whole cat theme in the ambiance, they place is covered with fun cat things in all sorts of ways.   The baristas were very nice and helpful. They were using Just Coffee which was cool. They weren't exactly gourmet espresso trained, but the americano I got can out well and the gelato was defiantly great. They have some great options to mix the two in affogstos and gelato-espresso shakes, yum!   Overall not bad coffee for a reasonable price, I would suggest getting the brewed stuff with some gelato and enjoy it on a walk through the park."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a Sunday morning coffee, and was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Excellent latte, and my nephew loved his hot chocolate.  A competent guitarist played acoustic 80's covers at just the right volume to not distract from conversations.  I was impressed with the selection of pastries and gelatos, which I will have to try on my next visit."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's an ambitious little spot with a lot of heart. That said, I've had some mixed experiences- primarily with the food offerings. Their sandwiches on a good day are REALLY GOOD. I'm crazy about the hummus panini and the cinnamon stuffed French toast. Unfortunately, the half dozen or so times I've ordered them the quality has always varied. Nearly half those times something was forgotten, and a couple other times the preparation seemed sloppy and rushed resulting in a sloppy/ burnt sandwich. I'm not one to complain in person, especially when it seems an undertrained employee or busy lunch hour is at fault. It seems turnover of counter staff is pretty common. The owner though is always very personable. And the mocha latte is fab!"}
{"text":"Gourmet Coffee, Fresh Bakery, Soup, Sandwiches, and best of all Home made Gelato in dozens of wild flavors. Clean and comforatble, with outside seating too. Best coffehouse in town."}
{"text":"I stopped for breakfast to go and really liked it!  I'll admit, I mostly stopped because I had the Bucky Book coupon, but was pleasantly surprised how good the coffee and food was.  I got a small cup of cold brew coffee. It was quite good! I also got the breakfast wrap (which was really kind of a breakfast burrito) filled with veggies, and that was really what impressed me.  I think the food menu could have a bit more variety/options (especially since the breakfast wrap was so good).   The place was clean and the lady who rung me up was very sweet.   I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Monona!"}
{"text":"Excellent service from all staff! Yummy coffee. I didn't have anything to eat but their pastry case looked tempting!"}
{"text":"Such a cool little spot!!   Delicious smoothies. Large selection of coffee based drinks as well as non-coffee. Pastries, breakfast (all day!), soups, salads, sandwiches.. whatever you're hungry for! And! Gelato!!   Inside is super cool, lots of art and fun things to look at on the walls. Kids corner to keep the littles occupied. Spacious tables section, not super cramped like some coffee shops seem to be.   Live music periodically. And they have a drive through!"}
