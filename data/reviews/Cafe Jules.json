{"text":"Passed by Cafe Jules so many times and never went in. Today I regretted, that I haven't checked it out earlier. It's an amazing spot to grab a coffee, sandwich or any kind of pastry - they all are delicious and super fresh. Staff is attentive and polite and music selection makes you feel like you're in a coffee shop somewhere in France."}
{"text":"Wonderful new addition to the neighbourhood! The owner is super nice and will encourage even the most timid speakers of French to speak to him in the belle langue, which is always fun. The coffee, croissant and baguettes are all excellent, but the real stars are the pastries, which are superb! We've taken them as dessert to parties that included food writers, and everyone was very pleased with them."}
{"text":"***DO NOT BUY THE $50 VOUCHER DEAL ADVERTISED ON YELP!***  I made the purchase and tried to use it a few days ago, and the lady behind the counter did not know what to do with it, so she called the manager, who told her that they did not post any deals on Yelp. They did not offer any explanation, reconciliation, or apology about the issue, and so I left hungry.  I contacted Yelp, and they said that deals on Yelp are posted by the business owner, and are not posted by Yelp. Overall it was a poor experience, and they could've handled the issue much better."}
{"text":"A genuine French vibe tucked away on a busy street. Easy to miss if you aren't looking for it. Unlike other cafes that try so hard to portray a French cafe (I'm looking at you, cheesy Eiffel Tower wall stickers), this place does not engage in the level of cultural appropriation that is all too common these days.  The owner is nice, bakes the croissants himself (not butter-laden) and the lattes smooth, not too acidic, with the perfect complement of milk. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"When I went to pay for a large drip coffee, the owner told the cashier to charge me $1 more than the posted amount. When I asked why, the owner told me it was an extra charge for a drop of Almond Milk, which was, in his words \"very expensive.\" Apparently he didn't realize that if you blatantly rip people off, they can post reviews on the internet."}
{"text":"Nice place to stop off after a hot walk in the sun. I wish they had air conditioning -- windows were open though so that helped. Espresso was a little 'salty' but I guess that could be considered new wave. Pastries looked great but I was turned off after seeing multiple flies buzzing in and around them. The owner is what makes the place. Friendly and genuine, I loved practicing my Grade 9 French with him. Lots of personality. Love the decor. Simple yet refined in a French way, tu sais?"}
{"text":"Came on a whim since I needed a place to chill before a meeting. Nice and quaint shop in the Entertainment district.  Nice and simple layout with tables set up for one on one meetings and dates. I met the owner who also ran the shop who was extremely friendly and welcoming. I ordered the Espresso Cortado and he insisted me to sit down instead of standing and waiting for my coffee.  He prepared it very well.  The espresso was strong and had a nice layer of crema. The milk was frothy and not burnt. Returning here for sure!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite coffee shops around the area. Cafe Jules has a Parisian vibe and it's been recently renovated!   The owner is soo so nice! He's always so happy and so friendly and greets every customer with lots of enthusiasm. He MAKES Cafe Jules even awesomer!  Love their coffee and pastries.  I usually get their apricot danish, altho on occasion have also tried the raspberry tart and an almond croissant. All are fresh and just the right amount of sweetness and flakiness.  They also have a wide variety of different teas if you're not much of a coffee drinker.  All around the coffee shop, there's art hanging on the walls - which are for sale if you fancy buying one."}
{"text":"Great addition to the community. Love the atmosphere in the shop, the owner is really nice and welcome. I have met many people around the office because of this and I love it. The coffee and pastries are to die for and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Wanted to check this place out recently but apparently they're closed due to a fire recently. Major bummer! Hope it ends up reopening!"}
{"text":"The Keish here is very yummy, it was toasted hot to perfection. Very nice meal space with leather chair, wooden table, and plants decoration. The price is appropriate and there are a wide variety of pastries and drinks. The owner is extremely nice and friendly. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Randomly found this place on Yelp and I was pleasantly surprised. They have really beautiful cakes and pastries. From pistachio cake, blueberry cheesecake, chocolate cake, apricot pastries and tarts, as well as a small selection of macarons.  Inside there are four pieces of abstract art on the wall and a timeless typewriter as the decor. The ambiance is nice with Parisian type of music  I decided to try the Pistachio cake. Although it tasted more like matcha I found this cake to be quite tasty. The base is very dense and made with some kind of crumbs. The actual green swirl on the top is a very nice, dense, creamy, and smooth cheesecake texture. It is topped with 3 raspberries. After digging into the middle of the cake I was plesantly surprised that they had hidden more raspberries within the inside of the base of the cake within the crumble. The environment is very relaxing and they have free wifi.  I really love this cafe and would come back."}
{"text":"Café sympathique. Peu brillant et pas chère. La qualité est au rdv. Et le patron est d'une gentillesse et d'un humour inoubliable. Jolie moment :)"}
{"text":"Cafe Jules is an amazing Cafe. The owner is what makes this place special. Extremely welcoming and warm personality. They have amazing pastries (try the blueberry cheesecake or the pistachio cake) and croissants (chocolate almond). The coffee is strong. Highly recommend checking out this place."}
{"text":"Nothing awkward then watching a cop flirt with a hot French barista behind the counter---so now that I have this out of the way--ahh cafe Jules --- for me nothing special -- I ordered Zucchini + Feta Quiche and English breakfast tea---which arrived 10 minutes after because the  modelesque barista was too busy flirting with the cop and I was the only customer there..   Also there is no WIFI here. How on earth in this Century you can call yourself a cafe and not have WIFI??  So the Quiche was actually on the semi-delicious side for $5.75 and tea $2.25 was nothing to brag about.  Am I going to come here again--depends if it's raining outside and I am without an umbrella."}
{"text":"Simple French-inspired coffee shop. Pastries and sweets and sandwiches are pre-made and delivered, not made in-house, but are decent when you want something to snack on with your coffee.  The coffee is quite good - I often get an americano here and it's strong/flavourful. The almond croissants are also tasty, if not a tad dry (again, not freshly baked but I enjoy them).  The thing that keeps us coming back is the service. The French gentleman behind the counter is super friendly and inviting. He likes to joke around and he'll you feel as welcome as possible, always ensuring you're seated and comfortable and enjoying your coffee before you even think of worrying about paying.  On a recent visit, my girlfriend mentioned it was her birthday that weekend and he gave us a hard time for not telling him sooner because he would have ensured our coffees and pastries were in the house. So instead he let her take one home for later! It's that kind of service that really stands out and keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Stepped into this little Parisian cafe on a rainy Saturday afternoon. We were greeted by the enthusiastic owner who welcomed us in. They brew a special blend of Social Coffee which is amazing.   We didn't get to try their pastries and quiche, but everything looked fresh and authentic. The cafe's got a great vibe and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We are visiting from out of town and was recommended to go here by a friend. From the happy baristas, the tasty coffee to the delicious pastries, it's a must go! The owner is amazing, so it's no wonder that his cafe is as well! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This French cafe has some of the friendliest service in the city. The owner is always around and is genuinely happy to see each of his customers. The coffee is fantastic (roasted by Social Coffee) and won't let you down. The pastries look fantastic so I'll be back to try them soon! I also love the art on the walls, including some pieces from local artists."}
