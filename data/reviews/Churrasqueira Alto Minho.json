{"text":"Considering it's the only place in the immediate neighbourhood to buy prepared food, it's pretty good. But nothing special. I've only tried the roasted chicken. It wasn't overdone, but not particularly crisp or succulent, and served with the generic red sauce. Fair prices."}
{"text":"The service at this place is remarkable, interior is like your typical churasqueira. It will not disappoint and if it does they will go out of there way to fix the issue. Literally."}
{"text":"Horrible , I've tried EVERYTHING on the menu and every time I eat something I get sick... I hope this place closes n we get some pizza or hipster sandwich place.
For good Portuguese take your time n go to CHURRASCO on st Clair"}
