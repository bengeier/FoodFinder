{"text":"Best buffet ever! Good quality food, awesome service! They don't like the traditional low quality low price Chinese buffet, omg I cannot really think of another place who can beat this!!! This place is a MUST go!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is clean and fun and very cheap and very dank food. Lisa is the homie. Good experience cannot complain we are young poor good looking high school students that easily down to drop $10-$15 because this place is so dope."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great desserts, great service! There is a wide variety of sushi and a full Mongolian grill. We will definitely be back again in the near future!"}
{"text":"We arrived for diner at 3:45 pm today. The hostess rudely informed us we would have to pay for diner since it was 15 minutes until diner started. We looked over the buffet and there was hardly any sushi and no specialty foods. The hostess was so rude we left and will never return. The sign should say dinner starts be for 4:00 !"}
{"text":"Mmmmm  The place is clean, food are decent for a buffet.  Coffee Jelly Dessert to die for...  lol Just kidding, but they are good :)  Keep up the good work :D"}
{"text":"Cockroaches in sushi. No thank you.  And owner is very rude when confronted. Blah.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! Here on a Friday night and it's not very busy...not sure why, food is fresh, wide selection and great desserts."}
{"text":"customer service is horrible and there sushi was so dry.roe fish that dry will be you can get sick.  won't recommend anyone for here and won't go back!!"}
{"text":"No idea why people would leave bad reviews.  It is a very good all u can eat buffet. It is not intended to be a 5 start restaurant or las vegas buffet. It is always good and filling with great service.  Lisa rocks"}
{"text":"Went at 4:30 6/15/2016 our first time for early dinner, because on the menu it said they served oysters. First the waitress was good. The oysters I picked up were the last three and looked dry, After I ate them I went back to see if they refilled the server...no. When I went for the sushi which my wife who is Asian said was old fish  and under the the fish, on top of the rice there was no wasabi. No excuse for not knowing how to prepare. Listed on the menu was: Shrimp Tempura Sushi, Spicy Tuna Roll, Dragon Roll which were not offered. i inquired and they said they would make...I asked three times then gave up.  Tried the new Oysters, which were still dry... Went on to the other dishes and they were all overdone and did not taste right. Most of the food did not make the smell test to it would never pass my lips. What little I ate made me visiting the THRONE Several times that night. WE WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a few days ago, and I was immediately impressed by its interior. The place is nice and clean, and the staff was absolutely friendly. Plus, I can't think of another place that offers unlimited sushi for just $9.99.   Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Went in opening day, typical buffet.   Walked out when I saw the price was $15.99 per person. Way to much for stuff I've seen at other buffets for around $9.00."}
{"text":"We went for dinner.  This place didn't disappoint. The sushi was fresh as was everything else. This evening they had octopus sushi.  It is not very often that you find a buffet that has all you can eat fresh octopus sushi.  They have a new sushi chef that is a transfer from pacific buffet.  My favorite is beef short ribs and those were cooked to perfection. I don't understand the low reviews but this is a buffet and should be judged as one.  One final note this place is much cleaner than pacific buffet and smells better."}
{"text":"This place was definitely not clean. I spotted a cockroach next to the crab legs. I had zero appetite after seeing this. As far as the staff they were fine. But this is an establishment where the last thing that you want to see is  bugs crawling next to your food.   Service 9/10 Food 0/10 Cleanliness 0/10   Overall 0/10   Sorry but I don't do bugs in my food."}
{"text":"This restaurant and Pacific Buffet belong to the same owner(s). The food is very similar. The place is newly remodeled and looks very nice. We like this one just as much as Pacific. This one has cheese cake in the dessert section and it is one of my favorites. There is also a coffee/cappucino flavored ice cream, which is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Such a decent place to eat at. Lisa, the waitress is amazing! Food are good, place is neat and decent looking! Looks new and fancy! Even though there are less food compared to the other buffets I've been to, it was good! This is my 2nd time here! I'm coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ate here last week and couldn't have been more impressed.  The restaurant space is clean and bright and upscale-looking for a Chinese buffet.  The food presentation was visually appealing and everything I ate was fresh, hot and appetizing. The quality of the sushi and sashimi was outstanding and is worth the price of the buffet by itself.  Employees are friendly, helpful and attentive. This is a great addition to South Chandler."}
{"text":".The people are very nice. The food is merely adequate. This is the place to come if you just want stuff in your stomach."}
{"text":"Its was $16.99 for Thursday dinner, and kids were $6.99 for ages 3-6. There was a great seafood selection, and the desserts were yummy too! The cocktails were all $6 !!! So glad there is something out in this part of the valley."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill steadily. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"We arrived on Friday at 1200. We were seated in a booth in the far corner. We sat and waited for someone to take a drink order. Our wait was 10 minutes. It was not booming with customers to warrant a 10 min wait.  When we went for food, they were out of fried rice, small fried chicken wings, and orange chicken. We went back a few minutes later, they were still out.  We had an infant with us who was ready to leave. I had to stand and signal for someone to bring me a check. Our waitress never looked our way. Another lady acknowledged us, and told our server to bring the check. We then watched her deliver drinks and take drink orders of someone else.  We waited at the front for the check and to pay. Service was terrible especially for a buffet when the expectation is to bring me a drink in a timely manner and my check when I'm ready to leave!"}
{"text":"Visited on Wednesday around 6pm. It turned out it's related to Pacific. I recognized some of the people there. Welcomed by a smiling lady. Not many people, but food was abundantly replenished. Decor and lighting were nice. Nice layout with ample room to walk. Clean floor, table, and chairs. And clean male restroom with no bad odor (unlike Pacific). Sushi was very good. Sashimi was never run out. There was even yellowtail sashimi! For $16, we would go there again and again. Warm food that we liked were chicken wings, sesame balls, fried fish, sort of beef steak (forgot the name). Strawberries were awesomely sweet, even without chocolate covered from chocolate fountain. Waitress Lisa (from Pacific) was friendly and efficient. Patrons were friendly and we actually had conversations with some of them! Overall good experience. So glad it's only 5 minutes away from our house. We will be back..."}
{"text":"Great selection, good price, and friendly staff. What's not to like? Even the sushi was good. The place was clean, well-maintained. I've never been to the Pacific Buffet which the other reviewers mention, but Jogoya is definitely a thumbs-up."}
{"text":"In one word.... TERRIBLE!!! I took my parents there for lunch today and the food served was just as bad as the Pacific Seafood which has gone so far downhill, I don't see how either place has any customers. I was told it was very good once but not anymore. Food was cold, dried out, tasteless, and didn't even appear to be appetizing when it might have been fresh sometime during the lunch hour which was hours before. Service was downright slow and inept. Table was not even cleaned so I had to chase someone for that. A totally rotten experience!  Go elsewhere for Chinese food. There are many good selections in the area. Never again!"}
{"text":"Great and Healthy food, Great price, Great service.  Clean and light. Best Seafood Buffet in Phoenix area. My wife and I have dinner here at least once a week."}
{"text":"We usually come here for lunch at least once a week and enjoy the food and service.  A good variety of hot Asian food and decent sushi.  Never had a problem with food temperature or quantity.   We'll be back."}
{"text":"Decent food, good variety. Have had Lisa as our server a few times and she is amazing!!! Love her."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first of many visits to Jogoya Sushi Seafood buffet, but it will not be our last. We found the remodel from the former Yummy's Buffet pretty amazing.   The WOW factor hit us as soon as we came through the front door. The young lady greeted us and promptly sat us and one of our favorite waitresses in the East Vally caught a glimpse of us and showed us to a table and made our visit wonderful.  The Buffet itself was laid out beautifully and very different from all the other Chinese Buffets that we have visited, inviting and interesting. The staff was very friendly and of course, being newly remodeled, the interior was immaculate.    The food was extremely fresh and very inviting. They did not have huge trays of food out on the counters waiting for many diners to empty, before replacing with fresh. There were small manageable amounts of food present in a lovely setting. Replaced often for freshness."}
{"text":"The sushi and sashimi were all fresh and wonderful. Tempura was very good and the dungeness crab was outstanding. The sticky rice was a little sweet and the non-seafood items were ordinary. Much more than I expected and the best seafood buffet in the Chandler area."}
{"text":"Zero stars. We came in for dinner to food that was old, dry and crunchy. I mean the rice and meats. I brought it to the managements attention and he had the audacity to ask me how many times I come in a week? Huh? Why does that matter? I'm here enough to identify that the food is old in comparison to fresh food! Not to mention I witnessed a worker pouring water out of a coffee pot into the food! This place used to be great but in my humble opinion it has gone down hill! Management offered a 20% discount and a $10 gift card that I declined. After the passive aggressive insult management lobbed in my face (in front of other patrons)  no way would I even return! It's disappointing that a place I frequent for years I no longer have the appetite or desire to patronize anymore."}
{"text":"Although the interior design is appointed in multiple natural stones, and the facility is very impressive - the food - and the prices are not.   My party of five adults and three children visited this place for the first time on Sunday April 26th, 2015.   READ THIS VERY CAREFULLY - THREE OUT OF THE FIVE ADULTS (myself included) GOT SICK FROM EATING THE SEA FOOD !!!!!   At close to $20 dollars a head for Sunday lunch - This added to the negative marks.   Then - to add insult to injury - we were asked by our server if we would like to have some \"complimentary lobster\" - which turned out to be inedible cuttings from crab in some \"kind of red sauce\" - no claws or tails as I had been anticipating.....   BUT wait - there's more:   We were told (by our hostess when we first arrived) that they had lamb, but sadly, all that was on the serving line where the \"lamb\" was supposed to be - was beef (labeled \"lamb\").....  this got this entire disaster to a new height of \"adding insult to injury\"   So much for looking forward to having \"Lobster\" and \"Lamb\"    I do sincerely wish that I had had a better first time at Jogoya - as their entire staff DID try to make our dining experience a very pleasant one (aside from the Lamb and Lobster debacle).    Sorry guys -after our party dropped over $130 bucks on lunch - I'd at least like to NOT have gotten SICK from eating there...... Won't be back :-("}
{"text":"Its alot better than the pacific food is the best that ive had here in phoenix for a seafood buffet. very clean serves was good as well. I will be back food was real good all that i had"}
{"text":"Amazing food and nice people.  I will be back very soon. This is the place to go for sea food!"}
{"text":"Wow! All you can eat Poke...new cheap price. 30% discount for seniors. More salad option. I love it. Healthy foods."}
{"text":"Ever since the new management this place is amazing. Ive been here 8 times in the last 3 months and it never disappoints. The staff is amazing and so os the food and new building."}
{"text":"Found a roach in my food. Manager just said sorry and still made me pay for my meal after I had lost my appetite. Last time EVER!"}
{"text":"Under New Management, the place has improved somewhat but the selection of sushi is still limited to California rolls, tuna, salmon and red snapper. Where's the Yellowtail? Where's the Eel in BBQ sauce? The Chinese dishes and desserts are still excellent and the service is still good, but where did the lamb skewers and prime rib go?"}
{"text":"My husband I went in yesterday. They did a great job putting this place together. Really classy. AWESOME service. Food was very fresh. I don't even like seafood but was very happy with the selections. My husband loves seafood and loved the variety.   Loved the sashimi.   We'll be regulars. Good value considering the quality of food.     Ask for the \"crazy white server\"."}
{"text":"If I can give this place 10 stars I would it's the best Asian/seafood buffet ever. The lamb skewers are amazing.  They have a chocolate fountain. Enough said :)"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday evening with the family for an early mothers day celebration. This place looks amazing on the inside! Very bright and colorful. This is the same owner as Pacific Seafood Buffet in Chandler, so naturally the price and food were similar. It did have some items that you never see at Pacific though so that's a plus. Also the sushi here looks way better, nice big cuts of sashimi. Being new* I hope this wasn't for show and keep up the same quality service Even though the shashimi was very fresh the tuna was very pale, signs of a low quality fish. The plates were pretty dirty I had to swap two or three dishes to find one that was decent. The waitress/waiter service was a bit slow, I was nearly finished with my second dish by the time our drinks came out, and seemed like forever to get dirty dishes picked up.  Being mothers day weekend I'll give them a bit of leeway. Overall, I would come here again for the sushi.  *This being new it has changed owners a few time."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of seafood in the AZ desert so my review is based on the other types of food this buffet has available. The selection of food is OK and definitely will hit the spot for someone that is craving a variety of food. The place is easily found in a strip mall. It is pretty large and the service is OK. I've been here with large groups of people and they can accommodate big parties with no problems (make a reservation in advance). I didn't notice anything unclean and would probably come back!"}
{"text":"We tried this place at the suggestion of a friend.  We have been to the Pacific Seafood Buffet also and I like that one a lot more.  They have a larger selection of food and the taste of the food was better.  It just didn't seem like the food here turned over very fast because there were not that many people there.  The sushi was dry and not very tasty and the plates that had the individual slices of tuna, salmon and other fish had plastic wrap on them and made it impossible to get any.  The crab legs were so water logged that I had to dump the water off of my plate.  Just not very good or worth the money.  The service was good and the waitress was on top of everything.  If not for her (Lisa) I would have given this place one star."}
{"text":"i got food poisoning from this place, i actually originally typed this as i was over my toilet vomiting.   this place used to be good, but the last few times the quality of food has really gone down. each time the food has been cold and questionable how long its been sitting there. this time around it made me really sick. it could have been the sashimi, since i was the only one in my party to get it. or the meat because i was with a bunch of vegetarians. regardless i threw up 8 times about 5 hours ago. i dont recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I hate to write negative reviews, but I had no choice for this restaurant....  Let me start by saying that the staff was extremely friendly and nice.  But that's where it ends.  The food is very, very, very poor in quality.  I tried a small portion of about 15 dishes, and was not impressed by a single one.  I didn't expect gourmet food for $13, but the quality was very bad.  The shrimp looked and tasted old.  The rice, chicken dishes, beef dishes, etc were really bad.  The ice cream had frost on it as if it's been sitting there for 6 months.  It might be fun to take small children who want to eat new foods; but I definitely don't recommend it for adults."}
{"text":"I love this place! I went there twice and all on happy hours, for what I've paid I could only say it's incredible. Usually there are not too many choices during the launch, but you can still have tasty steaks and other seafood. The food is clean and delicious, and most importantly, the service is awesome, the waitresses are always polite, and clean the dished off you table immediately, compare to other Asian restaurant, the service is definitely above the average."}
{"text":"I don't recommend this place. Food did not look fresh, greasy oily, and the sushi appeared to be sitting there for a while.  My son wanted chicken from the Mongolian grill but the chicken looked green, it was a scary sight. Also there was no wait at the Mongolian grill but you had to wait for the chef.  Staff was nice and friendly but I couldn't really understand them. I asked for low sodium soy sauce but didn't get it till the end of my meal."}
{"text":"Food is good for the price. They don't have that many options. For someone who likes going to buffet but gets full after a dish like me, this is a good place that worth the money. Food quality is a hit or miss depend on the day or the time. The place is very clean and spacious. I would give this place 3.5 stars for its inconsistency"}
{"text":"I'm from Tucson and I tried this place today and it was darn good everything was season nicely the place looks fancy af"}
{"text":"Attended on a thursday at 300 and wow, being a fan of seafood this was perfect for my liking. First time goer, from the second I walked in, I immediately felt the home comfort inside and could smell the fresh tuna being rolled in front of me.The hostess who helped my family had great customer service and was able to find us a table quickly so we could begin the buffet experience. Restaurant was very clean, sleek and had real comfortable booths.      After we were sat, there was a 10-15 minute wait before we were seen by a server or yet given drinks. We went for food, but they were missing several items. Including, the orange chicken, jello, and california rolls. However, beyond the disappearance of a few choices, the food waa great. Appeared to be fresh, a sushi chef on standby taking request for sushi as well as rolling the sushi that would be eaten near immediately after it is prepared.      I did wander over to the fresh fish section where I was convinced to try a few plates. Tried the sashimi, which was explained to me as a japanese delicacy and consisted of thin raw slices of fish. It was slimy, and personally I wasnt a fan. Then, I tried a couple spicy lemon mussels, which were surprisingly delicious, spicy but good. Overall, my experience was shaky. No service from server, but the food overpowered that into a great meal. I would check it out, just dont expect quick drinks."}
{"text":"Round 3 getting Green Tean icecream covered in their chocolate fountain. The chocolate hardens on the icecream like yum!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst food you can possibly feed your family.  For nearly 20 dollars per person, you get the coldest nastiest, sushi and Chinese food combo.  If you are feeling constipated before going you will ultimately feel relief shortly after leaving.. do not eat the food prior to long road trips or your vehicle and anyone in the car with you will regret the substantial amount of diarrhea you will have.  To the owner: not sure why you sacrifice quality for quantity because the McDonald's next door is supreme in this category.  I keep getting dragged here by my mother because she has no taste buds and an iron stomach.  I would compare this to the sugar free gummy bear challenge. Some of the comments from my kids are as follows:  Oh god why this place? Can I just eat the white rice? Can I stay home next time? My stomach hurts, thanks dad.. I don't want to go.. Why is the food cold? I feel sick from the food. (Followed by gastric distress and tears)   These comments are just from today..."}
{"text":"This place is just open today. My son wants to try it. The facility is nice and clean . It's been remodeled from previous Yummy Buffet. The remodeling is nice , the food selections look great. As I sample small portions of each dishes , my expectation of good looking dishes is melting away. Most of the saku tuna slices are still half frozen and even the farm hamachi is also half frozen. The hot dishes were good looking but tasteless . The soups are bland."}
{"text":"Late lunch.   Food was ok.  Typical buffet food. Sushi was decent for a buffet restaurant.   Iced tea was horribly watered down.  Clean restaurant, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the buffet, initially, had a much better selection of seafood but it appears they have decided profit was more important than remaining true to their mission. The lunch buffet has turned into a standard Chinese buffet. They no longer offer sashimi, the sushi rice is barely covered with narrow, thin pieces of fish and most of their seafood dishes are typical of other buffets. What a huge disappointment!  They failed to refill the tempura station, even though there was only 3 pieces of bell pepper in the tray, and the sushi chef was so focused on slicing razor thin pieces of fish, he could barely keep up with restocking the platters. I won't be going back to Jogoya and wouldn't recommend them for lunch, unless you want typical, greasy Chinese food. It's unfortunate they have decided to settle for less than mediocre offerings. I'm not sure if Pacific Seafood Buffet has followed a similar path, but I'm not willing to find out."}
{"text":"All u can eat sushi... Salmon, Tuna, Yellowtail, Maguro and more! Mmmn.. staff is nice, courteous and friendly. Newly opened... if Pacific Seafood buffet improved their quality of their restaurant. This would be it.. Priced reasonable! They're affiliated but different Managements. I used to go to Mido sushi but they upped their prices from 19.95 per person to 21.99. They don't offer unlimited sushi and it's all packed with rice that fills u up. In jogoya the unlimited sushi is the SASHIMI ITSELF and all u can eat custom rolls. My NEW go to all u can eat Chinese buffet! =D"}
{"text":"Service: On point, but it's not hard for a buffet to have decent service. Also they weren't so busy when I was there. Plates were clean, which is more than I can say for most buffet restaurants.  Food: Better variety than a lot of other seafood lunch buffet restaurants. Their seafood game is strong, but their other food less so. I really liked their pecan shrimp and squid salad. However some of the baicai I had tasted kind of funky, their grilled spare rib was really bland, and their duck was a little too salty. Also was not a fan of their sweet and sour tofu.   Anyway, I just feel like $20 a head on the weekend for lunch is too much given the food quality, but it could be worth it during the weekdays if you really enjoy seafood."}
{"text":"Been there on several occasions. I have always had friendly and prompt service. Drinks refilled and plates cleared very well. Sushi can get a bit scarce when they are busy but have always found the sushi tasty. Hot food seems fresh and cooked fish was good. Will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"Never again. Most of the food was horrible. Salty salmon, Sandy clams, horrible crab legs.."}
{"text":"Very exciting to see a new buffet here. The place is very clean with a modern atmosphere and full bar!   The sushi is freshly made in front of you, and the rest of the food was higher quality than I normally expect from a buffet.   The service is excellent- prompt and courteous! Lisa helped us with a few questions we had about their offerings and extremely personal. We will be back for sure and will recommend it to our friends in the area!"}
{"text":"I admit, me and my family come to this place often on occasion. I always go with my family and always leave satisfied. The service is always great and there is a lady who is very nice and funny who always comes to check up on us often. However, I went to eat here yesterday and left in an unpleasant mood. I enjoyed up until I got to the sushi bar. I saw that some of the sashimi was dark and not fresh as further back on the plate, and I grabbed a few pieces from the middle which you can tell was fresher. I could tell the sushi chef was about to grab for the tongs which I was going to hand to him, but as I was trying to hand it over, the sushi chef had taken the tongs from my hand and began moving the sashimi on the plate followed by speaking in a rude manner which I couldn't understand. As I proceeded, I just felt very uncomfortable because he glared at me over the counter. It wont keep me from continuing to come to this buffet, but I felt that the attitude towards customers should never be like that, which is what upset me coming to this place.."}
{"text":"I really like their sushi (nigiri) selection for lunch. The cost is $9.99 for the weekday lunch. They have salmon, tuna, yellow tail, shrimp, the regulars but they also have seared tuna which is excellent. The problem is they dont always replenish it when it runs out. The first time I went they refilled the plate soon after it was empty, however, 3 weeks later when I went back, they never refilled the seared tuna and just replaced it with another type of nigiri. The cut rolls have less variety than other of these cheaper Sushi/Chinese buffets. The variety of Chinese food is very good. Also they have Japanese curry which I have not seen at any of these buffets in AZ. Apparently the owner of this place is the brother of the owner of Pacific Seafood Buffet (Chandler)."}
{"text":"Great Asian buffet. The food is fresh. The staff changes out the food often so it doesn't sit out too long to dry. The sushi part of the buffet is acceptable for a buffet. The selection is average.   The place is clean. And prices are great for a buffet considering Asian take outs would average $8.00/pp and buffet price for lunch is $9.95.   So if you're looking to satisfy your Asian food craving but cat make up your mind to what kind, give this place a try."}
{"text":"This is new seafood buffet. The place looks nice and clean  . Drinks are extra .for dinner it works out to be 20 dollars  plus tax and tip. I am not a sushi fan  so I might  not be the best  judge.  A lot of the food was sitting.  The tempura and scallops  were cold . The sushi was a little  better but most of the Chinese  food was over cooked. The flavor and selection was average.  Services  were slow"}
{"text":"This is one of the better buffet places I have been to. Environment is really nice, place seems clean. There is a wide variety selections of sushi and sashimi; they are also very fresh. The crab legs are wonderful. Meat is very compacted and solid. Not like some places where you break open the leg and it's all watery. Only disappointment is the lobster. The meat is very mushy, not fresh at all. However, this will not stop me from coming here again since all other food is really good. Lots of selections. Will definitely let all my friends know!"}
{"text":"My family and I are from the East coast. We are loyal to our style of Chinese food but have accepted, it is near impossible to find what we want in AZ. This buffet has a nice selection of food, including Dim Sum! My son loves Sushi, and they have Sashimi, fresh!!! Crab legs, Salt and Pepper Crab, Clams, Snail, etc....you want it....it's there ;)  It's pricey but I don't mind paying for quality and cleanliness."}
{"text":"I arrived at Jogoya at around 8pm after coming out of the Harkins Theatres across the street. When I saw that the buffet closed at 9pm, I was hesitant to have dinner there lest the entree items would not be restocked once empty. However, my friends and I were in the mood for seafood, and we were pleasantly surprised that the employees continued to replenish the buffet items despite coming near closing time. The foods consisted of typical American-Chinese buffet dishes as well as some unique ones that pointed towards traditional Chinese style foods. Although the price is a bit higher than other American-Chinese buffets, Jogoya matches its seafood-buffet competitors in fresh and tasty sushi, sashimi, and other seafood dishes. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to parties large and small looking for a place to eat."}
{"text":"Seemed like a small step above most Chinese buffets.  Crab legs, soft shell crab, a few kinds of schrimp, lots of meat choices, a Mongolian grill, salad bar, plantain, vegetables and scoops of ice cream  (not a machine of soft serve) for desert.  I didn't notice anything unclean or messy. I'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"New owners really turned it around.  Cheaper than before and twice as good.  Sushi and poke bowls included for 11.98 can't beat it.  All the food was fresh and the sushi was really good."}
{"text":"Not too terrible of a buffet. I ate mostly sushi which wasn't the best but was better than I've had at other buffets.  Its a pretty standard Asian buffet. Not real Chinese food, but good enough.  We heard they have crab at night, that might be one of the only reasons I'd go back."}
{"text":"8/19/2016 update   Not sure what happened, came in on Friday night around 6:00 pm the place was empty, only two or three tables. The food quality has gone down. My husband tried the crab legs and he said it's cold and tasteless. I guess it's downhill from here.   Next...   For Chinese Seafood Buffet, we like to come here. They have plenty of selections to choose from, some night even raw Oysters. And for $17.99 price tag you know it's a sweet deal."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi buffet. This was great for us because they also have cooked food and a Mongolian grill. Kids loved that. Sashimi pieces were thick. Not a huge selection of specialty rolls, but enough to suffice. It was nice to see the rolls were not just set out to sit all afternoon. They had a few chefs at work behind the bar and kept them coming. Even oysters on ice. Good selection of deserts too. I have no doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"It is good, I like all the options, the staff is wonderful, the food is yummy, it is all clean and great selection. The atmosphere seems cold, that is my only complaint"}
{"text":"Not much of selections since new management took over. They got rid of crab legs and add sushi options. Since I'm not a big fan of sushi, and the selection are limited that I can actually go to any Chinese restaurants and order the same thing. I was not impressed!"}
{"text":"The food was good but nothing spectacular. They have a decent but small selection of sushi, Mongolian BBQ and Chinese dishes. The also have salad, fresh fruit and desserts. Service was good. If I'm in a sushi mood, I'd probably hit up a restaurant that specializes in it."}
{"text":"Don't know why my \"first to review\" review does not show as a posting, but does in my profile.  Funny stuff......maybe a software glitch or Yelp is blackballing me????  Oh well, been here twice now and I still think it is a pretty good deal for lunch.  Nigiri sushi is nice and fresh with good quality seafood -- hope it continues and this \"plus\" is not just an introductory special kind of thing.  Still think that their traditional Chinese beef curry stew is great.  One negative -- the Mongolian BBQ area needs to be improved so the customers have better access and they either need to add more grill cooks or get another one who can move faster than the snail's pace that he works with now.  All-in-all, a pretty good place to have lunch."}
{"text":"$12 for 6 pieces of sushi and miso soup? Never coming back. Service sucked, food was so so, not fun."}
{"text":"Some very nice changes since the change in ownership.  Love the option of making your own Poke Bowl."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointing.  Service so so unless you get the American woman who is great. Have eaten here four times, always lunch.  Not a bad selection but nothing spectacular at all. The \"hot\" foods are absolutely not hot. Last visit was at 11:00 when they just opened.  All the hot food is just barely warm.  Low quality beef and chicken dishes. Went to try Mongolian grill and worker yelled at me for some strange reason and since I do not know Chinese I passed.  I have commented each time that food was barely warm and it got worse. I hope they get the message as I have heard others complain too."}
{"text":"I found Jogoya to be as good, if not better than most of the other Asian style buffets in the Valley.  They have a little something for everyone's palate.  The ambience is pleasant and although there were many patrons in the restaurant, the food stations were arrange in such a manner that we weren't running into each other.  The food was very flavorful, fresh and hot.  For the most part, our dishes were cleared as needed.  Waitstaff wasn't abundant, but were available and friendly when we required.  I tried the spicy tuna roll, fried fish, fried rice,  Mongolian beef, curry beef,orange chicken, coconut shrimp, egg rolls, hot sour soup and clam chowder.  For dessert, I had the green tea ice cream.   All the food was very good.  The restaurant is a little out of my way in Gilbert, but I might try again if in the area."}
{"text":"My wife & I, along with another couple, dined there at 6:00 last night. I had been there for Lunch once before and enjoyed the quality of the food and prompt service, so I thought it'd be worth bringing the bride back to get her sushi \"fix\".   I sampled small portions of a variety of dishes: roasted duck, a couple crab legs, garlic shrimp, Mongolian beef, Lo Mien noodles and a fried chicken wing. My wife focused exclusively on their sushi- Rainbow Rolls, California Roll, Regular & Spicy Tuna Rolls. (Note: A previous reviewer gave a poor review because it didn't automatically come with wasabi. My wife hates wasabi, so they get kudos for that. Different strokes.) Also, she wanted me to make sure I mentioned the WIDE variety of sushi, and that each time she returned to the sushi bar, the chefs had added more sushi to keep selections abundant.  Nothing was dried out... or cold... or spongy, and there was plenty of dinner conversation that could've resulted in that effect. The entire restaurant is clean, well lit, and stocked with such an impressive variety of dinner choices.  My only reason for not giving 5 Stars is the absence of any crab crackers for the patrons to use to open their crab legs. Perhaps that's done on purpose, and they really want to make the customer \"work for it\". Also, there's much too much salt in the melted butter.  In closing, contrary to the 1-star \"whiners\", we did not experience any such problems. This is a buffet, people, and a pretty good one at that. We'll be going back, this time during the week when their discount pricing saves an additional $8.00 for dinner!"}
{"text":"Awesome variety of food to send the from.  Server Lisa is fantastic !!!  Great stir fry and fresh sushi."}
{"text":"Always fresh and clean when we eat here. Better than any other buffet that we have tried"}
{"text":"The hostess was not the nicest person, been there a few times, she forgot to give me my senor discount, but Dianna is a fantastic waitress, better than I could have hoped for, so I tip her extra, they do tend to limit the snow crab legs, I go there Saturday evening.   Ask for Dianna, so sweet as compared to others and very fast. Price is good"}
{"text":"Yikes! I am crying as I update this review, but it must be done. Service is still excellent.  HOWEVER...we went in for our weekly dinner at Jogoya earlier this week, and immediately we noticed that the food (other than the sushi), looked plain old sad. My mom is a chef and said that from her experience, the food looks like it was reheated and not fresh like usual. That's when we should have walked out. But we love this place, we're starving, and did I mention we love this place?  Fast forward 12 hours later and both of my parents and I are stuck in the restroom....ugh!! I don't live with my parents so there's no other food that we shared. Sad sad sad week for us here!"}
{"text":"We have been here before and it was one of our top buffets to visit.  Today was our first time visiting with its new management. The got rid of their habachi grill (no big loss) and added a Poke Bowl bar.  They also expanded their food selection. My wife couldn't stop talking about it and I was impressed too.  This place has gotten better with a bigger selection, nice staff, and it's very clean."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE customer service from the Manager! My son came for the salmon sushi and had some when we came in initially but when he came back for a third serving was told you have to wait for later. Well later never happened and when I asked to see the manager his response was we already served you 2 servings. OMG, is this not a buffet? Where was the limit 2 sign?? When I walked back to my table he shortly came over to argue his point again. Who goes to a buffet and leaves hungry and have to eat elsewhere? Other food was bland, we will NEVER return nor recommend this place that calls them an all you can eat buffet establishment."}
{"text":"This is the first time my friends and I had tried Jogoyas.  The food seemed decent enough, until we were standing at the food bar and saw a earwig walking right in front of the deviled eggs!  It was alive, crawling and disgusting. The food didnt seem to be too hot or too cold, just luke warm.  We lost our appetites after seeing the earwig walking along the food bar.  Not only that, the silverware was filthy!  A spoon at the ice cream bar looked like it has been used and set back in with the clean spoons. Upon checking out, we asked to speak to the Mgr. I showed the cashier my video of the live bug crawling along the food bar and she got a horrified look on her face.  I then showed her the dirty spoon and half dead roach there at the front door, along with a filthy floor! She advised the Mgr wasnt there and called him,. Said something in Chinese(?) I did not understand and handed me the phone.  All the manager did was say say something about the bug guys had just sprayed (I believe thats what he said, he was a little difficult to understand.) and then said he would comp one meal.  I told him 3 of us were in our party and he said he would comp half of the others meals.  A good manager would have apologized and comped our entire parties meal.  That is the first AND last time we will be eating there.  Its unacceptable to have bugs crawling among the food and half dead at the front door!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my word! I used to like this place so much, fresh made sushi, always hot entrees but now, we'll now IM IN LOVE! They recently added a Poke Bowl bar to make your own Poke! AMAZING!  The staff is always so nice, food is always great even the water is delicious  I totally recommend this place if you want a little bit of everything.  Ooh by the way, dinner price special was added for Mon - Thur! You can't go wrong!  This will be forever my go to spot for Poke, Sushi, seafood, Asian Cuisine!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I went for the first time tonight. It was a Friday at 7 and not very busy so I was a little worried. My first impression is that it was clean. I have been to others and they may have been clean, but everything looked so old, you couldn't be sure. Although this is a seafood buffet, we didn't have much seafood. There was plenty there and the staff was good at keeping things filled up. The food was good and our service was great! Our server, Lisa, was very personable, prompt on the drink refills and suggested a few of her favorites since we were newbies. We will be back!"}
{"text":"They're under new management, and the buffet is DELICIOUS! They've added a poke bowl station, added great selections to the sushi, and the diverse fares elsewhere are always fresh, hot and very tasty! There's a number of new specials too, for both lunch and dinner. .. no surprise they've become our favorite buffet!"}
{"text":"It was nice to have a longer sushi selection.  Great lunch price $9.99. It was nice to see authentic Chinese dishes such as choy sum and steamed fish.The kids would love the chocolate fountain to dip cookies in. A lot of variety but of course I think I overate. The manager did greet and thank me after I paid at the register. Great service."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday about 5:30 PM and it was very quiet but picked up a lot by 6:30 PM.  I'm glad we went a bit early.  My wife and I love sashimi so we found ourselves in heaven.  The sushi counter was filled with all sorts of wonderful and fresh items.  They had lots of things you would add to a poke bowl but heck, forget the veggies, I'm eating the fish!  But to start out, I took a bowl of hot and sour soup and a plate filled with shrimp, mushrooms, and chicken breast pieces to add to my soup at the table.  During our stay, we saw no bugs, no spilled food, no food on the floor or seats.  It looked quite clean and inviting.  Heat was a problem for the hot dishes, so be prepared for lukewarm food.   We didn't care too much as the sashimi is served cold, but the rolls needed the warmth!  Our server was friendly and caring, offered to move us to a table that was closer to the food as my wife was using a walker.  We were happy with the offerings and couldn't believe that for $10 a head we could eat $30+ worth of fresh cold raw fish!  The sesame balls and ice cream were a great way to say good-bye."}
{"text":"Decent food. You pay for what you get. The edges of the tables are sticky. Sushi is not bad. Sushi chef only brought out 8 pieces of oysters at a time, and it's gone within 30 seconds. I asked the chef for oysters, we took all and he stared at us and said something to another chef next to him. The fried crabs are disaster. It smell so bad and soggy! The crabs probably dead for days.Have diarrhea from it the whole night! Most of the food are out, not much choices."}
{"text":"Best coconut shrimp in the world! Great variety. Clean establishment. For a buffet, the sushi is great. Seated very promptly."}
{"text":"I came to this ALL YOU CAN EAT SEAFOOD BUFFET to eat the sushi. A couple plates in and i ended up waiting for the sushi chief to refill the sushi, i didn't have any issue with this.  After waiting for 15 minuets I asked one of the people at the sushi area if they could put some more salmon sashimi out. The man that replied, was the manager and he told me in his broken english \"I served you 2 pieces\" and he said there was nothing he could do. Then the tall stick looking manager came over to the table where my family and I ate. He insisted to tell us he could do nothing in a raised voice and argued with members of the table. The manager did not remember that he manages a buffet and told us we ate too much and could not have anymore. The twig that anyone could easily snap in half looking manager could take an english class to learn the language of the country he works in so that he could apply the knowledge to a customer service class so he can run a proper restaurant.   Things for this restaurant to improve on: -The restaurant needs to be cleaner. The floors were coated in a sticky and semi-sliding surface. Many plates were very dirty, dirty enough that it is visible to the eye.  -Change from a buffet to we control how much you eat.  -Fire the paper thin manager who thinks he has all the power in the world with bad english and rude customer service.  -Close down and have everyone go to Pacific Buffet  on Arizona ave. and Elliot. Better food and service."}
{"text":"I used to like this place. I was very disappointed in my last visit.  Service was good. Sushi was ok.  Everything else was either cold or tasted like old grease. I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt... maybe it was a bad day. But, then I saw little bugs crawling around the steamed buns.  Gross. Looked like baby cockroaches. Last time eating there"}
{"text":"Ok, why are there people saying this place is good or great buffet??? I thought this would be a good place to try out for some sushi, seafood and Asian food lunch, but so not the case! Got there between 11am - 12 pm on Monday found not there many people there yet, later a group of people showed up but still not that much. Food supply was very light, sushi was a joke because not only did they do NOT have sashimi but they didn't replenish or even try to put out much of anything, NO CRAB LEGS, and the dessert selections were not much of choice. Really disappointed in this so called sushi/seafood buffet.  Almost right when got home my sister's stomach started to feel some pain and now she is full on feeling sick. The bonus treat from this \"buffet\", food poisoning! Only reason I'm not sick is I didn't touch the sushi or seafood and ate only the cooked Chinese and other foods. Not a seafood person, but came here to try new place that was supposed to be good choice for ones that do, like my sister wanted to get some food seafood and sushi. Sorry I suggested this place!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience and the sushi was fresh as they made it in front of you. Good price for all you can eat sushi. Definitely heading back soon!"}
{"text":"The comparisons between Jogoya and Pacific Seafood Buffets will be inevitable,  as they seemingly offer a very similar selection (I'm not certain, but I would bet they are the same owners). That said, I would rank Jogoya a step below Pacific. The main reason is that the food turn-over time is longer because there just aren't enough diners to keep them busy.  Most of the food was lukewarm. The taste of the food was probably equal to Pacific's, and the sushi was better at Jogoya in my opinion. The service was decent, about the same as most other buffets.  Overall, I'd make the shorter drive (for me) to Pacific, and get more bang for my buck."}
{"text":"i have been there couple times, i like the food there but one thing i do not like is the way of server looked at me when i got sushi and oyster. The server put salmon and oyster with a little amount, then when i got all of these salmon or oyster, they looked at me like i was stealing food. I felt uncomfortable for that look."}
{"text":"I dined in this restaurant just as it opened its doors for dinner. Dinner price on week days is $15.99- a little steep, but for this dining experience, I felt that the price was worth it. Everything was so fresh! My entire first plate was filled with just sushi as they had an incredibly expansive selection of sushi. It is generally very hard to find a Chinese buffet (or really any buffet for that matter) that has a decent or really even edible seafood. I was happily surprised to find that all the seafood that I tried was ON POINT. Furthermore, they boast having ACTUAL king crab legs. Not some tiny, tempura battered crab that you'd find at your average Chinese buffet. Over all, this place genuinely exceeded my expectations with everything from the hibachi grill to the fresh fruit and desserts to the friendly service and atmosphere. Two thumbs way up! Would definitely recommend. :)"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! NOT CLEAN! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! My wife and I sat down for their lunch buffet. Both of us had sushi. As I was finishing my meal, my wife found an ant crawling on her salmon.  She showed the waitress and she said she was done. So the waitress brought our bill. Not only did she not comp our meal, but she brought us someone else's check for 3 people. When she brought us the correct check, she was still charging for both of us. After we made a stink, she said I can take 10% off (meanwhile there are ants crawling around in my stomach) I asked for the manager. He agreed to take off my wife's meal but not mine, saying he can't give everyone free food. I get that, but the fact that he has ants and who knows what else crawling over his raw fish and he still wanted to charge me? Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Very good foods for a buffet, exceed my expectation!  They have the best green tea ice cream ever!! I finished two bowls :)"}
{"text":"Their food has a lot of MSG although they have a lot of varieties. The price is very reasonable esp during the lunch hours."}
{"text":"On the better side of Chinese buffets. Not as much variety as I've seen, but I don't like sushi and they had a lot of that. Good food though. All the varieties of chicken were great and the egg drop soup was good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this buffet. Cleaner and nicer than any I've been to. I liked the noodles and teriyaki chicken a lot. The sushi was tasty and a lot of variety. Gave it 4 stars because they did not have beef and broccoli which is my favorite and wish they had more options for dessert. Other than that, good value."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. It's very pricey for dinner and can't believe they charge adult pricing for my 12 year old who doesn't have an adult appetite! They try to accommodate however but will probably go back only once in awhile but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"The selection of raw sushi for the lunch buffet is incredible! For only a mere $9.99. Lots of other seafood and non-seafood goodies to choose from too. Excellent steamed clams! Real ice cream (not soft-serve) including Green Tea. Nice décor and very clean. Attentive service. Best buffet of it's kind since Todai back in 2005."}
{"text":"WE FOUND A LONG STRAND OF HAIR IN THEIR ICE CREAM CONTAINERS THAT THEY SCOOPED OUT THEMSELVES!  YUCKK! The waitress told us she would give us a 20% discount off the bill. Came to our bill, she said it was only for one person so therefore only $1.80 off. Smh WHAT A JOKE! Last time coming here, don't trust the food and the workers don't care about your experience. The workers looked at us as if we were the ones lying and just wanted a free meal. I will make sure my family n friends don't support this business either! TRUST, THERE ARE OTHER REVIEWS TOO THAT SHOW THEY ARE NOT AS CLEANLINESS AS THEY CLAIM TO BE. Yeah food can taste good, but do you really want to eat somewhere where hair is in ice cream and roaches near the food."}
{"text":"The seafood quality is not as good as their other store. Salmon is bad; cold shrimp is not good. But I love all their vegetables. With the selections and price, 4 stars. For overall food quality, 3 stars"}
{"text":"Sushi was mediocre at best and much of the food was average. Good bang for your buck though. ($10 lunch buffet)"}
{"text":"Our new favorite! Clean. No stinky smell! Good food. Generous portions of sushi. Fondue!"}
{"text":"New buffet in the area and tried it out with my wife. Price is $9.99 and includes access to a Mongolian type grill, sushi, and the regular selection of Asian buffet items like Mongolian beef, sweet & sour chicken etc.   Since the place is new its in good condition and customer service is decent. The regular Asian food was ok with some of the dishes being warm, but most were cold. The sushi selection was good for a place like this including the standard nigiri but rolls were a bit scarce when you wanted  something that wasn't stuffed with raw fish.   They had plenty of desserts but they did not taste very good but looked nice in the presentation. They also had ice cream albeit not self serve. Had to wait for someone to come by to scoop some for me. After several minutes of the sever trying to scoop the hard ice cream, I ended up getting what looked like half a scoop and a sorry that he couldn't scoop more. I also noticed he did not wear gloves and his fingernails were dirty *shiver.   The Mongolian grill had a good selection of items to grill but their sauces were lacking in choice. I was only asked spiciness level and that was it. The sauce was lacking in flavor but the items were cooked ok.   All in all a good place to try out once but I wouldn't be returning for the price."}
{"text":"Amazing place with very nice service. The place is clean and most importantly, the food was delicious  will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Can't believe the reviews claimed this place was good. Lack of food and lack of quality. The few things that were out didn't taste good and were not hot. Sub par service and not a good value at all"}
{"text":"I've since had to update my review because I don't want to steer any fellow Yelpers wrong. On our fourth or fifth experience a year or so later, I hate to say it, but the quality has dropped significantly! It could be that we came at the wrong time, but the selections were limited and the meats were all a little dry. If you're going to stop by for a bite, be sure to come at the beginning of the lunch or dinner hours!"}
{"text":"The food is really Good, when they bring it out . Waited and waited for some wontons for the wonton soup, but gave up after about 45 minutes. Sushi was nice and fresh and the chefs seemed to keep up.  The crab legs were way too salty, like they were boiled with a pound of salt. Our waitress was very inattentive and rarely came by to pick up empty plates or refill drinks. For the price you pay, they should never run out of anything. I would still recommend a visit as the quality of the food is excellent and the place is very clean.  The owners need to pay attention and address these simple issues before it gets any worse and the word spreads."}
{"text":"Not our first visit, it's always been pretty decent, but tonight, wow. Someone pissed off all the staff. Nothing was hot. I'm just hoping they were having a bad night and that my expectations weren't that high - but I'll be Leary at coming back...."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  At first we were not going to try it because we thought it might be the same owners of the last buffet that was there, Yummy's, which was horrible and went out of business.  But, this is new owners and the food is hot and plentiful and a large variety.  The place has been remodeled and is bright and clean.  Waitress was very attentive and friendly (Lisa) and we also met the owner (Darren) who was very nice and asked if we were doing okay.  We said everything was great and we definitely would recommend this place.  We went for lunch.  Great selection of sushi, deserts and salads with numerous main dishes.  Glad we tried it."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive to try sushi from a buffet, but it is sooo good! My coworker comes here all the time and finally talked me into going. I work in the same plaza so it is a perfect, quick lunch. A wide variety of sushi to choose from, which is nice! I've never tried anything else, but my coworker has and has enjoyed it all!"}
{"text":"They changed owners since end of last year and been there about seven times since then.  I like their poke bowl bar.  Although their price is a lot cheaper then other buffet but their quality is good.  They just has less selections.  I rather a restaurant provide quality then quantity food especially buffet place."}
{"text":"We had such an amazing experience!! Lisa took care of us and even helped me with my baby so I could eat while they were slow. I just can't say enough. The food was hot and fresh. Best of all, we didn't leave feeling MSG drugged. Thank you all for a wonderful experience! Michael, Tina, Lilly & Joey"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed! The dinning area large and beautiful at first look, but when I sat down I noticed unswept floors and food on table platforms that was to be silver and shinny. There was a lot of food choices, but most of the meat taste old, not fresh,  crab legs were small and didn't have full meat inside, and every dish was not kept at proper temperature, all things I tried were Luke warm. Even ice creams had. Ice frosted over it and the one I thought was fresh didn't taste fresh either. Another customer over heard my party talking about food and they agreed and said \"this place won't be open long\" I give it all thumbs down, the price I paid was way too much for what I could tolerate to eat. I won't be back there!"}
{"text":"My new favorite buffet! The sushi/sashimi is better than Pacific and everything else is very comparable. They also have seared tuna which I haven't seen at other buffets along with all the sushi. If you're looking for crab legs they have that every night and unlike most other Chinese buffets I've been to, they even have a chocolate fountain! The two times I've gone, the orange chicken has been fried perfectly and the sauce is very good as well, dinner is only 17-18 a person too!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food buffet I ever eat so far in Arizona. I luv foods nd the place is nice also the people r very nice nd friendly.."}
{"text":"I just dined here for the first time. I have to say I was impressed. The staff were friendly, the restaurant was clean and the food was amazing. There were so many buffet choices! Everything I had was very good. This has become my favorite places to enjoy a nice meal."}
{"text":"The ambiance was nice and the restaurant was clean. Everyone was very friendly. The food was good for the price. I paid 18 for dinner with crab legs."}
{"text":"This place was horrible just for myself was $23.12! You would think our drinks would be included with the buffet but they charge that separate! I've never been so disappointed in a restaurant/buffet ever. The food wasn't as good and our waitress barely came over to refill our drinks. They put their own gratuities in the receipt we don't get to decide how much of a gratuity we want to give them."}
{"text":"They have tip jars at the sushi stations, which is tacky.  The sushi station should be producing accordingly to the need and not based on tip.  That's ridiculous.  They have sushi and various Chinese and Japanese hot dishes (some hot dishes get cold).  They also have a salad bar and banana fosters.  I could only eat a plate or two before I was full.  I think it was around $55 for 3 people for dinner, which isn't bad.  The service is good at the tables and the bathroom is clean."}
{"text":"What was supposed to be hot was cold, and what was supposed to be cold was lukewarm. Way overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Excellent food. And it's at a great price. Very clean and good service. I will definitely come back and recommend this buffet."}
{"text":"First time here and couldn't be happier. The seafood was fresh and hot. The chicken and beef entrees were great. My wife is a picky seafood eater and she was in heaven. The clams impressed her along with stuffed oysters on the half shell. She says it tasted like it had a buttery spicy sauce that she loved.  I enjoyed the cold sushi and nigiri. The sushi chefs asked what flavor we liked and made us a fresh eel roll. It was excellent.  She is also picky with her sushi and to my amazement nearly ate all of the roll. When your wife looks up at you, smiles and says \"that hit the spot\", I know it was good.  I'm glad I came here tonight and will come again, maybe on a Sunday when they have Alaskan Crab Legs."}
{"text":"wow, the selection and quality of the food were outstanding.  didn't expect it at all. not your typical run-of-da-mill \"yawner\" AYCE buffet joint.  will come back when in town again.   One thing to note... they ran out of the tempura, even though i asked couple times and the staff mentioned it to the sushi bar folks... but never saw one tempura.  oh well, not a deal breaker.  Did i mention it was $9.99 per person for lunch???   Crazy cheap!  \"Piece\"!!!"}
{"text":"Very clean, good selection, sushi above par for a buffet. Did not try Hibachi grill, but it looked good. Was a great change from the previous Yummy Buffet."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a nice Chinese buffet since we moved here last summer.  I discovered this place while shopping last week.  It's very large, clean, and nicely decorated.  We were greeted and seated right away.  The waitress was wonderful.  Our plates were cleared and drinks filled right away.  She made small talk with us and encouraged my son to eat more.  I also saw her interact with a dad and his two kids.  She helped him with his upset son by cutting up and bringing food to him.  It seemed like she had a lot of regulars who knew her well.  There was a wide variety of food.  Tons of sushi, meat options, appetizers, and traditional Chinese, along with several ice cream flavors and other desserts.  They even had a bar and seemed to be adding to the buffet area.  We'd definitely go back.  All of my food was very good and my picky son enjoyed his meal, too."}
{"text":"I first tried Jogoya with some friends and decided to return again later that same week with my family because it was so good. The first thing I noticed was how beautifully the restaurant was designed. It is very welcoming and the staff are just wonderful. I really enjoyed dining here and I think it would be a great place to take a small or large groups of family/friends.   The buffet boasts a large variety of Asian entrees, including crowd favorites like orange chicken, crab legs and even some dishes you only see at a dim sum. It also has a Mongolian style grill, a sushi and sashimi bar, fruits, cake and ice cream, and even a chocolate fountain! What really impressed me was the quality and selection of sushi and sashimi. I don't usually see yellowtail served at other buffets, which I was able to really enjoy here. I would say that Jogoya is second to none as far as a local seafood buffet.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed dining at Jogoya. It has become my new favorite place for dinner with friends and the prices are very reasonable as well. I will definitely be coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Came here with my daughter, the sushi was sitting out for a long time and still had skin on some of the rolls. Also I want to point out my daughter got a cream puff, when she bit down she screamed. I took it from her and not one but two flys came out. I told the waitress and they just apologize and said they were ordered in.   They didn't even comp my daughters dinner, they offered a 10 percent discount. The manager didn't bother to even come over and apologies."}
{"text":"Came back and they have poke!! Best deal in town. They even use fresh poke ingredients like mango etc. good service as always."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a pretty good buffet. Lots of seafood selection. I'm a sushi lover but i didn't like their sushi. The fish was smelly and i couldn't eat it. Other seafood dishes were great like crabs and shrimp. Great soup selection too. There was chicken and meat dishes however they were all sweet. Why should meat taste like dessert ? I'll go again though maybe it'll be better next time. I like lin's buffet on Baseline"}
{"text":"The poke bowl station is fantastic! Everything else was just ok...but for $10 I'll go here for Poke every time!"}
{"text":"This food was amazing and the place was so clean and on a very busy day. Mother's Day. Very happy with there food and desserts. I did wish they didn't have cakes there that I can buy at a grocery store though. But it was delicious and very family oriented. Best Chinese buffet place I know of in Phx"}
{"text":"Wow! Good food, clean, server really friendly.  I love seafood , crab legs just my favorite."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and very clean and nice setting. High Recommend this place it's really good and the food is delicious definitely worth it plus bar and food selection is soooo good! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Ate there and saw cockroaches crawling on the floor so I asked to move seats, away from the bugs. When I ate the chicken I found hairs in them, sizzled onto the chicken itself. When I talked to the manager/owner, he accused me of planting it.  Would never eat here again, and do not recommend.  Tried some watermelon also and it had a fleshy look, like skin rather than juicy watermelon."}
{"text":"Do not listen to one bad review I am a chef this is the best sushi bar saying in the state this place is incredible and I highly recommend you come here and they're very very friendly"}
{"text":"It is pretty much the exact same as Pacific Buffet but cleaner. The owner is the same as well and I see many of the long term staff that I used to see at Pacific over here at Jogoya.   There are also a couple additions like the chocolate fountain, fresh oysters, and now the ice cream is served by the employees.   Great for a casual lunch with friends. :-)"}
{"text":"Just your average Asian buffet here, except for one thing (from my experience with Asian buffets in AZ)... there is a chocolate fountain. That is pretty cool. And the dessert selection was larger than other cheap Asian buffets that I have been to in AZ.   This place is very comparable to Pacific Buffet in Chandler. In fact, most of the food looks nearly identical, but that should not stop you from going.   I think people should try this place at least once if they are into Asian buffets. It is not bad and has decent value."}
{"text":"Standard Chinese buffet, but perhaps a little better than other places since it's newer.  Time will tell whether the cleanliness and food quality will last.  Selection is smaller than Pacific, but there were more sushi options.  We were pleasant surprised to find the food fresh, even though it wasn't super busy.  That's an issue that we've had with other Asian buffets where the food will be sitting out for awhile.  Happy to say that was not the case here."}
{"text":"Before our dinner was even over my husband and I were both running to the bathroom with upset stomachs.  We will NOT be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Such an impressive place to eat. Every kind of Chinese food you would want, sushi, fish, the varieties are endless. Clean and friendly servers."}
{"text":"We meaning me and the family have enjoyed this place since it opened. They are under new management and made huge changes. They have added POKE all you can eat bar which is a first for me and I actually enjoy the fresh mix of vegetables and vrious choices of protein ( ahi Tuna shrimp crab and so on ) The look is nice and they also LOWERED the price ! From my experience prices change higher when new management comes in not lower . 12.99 is the highest you will pay on Sunday due to available Crab legs and other added items. The new manager more then helpful and showed me how to prepare a POKE bowl being a first timer. The atmosphere is good place is clean and service is good at a nice price. We will continue to come back for more.   Ps not to mentione they have a ton of other items full range for many .."}
{"text":"Yaed to be really good but the quality has gone down. Not bad pricing for a buffet tho. $10 for lunch"}
{"text":"Food was very good, especially for a buffet, love the grill selections. Our server, Lisa, was awesome and great with all our kids! We'll definitely be dining here again!"}
{"text":"Read reviews and was excited to try it. We will NOT be back. Food was mediocre at best. Hot food was old and most of it was cold. Sushi was rubbery and warm. To boot, they advertised on the LARGE white board at the entrance: $9.99 Lunch. Since they make you wait until the end to pay, I felt like it was a bait and switch. They charged us $20 instead of $9.99 and cited the prices were different on Sunday. Putting that on the large white board at the entrance would have been helpful. I feel physically ill after eating there. Honestly, giving them a rating of 2 stars is generous."}
{"text":"Their food was average. Very clean. A lot of my food was overcooked & some of it tasted either too salty or extremely bland."}
{"text":"Great buffet. Good price. Go there once a week. Sushi id good. And they added poki bowl"}
{"text":"Great new Buffett in So. Gilbert. Great sushi, Hibachi grill is a nice option. Very clean and a great value for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Especially for a holiday. We go here and the lady at the front couldn't even tell us how long it was going to take to be seated , hen we needed a chair for the car seat and she brought us a booster seat. Then a high chair. Then they were out of the car seat carriers come to realize they ran out. Then they made our party of 8 sit in three seperate booths while the large tables were separated into fours (they could have had the group of fours in the booth that way the tables were available for the larger groups of people. Just very poorly organized. I'm highly disappointed. The food was great though but with the service I honestly would have chosen to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Well it's better then the last 2-3 buffet places that were here. The sushi and sashimi is actually good too. They had 2 chefs making the sushi but most of the time there were 3-4 empty sushi stations? It wasn't jammed packed in here or anything so I don't know about that. They had raw oysters which look fresh but they were warm. The food is typical buffet but I like how they set it up the area, modern. The food station area was very clean however the table area was kind of messy. The booth they sat us in still had some food and napkins underneath. Our server barely checked on us. We had to stop her to refill drinks and stopped her to get our check.  I didn't like that most of the food were warm when it should be hot. Preferably I like my hot food hot and cold food cold. The desert station was small. I think when I went up there, there were 3 stations, cheesecake, tiramisu and cream puffs. There was a ice cream station with a server there to scoop up the ice cream that you wanted. I like that it wasn't the kids or customers hands in the ice cream barrels trying to scoop themselves.  Overall I think the business is starting up and as they  improve this place could be the best buffet in the east valley."}
{"text":"My kids actually asked to come here as their grandparents had taken them once before. My kids are 12 and 11. When we entered, it was not a particularly busy night and we were seated immediately. I saw the Hibachi station, which my kids immediately went to after placing orders for soda with the waitress and was hopeful the kids would have a nice dinner. They picked at their hibachi makings, sampled a bit of chicken from skewers and had maybe two marshmallows dipped in chocolate from the fountain. I tried a small sampling of 2 crab legs (super watery, not very meaty). I think they made plenty crab legs, but even though it wasn't busy, I saw tables of adults with 3 plates full of crab legs per person. The sushi was ok, definitely \"buffet\" quality sushi. The other items were very standard for a Chinese buffet, but were inconsistent temperatures. I don't believe everything was kept where it should have been for food safety. Having said that, it as ok. Until I received the check. Remember how I said we were seated immediately? Apparently I missed the sign at the entrance that stated how much dinner was. I had water. My kids each had 1 soda that was never refilled. Our bill was $53.99 with tax before we considered any sort of tip. Turns out, my 12 year old was charged a full adult price of $16.99 and my 11 year old was $11.99. Sodas were extra. I am sure they're charging everyone more overall, to make up for people who eat 3 plates of crab legs - but armed with this knowledge -- I'll never go back. I'll also strongly discourage anyone with kids from venturing here."}
{"text":"I would say this place is a great place. Especially go there at Sat noon, the price is unbeatable! I think it's some what $9.99 plus tax it will be around $11   But it's still a great deal. You can get almost every Asian cuisines you want there. Fishes, Pacific saury, sushi, some simple dimsums, and beef, pork, and ice creams!"}
{"text":"Pretty clean and friendly, but as slow as it was, service should have been better. Food not very hot, and seemed dried out by heat lamps. Mediocre selections missing labels. $15 for dinner."}
{"text":"So so glad I found this place and tried it! Although this is so far from me, I was out that way and my mom and I chose to give this place a try. I love sushi and I love eating as much as possible. My favorite place closed down and t has definitely taken it's place. The sushi selection is great, very fresh and nice a d cold.  Personally I only eat sashimi, however their other sushi rolls looked amazing.  My mom tried some and loved them. As far as the other food,  great selection, lots to pick from, and crab legs! Good ones too. They also have the poke bar, which I haven't heard of until this place.  It tasted great. The staff was friendly and quick to seat us. I wish I was closer, however I'll make the drive again."}
{"text":"Great service and very clean. Good food selection, fresh and good flavor. They obviously invest in quality and the place is up to date."}
{"text":"I think the current rating for this place is not fair. It's actually pretty decent for a Chinese buffet. They definitely take their time and make some decent sushi as well as have quality ice cream and a decent Mongolian barbecue.  We can't really expect five star food at a Chinese buffet but I was say this place does pretty decent"}
{"text":"It was so good Thursday after 5pm, I had to go back yesterday on Sunday, Good news, the service was moderately better (still need of improvement) I went because they said  oysters on the weekend, I think  Thursday late, the fresh fish comes in , because the blue crab was  mushy, the opposite  as on Thursday, It is likely they get ready for the Weekend on Thursday ??? no real proof. and the oysters by Sunday , were on the edge of being  on their way out, I don't eat them that way, I guess I will have to give this  \"2 out of 3 try's , I'll go back on a Thursday or Friday to  try,, Sunday was slow no costomers, and I was disappointed, also I did try their clam chowder, \"It is really good\" but for 21.00 bucks I  can get a can and be happy. tune in for my 3rd one when I am hungry enough to go back and give them another try."}
{"text":"For Chinese Buffet Style, this is the mirror image of Pacific seafood Buffet.. Which is one of the Top places for Rural Phoenix area... Now don't get me wrong, its still buffet food, but better than most places !!  We sample most of the different food every time. My main time to go is Dinner to make sure i get some Snow Crab legs.. They get a better variant n cleaner Crab legs than other Buffets I have been to. I get a few plates of crab legs to suffice the $$ for Dining. This location is also A LOT cleaner than the Sister Pacific location as well.   The Owners and Management are also very nice people, and love to listen to constructive criticism if you have any..   Don't forget to try the coconut macaroons,, Yum !!"}
{"text":"Changing my review. Again. Lol  Heard they changed ownership and added a poke bar so figured we would try them again. We went on Sunday and it was busy. Which is good for a buffet. Food was hot and tasted good. Supposedly they only do crabs on Sunday's but they would only bring out a small amount and not often. Wish they at least filled the pan.  Poke bar wasn't as exciting as I expected it to be. But the sushi selection was great and sashimi slices were larger than before. Overall much better than before."}
{"text":"I love this place and always suggest coming when I am in the area! It's hard to find a deal as good as this. For the price of one typical poke bowl, you could theoretically consume as many poke bowls as your heart desired. They have an ample selection of both fish like spicy tuna and toppings like seaweed salad. The sushi section is also so delicious that I have not really ventured into other sections of the buffet island and features a wide variety of sushi. The chocolate cake is so moist and rich and pairs wonderfully with the vanilla ice cream and pudding. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I came in 10 mins before they were closing and they still welcomed us.. Most of their food was gone of course due to closing and they asked us what food do we want them to cook. So we told them what we wanted and they cooked it for us quickly. Everything was fresh and delicious. Restaurant was nice and clean especially the restrooms! No nasty smell.. I noticed most of their servers were from Pacific Seafood it turns out the owner in this buffet is the old owner from Pacific and now his brother is running Pacific. No wonder everything looked similar to that buffet other than that this is newer and much cleaner. I'm glad they opened this buffet because my family loves buffets! And this is only 10 mins away from my house which is great!! Must try people!"}
{"text":"With my husband! Dinner on sale! Regular price: $15.99! Sale price? Try $12.99! There's TWO of us! Much cheaper than when we normally come! Limited time only! No specified end date of sale!!!"}
{"text":"Don't get the peel & eat shrimp. They do not clean the poop vein. Totally gross. Food is lukewarm, and it seems like they really don't care. Never again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst buffet I have been to, despite the new management.  The food sits there far too long and even when it's clear that it's stale, they refuse to bring fresh trays.  Avoid at all costs!  PS - I lived in Vegas for 12 years, so I know a bad buffet when I see it."}
{"text":"We could not figure out what to have for dinner so we ended up at Jogoya. We had 5 adults and 2 children and was able to get in right away. Great selection and everything was fresh, including the fish. There was everything from crab, mussels to chicken wings and ribs. Did I mention that there was dessert? Ice cream and little cakes. The chocolate fountain was there but there was nothing to dip in there? There was one lady assisting us and she was awesome. Talk about personable and very engaging. The family next to us was sharing pictures from their phone with her and she greeted everyone like she knew them. She probably did and they keep going back because she's so sweet. We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Totally unimpressed. I don't expect much from buffets, but this one was just bad. Almost all the food in wontons or with a coating was hard as a rock. All the meats were dried like they were cooked four hours on end. The fried rice was even undercooked. Everything just had an underlying weird taste to it. Not worth the money and we won't be back even though we do like buffets. The worst part was the server for our section never cleared our used plates, plates piled in the middle of the table and never cleared the entire meal."}
{"text":"When this place first opened they served hot crab legs but I came back today and they only served cold crab legs. They run out of the better dishes and you have to wait a long time. For the price I don't think it's worth eating here."}
