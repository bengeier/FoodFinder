BTW - mild has quite a kick!"}

Hunt down for the best biryanis where-ever i go .


This place has the taste of the biryani closest to cafe bahar in Hyderabad , India
check this place out when your in cleveland Ohio ."}
{"text":"I dined here for a late Sunday dinner when the restaurant was pretty empty. Despite being one of the few diners in the place, the service was quite slow. When my food finally came out, it was warm, not super hot. The palak paneer was quite tasty but not spicy at all (I did request a mild spice level though). This place would be a good go-to for takeout."}
{"text":"Best Indian in Cleveland. Great place to go for authentic cuisine,  but atmosphere is \"dive\" like because it's not new or clean looking."}
{"text":"This place made me like Indian food. The chicken makhani is my favorite and one of the best things I've ever eaten. I get it every time I come, which is like once a week. Yes, service can be slow, but they've been doing better lately and it's worth the wait regardless."}
{"text":"Indian Delight is the newest entry in growing collection of Detroit Shoreway neighborhood. They are open 7 days a week, and I think they may have a lunchtime buffet (at least the buffet stand was set up with christmas tinsel no less). It has authentic plastic table cloths and the decoration is pretty spartan. We tried the vegetarian samosas which were pretty good. I had Chicken Makhani which was delicious and my friend had Chicken Saagwala. We were both wimps and ordered our food medium which turned out to be more like mild. The basmati rice was really good and plentiful and the naan was excellent. It's a great addition to the hood, and I see a lot of Indian carryout in my future"}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews. In Fact, I've never written one. I couldn't even get to taste the food, so I won't comment on that. 

Smell the plates before you eat, smell the glass before you drink. The rag on which they put their bread stinks like it's been used as a cleaning rag but was never washed. I brought my concerns to the server's attention and she promptly changed the plates. They smelled worse. Same thing with glasses. I should have left when I walked in. Friday night and 8 pm with zero customers should have rang a bell, but the 4.5 star rating on Yelp made me stay. 

I work in health care. I see very bad wound infections on a daily basis and they don't phase me. This smell wasn't anything like I have smelled before. Be careful. I hope the manager will do something and change the way this business is being run. 

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Great food, but sub-par atmosphere.  Opt for carryout when you're n the mood for something different.  Well worth the 30 minute wait."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, parked right in front. After skimming the menu and seeing lots of interesting choices, we both chose the lunch buffet. Stuffed myself silly with two big plates of food and enjoyed every bit of it. Had a mango lassi which was also very good and a balance to the spiciness of the food. Our waiter brought out fresh naan when we asked and was attentive."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Let's just say you'll want to do takeaway for your meal. 
Speed of service: We were early for food pickup, but even after arrival, the food took longer than they said. 
Food: Amazing. After waiting so long in a dingy restaurant, we were prepared to dislike, but it was wonderful.  
Conclusion: Order ahead. Give them time to get it right. Then go home and enjoy."}
{"text":"I realize I'm giving this place a 3 when the food warrants a higher rating- it's about the inside of the restaurant. Now, I'm no stickler for insanely clean restaurants and I don't moonlight for the Health Department. I'm down with eating in a hole in the wall, provided its some damn good food- and that's what's going on with this restaurant.

I came here on Monday and ordered takeout for the first time. Monday was hot as balls, at 90-some degrees outside, so the kitchen left the front door open (I'm assuming for air circulation) and I, being a dumb noob customer, mistakenly walked into the kitchen. Saying it was not clean is a gruesome understatement. I would be lying if I did not consider getting back in my car and going to a cleaner restaurant. However, it smelled delicious and I tried to put the sights I had just witnessed out of my mind and only think of the impending Indian food.

I went into the actual restaurant, not the kitchen, which was a step above in terms of cleanliness, but not by much. This restaurant definitely warrants takeout more than dining in (however, I understand there is a killer Indian buffet that may sway my opinion, keep reading). 

I received my order: Chicken Tikka Masala, Palak Paneer, Channa Masala and 2 orders of garlic naan. Holy shit, it was amazing. Chicken tikka masala was far superior to India Garden; scratch that, everything was far superior to India Garden. A tad more expensive, but I ate the leftovers for about 3 meals (split between 2 people, which made it rational for me). I realize the beginning of my review makes the restaurant sound disgusting and I don't mean it to, as I was considering going back and ordering more food today. 

Now that you have a full understanding of what goes on in the back of the kitchen, know that I would still definitely recommend eating there. Especially due to the fact that the average household kitchen contains more germs than a toilet. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Glass top tables in need of Windex and the dirty stained tablecloths beneath should be laundered at least weekly. Yuck! 5 guests in the whole place, seated at three different tables. Weird that every time someone else came out of the kitchen they stirred all the dishes on the buffet table. They need to clean. The server stands at the end to pass out plates. Huh! Give that man a bucket and some sponges. Old resataurant saying \"if you've got time to lean, you've got time to clean.\" One postive thing I can say is the tandoor chicken is not totally dried out like that served @ India Garden and the rice was moist not crunchy. Restaurant is dirty. See pics of the tablecloth and vinyl drape under the condiments."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Indian food.  Surprisingly something that has been hard to find in Cleveland. Would highly recommended their chaat. For meat lovers try to get their haleem...best haleem I have had. For those of you who have nwver heard of it before, its a dish usually exclusively made by muslims in the asian subcontinent during the time of ramadan. They usually have it while breaking their fast. It is slowly cooked over a few hours with wheat, meat and spices. And their biryani ? Definitely authentic hyderbadi biryani."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times and I know my Indian food!! This place does a very good job with chicken makhani (which is my favourite on their menu). I've never been disappointed in any new dish on their menu that I have tried. Would recommend it hands down to all Indian food lovers!"}
{"text":"Their Dum Briyani's and Haleem are the best you get in Cleveland... If you are in Cleveland and a fan of Indian Cuisine,  Then this place is a no miss..

Note - Ambiance is avg so prefer carry out here..."}
{"text":"Usually I like this place a lot but last time I ordered the rice pudding was SOOO watery and the bowl wasn't full. I really felt like I was gypped!  They make fantastic food but it is a bit over priced."}
{"text":"AVOID.

I went here for the buffet recently.  They hardly had any food and promised to refill.  This lie is what made us agree to pay for the buffet.

They bring out only a little bit of food at a time.  There is tons of food in the back, and the whole restaurant was complaining about the lack of food especially the meat.  Yet only little bits would trickle out from their pre-made pile in the back.

They let you fill up on rice and naan which is well stocked but have to compete with other patrons for the meat.  

You are better off going elsewhere.  We left hungry and frustrated.

It's a trap and a ripoff."}
{"text":"Serves the best biryani in the Cleveland area.Buffet is good as well.The restroom was dirty."}
{"text":"I'm giving Indian Delight 5 stars for food! Atmosphere is lacking as can be the service (they are really nice there if you strike up a convo though). Lunch buffets are lunch buffets...i really don't think expectations should be that high to begin with....but their lunch buffet has more options then most around here.

My boyfriend is from India and this is his preferred location for several dishes including chicken biryani (especially the hyderabadi version), both chicken and paneer tikka masala, and samosas. We both are in LOVE LOVE LOVE with their paneer tikka masala!!!! Try it! I would suggest eating it with the garlic naan...making my mouth water now! 

It's such a treat having them in the neigborhood! The take out is quick and always ready in time too."}
{"text":"I've been trying to support this place since it opened in my neighborhood. They had some real service problems at the beginning which seems do improve, but the food was pretty good so I tried to give a chance to grow.

Things were better for a while but on a recent visit, a Sunday evening, the service was just horrible. The server really didn't know how to manage the few tables that were filled, took her at least 20 minutes to bring drinks! After an hour of waiting for food and at least four other parties coming in, waiting and giving up, we also gave up.
Lot's of people came in and out during our wait to pick up carry out orders; maybe that's what they should stick with because their dining room service is awful."}
{"text":"...From the UK so have enjoyed good Indian food. This is by far the best Iv'e had since being here...18yrs!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best biryani in US.
I've had biryani from the best places in New York, Chicago and Houston, this beats them all.
The staff is very nice and food is cheap.
The interior of the restaurant can use a make over, but that's just nitpicking."}
{"text":"I had a table for 1; however, half way thru my meal, I found a big cockroach on the table....the waiter/owner apologized when he brought me my check.....never again..."}
{"text":"Garlic naans are good,murgh Masala curry was just ok, kebabs were too good and finally mouth watering haleen at non ramzan time!!!! Haleem was delicious...I would go here anytime for haleem !!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly their food is good. Their service and ability to remain consistent as a business is sketchy at best. This is not a place you can rely on for regular food based on their hours. I just called to order the biryani at 5:50 on a Sunday and they said they are already out. They open at 5!!  Last time I called they wouldn't let me place the order until 6 on a Sunday. Food is good but they either need to invest in a business manager or more staff.  I want to support small businesses in my area but when their ability to give you food is just gone to shit they get a review like this.  Sorry!  I want to love you but I just can't."}
{"text":"Love this place very much . Really great indian food . No one in Cleveland offers true Hydrabadi cuisines like this restaurant . Yum ! Yum !  Great service ."}
{"text":"The biryani here is awesome! I'd die for the dry chicken chilli here. Price might seem a bit high. But surely worth it. The customer service is also awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great place. Do not be fooled by the location or the minimum of \"ambiance\". The food is fantastic and the service is always great. If you opt for take out -- it is ready quickly and worth the trip to pick it up. You can have delivery but we have never tried that since we live in the area. Recommend."}
{"text":"I got take out from here so I can't speak to the service but the food was pretty good.  The paneer tikka masala was great.  Naan was standard.  I've been looking for good papri chaat everywhere and it definitely compares to the kind you'd find in NYC Indian restaurants.  I didn't love the chili pakora because the batter was too thick and the peppers were too spicy (the latter obviously couldn't be controlled by the restaurant and just my own taste).  Overall very good.  I'd go for their buffet."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Cleveland! My husband and I order from here all the time. We aren't big on Indian buffets in general so never tried theirs but ordering off the menu has never failed us. We usually order paneer tikka masala, chicken madras, and daal makhani along with some biryani. The biryani is absolutely amazing and has to be ordered in advance as they tend to run out every day because it's so popular! Can't say enough good stuff about the food here!"}
{"text":"We visited Indian delight on a Sunday evening. As soon we entered the restaurant, the hostess was listening to her ipod and had the earphones on and didnt first listen that we were there. She did not take out the earphones during our entire conversation. The decor of the restaurant was OK. The ordeal started then, we placed the order and asked it to be spicy. We are Indians and do know what Indian spicy is. We ordered samosa chat, papri chat, bhel puri, panner pakora X2 and lassi. The 1st order that came out was bhel puri and it was SO SPICY. It had red chilli powder all over it. We told them that it is not Indian spicy, but seems that it has been made in a gravy of red chilli powder. The reply was that you told us that you want spicy and hence you have it. No apologies or any effort to comfort us. It was so spicy that it burnt our throat and stomach. We asked them not to make the other items so spicy. The answer was TOO LATE.... other stuff is already ready. Our hostess served our food along with her earphones plugged in. On telling her that the food was spicy......she made a face and walked away.

Seeing such bad service, we told them that we will put some reviews about the service. Later on the other server and the restaurant manager came to us and apologized and told us not to put the review anywhere. I think they apologized only for the sake that we do not put some negative reviews.

This place is not recommended at all and will not visit again. The food quality was OK at best and the service was worst seen in the US."}
{"text":"We have tried this place several times and ordered off the menu and also tried the buffet.  We love the food!  The lamb or chicken Korma is ridiculously good!!!  My husband and I get 'American hot' and it is perfect for us.  We really like the fact that they will bring out more rice for you - even if you have ordered off the menu for no extra charge.  
The reason it gets 4 out of 5 stars is the atmosphere and the workers there are not up to par!  Sometimes it is so quiet in there because there is not music for ambiance most of the time...so it has a weird vibe.
Also the staff... they are not very friendly, and after taking your order and bringing your food to the table....they just disappear!!   So here you are, sitting at a table in dead silence all alone .... Like I said....  Weird!!!
But the food is great and my husband and I can entertain ourselves between mouthfuls of Yummy food!"}
{"text":"Try the chicken 65, samosas, n biryani. Yum! Best authentic Indian food place I've had in Cleveland so far. Don't let the look of the place fool you. Diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"The Vietnamese restaurant across the street was at capacity, so we decided to give Indian Delight a try.  Walked in and it was at least 80-82 degrees inside.  The female hostess/server had a bad attitude, \"Just two?\"...no smile, unpleasant tone.   She did not do one thing to make us feel welcome.  She dropped off two waters that were warm...it looked like all the ice had melted in the pitcher due to the warmth of the restaurant.   We asked a question about getting beer next door and she was once again, less than pleasant.  We got up and went back across the street.  There was one table occupied at 7 PM on a Saturday night.  I wonder why?"}
{"text":"I went here on 2/22/16 around 9pm with my boyfriend. Right when we entered we were greeted warmly! I absolutely love Indian food and I can already tell that this place will have me back!

Awesome vegetarian selections! Even though we got there an hour before closing, our food was made fresh! I ordered the Aloo Gobi and my boyfriend ordered the Daal Makhani. We also shared the garlic naan. I can't even begin to say how delicious and fresh our food was! We had two options on spice: mild or medium. Feeling adventurous, we did the medium. It was a little too spicey for us but still amazing! 

They were a little busy but our waiter (never got his name) was always checking up on us, on other tables and handling takeout orders. I would suggest this place to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Buffet was very good with a great selection & the price was very reasonable. However, it was extemely quiet at a whisper and the temperature was cold in the restaurant which made it uncomfortable to enjoy the meal to the fullest."}
{"text":"Excellent north Indian food, definitely the best Indian restaurant I've been to in Cleveland. I had the lunch buffet and it was really great. They kept refilling the food fairly often so it was fresh. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This rating is an average of two experiences with \"Indian Delight\" located on Detroit Ave, in The GSAD. Eating in the restaurant was pleasant and the food was delicious. I had Chicken Vindaloo and tasted the Aloo Gobi that my dinner partner ordered-The Vindaloo was perfect, spicy, not 'too' hot, tangy and saucy. It was a very flavorful dish and being served with rice, it was satisfying but not heavy. The Aloo Gobi was surprisingly full bodied flavor for being simply cauliflower & potatoes stir-fried with spice. I ordered a vegetarian Paneer Makhani to go and we ate dessert-Gulab Jamun & Kheer. Service was good altho the waitress could not understand our questionsand she had to retrieve the owner to answer. All in all, it was a good, polite, yummy experience. 

BUT THEN I PLACED A PHONE ORDER-Paneer Makhani & Chicken Vindaloo-I had such a craving from my last experience. When I said\"...Chicken Vindaloo..\" the response over the phone sounded like \"..Chicken Vandahli\", I said \"No,Chicken Vindaloo\", he said \"..Chicken Vandahli\", I repeated \"No,Chicken Vindaloo\" he repeated \"Chicken Vandahli\" I said again\"..VINDALOO\" & AGAIN HE WITH THE \"..VINDAHLI\" So I said \"Ok, I guess I'm pronouncing it wrong and I asked for it spicy. When we picked up the order, the Paneer Makhani was correct but instead of Chicken Vindaloo the dish was something that isn't even listed on the menu-It was dry bone-in chicken pieces coated with spice laying on dry onions stir-fried in spice-COMPLETELY NOT WHAT I ORDERED! When I called to complain he said that he repeated \"Vandahli\" and I said \"yes\" When I tried to explain,(as I did above), He said \"..No, let me explain to you..\" He would not admit a mistake, nor grant a credit and I gave up telling him that I'd eat it anyway because obviously he couldn't understand me!

NOT COOL! So Enjoy your \"In restaurant\" experience BUT USE CAUTION WHEN ORDERING ON THE PHONE AND DON'T GIVE UP UNTIL YOU ARE REPEATED VERBATIM! You may be disappointed but worse, you won't receive a refund nor an apology to ensure another visit  /:- ["}
{"text":"This is our go to Indian place for takeout. I don't think it's the best I have ever had, but it is good and it's the closest. 

My favorite and most ordered dish is the Chicken Tikka Masala (medium spice). When you order they ask what level of spice you want, the first time I ordered I didn't know what to expect so went with the medium. That was a good decision because it was the perfect amount of spice, not so hot that you felt like you could no longer taste the food, but not so mild you had to ask where's the heat? The creamy tomato sauce has a perfect blend of spices. Definitely up there with some of the best Indian restaurants I have been to.

My least favorite dish was the Neelgiri Korma. It's a creamy sauce with almonds and cashews. While the flavors were good, it was just too greasy for my liking. 

The Samosas are good. You get two big samosas with each order. Garlic Naan also good...Although I don't think there is anything that makes these stand out from any other good Indian restaurant.  

We have always ordered for pick up, never eaten in the restaurant.  The food is always hot and fresh and the service is always friendly. Also great for reheating the next day, because the portions are pretty large, especially when you order apps and naan."}
{"text":"I first tried Indian Delight in response to a neighborhood call for a \"Cash Mob\" to businesses affected by a lengthy road closure due to a repair last winter. I'll admit it, I was extremely skeptical. While the dining room leaves much to be desired and the service is just okay, the food is delicious so I most often order takeout, sometimes weekly (seriously). After reigniting my taste for Indian flavors (I go on flavor profile binges- my last one was Thai and Cambodian and before that, Vietnamese), I went on a tour of Cleveland Indian establishments, seeking out \"the one.\" While Indian Garden in Lakewood/Rocky River is probably the best when it comes to flavor, value, and service, Indian Delight is closer, cheaper, and their Neelgiri Korma is unusual (chicken and cilantro, cashew/almond based korma). I have yet to find it served at any of the other Indian restaurants in town so I'll say it's the best I've ever had. 

I'm sure they know me by my regular order of : \"Neelgiri Korma- medium spicey, paneer pakora, two garlic naan, and samosas.\" I've tried several other dishes- their regular korma, lamb vindaloo, and chicken tikka masala- all excellent. But, I keep coming back to that Neelgiri Korma every time.

Definitely don't pass up this Gordan Square gem when you're in the area, but maybe order it to go."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Indian food, and definitely the worst buffet, I've ever had.  We arrived for the lunch buffet around 1;45pm.  It's supposed to last until 3:00pm, but by the time we got there some of the dishes were already empty, and more were so close to empty that we had to negotiate who got to eat what.  And they never refilled them.  Not when we arrived, nor when other patrons, who faced even more empty dishes, arrived after us.  The restaurant was poorly lit and very dirty.  They ran out of bowls.  I asked the waitress for green chutney, and she said \"it's there\" while pointing at what was clearly raita.  The food that was available did not seem fresh (the naan was hard), nor particularly well seasoned.  Even if the place had been clean and everything full, it still would have been a disappointing buffet.  Definitely one to avoid."}
{"text":"My wife and kids join me here for the lunch buffet at least once a month. My kids cannot get enough of the chicken and naan. My wife loves everything and so do I. It's a small hole in the wall kind of place that is not impressive by any means atheistically. But aren't all the places with really good food like that? We've tried about 5 other Indian restaurants in the greater Cleveland area and have yet to find one as good as this."}
{"text":"This is some good shit!!!

This is the first Indian food I've tried in Cleveland. My husband went bananas over the papri chat - totally agree with Pam C on that one!!!! We had the buttery, soft naan as well. I guess naan can't really be bad, but this was gooooood.

I had the lamb saag, which was different for me, as I usually order chicken korma or chana masala. It was great, but I actually liked the sauce more than the lamb itself. The rice was moist and delicately spiced. 

Haven't been to the restaurant, as ordered from food fetchers, but I would definitely go in a heartbeat. And I would order takeout again! There are a LOT of items to choose from."}
{"text":"Came here before a recent Monday night movie night down at the Capitol Theatre...the four of us shared a bunch of dishes.  We ordered samosas, chicken biryani, chicken madras and a meatball-style dish.

Everything was good, but nothing was great.  Naan was pretty standard and the dipping sauces for the samosas were also decent.  They are supposed to be known for their biryani dishes, but I found them to be uninspiring.  My favorite dish was one our dinner-mates ordered...it was a meatball style meat in a rich orange-yellow gravy (I cannot find the name of it on the menu) and it was really outstanding.  I could not get enough of the sauce!

Will probably come back here, since it is very convenient to our new house...but there are plenty of other Indian spots around town I'd choose to go to."}
{"text":"Indian Delight was a very tasty and insightful visit. I am searching each Saturday the Northeast Ohio region for the best Indian food, I visited here two or three weeks ago. I was overall happy to see a lot of people in the restaurant, that being said it is rather small, that is not their fault though since that is the way that the space was designed in the building. It is tight though and the bathrooms are small and frequently in use. The food is good and I have a nut allergy so having to ask about which items contains nuts can be a trip, however not too bad here. the offerings were a curry (lamb), Chicken Tikka Marsala, Naan brought to the table, salad (unsure if they had Chaat or not), two vegetarian dishes which were quite tasty, rice, and gulab jamun. That was about it, however that is more than enough to have your fill. They also have an A La Carte menu if you want Samosa or Lassi. I would not say the best since others around the area are as tasty with more selection but by no means are they had. The chicken seemed like breast and some Indian restaurants and other buffets are known to add flour/baking soda to food to fill you up and I did not sense that here. So it is worth a visit, the spice was good I would say about a 3/10 so very tolerable and the service was good."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I tried out Indian Delight last Sunday for their brunch buffet!

Now, if any of you have read my Indain restaurant reviews, you know that I can be exacting. Having grown up on some great Indian food (in India), I know what I am looking for. And what Indian Delight delivers (in spades) is good, simple, delicious food that gives off a fantastic home cooked vibe. 

The naan is super soft and delicious, and always bought out hot (even for the buffet). All the curries and dishes were simple, flavorful, not too complicated and not watered down. The chicken in the chicken tikka masala was replenished 5 times in the hour that I was there (so that you didn't have to fish for a piece amongst the gravy).

All in all, a good food experience and a good restaurant (without the epithet of 'for Cleveland')"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Staff were creepers. Just stood there and kinda watched us eat, didn't have any music playing in the restaurant at all, and the food was just ok. Not friendly just a meh attitude. 

If you ar ehard up for some indian food, go here but don't expect to feel like anyone cares you are there."}
{"text":"I am not a big eater of Indian food, to be honest. But I absolutely love their Chicken Tikka Masala.  It's just a little hotter than I can stand when I order it \"medium\", which is just how I like it.  I've only eaten their food on a take-out basis, so I can't comment on the dine-in experience, but for the one dish on an Indian menu that I am brave enough to try, it's very good."}
{"text":"That Hyderabadi Biryani is just too good. They make it in a huge pot, only once or twice a day, so make sure you call in and reserve yours."}
{"text":"The absolute best Indian food in the Cleveland area. I have been to India and try Indian cuisine from all over the area. Great prices for a large amount of food. The service is friendly and considerate. They remember you if you come more than two times."}
{"text":"Good place for Indian food. Friendly staff and tasty food. Chicken Biryani was good. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Passing by on a Sunday -stopped in for dinner and was pleasantly \"Indian Delighted\".  Had the Samosa Chat (veg samosas w/ chickpeas, onions, tomatoes, and a yogurt tamarind sauce) as a starter and can't wait to go back to have it again.  Also enjoyed the  Chicken Madras & Alioo gobi (cauliflower and potatoe dish).  They do not have a liquor license.  We were able to buy a bottle of wine next door and they supplied the wine glasses.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I get food togo due to my routine, I would definitely say nothing beats Indian Delight in Biryani, chicken 65, Mirchi curry etc. Surely worth the money & drive."}
{"text":"If I could give it negative stars I would. The food is not bad but it isn't good either. For the high price I expect  the food to be at least good if not great . I read numerous reviews which said the food was bland for it to be Indian food I didn't believe it because Indian at the very least is packed full of flavor. But this food is BLAND. I read numerous reviews that said the place was dirty but I thought they were exaggerating. They weren't. The place looks grungy which is sorta they way a lot of these hole in the wall spots are but the place was filthy to the extent that I am questioning eating the food. All I'm going to say it they were at least 4 dead flies in the window I literally turned around and stop looking at stuff. And when I did that the corner I was looking at was filthy."}
{"text":"ARE YOU SERIOUS!!!  Disgusting!!  What they served me was more than a day old food recooked.  I had some pieces of chicken that were hard as a rock... I'm not exaggerating.  Stay away.... FAR FAR away if you value your intestines."}
{"text":"delicious food and great service.  Friendly and affordable too.  Chicken tiki masala and paneer tiki masala were excellent.  The nan was excellent too.  The mango lassi was too sweet."}
{"text":"I was going to give this place three stars and my girlfriend was going to give it one. Let's leave it at two. We went for lunch and opted for the buffet. I'm a simpleton and only got the chicken makhani and some naan. I thought it was pretty good but nothing special. My girlfriend had a few other dishes but said they were cold or didn't taste very good.

The server on this day was a gentleman who spent much of his time sitting near the door with a bluetooth in his ear. When we told him it we were ready to leave it took 10 minutes to get the check.

There are a lot of places to get Indian food in Cleveland and I don't see any reason to go back to Indian Delight anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food was okay. The restaurant opens at 11:30 am but if you want the buffet, come after 12:30 pm. The server was friendly."}
{"text":"Meh. Tried it when I was the area because I usually just go to Indian garden. Let's just say it's better for takeout maybe, cause the interior is bleak. Lights blinking on and off, and not the most attentive staff. Food was ok, took a while and we were the only ones in the restaurant. Go to India Garden instead"}
{"text":"I went here with my husband tonight for the first time on the recommendation of a few friends. I was not disappointed. The waiter was friendly and attentive, but not annoyingly so. I had the Chicken Korma and he had the Lamb Vindaloo, along with samosas and garlic Naan. The food was delicious and spiced just right. This place is definitely not fancy, but it doesn't need to be. Our bill for entrees and appetizers came  to less than $40, and the waiter sent me home with an extra container of rice for my leftovers.  I will come back here for sure."}
{"text":"God bless this wonderful place and it's chili chicken and tiki masala! The best Indian food we've ever had. (Droolinggggggg). Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews. But this place does not deserve a good one.

First off, ambiance is nil. How hard is it to slap a few colors of paint on the walls and play some background music? It's not hard. I could do it in my sleep. 

The food was good. Better than average even. It might have even been the best Indian I've tried in Cleveland thus far. And I think I've been to every Indian restaurant in the area. But when your overall dining experience just sucks then you're not likely to remember the tasty food. You'll just remember the negatives. I'm sorry to say Indian Delight, but our experience was much more negative than positive. 

The service was absolutely terrible. We're talking bad to an embarrassing level. SO bad that I was actually worried about other tables and the people that were standing around for more than 45 minutes for take-out orders. There was a guy from Food Fetchers who was waiting about an hour for a take-out order. AN HOUR. And sure, that wasn't me but it was very irritating to hear the employees say \"one more minute!\" to him every 10 minutes. Whoever he was fetching food for was most likely NOT happy and neither was he. 

The server was apologetic to everyone in the place except for my sister and I. She told one table that they had only one cook this evening. So sure, that was probably the hold up. However -- it was sort of insulting that because we were polite and understanding that we didn't get special ass kissing treatment like everyone else did. The table next to us got credited for items and the Food Fetchers guy did as well. My sister and I didn't get credited for anything. Just because we didn't complain. But then again, we didn't really have a chance to complain since the service was so short and the girl was flying around the place like a chicken with her head cut off. She would ask how things were and then literally RUN away before we could answer her. The restaurant wasn't packed either. At all. There were only a few other tables. 

Also, like Carl A. mentioned -- the tables were just really creepy. Why were they covered in Saran wrap? 

Next time, I'll get take-out. And if I wait for more than 15 minutes I will lay on the floor and kick and scream and throw a tantrum and rip tapestries off the walls. Maybe they'll pay attention to me then."}
{"text":"Not sure about the buffet experience below, but..... This place is freaking awesome as far as quality of food..  

Chicken 65 is a great example of a delicious way to start your dinner..  Then add Chana masala to the mix and you have one great meal.....  If you lucky to get before it's gone,  the special Hyderabad Biryani -  Friday is goat,  Sunday is chicken,  then you are in for a special treat..  The spices and flavor is undeniably irresistible..  The vegetable Jalfrezi also tasty, but the must get with any meal is the samosa chaat, if you dare utter these words \" can I have it Indian hot\", those might be the last words you speak for the night because your mouth will be on fire!  Welcome to little Hyderabadi"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Indian place in Cleveland for a couple years. The food has always been good. The buffet is relatively small, with a smaller variety than the other Indian buffet in Lakewood but the food is spicier (about Medium spiciness) and it's all very well made. The wait staff is pleasant and polite when they're there but often there is only one server who spends most of her time presumably preparing food back in the kitchen. If you're one of those people who need to be coddled by their server and need constant attention, this is not the place for you. It doesn't bother me although sometimes I wait a bit longer than I would like for a refill, not a big deal. The value is excellent in my opinion. If you come in with a low-maintenance attitude, you will get great food at a good price.  

It's just barely close enough so that I can make it from downtown on my lunch break to get pick up.  Beware when picking up, though, the food is almost never ready on time for pickup.  I've had to wait up to 10 minutes after the time they told me to come pick it up.  They made me late back to work one time because it took so long.  But that's really the only bad thing I can say about the place."}
{"text":"I am delighted that this place has opened. The food makes me so happy -- it's prepared with real care. None of that typical tired Indian food. I've ordered off the menu and also tried their buffet which offers many choices. But, jeez, what's with the decor. That pink on the wall actually dulls my apetite, especially since it clashes with the sherbet-colored tapestries. That said, I still love this place. Take note that they close mid-afternoon for a couple of hours.

Please note that the colors have been changed to a jewel tone! Well done, Indian Delight."}
{"text":"I figured with my new-found promotion and my proximity to the magic number 100 on yelp, I ought to stop studying for my exams long enough to put up a couple new reviews for the places I've been relying upon to keep my weight up!

Now, being in the medical field, I have my fair share of friends from all over India and from Pakistan as well...and they all love to cook their spicy food for the little white girl thinking that \"she can't handle it\".  The looks of shock and despair when I wolf down their hottest family concoctions and proclaim them only mild or medium are quite amusing to my sadistic sense of humour (and shush, I'm Canadian, that's how we spell it!).

Indian cuisine is one of my favorites and I haven't had it since moving to Cleveland in July...I was in definite withdrawal and dying for it and managed to grab some take-out from Indian Delight last night to share with a friend.

Phone order went a little something like this...

Me: Could I get a Chicken Madras and Rogan Josh along with a Neelgiri Korma?
Owner: Sure, how spicy would you like them?
Me: Indian spicy for the first two and medium for the Korma (traditionally Kormas are mild or medium and for my dining partner's sensitivity b/c I neglected to ask them if uber-spicy stuff was ok, lol)
Owner: ....*Pause*.....
Me:  Hello?
Owner:  You say \"Indian spicy\"??
Me: yes, the hottest you can make it....
Owner:  ok....uh, any lassi to go with that?

So, after I got in the order and brought it home we got to tuck in to some really excellent food.  Their Papri Chat is top notch....for the love of god people, don't order samosas every time you go to an Indian restaurant...try some of the more authentic stuff to start off with!

Requisite garlic naan and basmati rice to go along with the main dishes.  Madras and Rogan Josh were both excellent but I found the Korma a little lacking, seemed like it might have been a local variant that wasn't exactly my favorite.  Indian spicy?  Glad I ordered it that way because it was only about a medium in my books, but definitely excellent enough to be back for more!

Can't really comment on the restaurant since I just got take-out, but the owner met me at the door and was really nice and my food was just ready when I got there (they were pulling the naan out of the oven as I was walking in the door).  Another customer was there also waiting to pick up his order and said that the Biryani was the best thing on the menu (noted for the next occasion, although I make a pretty good biryani of my own!).

So, all in all, an amazing experience and due to it's close proximity to my apartment, I will be coming back for take-out quite a bit!"}
{"text":"Son of a biz...freaking Yelp kept thinking backspace meant \"leave this page\"...it erased about five paragraphs...and they were witty too...hopefully I can come up with some new stuff.

Went here with the magnificent Magic, as she wanted to try it out. Indian food is quickly becoming my second favorite cuisine...so I was happy to accompany her. 

There's a nice big sign out front, so it's easy to spot...there's also parking in the back...off street...if you're daring enough to navigate the narrow alley to the back of the building in your car. If you have a Hummer, I wouldn't try it (I'd also suggest re-evaluating your life, if that's the case).

The inside is spacious and bright, but kind of strange...kind of sparse...and there's carpet, which attracts more bacteria and germs than a hobo's ass. But, I have faith that they'll keep it clean.

The server was pleasant, as was the owner, who came out a couple times to check on us. He seems like he really wants to make this place work! Which is good.

The food was a good start. I had one of my favorite dishes, Chicken Madras. It was missing the normal stewed tomatoes, but not missing any flavor. The chicken was perfect.

I think Magic had the Chicken Vindaloo...also awesome. The rice was good, the nan was great too.

Didn't check out the bathrooms, as I didn't have the need...which, in an Indian place is a good sign. 

It's a bit east of Gordon Square, about a block from the Happy Dog...so, after dark, it's not the best location (know a guy who was beat within an inch of his life about a month ago on that very block, around 10:30pm)...but perhaps if more places like this open, that will change. I keep wishing that Cleveland would start doing the right thing and build out from center, rather than these outposts of civilization, but...what can you do? 

Or at least, what can I do until I'm elected mayor in 2024?

That said, I'll ABSOLUTELY be back. The food was definitely enough to warrant a return visit, and the pleasantness of the owner added to it. Not a five star rating, not even close, but a solid place that fills a gigantic need on the Near West Side."}
{"text":"While the service was a bit strange, the food was fantastic.

I stopped in on my way home for take out; there was not a soul in sight as we walked in and that gave me time to glance around a bit. The sterile setting was fine but far from inviting. There were two wonderfully detailed pieces of Indian art on the walls gave it an air of authority, if you will. We waited for few moments and after some throat clearing our waitress came from the back to take our order.

While nice, she was not overtly helpful. We ordered meat and veggie samosas, naan, Aloo Gabi and Lamb Vindaloo. After going into the back to confirm they still had meat samosas (they were out yesterday), she confirmed it would take 20 mins. Being I live just blocks away, we decided to go to my house (which the waitress validated now a part of discussion) we confirmed the time, 20 minutes, and said we'd be back. 20 minutes later there was one table of three now present in the dining room. Another person approached us, we confirmed we had the takeout, the waitress told him she had put it in and he went to grab it. We waited, and waited, and waited. At one point she did apologize for the wait, stating they only had one cook - hardly seems like an issue when we were just 2 of 5 total customers. The wait was at least highlighted with the three strange dining partners; they appeared to be a family, a father and two sons. The overtly aggressive father would not let his sons order, chastised their decisions and then berated them as he talked about representing their 'group/band' as their agent. When our food finally did come out I was sad I could not see this saga further unfold. Cut scene.

We got the food home and it was fantastic. The samosas were delicious, the basmati rice spiced perfectly, with a hint of cinnamon perhaps. The Aloo was delicious but not quite spicy enough for my taste, so if you like it hot make sure you ask.

All in all, the actual experience while inside Indian Delight was very strange but worth it for some fantastic Indian food in Cleveland. I hear the lunch buffet is delicious and cheap ($7.95-$9.95), a far better deal than the dinner menu. I think I will risk the awkwardness of an in-house dining experience and try it out."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I will definitely be a regular. The staff was super nice, food was reasonably priced and the portions they gave were very generous. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Worst buffet I have ever eaten in my life. They were literally running out of food. I left the place still hungry."}
{"text":"I have been to Indian Delight several times and really enjoy the food.  The Chicken 65 here is definitely some of the best Chicken 65 I've had (and I've had it in several restaurants in several states).  I also have had their Madras Chicken, Chicken Tikka, Chicken Tikka Masala, Biryani and many other dishes which are all very good!  I'd say this place is definitely one of the top 5 Indian places in Cleveland.  The only downside to this restaurant is that that the service is a bit slow/lacking.  Most servers are very kind however sometimes things take a long time to get.  Other than that I would say definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"The food is exceptional, 5 star, Again, the food is 5 star.  The place is a 1 star. Clean , nice, new looking, but bare as , well anything. The service is a bunch of nice  clueless people. Who run around and do everything but what they are susposed to do. No dedicated table person. No dedicated anything I suspect.  I just think they don't know how to do anything  exceptional,like run a restaurant or understand manners and customs.  but they do everything  in typical third world.  The table person has numerous jobs and leaves, never asks if anythings ok, She said they could tone  down the spicy but they didnt. i suspect she forgot to tell them, or who she told switched jobs with who cooked.  and didnt tell the next guy . then she's busy so the kitchen help comes collect the money. No register, just leaves to the kitchen , don't come back with my change so I took a buck off the tip money. As other raters said, take it home. But again 5 star  food.  one star everything else until they figure it out. Oh they are closed 3:30 pm - 5:30 to get dinner ready. The price was $20  for a chicken rice meal, and an appetizer salad. It would of been super awesome if Benny Hill music was playing."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Authentic music and taste. Staff very friendly. Clean and affordable. The buffet at lunch is great with variety. Nan bread is soooo good too."}
{"text":"This is my absolute go-to Indian cuisine spot. They have an excellent selection of dishes for their lunch buffet, including vegetarian for all of $10. The naan is also a consistently healthy portion, which is a must. Their chicken tikka masala is to die for. They combine the delicious all white chicken with a thick tangy sauce, and large chunks of green pepper and red onion. Dishes are served in Indian metal tins, consistently keep the right temperature. The Indian hot should not be ordered without caution but do walk on the wild side with medium heat.

The service is friendly, I believe all are native to India by way of the U.K. Cheers, excellent spot."}
{"text":"Yummy Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani and lamb chops! Ambience can be better. Paneer tikka was a disappointment because it wasn't kiln fired Tikka. But Biryani makes up for everything."}
{"text":"I had the non-veg lunch special for 8 dollars.  It was definitely not worth it. You get tons of rice, 2 meat dishes, half naan, and dessert.  You get tons of rice, 1 gulab jaman, and the meat dishes are very small. I got only 2-3 pieces of chicken and the smallest pieces of tandoori chicken.  The food was cold and stale tasting.  Definitely would not go again or recommend to friend."}
{"text":"Great food !!! Probably the best Indian food in Cleveland and its way better than the much hyped \"Cafe Tandoor\" if you consider the cost of food. But they should improve on service and include some more variety in the starters section. Chicken biriyani was good and garlic naans were awesome. But I somehow didn't liked the Coolfi, they should improve the recipe. My overall rating will be 8.0/10. Shall I go back .. Oh yes but probably for lunch, as the neighborhood is a bit sketchy place and might not be safe in the night !!!"}
{"text":"I don't know a lot about Indian food, other than the little tastes of it and the flavor profiles, so I just ordered a bunch of random entrees, a lunch special, and a dessert. It was all delicious, piping hot, perfectly cooked and seasoned, and napkins and utensils. They were out of the ice-dream dessert and they called and gave me some fried balls in rose syrup, which was a little saddening but it was tasty-I'm not a huge fried foods fan but the flavor and execution was there. 
I was really impressed with the food, having somewhat low expectations due to other uber eats restaurants like Cleat's and Lucky's giving me half-assed food. Indian Delight is just that, a delight! 10/10 tell your mom, take her there for lunch you know she misses you!"}
{"text":"Had a chance to go for buffet while moving back from Niagara to Chicago, the taste of food is really really authentic to Indian taste and is also very good. Veg and Non-veg dishes had the smell and taste as it was cooked by person who is cooking for his family. Tandoori chicken if one of the best I have ever eaten in US. The good part of it was it was not colored but cooked to make it red. Even the Kheer was pretty good and as like cooked by Mom. Very Delightful

The price is also very genuine so you will definitely feel good after eating here.

One this which might depress you a little is the service is not so good, you might have to wait for plates or buffet stuffs to come.

I gave 4 as I declined all its sins after tasting the food. :) :) 
I even said to Owner while leaving .. \" Saat Khoon Maaf\" :P :P"}
{"text":"This would easily be a one star review if the manager or owner had not intervened. Came in close to closing time and asked if they were still serving, waitress said yes. Sat down, was not offered anything to drink besides water, waitress seemed smitten with a rowdy group of locals. No problem, was hoping for some chai but water it is. On to the buffet...there was no tandoori, a main staple of any buffet, no naan, no pakoras and most of the vegetables were gone or near the end and had seen better days. When I asked the waitress if she was able to refill some of these items, she seemed to have understood only naan, said yes then returned from the kitchen offering roti instead. At this point we had somewhat served ourselves rice and chicken masala but I had not touched it, told them I would rather not eat there in that case. Indian and no naan? Blasphemy. Dear gluten-free fans: Stay far away from that roti.

To be fair to them, and as the manager pointed out, it was close to closing time, however, don't seat people if you can't serve food. Another table had a giant pile of tandoori on a communal plate that they wasted, that probably didn't help matters. Manager had fresh naan, tandoori and pakoras brought to us, and they were delicious. Still not quite a buffet, no veggies. Also some Indian places make the food extra rich so people don't eat as much. I still feel weirdly stuffed, and I didn't even eat that much. I wish I could give it 3 stars and actually intended to, but as I started writing this just couldn't, it really was below average. I do appreciate it when managers at least attempt to rectify though."}
{"text":"If there is better Indian food in Cleveland I haven't found it.  The Veggie Mali Kofta is amazing.  Sunny (manager) is a great person and is always eager to please. 

Yes, maybe the decor is lacking but who cares...its all about the food.  Plus you can bring your own alcohol...bonus."}
{"text":"Indian Delight is probably the third best Indian food I've had in Cleveland. That's pretty good, because there is a lot of really mediocre Indian around here. 

There have been several complaints about the decor, but I've pretty much resigned myself to bad decor for Indian restaurants in Cleveland. And really? I didn't come here to eat the curtains. 

The garlic naan was the best naan I've had in the states, and the rogan josh was delicious. Josh is always a real test of quality, because goat can be tough and, uh, goaty. This was tender and flavorful without tasting overly gamey.

Overall, a good, solid dining experience, and I will be back."}
{"text":"Tandoori prawns were pathetic. Teeny tiny pre - cooked/frozen shrimp brushed with seasoning. 
And to top or off, they have the nerve to charge $15 for it. 

Come on, man!?"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant after a 3 year hiatus and found it to be under new owners.  The menu is the same but the food is so much better than before!!!!   The garlic naan is crispy, buttery and air light. I had the samosa chat which was very spicy and flavorful.  I ordered the chicken jalfrezi as my main course.  The dish was so flavorful with large chunks of tender chicken and vegetables.  The service was fast and friendly.  I am happily surprised by the change in quality of the food.  Prices are a little higher (by $2 a dish) compared to the old prices, but I think it is worth it in general.  I will be coming back for the lunch buffet-just not on a Tuesday when the lunch buffet is closed."}
{"text":"When Indian Delight first openned, it was a bit shaky on service and the decor seemed bland.  Luckily, a friend and I stepped inside the unassuming building to have dinner.  I'm glad that we did.

The food was great.  the rice, naan, and other dishes were delicious.  I would caution, however, that those who don't like too much heat or spice in their dishes to stay below a \"3\" on the hotness scale (1 to 10).  I dined on food that was a \"5\", to be safe, but it was still a little hot for my taste.

There were four servers/wait people who looked to our every need, so I didn't have any complaints and the interior decor was intimate and well done.  It was a bit quiet, however.  But, that enabled my guest and I to have a great conversation.

If I'm in North Olmsted, I would dine at Indian Delight.  I recommend highly.  It's food, atmosphere, and price are hard to beat."}
{"text":"When I think of Indian cuisine, I think of the grande tapestry of spices, herbs and blends used to create the dishes. It's a cuisine that is sophisticated in preparation yet subtle in flavor.  

The culinary tradition of Indian food seems to compliment their culture. Bright colors, an ambitious film industry, ornate art and age-old traditions all share similar traits to the uniquely flavored and aromatic cuisine. 

Woven into the dishes are chili pepper, black mustard seed, cumin, turmeric, ginger, coriander, garlic, garam masala, clove, cinnamon, mint leaf, curry leaves curry roots, cardamom, saffron, nutmeg, and rose petal essences. Despite the many flavorings, the dishes are all very well balanced. With that said, Indian is my favorite variety of all Asian cuisines and Indian Delight seems to be the best place to get it.

A recent take-out order consisted of Papri Chaat, Lamb Biryani, Chicken Madras, Naan, Kheer and a drink of Mango Lassi. The Papri Chaat was a cold chick pea and potato salad with seasoned yogurt, mint and sweet chutney. The Lamb Biryani consisted of lamb pieces cooked with basmati rice and spices. The Chicken Madras boasted chunks of chicken cooked with tomatoes, onion, coconut and smothered in a fiery hot sauce. Naan, a white bread cooked traditionally in a stone oven was used to soak up all the leftover sauce and rice left on the plate. Kheer, a sweet rice pudding with almonds was a refreshing dessert. The Mango Lassi was similar to an Orange Julius in consistency, only much better.

If you like food, if you are adventurous and if you haven't yet broadened your horizons to Indian food, I suggest you do so immediately. It's a cuisine unlike any other. Kudos to Indian Delight for being as good of an ambassador to this wonderful cuisine as any other in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Umm... I don't know what happened, but the food seems to be getting more and more bland each time I go.  Its been surpassed by a few places on my list, but its still nearby and convenient and really not bad, so I'll keep going, but I wish they didn't lose their luster.  Maybe its just the other restaurants I tried. 

Also, make sure you always get take out or the buffet. Service is very slow."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for years and finally made it! Indian Delight did not disappoint. The interior decor was surprisingly more sparse than I'd assumed it would be, but what they lack in presentation they make up for in flavor! 

The style of cuisine was different than other Indian food I've had but it was wonderful and different enough to be fresh and new. The sonic red chicken tikka masala was the standout hit, full of bright and complex soothing flavor, the sauce was one of the best I've tasted. The Vindaloo and Karihi(sp?) were also on point, with the later being a hearty, savory and zesty option that was perfect for fall. We went medium spicey all the way around and it was a perfect flavorful kick without burning too much. 

The mulligatawny soup was one of my favorites, a wild blend of curry and spices that was tasty and fun to eat! 

And the naan was about the most proper serving of naan I've had, big crispy, flakey, and perfectly soft and chewy halves that rounded out the meal perfectly. We also enjoyed the veggie samosas and chutneys as an appetizer. 

My lone complaint. I wasn't terribly impressed with the quality of the chicken, I couldn't tell if it was a bit overdone or just not a great grade. But I ate it and enjoyed it nonetheless. 

The service was warm, friendly and welcoming, and sauces were the standout hit. I'll definitely hit up Indian Delight again on my next trip to CLE."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the Indian Delight lunch buffet. I've had it many times before and it's always excellent. I would recommend it to anyone. It's a delicious restaurant."}
{"text":"I went today (on a Saturday) and the service was very slow. We ended up being there for two hours, and not because we wanted to be. Granted there was a huge rush in a very short amount of time but there were only two waitresses. I ended up waiting 10-15 mins to get my change back after paying the bill. I got the rogan josh and the lamb pieces were very small. The raita didn't have any tomatoes or onions in it. The food quality was good and everyone seemed to like their food a lot. I might visit again when I'm in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Great little new indian place blocks from downtown on the shoreway...  went tonight with my girl and her family who have never had indian food.  they loved it and we will all be bacdk.  very good service, clean, and wonderfull food.  some of the best naan i have ever had...  please go and support them"}
{"text":"We went for a late lunch after helping my brother move to his new apartment in Lakewood. I thought the buffet was just awesome. I agree that the place lacks ambiance, but it makes it up with a buffet that serves food with a hint of spice (most Indian buffets are so bland that it makes me want to cry). And I was very pleased with the prices. No, I wouldn't take anyone here to impress them, but for delicious, quick lunch I'm totally sold."}
{"text":"I've been to Café Tandoor out in Westlake a couple times so Indian Delight was a bit of a disappointment.  Tried their Chicken 65 which is one of my favorite dishes.  It was ok, but not quite crunchy enough.  Also the lamb vindaloo and chicken tikka masala agan were ok, but missing a bit of...something.  Not heat...they provided that plenty, just not the usual breadth and depth of flavor that I associate with Indian cuisine.  On top of that the server seemed a little unorganized...almost scared of us...2  1/2 star, but I'm going to give them three because even mediocre Indian Food is a good experience."}
{"text":"Very nice addition to the Gordon Square food lineup. We started with samosas, which were piping hot and flavorful. They came with two dipping sauces- a tamarind and a cilantro. I chose the paneer tikka masala for my entree, and my husband had the lamb Madras. My paneer was plentiful, the sauce was heavenly, and the veggies were perfectly cooked. The lamb was tasty and well-spiced per my husband's request. Of course we had to get the garlic naan, and were not sorry we did. 

No liquor license? No problem. Go right next door and fetch some beer. BYOB welcome.

The lone server on the evening we were there was running her tail off, and she did an admirable job.

The only reason I can't give 5 stars was the total lack of ambiance. It's just a little rough around the edges in there. That will, however, not stop me from coming back for more delicious food at great prices."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Cleveland. Go there again and again and it's always good! Hole in the wall place so don't expect much in terms of ambience or service. The food is outstanding, tastes authentic and made fresh. Not overgreasy or overspiced. Just right. And prices are affordable. I cook a lot at home and give cooking lessons in Indian food so have high standards."}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant in Cleveland. Me and my husband went here for dinner on Sunday night, we had the hyderabadi chicken biriyani, chicken tikka masala and goat Karahi, all tasted fresh and good! They make special biriyani on Fri-Sat. Since moving to Ohio, we're been searching for some good Indian/Pakistani restaurants like they have in Va and NY. This is our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"We ate here buffet style: once again, while the ambiance left something to be desired, the food was terrific.  It might have lacked the finesse of the plated entrees (probably due to the additional heat from the steam table), but the flavors from butter chicken to chickpeas were robust and the food was beautifully spiced.  The service was also polite and attentive, which we appreciated. Worth the trip - if I lived closer, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"I went here several months ago and forgot to review it. I distinctly remember 3 things:
1) The food was extremely dry and flavorless.
2) At the time, we were the only ones in the restaurant, and the waitress disappeared into the back for so long that eventually I had to go in the bathroom to fill up my water glass.
3) The bathrooms were disgusting, and the rest of the restaurant wasn't much more welcoming. 
I am on the hunt for a great Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with 2 friends today. We have been admirers of their chicken biryani for a long time but ... but the egg biryani disappointed me to the core. It still has the raw smell of turmeric and looks like some turmeric rice.."}
{"text":"Still love this place. I've been ordering takeout from here a lot because I've found the perfect dinner for my boyfriend and I to share for under $20: mild chicken korma (it's a little more medium, in my opinion, bear that in mind), samosas (spicy, delicious, some of the best I've had), naan, rice. I want them to start a bike delivery service in Ohio City/Detroit Shoreway!"}
{"text":"I don't often write reviews but tonight's takeaway dinner was the best Indian food I have ever eaten. My girlfriend ordered Paneer Tikka Masala and I had Rogan Josh. 

This is now going to be a regular thing for us. Do yourself a favor and try this place."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to Indian Delight for the lunch buffet.  While it is not a huge selection, it is very flavorful and affordable for lunch.  I love that I may try a variety of dishes, and then come back for a little more... it's very filling and delicious.  The service is top notch, and attentive.  I have brought friends here, and they too have enjoyed the experience.  Recently, my fiancee and I order samosas to go... and these were wonderful.  If you have not had Indian food before, I strongly recommend coming in and trying the buffet so as to sample some of the wonderful dishes.  However, if you are familiar with Indian food; this place will not disappoint and there is the option of ordering from a menu or the buffet for lunch.  I have now been to this establishment at least four or five times and I always have a pleasant experience, and enjoy tasting the variety of dishes offered on the lunch buffet.  :)"}
{"text":"Every time I have had food at Indian delight, it has been totally great. The Father and Son duo make you feel special and the food is hot and steaming. They willingly alter the spice levels. This will always be my top place to go in Cleveland for their authentic goat biriyani, kebabs and naan. I would recommend trying their Nihari and Halim.....mouth watering!!!"}
{"text":"I freaking love Indian food.  I dream of curry.

I'm usually more than satisfied and have only had one poor experience in my life.  Here, I had an average experience. 

After reading rave reviews, I had to see what all the delight was about.

Started out awkward when my friend suggested we parked in the rear after noticing a 'Parking in Rear' sign (see photo).  I'm always up for new things.  We drove through a very narrow alleyway to come to what I would not advertise as 'parking' as it was clearly where the two employee cars go and where they empty grease (see photo).  After noticing that, I chose to back up, but the young gentleman emptying a pickle bucket of grease insisted I park in the 'parking lot'.  Okay, that's fine.  

We walk in and it smells curry-licious.  We arrived around 2pm so I wasn't sure if the buffet was gonna be slim pickins. Took a look at it and decided to go with that and sample everything.  [I usually don't take the buffet route with any other food but Indian.]  There was plenty of all of the food which was a plus.  They made fresh naan and brought it out to us.  Plus plus.  But it was really buttery, almost soggy.  Minus.
The rice was more room temperature than fresh, but the rest of the food was decent.  The chicken in the tikka masala was actually very good.  Sometimes chicken can be shady but this was nice white tender grainy chicken.  I ate the rest of my samplings not complaining but not raving.  It was okay.  I didn't love anything.  Only one lamb dish (which I don't remember the name) was spicy; the rest was very mild.  

The ambiance is amusing.  Thank god I wasn't there on a first or second date.  There was absolutely no music and we were the only ones talking in the whole place.  The decor consists of a few traditional Indian textile pieces on the very bare walls.  I think my favorite aspect, though, were the table settings.  Now, I don't need linens and candles floral centerpieces, but our table was covering in something resembling seran wrap.  With a disposable paper placemat underneath.  and yellow rings on the seran wrap from a previous dish.  Now that I could have done without.  

I think I'll try around a few different places before returning, or else return to order off the menu and opt out of the buffet choice."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Friday at 9:30pm. We were told that we could not fine in as they close at 10pm and so we opted to do take out instead. The restaurant itself has a small facade on the outside and there is plentiful street parking.

We ordered 1x paneer tikka masala and 1x malai kofta. Both were requested to be spicy and the chef did not disappoint. It was s p i c y! The garlic naan and included rice was also very good. The hostess was very kind and helpful. She picked enough plastic cutlery, plates and such when we told her we were out of towners.

Overall it was a good experience and we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love this place. True, the interior is not fancy, but I like that humble look. Anything I have had here has been delicious. In fact, I may get takeout today...!"}
{"text":"We checked this place out for the lunch buffet last Friday, and I was impressed. Being no stranger to Indian lunch buffets, I would say that Indian Delight does it better than most others in the area. First of all, despite the fact that there were only about 3 customers, including us, and despite it being close to the end of the lunch (2 p.m.), they still replenished the food on the buffet, and everything was very fresh and delicious. There were three vegetarian curries and three chicken dishes, along with basmati rice and some kind of fried potato. The naan, which they served fresh and hot to our table, was delicious - super pillowy and buttery. It was delicious!

Also, the palak paneer had huge chunks of paneer in it (it's not my favorite, but I know a lot of people enjoy the cheese). I've been to many Indian buffets that had \"palak paneer\", but skimped on the paneer. Not this place!

My husband, who loves Indian food and prefers to take it in buffet form, wanted to check the place out for himself, so we ended up going back on Saturday for the lunch buffet. On Saturday's buffet, there are four vegetarian dishes and four chicken dishes, with two different kinds of rice. The naan, again, was delicious.

What stuck out most to me was the one man working both Friday and Saturday, who was absolutely wonderful. He was very friendly, asking whether everything was good, and shared some very interesting information about the dishes, and about the okra curry, which I especially enjoyed. It's always so great to find these small local places where the owner / employees are so engaging and friendly."}
{"text":"A cheap all you can eat buffet with decent tasting food. Too bad they didn't have biriyani as part of their buffet but whatever they did have was good enough."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times and have consistently been disappointed.  The service is slow and uncooperative with my requests, the food takes far longer than one would expect, and most especially the restaurant is filthy. I had to clean the light switch in the men's room before I could even feel comfortable turning it off. Even though the restaurant is still fairly new the carpet looks old and covered with food grime. We are desperate for a good Indian food restaurant in this neighborhood, but this isn't it. My partner and I have given it our last chance and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Been here twice and loved it both times . I am a vegetarian and had the buffet the first time . The food was super tasty and the gulab jamun tasted as if made of Khoa . The only drawback was that there were no paneer dishes in the buffet . 

I went there again today and ordered the paneer pakora , malai kofta , garlic naan and onion kulcha and everything was flavourful. I asked our server to make malai kofta spicy and it was on point . The naan and kulcha were crunchy as the same time so light , the best I have had in a while . Our server was very helpful and I ended up thanking the cook for the food .

This is by far one of the more authentic Indian restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Probably the best Indian food in the Cleveland area. The Biryani is on point. The naan is fresh and tastes amazing!!!"}
{"text":"It hasn't been terribly long since I first reviewed this place, but I have been back so much between now and then I just had to update my review. 

This place is my new favorite Indian restaurant in Cleveland. My old favorite Indian restaurant does have a much nicer interior as far as decor goes, but this place just puts out more flavorful food - not hotter necessarily, but just more well seasoned.  

I've eaten in and taken food to go more times than I can count; so much so that the couple of staff I typically run into recognize me. Eating in has its perks, especially depending what you order. I love the Samosa Chat, but it really is just better when served hot. To go though the regular Samosa appetizer is great. 

Whether eat in or take away you cannot go wrong with the Chicken Tikka Masalla. The rice portion to go is just enough to have some with each piece of meat. The sauce is very flavorful - I love it. Definitely get some garlic naan so you can mop up all the left over creamy tomato sauce. 

While the dining room is typically empty there is usually a 30+ minute wait for take away so call ahead accordingly."}
{"text":"I finally had the opportunity to check out Indian Delight.  Overall, it was delightful!  

I wasn't entirely overwhelmed by the decor, but the food was delicious!  I ordered the Tikka Masala and we also got a Butter Chicken which...um...I\"m pretty sure is exactly the same.  I'm trying to remember the appetizer or the green dish we ordered but I'll be honest that maybe my Hindi isn't as good as it can be, so I don't really remember.

Anyway, all the food was served with an equally flavorful rice pilaf and I absolutely recommend the naan.  We had enough to bring home the next day for leftovers and the prices weren't cheap, but not bank breaking.

Plus, they'll make it Indian super hot for you.  

So...ahem...overall it was a delight!  Glad there is some decent Indian food representation in the area..."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. We had tadka dal, palak paneer, malai kofta and naan and everything was excellent. 

I accidentally left my card and when I realized it ~18 hours later, I was able to call and get it back quickly. Will definitely visit again next time I am in Cleveland!"}
