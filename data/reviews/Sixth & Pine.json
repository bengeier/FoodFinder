{"text":"Great food selection, very nice atmosphere, kind and courteous staff. One of my favorite spots in Beachwood."}
{"text":"Had the salmon with risotto. It was wonderful! Started with matzo ball soup which was just ok, definitely not authentic like Nate and Al's in Beverly Hills. Rice pudding for dessert, also very good. This place was not busy at all, a few scattered tables, but the service was neither timely or efficient. Thankfully the soup came first and actually had a spoon. When I asked a random waiter to bring me napkins (Hello, I'm eating soup and need my place setting) said he would bring a couple of paper napkins?!  I thought, okay, so how could he not notice that I had no table setting at all and specify paper?? Apparently I needed to spell out the obvious.  If I were to return I would probably sit at the counter where it's much more difficult to ignore the customers"}
{"text":"Casual restaurant inside of Nordstrom. I had the warm Salmon salad and it was perfectly prepared.  Paired my salmon with a ricotta and tomato jam jar that did not disappoint.  The server did recommend a great Italian white wine that was also good. Great service and good casual food that beats out all other mall options."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for some time, and finally made time to go on an early Saturday morning with my 2 daughters.   The manager was very personable and we were seated right away.   Our drink orders were taken and we were left with a dish of freshly pickled vegetables to snack on while we perused the menu.  One daughter ordered the breakfast combo, eggs, bacon, toast, laltkes and fresh fruit.  Her entree arrived hot and fresh, eggs scrambled just right, thick sliced bacon and sour cream to accompany the latke. The other ordered the roasted turkey and avocado sandwich with a side of shoestring fries.   The turkey was truly roasted and then hand carved, not packaged deli slices, served on fresh thickly sliced bread with perfectly ripe avocado slices.  The fries were served hot, fresh and lightly seasoned (yum).  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and fries.   The sandwich was spot on, large chunks of roasted chicken and veggies, tossed in a light mayo served on fresh bread with lettuce and tomato.  Our server, who was also the manager informed us that the turkey was roasted and carved to order, also the chicken salad is mixed to order.   All-in-all, this was a very good meal, I thought it was a little bit pricey.   The sandwiches were in the $10-11 range, sides were and extra $1.50.   I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great selection. Great service. Casual. Definitely comfortable for the whole family. The quality IS high -just not as high as the blurb in the menu about \"highest quality organic, local ingredients.\" I have been here several times for lunch and the quality doesn't ever really change. I will return for lunch. I wish they served breakfast items."}
{"text":"So glad I noticed this place conveniently nestled in Nordstrom. Forget the food court/ Maggiano's. This is now my place to go after getting my cardio (shopping) in. They have great salads/ sandwiches. It's nice and quiet, unlikel the other noisy and overcrowded options. Plus, I'm afraid of getting jumped in the food court if I accidentally step on someone's Jordan's :p"}
{"text":"We had to wait 20 minutes for a late lunch but wow was it worth it! I had low expectations for a restaurant located inside Nordstrom's. The service was excellent Shawn was very attentive! Reuben, French dip, fries and coleslaw all excellent a must visit restaurant during a long day of shopping at Beachwood Place!"}
{"text":"I ate the best French Dip Sandwich of my life at Sixth & Pine. I was blown away by it. Good salad too! Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Sure--this cafe is located in a department store. Yes, you're probably not expecting much. But maybe that's why it just smacks you in the face with awesome.   This is my favorite lunch spot when I'm in the Beachwood area. They've got healthy options and cheat options--but it's all comfort, diner-style fare. I almost always get a bowl of their scratch-made matzo ball soup, which comes with huge hunks of pulled chicken, tender veggies and noodles, too!   Last time around I indulged in a BLTA, sans maybe and swapped in sourdough. Ermahgerd. How can something so simple be so delicious? I never finish sandwiches, but this one disappeared quickly. It was also served with these shoestring-style fries that made.my.life.   Service is not what you'd expect in a restaurant inside Nordstom. You'll feel like you're dining at a 5-start restaurant downtown. Craziness.   I love this place."}
{"text":"6th & Pine is part of the Nordstrom experience aims to pamper its customers. The overall customer experience is very well designed. It has always successfully put me in a great mood.  Take this time for example. On my way driving to the restaurant, I was having an argument with my mom in the car. However, as we walked through the store, and sat down in the restaurant, we were both smiling and joking around. The temperature is cool and dry, even though it was raining outside. The lighting is like that in an art gallery, even though we didn't sit anywhere close to a window. I felt the service was \"tender and caring\", even though our server was a 6 feet tall muscular guy. ---- This time around we ordered:  - BLTA Sandwich. I upgrade the default french fries to sweet potato fries with cilantro lime dipping sauce for $1. Crisp bacon, iceberg lettuce, tomato, avocado, mayonnaise, toasted whole wheat bread  - Sweet potato fries, salty and sweet to balance with the zesty, sour, garlicky sauce. Work well together.  I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor and texture of the whole ensemble, down to the very last fry. The lettuce and tomato tasted totally fresh and crispy, plus crunchy bread and bacon, contrasting with the creamy and warm texture of avocado (texture-wise, not temperature). Traditionally this is achieved by using a lot of mayo, which to me is complete junk. Avocado however, is loaded with healthy good fat.  The only surprise is that when my plate came, both the fries and the bacon were cold. Granted, it was 1pm on Saturday lunch rush, the tables was 90% full. But I expected the fries and bacon to be made to order. If it were, they would be at least lukewarm, instead of completely cold.  - Marinated Chicken Breast Sandwich, pick a side between soup or salad A thick, huge, juicy chunk of seared chicken breast, well marinated so that it's not dry at all, iceberg lettuce, tomato, red onion, caramelized shallot a√Øoli, toasted onion roll. The portion is very big. Mom could only finish half, ending up eating the other half as dinner. $11.75 for two meals, not bad at all. ---- Worth mentioning:  - You won't see \"chicken matzo ball soup\" on the menu, but it's served everyday, as a \"soup du jour\".  - The restroom is right outside the restaurant, as part of the store. I can only describe it as luxurious. There is a sitting area between the nursing room and the actual restroom. The leather sofa and chairs are cushier than my own living room furniture. (See my photo under Nordstrom.)"}
{"text":"This diner-type restaurant seemed quite empty when I was in (despite being there during prime-time. The service was great for the most part (the hostess could have been much friendlier, but otherwise the server was great from the get-go!). The menu is extensive and the food was terrific for what it is. This place really deserves to be fuller. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Sixth & Pine  aka Nordstrom   Yep, Nordstrom in beechwood  has a restaurant , well more like a cool place (photos from the jazz age hang on the wall) for a simple breakfast or to grab a bite to eat. Its clean, well lit , simple two page menu with soups, sandwiches, salads and prime plates. My favorites are the crusted salmon and fish n chips.   They have  a surprisingly good selection of wine and beer. The pricing is lower than you'd expect given the location and quality of food and service.   It's a perfect affordable place to take a coworker or business contact for lunch.    I love having breakfast alone there, easy to get lost in the classic jazz songs they play and the good coffee."}
{"text":"This place is located on the 3rd floor of the Nordstrom department store.   I went on a Saturday morning. There was only one other table occupied, but the waiter said that last night the entire place (a mix of about 25 booths and tables) was full by 17.30. There is also a diner style bar with 6 stools as well as a lower bar space for persons in wheelchairs, which I've never seen before so found a really cool feature.   The service was attentive. When first seated we were presented with a plate of pickles....a take on amuse bouche of sorts? Whatever, much better than a bread basket - sodium aside. The kitchen cooked our lunch in about 20 minutes. I had the turkey avocado club with sweet potato fries and the other entree ordered was a well done burger. I also ordered a cup of the soup of the day which was vegetarian chili. The soup was delivered instantly. It was really good and served with the typical Sysco cracker packet - this one however was a whole wheat one!   The only problem I can find with the place is that they really have no breakfast items on the menu. Since they open at 10.00 I would think there should be something egg related on the menu, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Used to be our go-to place for a quick bite to eat. Lately, the service and quality has deteriorated. Not sure if there has been a management or staff change or a change with the chef. Hope things turn around. It is very convenient."}
