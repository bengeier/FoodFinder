{"text":"Been coming here for years... since Jessica still own the place. Cant get enuff of the chicken fried rice... its always on our order. Decent amount of food and cheap price...

But lately... especially today. I tried the sweet and sour chicken. Very disappointed... not only they gave me so little they also cheated on the chicken... they should call it \"Sweet and sour batter\" coz theres hardly chicken in it. I saw a chunk, thinking its all chicken. Then i bit it in half... all i get is the batter n i still dont see the chicken. Then i bit the other half... finally the little piece of chicken showed up.

We made 3 orders and all of them wasnt the same as before. You can pretty much count how many chicken and beef was in our order. they used to fill up the container or maybe its just today?... will still come back for sure. But they should fix that \"sweet and sour batter\"."}
{"text":"Great food and great value!

I think the fried chicken on rice (#44) appears to be quite popular. 
If you like spicy I recommend the spicy chicken on fried rice."}
{"text":"used to get the chicken on fried rice back in the dragon centre days
tried it again and its still taste good, the restaurant is dingy however too bad as it could have been better had they kept things cleaner etc"}
{"text":"Bang for your buck! If you're on a budget or are looking for some good eats, or both, this place is a must go-to.  This is a Scarborough staple so be sure you know what \"#44\" is or you may get a look.  You may even lose some brownie points with some foodie friends. To those who are unfamiliar, #44 is their Crispy Chicken Fried Rice - and if yuh don't know, now yuh know *said in Biggie's voice*  5/5."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place. By the decor of the place you might think its another one of those Chinese restaurants but you are so mistaken. They have an extensive menu with almost all the items below 6 bucks( or around that). 

The Portions are huge. Usually me and my girlfriend can eat 1 box and we are full. The food is flavorful and filling. My personal favourite is the shanghai noodles with crispy chicken. Its freaking amazing. 

If you are in the area definately try this place , it will satisfy you for sure."}
{"text":"This place is an affordable spot for those who are hungry.  For a long time(since they opened) they did not accept Debit/Interac as a method of payment.  The only reason I started coming back is due to the acceptance of Debit/Interac.  

Their ambiance isn't that great to speak of, better to take out.  Their portioning is fair for the price you pay.  Depending on the time of day you visit, service could be speedy or on the slow side.  If you don't like plastic utensils..invest in utensils of your own and bring them with you..I recently received a compact utensil kit containing spoon and chopsticks..that's what I use at eating spots that don't have metal utensils.

I like Mapo Tofu however, their version of Mapo Tofu falls short.  They have no ground pork or meat in the dish..purely a vegetarian dish with frozen mixed vegetables.  When I experienced mapo tofu the very first time..it was mainly ground pork with tofu with a spicy-ish gravy not overly spicy (don't need to run for a glass of milk).  I don't mind variations on the dish..but make sure the meat is there in my opinion.

Most dishes you can't go wrong with.  I've tried their fried chicken fried rice (good portion of boneless fried chicken & rice), shrimp in lobster sauce, yeung chow fried rice (with and without the mixed veggies). My only gripe I suppose is with their fried rice..tho can't complain on the taste..too much soy sauce and they use dark soy sauce not light.  I tried asking for less salt..but didn't help.

This place is only good for small groups only, I'd say about 4-6 tops in 1 group.  No WiFi, tv is available but kinda small.

If you're on a budget and looking for affordable chow, this is a place to hit up along with Chinese Feast.  I usually alternate between the 2.  Since Chinese Feast is closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Really cheap and tastes amazing!  Got Crispy Chicken Fried rice and the portion is massive for only $5.  Can't complain about anything here.  I only got Take out but the place itself is not the best looking place in town."}
{"text":"best bang for your buck. 5-7$ is enough for two people. My Chinese go-to spot. I love their shanghai noodles"}
{"text":"FYI they charge $1 fee for credit card (not sure about debit). My total was over $15 so I'm not sure if there is a minimum or not, there were no signs indicating. 

Secondly every time we go here, the food is adequate but never great. That being said, the prices are pretty good."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food, cooked fresh and quickly. They are  always friendly and provide good customer service. I've been coming here for years and have never had an issue, the food just tastes better almost everytime. I highly recommend 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Great price and huge quantities! For the price, the food is great, but it's not the best tasting chinese food.  My go to is the calamari and cantonese chow mien.  I've gotten used to the none crispy noodles of the chow mien and the sauce on it is very tasty."}
{"text":"For a food place around the area where I temporarily work, Sinopino Chinese Restaurant is really quick at making their dishes in large portions and at decent prices. Of course, it's not going to be as cheap as some of the Food Court Places, but the quality (the amount of meat in the sweet and sour pork) of Food Court places aren't going to be as good as Sinopino. 

Walking into this plaza (Tenichi plaza), the store is not glamorous at all, it has a few diner chairs and utensils on the side. I tried two of their rice dishes here - the Yeung Chow Fried Rice ($5.50) and the Sweet and Sour Pork on Rice ($5). Including tax, this was a pretty cheap and large meal. The chefs were able to cook my meals to go in five minutes - it was super efficient, especially when I had to rush back to the office to finish working. 

The sweet and sour pork had quite a few pieces in it, and it wasn't filled with flour, but there was actual meat in here! Also, if you pay cash and you show a student card, you are eligible for 10% off your meal!!"}
{"text":"I have only gotten take out food from here, so I can only comment on the food. All Chinese places to are the same, they all sell roughly the same items which are made in the same way with the spices varying a little bit. 

This place is really not different than any of the other many Asian take out places on this same street! But what I like is that they make the food fast and that it is at a good price. Sometimes I don't want fast food, so Chinese take out is a nice alternative. It really is not healthier for you as it is cooked with fatty oils, deep fried, and heavily salted! But as I said its an alternative."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great, cheap meal, Sinopino is the place to be.  Order your meal, wait 10 minutes, and walk out with a filled container of food.  This place certainly doesn't look like much; it's really more for take-out than for eating in.  If you have $5 and you're hungry, skip McDs and come here."}
{"text":"Honesty one of the best restaurants I will ever go to. The quality matches the memories easily made within!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Cheap. And they give you loads of food. My favourite has to be the spicy pork chop with fried rice. They also have a selection of Filipino food which is great too. The lady there is so nice and very genuine. :)"}
{"text":"Visited based on the reviews, not that great in my opinion. Got the spicy chicken with fried rice.  The fried rice was cold not fresh or even warmed up.  The chicken was fresh; however, not much meat and was not even mild or spicy.  Would not recommend; however price is cheap."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast and very decent Chinese food. This is gonna be my new go to place  for fast Chinese food. Tried the beef brisket on rice for $5. Huge portions. Could have used a bit more beef but for $5 it is still a bargain."}
{"text":"Kennedy location is quiet, lots of take out. Great value for money."}
{"text":"Ive been going to this place for years, it is my go to place when we are too lazy to cook or have unexpected guest. It was owned by a great lady named jessica.  Seems like everybody knew her.  The actual place is nothing to get excited about. Its the cheap food that everybody keeps coming for.  The serving size is pretty good, and will fill you up.  Most people just come in and order take out, because again the ambience isnt really there.  You cant go there without ordering the staples, chicken fried rice, spicy chicken and deep fried octopus tenticles."}
{"text":"This place has really good prices and large portions. The fried rice is good, and the other dishes I have tried are hit and miss. The Shanghai noodles with crispy chicken was soggy when I ordered them which was very disappointing. 

Although this is a budget friendly place to eat, the location is quite battered. I would recommend getting take out."}
{"text":"The place is cheap and get what you pay for. I ordered the shrimp with lobsters sauce, only $5.00 but only got five small shrimp and a lot of green peas. I hate green peas!  Took all the peas out half the sauce!  Should have ordered the Chili Chicken, it seems to be popular here. Maybe next time if I come back."}
