{"text":"Went in at 10pm tonight (Sunday) for wings. Wasn't busy at all. Got sat, drinks then waited 15 mins or longer for someone to take our fucking order just to be told THERE'S NO WINGS. I get not everyone will have the thing you happen to be out of. But the manager sat us down, at least let me fucking know? Most people would have said don't worry about the drink. But kinda pissed that I had to  pay for a fucking $3 drink after waiting for fucking ever. I've served before so I understand but UNACCEPTABLE. Also been told by servers themselves that food goes back often for being undercooked."}
{"text":"Had a small party for 10 at the Salem and Kingston SLJ.  Food was dry, over cooked and took a long time for the food to come out. A bit pricey, Was not impress with overall meal and  atmosphere. Second time there and never again will we go back."}
{"text":"Food was horrible.  Chicken wings were bone dry.  Portions are small and way way wayyy to expensive.  Don't go!"}
{"text":"Loved my first trip to shoeless joes! Waitress was kind and hubby thought so too! ;) bruschetta brad was the best I've ever had. Not a long wait for food on a saturday night, I was shocked"}
{"text":"Even though this location seems to be very dead most of the time I enjoy going and have a nice quiet lunch. The waitresses are very friendly. Their butter buffalo sauce on their wings are always amazing !! I do miss the old menu however I find that they have gone from sports bra food to more hipster/health conscious while most entree involves protein or avocado. I have to switch up my choice as they took off my favourite Greek wrap from the menu."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight with my family (4 people) and we just wanted to do apps to share between all of us so we ended up ordering the platter which included: deep fried pickles, calamari, thai bites, spinach and artichoke dip. The platter was $26.99 and let me tell you, it was defiantly not worth $26.00 bucks. The portions were so small. We barely got any spinach dip, and we basically had to scrape the bowl in order to get enough dip on our chip. I personally didn't think that the calamari was cooked enough, pickles were very salty.. however, The thai bites were awesome. We also ordered a buffalo chicken flatbread and that was pretty good. All in all, the platter was a rip off for the price."}
{"text":"Their menu has really improved since the last time I was here! Everything sounds fancy and complicated. They've added a gourmet twist to sports bar food, everything, nothing is as it seems. The words aioli, quinoa and curry are all over this menu. There seems to be bacon jam, some sort of cheese and Rickard's White in everything. Definitely and upgrade from the old menu! A lot more choice and it was pretty dang good.

We had some caesar salad, chicken fingers(smothered in your wing sauce of choice) and the 5 cheese dip with all pita, all the time. Finally a place that gives you enough pita to finish the dip and not have to ask for more. Yay!

They had a different sport on every TV and there were a lot of them. Not a bad seat in the house really. Service was good, prices are decent. A nice casual evening."}
{"text":"This is an average sports bar with a very nice and cozy atmosphere. The wait for food after you order is quite long and it doesn't seem to matter how many people are dining in. The waitresses are prompt and friendly. The food is pretty good and the desserts are delicious. A little bit on the expensive side but a nice place to go before the movies or a date (just make sure you have lots of time because you'll be there a while)."}
{"text":"Very disappointed  it wasn't that busy but waited forever for service. Then told they ran out of burger and chicken sandwiches. Finally get our orders and honestly it was like a meal off the kids menu. Very disappointed in deed."}
{"text":"I believe our waitress was new or had just started but service was super slow and we didn't get checked in on once."}
{"text":"Shoeless Joe's offers bison burger on their menu, had one and was alright, but would have preferred it rare as this meat has alot less fat and does dry out easily.  Has outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times. The menu is quite expansive and the food has always been good. When tasked with finding a location for a large family get together, I ended up picking this place as they could handle the 30+ party and the menu would work for everyone. 

Food is great here - I really like the selection, I had a wrap and it was perfect. Just the right size, great flavor, fresh ingredients and not too many fries on the side. Most people who we were with enjoyed their meals.

When they got them.

It took probably 45 minutes for them to get all of the food out, which I cannot FATHOM why. I was sitting at one end with my folks and they got their food a solid half hour before I did. They were done by the time I got my food, and quite irked. 

I get it. It's a lot of people in one restaurant. But don't take a 30-person party if your kitchen and servers can't handle it. There was no excuse for the last few dishes to come out being wraps - most of the components are already cooked, all you have to do is put it in the wrap, wrap it, and onto the plate.

Service was crappy - the management person who was on duty studiously ignored most of our party when delivering things and didn't think to check in with us to make sure things were going okay (which they were not). The server we had assigned to us wasn't on point - the concept of working on refills took FOREVER and the restaurant wasnt even that busy. 

Unimpressed. Not only am I unimpressed, but this made me look bad in front of my extended family as I was the one who picked the place and organized it. I think that some of the drinks were comped, but the management really should have done more for those of us who were served last. I doubt I'll be back again. Really really disappointed."}
{"text":"Shoeless Joe's has been around for as long as I can remember. With that said this franchise has had opportunities to improve itself over the years as competition in this particular industry is fierce with many restaurants offering a bar like atmosphere with pub type of food.

My friend chose this place as I personally would not go to a Shoeless Joe's given the fact that this brand did not really appeal to me, I was hoping to be surprised that possibly things had changed..NOT.

Decor (4/5)

The look of Shoeless Joe's has vastly improved from I can remember. Very modern, open concept, it works!

Service (1/5)

The servers at this place are like amateurs trying to make the big leagues. We felt rushed in ordering our food, and the impatience shown on their faces was obvious. When we did order, 3 out of 4 orders were completely wrong!! Asked for no cheese on the burgers, got cheese! Asked for chicken quesadillas got vegetarian. One of the burger buns was burnt! It's no wonder that Shoeless Joe's is actively marketing coupons, since business is down I can see why. Speaking of those coupons, when we tried to use the ones we had, we were told that we can't use two coupons at the same table!?!?We told our waitress that it was two bills ( 2 Couples) she refused to adjust it, even though we had horrible service. We asked her to ask her manager, and the coupons usage and granted...sheesh

Food (3/5)

The food was good. We ordered the fish tacos, I had the steak and frites and wifey got the chicken quesadilla. Like I said it was good not great and the steak was chewy.

All in all, Shoeless Joe's is a place to go if you wanna have a few beers and watch sports. That is it! If you wanna eat go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Love shoeless in Oshawa and love shoeless in Ajax. Have now tried this location in Whitby 3 times and all 3 times it was awful. We live in Whitby but will either go to Oshawa or Ajax then go here.
Not once have they got our order right and the none of the waitresses ever came around to ask us how our food was or even to take refills. We had to flag the manager for our bill on one occasion. I'm not sure if it's a training issue because we don't think we have had the same waitress all 3 times. Avoid and just go to Oshawa or Ajax."}
{"text":"Great food and services, nice atmosphere. 
Eating a healthy salad for a change and Carmen loves her pasta. 
Good friends make it even better experience."}
{"text":"Well unfortunately this will be my first less then perfect rating on Yelp. 

I went out for their Tuesday half price wing night with a friend. The service was great, very happy cheerful server, no complaints there at all. 

I am not sure if they brine their wings and I was just unlucky enough to get the bottom of the bucket, they had an over powering taste of salt with every bite, hot sauce was weak, horrible taste experience. The portion size was big, the wings meaty and was plated Nicely but that's about all I can say positive other then the service. 

So if your out for salty big wings and lots of beer just leave your taste buds at home bring your stretchy pants.  

I know with many other awesome wing spots in Whitby, I won't make the trek for another disappointment, sadly because it's so conveniently located in such nice area for a fun night out."}
