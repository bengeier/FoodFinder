{"text":"OK, so the neighbourhood isn't the greatest and this little hole in the wall greasy spoon may not look that appetizing but they have some pretty decent fare.

The burger is my favorite in the area. simple, not frozen patty on a simple white bun. perfect.

The prices are great. I think the hamburger combo with fries and drink is less than $7.

Their omelettes are also a great option.They have your standard toppings and the price is determined by how many items you get mixed in with your eggs. The most expensive is 5 items and runs about $9 with home fries and toast.

I do lunch runs for work all of the time and this place is one that i frequent about once a week.

Cheap, good food."}
{"text":"Dang, guys, I'm in love. This joint is two or three doors down from my office, and it is so, so satisfying. Quick service, rock bottom prices, and everything I've had is just absolutely perfect comfort diner food. Egg sandwiches in the morning are delicious. Tuna salad for lunch is delicious. Grilled cheese sandwiches with peameal bacon and fries are delicious. Onion rings are shockingly delicious.

Seriously, not a thing I have had from here isn't awesome and that's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall restaurant. I walked in from the street for the breakfast special. Really cheap greasy spoon breakfast. I'm surrounded by a bunch of guys speaking...italian(?)...and watching CP24 on an old timey tv mounted in the corner of the ceiling. Great little spot."}
{"text":"Regardless of food quality.
Cook was smoking and cooking Saturday morning?!
2014 and cooking and smoking; disgusting."}
