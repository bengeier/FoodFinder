{"text":"Actually probably 2 1/2 stars. Pretty standard shawarma place. Lines never too long and lunch under $8. Staff efficient and food seems somewhat fresh. The daily special is often a good deal...see my pic of their \"small\" shawarma plate, priced at $6.49+tax. It comes with salad, choice of protein and rice and potatoes (although I skipped potatoes as they looked dry and got double rice). Nothing to get excited about but a decent, filling meal at a reasonable price"}
{"text":"Falafel here is not the best I tried but is more than ok to eat. When your really hungry they taste delicious. But in all actuality they re not amazing. The owners are nice but at lunch time it gets too busy as sometimes line up extends outside the store."}
{"text":"This mom and pop falafel joint is tucked away on Simcoe St, right off of Dundas.   Had the falafel pita sandwich which was fresh and garlicky. The sandwich was heated in a grill and came out warm and crisp. They have a special on Fridays, so it was great value at $4.99 (regular $5.99).  Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"I ordered the lamb with salad and potatoes . The lamb was stone cold . Brought it back and they heated it on grill for one minute . Was still cold but not only that . It is not really fresh lamb . It is some type of ground lamb (I think) made into a sausage roll . I could feel the ground bones left in the meat when I chewed it . Terrible . It is full of some God awful seasoning and MSG . I was sick the whole day and night after eating this stuff . The salad was old . You could see the wilted and brown edges of the lettuce . Don't eat here . Not good and not safe ."}
{"text":"Just your average shawarma spot,  nothing special,  food is Fast and cheap and does the trick if you're in a hurry with only a few bucks.  The seating area is what you would expect to be for a restaurant geared toward this niche. Servers are friendly and on Saturdays there's a special on gyros for 3.99 before tax."}
{"text":"The location is a bit tucked away but if you are in the area and are looking for some cheap eats, this is a really great place to go. Would definitely recommend if you are on the go, as there isn't much seating space.   You can get any two large wraps (beef or chicken shawarma, falafel, kofta)  for $10, which is a pretty good deal (another reason why it's a good place to grab some food on the go). They load up the wrap with lots of toppings so you are very full in the end. I found the pita to a be a bit dry in the beginning, but since I asked for extra tahini and hot sauce, it got really loaded and full of flavor the more I dug in.   A little note is they do charge a fee for using credit (at least when I asked wanted to pay with Visa), but they accept Debit and do not charge for it!   Really nice spot; would definitely come again for some cheap and quick food! :)"}
{"text":"I was dragged out here for lunch with some people for work. It's a nice convenient location for U of T students. I had a falafel pita, which wasn't anything spectacular, but good enough to curb my lunchtime appetite.  I haven't tried the shawarma, but I will say that it smelled pretty good. Worth a shot if you're looking for something different and a reasonably cheap lunch in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing Shwarma and authentic food. Definitely will go back! Wish they had more locations closer to me. If you are reading this open a location at Yonge and eglinton!"}
{"text":"Becomes PACKED during lunch time, this is a common eatery for UofT students for their daily dose of Schwarma and Falafels.  They are fast and efficient with good service but the schwarma's aren't anything special. They do the job for the reason of why you'd go there: to put something in your stomach. I don't recommend taking these to class either, I always end up with a pool of sauce all over me/my clothes and/or my notes - the latter gives me a good reason to grab a nice nap as my notes are rendered useless :)"}
{"text":"I don't even feel like writing an in-depth review of this place because of how mediocre it is.  The food is cold and flavorless, the prices are higher than they should be, the selection is poor and the employees seem like they're depressed.  Do I even need to say anything else?   Maybe if there was something good to say then I would, but I'm at a loss for words right now."}
{"text":"Don't get this Anoush fooled with the other Yelp reviews online! This location has new ownership/management is different in every aspect. This is my go to place whenever I am downtown! Food is as authentic as it gets and the service is as amazing as the family that owns the place! Being middle eastern myself, trust me when I tell you that this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Pretty bad even by the low Toronto's standards.  The food is cheap, but you get low quality tasteless stuff."}
{"text":"Located in the MaRS food court, Anoush is a pretty standard shawarma place. They offer chicken and beef shawarma, chicken kebab, and falafel, and you can have your protein wrapped in a pita, or as part of a larger plate with rice, potatoes and salad.  While the portions are large (the pita satisfies me for lunch, whereas the plate is too much), this Anoush falls short in flavour (potentially relevant, this place is run by Koreans). I ask for everything in my pita, and something is just...off. I think I've isolated the culprit to the pickles, which just taste a bit strange. It's hard to describe, but others notice that this isn't the ideal flavour profile for a shawarma; certainly nothing close to my favourite, Pita Land.  Nevertheless, Anoush is on my lunch rotation; its proximity to my workplace overriding my preference for other shawarma joints. I usually opt for the kebab in a pita (which strikes me as a healthier chicken option than the spit), or the Vegetarian plate, which has a great variety of filling veggie options. Mind the beans within, though - they reliably give me gas. Sometimes, however, it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make."}
{"text":"Portions are small. They gave me only half box filled for salad i ordered. And tabouleh salad was extremely salty!! Wouldnt recommend."}
{"text":"Great little shawarma shop.  I usually get chicken shawarma on a salad.  Service is fast and friendly.  Only wish their salad dressing had more flavor.  Adding tahini helps!"}
{"text":"Shawarma spot located a falafel's throw from the U of T gates. Usually infested with snot-nosed undergrads trying to sponge up last night's hangover with the therapy only rotisserie meat can provide. I've had the falafel here and it's well-priced, quickly-made, and filling -- but nothing special compared to the other options in this city (of which there are a megatonne). On the menu are shawarma plates, veggie plates, falafel and shawarma on a pita, and salads. You can also get roast potatoes, tabouleh and hummus. Good morning after medicine if you spent the evening getting Jager-bombed with the waterpolo team.  Obligatory Title Pun: Nothing NOUSH-worthy.  Menu Readability: Actually their obligatory bad photos of shawarma aren't that bad.  Need to mention: They take credit, but not debit. Did you get that?  What this place teaches me about myself: Is it just me or are university kids getting younger every year? Lousy punks."}
{"text":"This Anoush is located in the base of an office tower on the north side of the street at Dundas and Simcoe. It's a wee spot with room for no more than a dozen seated. Decor is un-charming crimson walls and lawn furniture. What Anoush lacks in xenodochy, it makes up for in decent shawarma.  I opted for a falafel on a pita which runs $4.50 and is a large portion. The falafel balls were pre-made which puts it at a disadvantage to nearby Pita Village who fry up fresh falafel balls with each order, but they still tasted fine. A big plus is their SUPER hot grill which got me munching a hot and perfectly crunchy pita. This I like.   They also have shawarma plates in chicken and beef and a vegetarian plate that looked hefty. Not the best falafel I've tried in the city but it's a solid price and pretty tasty.  Obligatory Title Pun: To every meat (TURN, TURN, TURN) / It should be seasoned (TURN, TURN, TURN)  Menu Readability: Plump letters on orange astride pictures of Middle Eastern food, i.e., the way it should be.  Need to mention: They take debit and DON'T charge extra for the privilege!  What this place teaches me about myself: Now that I think about it, The Byrds kind of sucked."}
{"text":"This is not a standard shawarma place, because you can do so much better almost anywhere else. They're very stingy with portion sizes, and fill platters up with rice. The meat is tough and too thickly sliced, the hummus is oddly grainy (not in a good way) and flavourless and the person making my plate tried to pass tabbouleh off as a mere garnish. Take a 5 minute walk in any direction of this place and you'll find much better shawarma."}
