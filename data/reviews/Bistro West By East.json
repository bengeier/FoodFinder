{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch & breakfast and it is a decent hotel restaurant. The location is convenient to the airport & it is nice that parking is free. The food is basic - a bit bland, but a good variety of choices.  Service can be a bit slow - be careful if you have a flight to catch!"}
{"text":"This was a decent restaurant in the area if you don't want to venture out while staying at the Marriott.

I couldn't bear to get back into the car after driving all day, so I stopped into the restaurant.  The service was excellent - very friendly and helpful.  The food was pretty good as well - it came out quickly and seemed to be made of fresh ingredients. I tried the burger with maple pepper bacon - very maple-y bacon, but quite good - I recommend it as an add-on.

The atmosphere isn't wonderful - more of a hotel restaurant - but it's ok if you're not looking for a hip restaurant.  

I wouldn't make this a stop if I wasn't staying at the Marriott, but if you are staying there, definitely a good dinner location which is reasonably priced and convenient."}
{"text":"This is a keg priced restaurant that reminds me of the old Kmart cafeteria. Powdered gravy, frozen burgers and cheap plates and silver wear. Wish I would have walked to the keg... :("}
{"text":"Yes I agree with previous reviewer, food is bit bland but nothing little salt and pepper can fix.
But I have to give it these ladies, the service is excellent. I was suffering from bit cold, the bartender made me a hot toddy and she requested the chef to make me a chicken noodle soup which was not on the menu.
It was nice especially when you away from your house."}
{"text":"I am sorry people but I have eaten at this establishment three times consecutively and three times consecutively I have been disappointed with my meal that's over $300 worth of food between my colleague and I which cannot be explained in this review.
This last episode involved the overdone end piece of a $36 piece of prime rib served with canned gravy instead of au jus. I did to say it was close to being a TV dinner.
I was especially surprised when after 10 minutes no bread or rolls arrived and I had to ask.
 To which the response was oh you want rolls?
Don't eat here walk a few hundred yards up the road and eat at the keg for the same price and you won't be hungry or disappointed when you leave. Or simply go over to Subway and you'll still be ahead of the game rather than eating here."}
{"text":"We were quite pleasantly surprised by this restaurant tucked away as part of the Toronto Airport Marriott hotel's lobby.  There seems to be an inordinate number of mediocre steak and sport pubs on Dixon road and if you're not in the mood for these and want something a bit different (and tastier), then Bistro West by East certainly is a solid alternative.   My colleagues and I shared some terrific appetizers of: steak mini-chimichangas, excellent fried calamari, and a nice creamy burrata.  I followed up with a satisfyingly rich lobster fettuccine; my colleagues had their pork chops that was beautifully presented and also well-cooked and tasty.  A shout-out to Sharon and the other wait-staff - she made the experience a lot of fun with her enthusiasm and good nature!"}
