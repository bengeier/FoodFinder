{"text":"The place itself always seems clean and the staff are generally nice.   I was disappointed with my order this morning; I had already arrived at work when I noticed that my bagel wasn't toasted and there was barely any cream cheese on it. I don't get bagels often, so it's a treat for me when I do go to Einstein's, sad that this felt like a wasted trip.  Also, the other times that I have gone to this location, they were always skimpy on the spread, so I suggest asking for extra (I just always forget to ask when I do go)."}
{"text":"Excellent fast friendly service! Amazing choices of bagels, we liked the French Toast, Parmesan and Cranberry! The Pumpernickel bagel is a hearty treat if you love the flavor of dark rye. We plan to go back and try them all with hot steaming cups of excellent, eye-opening morning coffee. The special dark hot chocolate with dark chocolate chips topped with cream will delight you. Best ever! Place is hopping in the morning for breakfast bagel sandwiches and again at noon when the lunch crowd arrives, but worth a short wait in line to get your order in!"}
{"text":"I love Caribou coffee and use that exclusively at home, so I was thrilled to come to a city that had a brick and mortar store. However; staff was impatient and menu items are overpriced. At least I got a pack of DECAF Caribou to take back home to the Northeast."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese and egg bagel and the cheese came unmelted. I asked for it to be warmed up and the employees seemed annoyed (putting a bagel into a microwave is clearly hard work). Several minutes into eating the egg sandwich, I bit into something hard and pulled out a piece of egg shell a little bit larger than the size of a quarter. I brought it back up to the counter and showed the employee and asked for just a plain bagel with cream cheese instead. The employee didn't apologize or seem at all concerned and acted as if she was going way out of her way to make my new bagel. Also the wifi doesn't really work."}
{"text":"I'm from Minnesota and was thrilled to see a Caribou since I just moved here. Vanilla white mochas are a taste of home. Love this place and glad to see it, just find it strange it closes at 5pm on weekends."}
{"text":"We were at the Tempe, AZ location Sunday, 5/14/17, and received awful service from the untidy, frankly probably hungover, snobby college girls working the mid-morning shift. The gal taking our orders was not helpful in answering questions and generally just seemed annoyed that we had come in to order bagels and coffee. (We were the only ones in line and, I mean, is it really that hard to toast a bagel?) After receiving cold service from her, we waited for our order. The coffee order came out first and I noticed that I may not have received what I ordered. I asked the gal who had given us our bagels if she could confirm whether not this is what I ordered, and I received an eye roll and a cold \"I don't do coffee.\" Then she walked away. The girl who DID \"do coffee\" was very friendly and helpful once we waited to ask her. I don't mind waiting for an expert to help me with my question, but I do mind the snobby response I got just for asking a question. As someone new to that location, how was I supposed to know who does and does not do coffee? They are all behind the counter in the same spot. Long story short, if I want to pay for average tasting, overpriced bagels and coffee, I will do it at a location where they hire adults and not gossipy, bratty, hungover college kids."}
{"text":"I was SO excited when I heard Caribou Coffee opened up in Arizona--it used to be a treat for when I visited the Midwest. My favorite drink is the mint condition cooler, which packs enough calories to be an entire meal (even a small is 610 calories), but is so incredibly tasty. We're talking coffee blended with ice, mint flavor, and chocolate (you can get dark, milk, or white chocolate, or my favorite, which is a combination of all three). It's topped with whipped cream and chocolate mint. To die for."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to stop and grab a quick breakfast. My favorite thing to get is the turkey sausage and cheddar egg sandwich on an asiago bagel. Service is very quick. Food is tasty. Atmosphere is cozy with a fireplace. Overall, awesome place!"}
{"text":"Good coffee. The staff was friendly and quick. They had a good selection of pastries and breakfast sandwiches. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Everyone's very friendly and the ambiance is great. But I'm here to rate their almond milk latte. Almost 5 bucks for a medium sized latte which is overpriced and the latte unfortunately was a disappointment. It was not worth 5 dollars. I wouldn't come here for their coffee."}
