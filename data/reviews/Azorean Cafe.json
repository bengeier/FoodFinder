{"text":"This place is great. We've been wanting to try it since it opened and stopped in for breakfast today. We had breakfast sandwiches and home-fries, both of which were delicious. I also had one of the best lattes I've found in bloomfirlf. Very chill vibe and super friendly staff. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"When I stopped in here, I did so without realizing they had just opened two days ago. The atmosphere is casual which I liked. You order at the counter and if you are eating in, they'll bring your food to you. Since it was a hot day, I ordered a cold brew coffee which was very good. There were quite a few coffee and tea options. I look forward to trying the casserole and hot dishes, but today was a scorcher so I ordered their tuna sandwich with a side salad. The tuna was delicious and not heavy with mayo but included tuna, eggs, potatoes, olives, and vinegar with a touch of mayo. I had it in a croissant which was delicious. The side salad simply had cucumber and chopped onion. While there was oil and vinegar at the table, I would have preferred it dressed up a bit with something flavorful.   It was quite warm in the cafe though and since it was so hot today, I was looking for some respite from the heat so in that sense it could have been a little better.   The service was so nice and friendly and they were very happy to answer any questions! Looking forward to trying more!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try out this new spot in Bloomfield - It looks cute inside and also has a couple outdoor tables. But - I don't think I would go back. It is a Portuguese restaurant, however, the food really just tasted American to me.. It just wasn't 'different enough' as lame as that sounds. Maybe it's what we ordered, but it was a let down."}
{"text":"Excellent prices for quality, fresh food. The food was very flavorful and the coffee was delicious. If you like spice, try the hot sauce!"}
{"text":"We were so happy with our breakfasts!  Fiance got the American Breakfast and raved about the homefries and also his Intelligentsia coffee.  I enjoyed a Paposeco and Meia Leite.  I'm so excited about the food offered here and can't wait to visit again to try another item off the menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pasteis and Octopus.  It has a coffee shop atmosphere with delicious food.  Authentically Portuguese."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!  I have to freak out about a place to give 5 stars and Azorean Cafe was close.  Ordered the American breakfast with presunto, which was similar to Canadian bacon in terms of texture but it is cured and sourced from Portugal.  The home fries were light with a hint of red pepper and parsley.  The portions were moderate. Not stuffed, not hungry, perfect for a hot summer day.  The owner came by our table and could not have been nicer.  This will be a regular spot!"}
{"text":"I cant wait to come here again and again. Just stopped in for breakfast. It's so freaking CUTE. I got an egg sandwich and an ice coffee. Their bread is the best that I've had in a restaurant, a crusty roll that is so soft and flavorful in the inside. My iced coffee was delicious. Usually when I go out for breakfast they give me more food than I can handle, but the portions here are perfect. I'm excited to go back and see what they have for lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. The owner was very helpful and friendly in explaining the food. She's clearly passionate about her food and keeping in the tradition of her home. Great food and experience. We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Have visited twice.  Once for a late lunch and once for breakfast sandwich take out.  First, the staff is very friendly and will explain the items on the menu.  Elsa the owner is very sweet and checking on you and your satisfaction with your food.  The Egg, Cheese, & Presunto, breakfast sandwich is very good with a salty Presunto, cheese and a well cooked egg.  My order of home fries were so tasty!  The home fries include red pepper, onions and nicely cooked potato.   Really enjoyed the Feijoada for lunch, a Portuguese stew of beans, pork, & chorizo.  A very large bowl of deliciousness.  If you are interested in coffee and pastry, or breakfast, or lunch.  Stop by and welcome your new neighbor."}
