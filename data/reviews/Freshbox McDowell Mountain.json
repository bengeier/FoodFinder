{"text":"I went to Freshbox after finding them while searching for a healthy lunch option in North Scottsdale. I am so glad I did, because the food is tasty, quickly-prepared, and left me feeling satisfied with my choice. Also, the employees are good at making wraps that don't fall apart after a few bites. 

My one complaint is the high prices for their shakes, especially since the portions are small. Someone could make an identical shake at home for a tenth of the cost they charge. Is it a premium for convenience? Or do they grow their own ingredients on the roof?

P.S.
The Sumac Daddy and Primal Warrior are great menu items."}
{"text":"The best salad bar experience in town! Mostly organic & fresh clean eating here folks!  Great portion size, low calorie, delicious real food!  Favs for me are Primal Warrior salad and Sumac Daddy.  Prices are  good, frequent diner rewards are a bonus and unbeatable value for healthy meals."}
{"text":"Love the addition of the small salad options and have had great interactions with staff. This has become a go to place for us."}
{"text":"I will give this restaurant a second try owner has stepped up to the plate."}
{"text":"The first time we ate here it was great. Unfortunately every time after that was worse than the one before. They are just inconsistent. Sometimes the wrap is huge and can feed two, other times you are still hungry after eating the whole thing. And customer service is seriously lacking. The manager was supposed to call me back and never did. If I ever order from here again it will definitely NOT be take out or delivery so I can send it back if it isn't right."}
{"text":"5 stars! I have been to many \"make your own salad places\", but Freshbox has the best and most unique ingredients by far. I had a salad with chicken and the blood orange vinaigrette. I also had the cold brew coffee which was not acidic at all and had a great carmel after taste! I am glad Freshbox is in North Scottsdale. I will most definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Love! Delicious food and generous servings...great snack options and smoothies as well.  I am always looking for a good protein smoothie and they make em! I have to stop myself from going here too much! Also super nice people working here, always appreciate that!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Obsessed with their rotating flavored stevia sweetened lemonades. Fresh ingredients and Paleo/Keto/Whole30 friendly. Amen! Not kidding we are here sometimes 3x per week. Do yourself a favor and try this place if you are dying for a quick but healthy meal."}
{"text":"We love fresh box! Especially make your own !!!! The restaurant is right next to my sisters house so when we lunch together, this is the place we go. I love all the added extras like seeds. As a vegetarian I'm always looking for creative protein options and they have a ton!"}
{"text":"This place is like the rich people's chipotle.  I've had the Seoul wrap and the Pho wrap, both very delicious.  The price is just slightly too much for me to go daily, but it's not too high (around $15/meal).  Fresh ingredients, nice portions and fairy quickly prepared.  It's the type of food that doesn't make you feel like shit afterwards.  The customer service is good enough, can't complain yet.  It lives up to its name, fresh box."}
{"text":"I just stumbled across this place while visiting North Scottsdale - what a great find!  Very fresh and healthy salad with a delicious and bold salad dressing. (turmeric ginger vinaigrette)  So many places (Panera, Mad Greens,etc.) have such blah dressings that I was happy to find this place.  I wish they had a Freshbox in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have now eaten here twice, and I am amending my rating to 5 stars. Great food. Fresh ingredients. Great service."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is a little pricey but totally worth it. I always get the Primal Warrior! The ingredients are fresh and good quality. You also get a good portion as well. The chicken is very tasty. I love that you can make it either a salad or wrap no extra cost.

I actually put my coworkers on to this spot and they also agree that this place is delicious. They got Herban Cowboy and the Wholey Moley. No complaints! 

Definitely a great place to go for a great healthy meal."}
{"text":"I ordered a custom wrap today and it was excellent, the flavors of the avocado cream and hummus can make any combo of ingredients taste great together.  Husband had the Herban Cowboy and he loved it.  We also tried their infused lemonade, one basil and one ginger and they were both incredible.  They have cold brewed coffee too which is a major plus for me.

They have high quality, fresh, and locally sourced ingredients with the names of the farms listed inside the restaurant.  You can eat there but I've only tried take out.  Parking lot is huge and there are good spots to park away from other cars.  This was only my second time here but service has been great and I've been happy with everything I've tried.  The portions are big and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"Convenient and quick.  New without a good ambiance and staff need additional training to build consistency.  I will go here for takeout 2X/week.  I would stay if table set up was better and you could have a private conversation.  I think they should give more than 3 oz of chicken, 4 oz would be more appropriate.  Also, EXTREMELY wasteful.  Most people that go to eat organic food do not want to eat out of plastic that then gets thrown away into landfills.  I would suggest wood resusable bowls for dining in and more environmentally friendly containers.  Also, I ordered 4 kids meals one day and each side had a plastic container for 8 plastic containers!!!  Kids quesadillas great but more chicken please."}
{"text":"I've had Freshbox a few times over the past few months and there's always been some sort of problem with the food and/or service. The first time I tried here I got a make your own bowl with rice noodles and shredded chicken delivered via GrubHub and it was almost inedible. The rice noodles were totally undercooked and the shredded chicken was so dried out that it tasted like yarn. 

Still inspired by the slew of other 5 star reviews, I decided to try again a few days later and got a white rice based veggie bowl. It tasted great but it took a ridiculous amount of time to make. For some reason, the woman helping me had to go in the back and get the rice and came back minutes later telling me that she had to get me a new bowl of rice after finding that the hot rice melted the first plastic bowl she put it in. Why that mistake had to be made, I really don't know. 

The third time basically put the nail in the coffin. I went in yesterday to try this place again and even though I was the ONLY person they were helping at the time, it still took way too many minutes to get me my food. From what I could see, it seemed that there weren't enough clean tongs available. No melted bowl and no dry chicken this time but the chicken was so incredibly salty and there was barely any dressing on my bowl. The cold brewed iced tea was surprisingly phenomenal but not enough to make up for everything else.

The price here definitely does not reflect the quality. It's just another overpriced \"healthy\" salad spot dropped in an affluent area."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars but I paid $12 for a bag of quinoa chips...
We ordered for 2, to go plus an order of house mad humus and quinoa chips which totaled $37 so it's pricey but.....

The food was delicious!!  I had a custom wrap with kale, brusel sprouts, corn, mung sprouts, feta, chicken and miso dressing.  It was so fresh and had so much flavor.  My boyfriend ordered the pho wrap and said it was really good.
Their humus is the best I have had around here so far.

We will be regulars here."}
{"text":"Great healthy option!

I got the Seoul food in a wrap. Overall, did enjoy my meal and it was really filling but did feel a little much at times. Was not a particular fan of the greens they put in because they felt a little hard to eat. However, would recommend for a healthy meal. 

Liked that there was practically no line when I came."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm so glad there's something like this around here, especially being at this event today at Westworld and having only junk food to eat. I wish I had one of these in Gilbert."}
{"text":"I am visiting from San Diego. Wish we had Fresh Box in SD. Very similar to Cafe Gratitude at a lower price point. 

The bowls are amazing, and dressing is perfection. You must order a bottles day in advance to purchase. 

Large portions and very filling. The homemade desert bars are wonderful, the açaí bowl delicious with honey and granola a more liquid texture than thicker you see most places. 

Ate breakfast before our hike and went back for lunch. Perfect place for a healthy meal when hiking the Gateway Trails."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for lunch! Outstanding high-quality ingredients make truly mouthwateringly good salads and wraps. We eat here weekly and would come every day if we could."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer of Freshbox, and I absolutely love it. It's so cool to find a place that cares about organic ingredients and makes such DELICIOUS food. On top of that, the customer service is fantastic. I've always had great experiences, especially with the young couple that works there (I probably should know their names by now ). I'll always be a Freshbox customer, keep doing healthy ingredients and hiring great people!!"}
{"text":"Five stars always! This place never seems to disappoint always quick and friendly! I love the staff! Even though they are always busy they never make you feel rushed. Keep up the great service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had salads for lunch here and they were incredible! They had great combinations and they thought of everything from using good oils in the dressing, nitrate free bacon, local farms for the produce, and stevia to sweeten the lemonade. And it tasted so flavorful! highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Truly somewhere I can go and eat without worrying about nasty additives. For anyone trying to eat clean, you've got to try freshbox. Many options are Paleo or whole30 compliant."}
{"text":"Food is good, portions are small, prices average to high. Pick up order not ready upon arrival."}
{"text":"Oh boy do i love this place!! I was in town doing work at Quicken and this place was right down the road. 
First off i have to say the staff here is absolutely amazing!!! They were super excited to talk about the food and explain and answer any questions i had. The also were just very personal asking me about my day and how i was doing.
The facility is small but perfect, there is also outdoor seating available which i enjoyed on the sunny 70 deg days i was there. Everything was very clean and well kept.

The food! oh man! amazing! the menu is small, i thinks i recall around 10 items on the menu. All super fresh and all super amazing. They literally have a fresh produce cooler right behind them that they grab ingredients when making your food. I had salads both times i went there, i know they can make them into wraps as well. They flavor were just perfect and outstanding! 
I recommend anyone looking for a tasty fresh lunch to go here! you'll be hooked as i am. The menu is very heath conscious but amazing.

i can't wait to come back here when I'm in town on business."}
{"text":"If you are wondering why millennials aren't saving money it's because of places like this that sell $11 salads. Great food though."}
{"text":"I would have to say this is one of my favorite places in the valley. Organic, non-gmo, and goodies brought in from local farms. If you are in the area, and looking for the highest quality of food in N. Scottsdale, you should check them out :))"}
{"text":"This place is very expensive but the ingredients are of incredible freshness and quality. This is a place to get a healthy dinner, relatively quickly, though it does take them some time to make your food. I love the wraps. They taste amazing and I don't feel guilty eating them because they are made with such good ingredients. The Pho, Seoul Food and Primal Warrior are my faves."}
{"text":"Fresh- yes. Clean - yes.  Great concept.  I'm just not thrilled at the pricing and lack of flavor. It was very expensive. I find Grabba Green a much better experience overall."}
{"text":"Food is good, it's awesome to be able to pick the exact items you want in a salad or wrap but it is very pricey and they are not the quickest. Juice options are pretty limited and they stop juicing about an hour before they close for the day. This has been inconvenient on multiple occasions. The smoothies are awesome, super flavorful. Overall a good experience, just need to ramp up the juice options and time frame that they serve it."}
{"text":"Lovely folks at fresh box make some of the best salads around. And their iced coffee is pretty great too."}
{"text":"Jolt smoothie is fabulous!  Homemade protein bars are delicious.  Salads custom or the pre-combined (Primal Warrior, Herban Cowboy) are worth price and easily can be two meals.  Detailed nutritional data for everything.  Rewards program is nice for freebies too!!!!!  Anyone hiking around Gateway Trailhead should plan to eat here before or after."}
{"text":"I made up my own chicken salad from all the tons of choices. All the ingredients were fresh and delicious . I can't wait to try everything else! 
Customers service was knowledgable and friendly!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a fresh salad mixed with your favorite healthy ingredients.  The service was friendly and the prices were fair."}
{"text":"This restaurant by far takes the most care I've ever seen to ensure their food is cooked to perfection. If you have ever had their meats, dressings, soups, teas, desserts you can taste that everything is scratch made and the utmost care has been take to keep their dishes consistent and delicious. I love knowing no matter what I try it's going to be fresh and delicious. It's so easy to eat healthy. They also list all of their organic ingredients they always carry. They offer this chocolate espresso smoothie that will make your morning amazing. And their regular coffee is good too. If you really want something to boost your energy try their delicious juices. Any time I am around I always stop in, stock up and visit with their super friendly staff. This restaurant is amazing."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Freshbox & it definitely won't be our last! I built my own salad and my husband had the Herban Cowboy as a wrap. We also tried the soup of the day, a vegetarian chili & shared an ice tea! The food was great, fresh ingredients, organic meat & very flavorful dressing. The veggie chili was terrific & the tea... we combined the tropical tea with the watermelon jalepeño lemonade. YUM!
We also met the owner, Sophia who was just awesome!"}
{"text":"Not too bad..... Very similar concept as Grabba Green IMO, but less options. Calorie and nutritional information not available, and would be nice to have, but it is overall healthy.  Had a Groupon to use, but still ended up spending my 13$ with a tip included, so not cheap, but not overpriced either."}
{"text":"At first I was a little skeptical, which is usual for me when trying out new places to eat but I was most pleasantly surprised. The food was AMAZING and LOCAL and HEALTHY! You can't get much better than that. If this place was by my gym my bank account would have a huge problem. I got The Pho and my girlfriend got the Herban Cowboy, both were equally delicious!!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad something so yummy, organic, and healthy has opened up here! I had the Herban Cowboy salad and as a wrap it is so delicious!!! They're jalapeño watermelon lemonade is mouth watering! The service is super friendly and fast! I'll be here every week!"}
{"text":"On July 6th, I stopped by while in town to try this place out. Mike Morelli is always talking about this place so I thought \"why not\". The employees working, Jasmine and Nicole (I believe that was their names, they happen to be sisters) were BEYOND amazing and honestly made the experience memorable. They were extremely helpful and super friendly  (which is rare in Scottsdale).  The food was incredible and its truly healthy! I wish there was a Fresh Box in LA, specifically on Ventura Blvd. It would be a hit given there isn't anything like this here!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Can't wait to come back and try something else. They allow you to turn any salad into a wrap free of charge! Great way to mix things up"}
{"text":"My husband visited earlier in the week for lunch so we stopped by on a Saturday evening. It was DEAD at almost 6:00. My husband double checked to make sure they were open. The 2 girls working were sweet and got our food done quickly. The food was delicious and I would definitely get the Cobb wrap again!! 2 complaints: the high chairs were VERY dirty (you would think the place would be spotless since they had no customers before us) and it is WAY overpriced. $30-something dollars for a wrap, salad and 2 drinks is steep! Yes I know it's organic and what not but it's still pricey. We would go back for sure regardless."}
{"text":"Salad very fresh. Could be smaller and $2 less.  Nice service.   Sweetgreens wannabe."}
{"text":"Healthy, mostly organic, non GMO, Fresh, Delicious and Fast!  

This place gets busy so if your in a hurry I'd suggest placing the order online for pick up or 
BEAT THE WAIT, and CALL AHEAD 480-245-4469.  

They offer 2 soups of the day usually one creamy & one broth based from what I can tell.  You can ask for a sample if your not sure which you'd prefer.  

You start by picking a salad, wrap or quesadilla any of which you can do a build your own or you can go with one of their delicious creations example the
Park Ave Cobb, Wholey Moley, Primal Warrior, The Pho, Sumac Daddy.  
 They make the dressings in house 

Their lemonades contain no sugar! They use pure organic stevia extract, alkaline water and fresh fruits & herbs.  The bomb.com !!

{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC! The food, the service, the spot! I cannot say more amazing things about this place. I originally found this place on Yelp and was so happy I did. We went here on a wim, based off the Yelp reviews. It's a cute spot, you walk in and are greeted by friendly employees. It's like Chipotle, but salad style. They have their signature salads or you can build your own, which we always choose. They also have a juice/smoothie bar and soup, but it's not their focus. We got a juice, which was pretty decent. But the smoothie we got wasn't that great. The ingredients are ALWAYS fresh and primarily local and organic which I absolutely love and appreciate. I have yet to try their famous chili, which is only served on Friday's.
Their staff are the coolest and kindest! They work so hard and come across all types of customers, and they stay consistently genuine and friendly. I've started coming in here often enough that we're a little more engaging which I appreciate. Katie and the assistant manager (I'm sorry I'm blanking on her name right now) are SO awesome and fun and friendly. I go back here for the food, yes, but also to interact with them!
LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"I don't like giving bad reviews; however, the last 4 times I have purchased from this restaurant, since giving them a 5-star rating, have not been pleasant. This bad review stems mostly from bad customer service. The food is great, don't get me wrong. It's just that the first 3 times I showed up to pick up my to-go order I had to wait for up to 3 other customers (to have their food prepped and paid for) although my order was sitting next to the wall and was already paid for via their website. Once the server got to me and asked what I needed help with, I informed her that I placed a to-go order online and was ready to pick it up. She asked me what my name was and I replied, then she immediately handed me my order and I left. I couldn't help thinking why to-go customers had such a huge wait time just to pick up their order especially if it was already paid for. And on top of that, this has happened to me 3 times in a row.

The 4th time that I decided to order, I was not able to order online. For some reason, this feature was disabled. I was able to access my personal account and see that I had a $5 voucher (it must be mentioned here, that I actually had 2 accounts with them online. The first one was a personal account and the second one was a business account. I had the personal account since day one when the owner of the restaurant set it up for me. The business account was created by me when I could not figure how to access my personal account online. Also, this business account was used only once before when a server incorrectly put my order on the wrong account). 

To continue... I called in my order since I was unable to order online. I advised her that I actually have 2 accounts and that one needed to be deleted. I also advised that I needed to merge the points from the business account over to the personal account. She advised that this is not a new issue and could be easily resolved if I came in and spoke with the owner about it. Since the owner was not in today, I would need to follow up later at the appropriate time that she gave me. I agreed and hung up. 

It is at this point, where things got worse for me... Minutes after the previous phone call was made I arrived to pick up my to-go order. However, when they tried to pull up my personal account (which had the $5 voucher) they were unable to access it. I informed her that was impossible since I was in my personal account prior to arriving there. She re-iterated to me that my personal account was not in their system. When I asked how or why my account was deleted, I was never given a straight answer on this and no one would own up to it.

Instead, the only option I was given at this point was her word that she would make sure the points were awarded to my account to show that I have a $5 discount. She asked for my information (name, phone number, email, etc.) and said this would be fixed and not to worry about it. 

So I waited about a week believing everything was going to be resolved and that a call would come through from the owner/employee explaining that it was taken care of. But the call never came.

In the end, I wound up calling them today and explaining the issue all over again. I was asked for my personal information for the 2nd time and was advised they would take care of it. It was at this point I felt I was getting nowhere on resolving this issue -- with their website and my account which had mysteriously disappeared. In frustration, I tried accessing my online account again (while on the phone with the manager). For curiosity-sake, I entered my personal email address and for the password I entered the password from my 'business account'. Surprisingly, I was able to view this account; however, this account is one that I rarely used and there was no $5 discount on it as promised. I was also at this point I realized what had happened. All of my business information was still there except for the email address. The email address on this account was changed from one that was used for business to my personal one. This explained why I was not able to login with my personal email address and password.

As of now, I have wasted a lot of time trying to have my personal online account restored to the way it was before, complete with my purchase history and points. And all I have now is the business account, which I have no desire to use or keep. I don't understand how a business can delete a customer's account or have any way of restoring it in case the former does occur. For their part, I was offered to have my business account deleted and to start all over again with a new account and $5 discount. Unfortunately, after all of the bad customer service I went through, I still have my doubts on their ability to make things go right.

{"text":"Disappointing. My salad was supposed to come with steak but I got shredded chicken instead. The salad dressings are not good at all, lacking flavor. I would not go back to this place."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite places to eat on my lunch breaks. I have to give jack huge props. He is super friendly. Took time to start a conversation with me and make me smile. What I didn't like is the interaction his shift lead or manager was with him and other employees. Rude and short even if there was a small mistake. There are better ways to correct a coworker don't look down your nose at them."}
{"text":"Clean, contemporary all with fresh food. I really like the salads because I can add, remove and just make it just the way I want. Tasty, healthy and more than enough food. 

The drinks have stevia which I dislike so only negative."}
{"text":"Got here right when they opened and they were nice and prepared for the day which was a big plus since I was in a hurry! Traveling through so it was my first time there and the ladies helped me decide what to order! She helped me make my meal 100% vegan and it was great having a meal with a variety of veggies i dont usually consume. When im in town, i will be back! Ambiance, quality, taste, staff... All 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I've driven past here numerous times and finally decided to try it out today. I am SO HAPPY I did. I had a Primal Warrior wrap and subbed sweet potato for tomato. So delicious. I also got a watermelon basil lemonade that was to die for and was not too overly sweet or sour. My only negative thing to say about my experience is maybe have a few more people working the line to keep things moving. Regardless I'll be back for sure. So glad I took the time to stop in finally."}
{"text":"A great quick and easy place for quality fresh foods. Staff was friendly and very helpful. I ordered one of their signature salads - the primal warrior - it was great! Huge! Grass fed beef! I think $13 was very reasonable for fresh from the farm veggies and healthy proteins."}
{"text":"Only the freshest ingredients sourced from local Arizona farms to the stretches of Yuma, AZ. Very clean and orderly. Not too stuffy on the options but a fair amount. Wraps and salads with over 30 ingredients to choose from. 

Various coffee, cold drink options. 

Clean tables, chairs and counters. Bathrooms were very sanitary and floors were swept and mopped. 

Staff was helpful, courteous and fine examples of good hosts. 

My only wish is to have a place like this walking distance from my house in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Healthy fresh excellent variety of wraps and salads. Manager helpful and friendly. Checked to see if we wanted anything added to our wrap while we were eating. Will definitely be back. Well priced for the amount of food. Great value!"}
{"text":"Eh. Was wanting more flavor, could of tossed the greens with some sort of something. And for a $13 wrap it really could lead of packed again, more flavor. 
Good concept, friendly enough kids running the place, but still a ways to go in order to deliver fresh, nutrient rich tasty food"}
{"text":"As much as I tried to love this place , and giving it two tries - there is MUCH left to be desired.

First of it seems like this place is ran by a bunch of high schoolers running around like chickens with their heads chopped of. No clear sense of who is doing what, and performing like its their first day on the job (probably literally is).  With no crowd in the store both times, the wraps took 10+ minutes to be made, which should of been no longer than a few minute of assembly.  

Ingredients are fresh - I'll give it that. But my 2nd wrap that I ordered was barely filled with ingredients - and after a few bites I was left with mostly wrap left over.  Oh and lets not forget the price - at over $12/$13 a wrap I would expect at least a moderate serving of chips with it - wrong I got 3 strangly chip looking things along with my barely filled wrap. Again...charging above restaurant prices for a mediocre wrap thats barely filled with ingredients is not my cup of tea.  I do not mind paying premium prices for premium food - but this was far from that.

One of the times I got a veggie smoothie. It was more of 'veggie flavored water'...no consistency to it at all, luke warm - again very disappointing for $6+.

The seating inside is awkward as well. There is one long table in the middle of the place, and several seats scattered up against the window (with a very narrow counter)...so inside layout of seating seems like an afterthought rather than planned from the start. 

Maybe I will return in several months to see if this place has got it together...both in consistency of food preparation, turn around time, and ingredient combinations.  For now, it seems like 90% gimmick with over inflated prices."}
{"text":"I just moved a mile away from freshbox, so I've been going there a lot! The service and food has always been good. Jolt smoothie is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Probably my 5th visit.  This experience started out so very well but each visit has declined in employee attitude.  The first time we came here it was phenomenal, the portions were generous and the workers were social, engaging, and fun.  Fast forward to our visit today... felt as if we were bothering the crew by us showing up.  Awkward.  No smiles.  Just a weird vibe.  If the visit today was our first time... it would be our last."}
{"text":"This place is really good. It's a perfect spot for a nice healthy meal. Wife and I came here after hiking gateway and it was the perfect compliment to the day. Would recommend the herban cowboy as a wrap. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good!!! Amazing food that is both fresh and healthy, hard to find in the age of fast food. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Maybe I came at a bad time, but the service here was so slow and disorganized. No one knew who was ahead of each other because there are seemingly three lines to stand in, the staff is very slow although I cannot really fault them for this since it was busy. To top it off my drink tasted like pure aspartame. I couldn't drink it. Waste of an overpriced smoothie."}
{"text":"The food is really tasty and delicious. I love how they try get their ingredients from local farmers. They did mess up my order twice out of the maybe five times I have been there. I ask for no meat and I got meat and had to throw everything out when I got home. Also they will not let you substitute meat with an extra veggie if you want it vegetarian. They will just charge you as if you got meat even though you didn't, but won't let you add an extra veggie option instead of having the chicken? So they kind of sucks that they are not accommodating to that."}
{"text":"Wow-wee! So sad that this place is two hours away. We were in Phoenix for the day visiting Talesin West and were looking for something simple nearby for lunch. Found this gem and opted for the make your own salad route. Beautiful, yummy selections throughout the line. Finally had to stop picking additions as salad was getting huge but it was hard because everything looked so delicious and was it ever!  Expected a big tab when I went to pay but was very pleasantly surprised. I think I may have paid about $8.00 for a giant, fresh salad with the most unusual, delicious ingredients."}
{"text":"Little pricier than I expected based on how it looked but the food was certainly quality. The butternut squash enchiladas were amazing. I would go back just for those. 

Waiters took a while to even make the first stop by our table, and then the drinks took over 10 minutes to be delivered after we ordered. There were open tables throughout the restaurant and didn't seem busy so that was a little annoying it was taking so long."}
{"text":"I've never written a review ever in my life but I just had to about this place! Not only was my wrap AMAZING but so was the customer service. The manager was so nice and helpful! I got the sumac daddy in wrap and loved it! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Best salads I've found in the valley! All of their dressings are homemade and you can ask for a bottle to take with you. Super friendly group of people."}
{"text":"My favorite salad and wrap spot! I think I have tried almost everything :) customer service is always immaculate, even when the line is long. Can't say anything bad about freshbox. FRESH ingredients, freshly cooked, crisp veggies, healthy choices."}
{"text":"Great salads!! Here for the weekend from out of town, and ordered from here a few times on Uber Eats. There are some issues with the app not showing all of the veggie toppings but they called and worked through it with us every time! Food is fresh and tasty and customer service is five star. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this  place! I always order the pho wrap and it is absolute perfection! Food is fresh and they are very nice. This is my go to place for healthy delicious  food that is fast and affordable. I have tried most of their things and they are all really good! Their drinks are also very good!"}
{"text":"We came here after our tailesin west tour. We wanted healthy and hubby found this on yelp. Omg omg the food here was sooooo good and fresh. I wish we had more places like this in WA. I got the Seoul food salad with grass fed beef. It was full of beef and super  fresh veggies and rice noodles. It was filling and a good portion. One of my Friends got the herban cowboy and acai bowl which she liked as well."}
{"text":"Awesome place nice service,great fresh food, and they delivered to our CrossFit gym!! Highly recommend spot!"}
{"text":"From what I observed walking into Freshbox, this is the place to go after the gym.  I'm pretty sure 98% of the customers were in workout gear, myself included.  

I waited a good 20 minutes to order because according to the workers they were understaffed for an unusually busy Saturday afternoon.  All the emplyees profusely apologized for the delay and I wasn't in hangry mode so I didn't mind.  The decor was simplistic and bright with a shelf area that displayed organic veggies that could go into a customizable sald or wrap.  I felt healthier just standing there.

I was too indecisive to make my own salad so I  got a signature wholey moley salad and wholey moley is right. The salad was giant and delicious.  I enjoyed the kick from the jalapeños and poblano peppers.  The chicken in avocado sauce almost negates the need for a dressing but trust me add some citrus lime vinaigrette,  it ties it all together like a bow on a present. 

 I sat outside to eat and enjoyed just looking out to the mountains.  It was a perfect little break from life. In the end I had leftovers which is unheard of for me and salads.  They also have a selection of juices and smoothies which I was tempted to try but will have to wait for a return trip."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my first visit to this healthy, wholesome, delicious establishment. Happy with the recommendations and service provided. And yes, their hummus is to die for and their lentil soup with chicken was fantastic! Looking forward to my next trip. Thanks for being close to me in North Scottsdale. Love healthy and happy options!"}
{"text":"This place!!

I very randomly found Freshbox while running some errands over my Friday lunch break. I HATE the vortex of doom that is driving around the FLLW/Hayden area, but that's where I was when I ventured onto Yelp with a hope and a prayer that I could find lunch close, but not there.

Enter: Freshbox. I quick jaunt down Bell and I was in bizness. I opted for a Primal Warrior salad, add shredded chicken. The salad had some of my absolute favorite ingredients: kale, spinach, roasted beets, tomato, avocado (a whole half!), sunflower seeds. (I left the roasted brussels off, but it usually comes with those, too). My salad bowl was on a food scale the whole time the gal was adding each ingredient, which I actually appreciate. It means portions are consistent and their calorie counts are closer to what they display on the menu. The chicken was perfect and when I tossed it with a little of their cilantro dressing, it was outstanding! 

The prices on their online menu are higher than what I paid, so I'm not sure if prices have gone down or if chicken is that much cheaper than steak, but I paid less than $10 for an awesome, fresh, filling salad. So happy to have stumbled upon Freshbox!"}
{"text":"Awesome salad place with a lot if organic items, including the salad greens.  I made my own salad and loved the ingredients they provided and being organic also. Their salad dressing was house made too. . the only sad thing is there was NO SILVER FORK.  They gave a PLASTIC FORK!!!  Not cool.  If you're going to be organic then you need real silverware!!"}
{"text":"This is a decent enough food place if you're on a healthy diet. The salads here are bomb, depending on what you order. However, some of the smoothies are disappointing. Many of the food/drinks here are a hit or miss; which is kind of disappointing considering the cost. I wasn't impressed, but would come back if i had to. 

3 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"I am really loving these new healthy restaurants that have been popping up throughout the valley.  Freshbox does it right.  I have eaten here twice now and each time I've ordered the Primal Warrior as a wrap.  It's fresh and healthy and very filling.  You won't regret this meal.  They have naturally sweeten drinks with no added sugars.  Coming here right after a good workout will get you recharged in no time."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious!  Upon the recommendation of a very gracious employee, I had the primal warrior. She had me at brussel sprouts!  She was even cautious enough to ask if I liked cilantro to warn me about the suggested dressing. I hate cilantro, so I appreciated this so much!  Anyway, I got this amazing salad that was big enough for two, with two dressings on the side. My friend loved tahini dressing and I loved the pomegranate vinaigrette. $14 for a huge, super nutritious salad, with grass fed beef steak, yes please!  I could eat this every night!"}
{"text":"Solid make your own salad spot. I got the Herban Cowboy and was surprised by how full I was after. Prices  are honestly good for what you're getting. Got the Jolt smoothie. Wished there was more peanut butter and more chocolate but it was good too. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"D'lish! Super fresh, tasty and healthy salad options. The establishment is clean and the workers are friendly and helpful. Loved the Primal Warrior with a scoop of turmeric cauliflower. Yum! They make eating healthy fun and their menu board lists calorie count. 

A little pricey, but now a days healthy food is. Glad they offer a rewards program!"}
{"text":"1st visit and I'm already impressed! Fresh heathy ingredients in a simple delivery format: assembly line service. I'm always looking for healthy choices. This is a great find and in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Came here to get a beet juice and stayed for a custom salad. Sure it's pricey but hey good things cost money and this stuff is worth it. Yum yum yum. I love everything about this place and will be back. I wish they would open another location in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm here at least twice a week. I'm really picky about my meat and their chicken has always been done to perfection. No veins, stretchy bits or gristle just perfectly cooked chicken. The Herban Cowboy is hands down my favorite and the Park Ave Cobb is where I go when I want to switch it up. Everything they make here is from scratch and made with the finest ingredients. Yes this place is pricey but I could not make it for what they charge. It's worth every penny. I often find the portions so large that I eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner. Don't miss the hummus it's delicious. Listen where there some quirks when they first opened, of course but every time I go I see them getting better at what they do and the employees are becoming more and more knowledgeable. If you're conscious about what's going in your body you will love this place and want more."}
{"text":"First time visit. Kind of confusing. Had a quinoa bowl with roasted veggies. Had lots of garbonzo beans & black beans but hardly any veggies. Only saw a couple of carrot pieces but no roasted veggies. The spicy hummus with it was amazing. Will try something different next time. A good place nearby my favorite place, Planet Beach!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Fresh, healthy, and delicious.  The staff is super friendly and this is my favorite healthy lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Tried a salad from Freshbox. Nothing on the menu sounded that great to me so I opted to make my own. The portion size fits the price at about $10, and my salad was surprisingly really good. It is very hard to find a good salad anywhere because they are either really healthy but too bland, or taste really good and have as many calories as a meal from Mcdonalds. This place is a good resolution to that problem and I feel like it is a healthy option that still tastes good. The reason for 4 stars and not 5, is because I ordered avocado on my salad and they only gave me like 4 or 5 little cubes of avocado, and that's just a little disappointing when you have to pay extra for it. I also wish they had more options for salad dressing, as most of their dressings have jalapeno and I don't care for spicy, but the balsamic that I got was very good. Overall, I really liked my food and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A friend took me here last weekend while I was visiting him in Scottsdale. I loved it so much I ended up eating there 5 times in 2 days!  The recipes are all amazing but you can also create your own wrap or bowl to your own liking. All of the food are so clean, fresh and healthy. I highly recommend the Jolt smoothie to go along with whatever food you order. If you're in the Scottsdale area and you're looking for healthy, tasty food, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The food used to be amazing.  It's still pretty good but the service is hit and miss at best and I've had too many incidents where they either mix up the orders or just have a poor attitude.  

This used to be one of my favorite spots but I won't be back."}
{"text":"So good! Everything is crazy fresh and delicious- I had the Park Ave Cobb with Cilantro Lemon Vinaigrette and it was bomb!! They even made my picky daughter a chicken and cheese only wrap that she loved! Service is super friendly, too!"}
{"text":"Best Lunch in the area if you're looking for clean eating.  Smoothies great too.  Always clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Nice healthy dining option with salads, wraps and freshly made juices. I got the Park Ave Cobb. It was a good size, and it should be at $12 for a counter service salad. (I wish they'd make the salads a little smaller and charge 10 bucks instead.) 

The herb ranch dressing and chicken were both extremely bland so I had to doctor my meal up with lots of salt and pepper. It'd be better if they put the chicken on first and then the rest of the ingredients because people with their eyes as well as their mouths and a big pile of bland chicken is less appetizing than a colorful plate. 

I am glad they use mostly organic ingredients, free-range steak, chicken and eggs. They use recycled materials and local farm ingredients, too. I just wish the food had more flavor. I also wish they offered a gluten-free wrap option. I'll be back to see if their other offerings are tastier!"}
{"text":"I got the sumac wrap, it was good and huge. Only downside is the amount of garlic and tomatoes. I think next time I'll side note light on the tomatoes. Otherwise place was good, I'll try it again and something new. They have a neat selection and I like that I can create my own."}
