{"text":"Third times a charm!  This is the third restaurant in this location and by-far the best one.  Wonderful beers and pub food."}
{"text":"This is a pretty okay place to go for drinks or meeting friends after work.  The menu is overly large, too many entrees and not very imaginative.  Conveniently located both downtown and at Hilldale.  Nothing special.  Tends to be kind of noisy."}
{"text":"Good beer and wide variety of food on the menu from standard pub fare to more exotic choices like fish tacos and peanut stew.  I had their American pale ale and it was good, with just the right malt/hops balance. The peanut stew was fragrant with spices, full of veggies with a rich peanut sauce--yumm.  We waited about one beer on a Tuesday night--not too bad, but Friday must be difficult.  Friendly, efficient waitress who even put up with my dining companion's flirty hassling with good humor."}
{"text":"We used to live on Richmond Hill ten years ago before moving out East.  Stopped for a quick pint at the now Great Dane up on the hill.  The \"developers\" have turned the whole park into an instant semi-urban slum, and all the beautiful views are gone (including the one at the Dane apparently).  Walked in looking for a brew and was almost knocked over by the racket from some of the totally boozed up customers virtually screaming at each other.  Looked around and saw nothing but detritus and dirty windows.  Tried to get at the hostesses, but they couldn't be heard over the racket.  This place is really a dump.  I don't know if any of their beer is any good, as we never got one."}
{"text":"A local favorite! The brat & bacon pretzel burger may not be good for your arteries but it's the best!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, beer and service every single time we eat here. Every item on the menu is a winner."}
{"text":"Service is horrid in this location. Every time I've been there, I wait for food and wait for drinks and wait and wait and wait.   One time in particular, the waiter was short from the time we sat down. Sorry we wanted to give you money in exchange for decent service and food.   Then the most flavorless, flat soda was delivered to our table. My boyfriend asked for another soda and politely explains it doesn't taste quite right. Waiter's response? \"Well, it's going to come out of the same gun so it won't taste any better.\" Since when does a waiter not offer to check the syrup/carbonation to make sure the mixture is correct?! How hard is that?!   Brings the second one back to the table. Well, he was right, it was just as nasty as the first one. So when he delivers our food (he never checked back after delivering the second soda to see if it was better) my boyfriend asked for a water because the soda (which he had not drank) didn't taste right. Waiter brings the water. Can you guess what was on our bill? Yep, the unconsumed flat, flavorless soda. Can you guess how much of a tip we gave him?!   Horrible service. He made us feel like we were an inconvenience for deciding to come into the restaurant. Food just isn't good enough to justify dealing with the service. Go to the one on Fish Hatch instead."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  A group of us stopped there on our way back from Chicago for a bite. Unfortunately this was day 4 of a guys trip to watch Gopher hockey so we did not partake in any of their delicious beers. The burger and sandwiches were very good and the service was great. cool place."}
{"text":"I've been The Great Dane a number of times but not to this location. We sat upstairs and the view was absolutely amazing! We could see the whole Madison area and the sunset was beautiful.   I got the Capital Falafel wrap. The falafel was wonderful - perfectly crisp on the outside and delicious on the inside. It was wrapped in a pita with lettuce and onions, all of  which tasted fresh. I was looking forward to the homemade hummus which comes in the wrap, but I honestly couldn't even see the hummus when I opened the pita. I'll have to ask for extra hummus next time. It also comes with a cucumber yogurt dipping sauce which is very mild but could maybe use a bit more flavoring.   Although, the waitstaff, while extremely friendly and on top of things, should be aware that the customers can hear their conversations, chatting, and giggling when they are in their kitchen/prep area. We were sitting in the half-circle booth closest to the kitchen area and I could hear everything they said.  Overall, a good experience and good food."}
{"text":"A great place to remind two old guys of youth. Great draft beers and the German Sausage Plate served some of the best meat I have ever had. The sauerkraut comes out of the can and is nowhere near real German sauerkraut. Otherwise, a fantastic experience for two old guys who can still climb stairs."}
{"text":"Just found out about this location on the East side. Great area, beautiful building. Awesome views of the city, capital, and lakes from the upstairs dining area.   Went for lunch with a big group and didn't hear one complaint. The food was Great. Had a falafel which was just amazing. Others also said the gourmet grilled cheese, fish fry, and green chili were very good. I normally get the fish tacos with the hellfire habanero sauce, IMO the best i've had in Madison. The garlic mussels are also excellent.  I haven't been a huge fan of their beers but, the Peck's Pilsner is a favorite.  Our waitress and service was top-notch! She did an awesome job especially with the large group.  Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Large menu filled with delicious entrees. Quality Wisconsin comfort food. I always try something new and have never been disappointed. Great place for brunch, lunch, dinner or a late night foray.  Huge selection of great beers and other drinks... also a bloody mary bar! WIN! Cozy atmosphere and a great place for families or large groups. Also a nice place to kick back at the bar and watch sports. The building is pretty large so even when it's packed you will never have to wait very long for a table."}
{"text":"Good food and decent beer selection. Personal favorites are the Pub Burger and Pub Wings. I like that this location is always crowded, which often means the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I love their food. I love their atmosphere. I love their service. And I love that I can walk there from my house. Great place to hang out with friends and have drinks."}
{"text":"Great Dane is a local favorite but is highly overrated in my opinion. The food is lackluster.  However, the ambiance is casual and fun. Great venue for large groups."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer.  Nice atmosphere. I like the variety on the menu - American-soups, burgers, wraps, mac & cheese.  Irish items, Mexican- enchiladas tacos.  Also like the 1/2 combo options."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight with a few other people. I was looking forward to it because I hadn't been in a long time and the menu looked delicious. Got there a little before 9 and it wasn't very busy- should have been an indicator on how the night was going to go when it took 10 minutes to get a beer from the bar. When the rest of the group arrived we ordered an appetizer. We never I r that. Our food took at least 45 minutes to come out (we ordered burgers and sandwiches) and was cold when it arrived, but our waitress did not seem to care. Eventually she offered us a free dessert, which was nice, except that it took an additional 25-30 minutes for that to arrive. Overall, the service was very poor and inattentive, and it was hard to judge the food because it came out cold. Would have been a very bad experience if I wasn't in good company."}
{"text":"I have been here about three times. Terrible Service, sub par food. Not a good combination when Madison is thriving with foodie options. If you aren't too picky or in a rush than maybe this place is for you. If you like beer go to Hop Cat off of State Street. I have had a few of the basic food options at this place but, dang, epic fail on all accounts. The nachos are uber gross and look and taste like something fished out of a gutter spout. Did I mention the service? It is non existent. Holy cow, thank god there are a gazillion other options in this town. enough said."}
{"text":"It all started with the flight of beers presented in the wrong order, it should have tipped me off Unnspired beer, overcooked steaks and sloooooow service sum this place up.   I was so disappointed since the menu descriptions were exquisite but the cooks in the kitchen obviously weren't on the same page.   As far as the beer, skip this place and go to your local package store you'll find better flavors.  The only saving Grace was the attentiveness of our waiter."}
{"text":"Crowded, great atmosphere, food is not the best. It's about the only thing in the area though."}
{"text":"Monday dinner with dad. No wait for a table. I needed a beer for a rough day at work. Waitress asked about our likes a brought some samples to choose from. Food came out fast and hot. I had the french dip and dad had the cuban. We split an order of their specialty fries ?Pautine? - YUM!"}
{"text":"Hit the spot spectacularly! Fantastic pretzel with cranberry mustard and cheese sauce too. Had a soup and sandwich for dinner: grilled cheese with tomato mushroom bisque. Wow! Great beer and desert!"}
{"text":"They have several vegetarian options. I have tried all of them and they are all so good I have trouble deciding which one to order. The last time I went with a friend we wanted to play shuffle board and get a bite to eat. The dinning area was full but they sat us at a table right by the shuffle board table so we could eat and play tat the same time. We had a blast. Great beer, tasty food, exceptionally friendly staff. I only wish it was closer to my house! I do prefer this location however. The fish hatchery location is not quite the same and I have had poor luck at that one."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to The Great Dane.  I love their chicken pot pie with cinnamon apples and beer bread.  I also love their potato soup, their Aztec Chicken Wrap, their artichoke dip, etc, etc.  I haven't had a bad meal here yet, and I've been to all their locations.  The food at all their locations seems to be equivalent in quality.    My husband enjoys their beers.  The wait staff at this location have always been pleasant and accommodating.  Service has been good.  I also love the brunch at their Hilldale location, but you'll have to expect a wait if you go for this, as it's popular.  If brunch isn't your thing, they have their late-night menu available to choose from."}
{"text":"The best part about the Dane is the beer garden in summer. There's often a wait during peak hours, but it's worth it.  Since this is a brewpub, I'll say that their beer is decent but not really that exciting.  I like their Scotch ale a lot.  The barleywine is good.  But in a town where we're so spoiled with beer options, there's better out there.  TIp: Most of their beer comes in imperial pints, which are larger than standard pints.  That is why you feel tipsy faster here, isn't it?  Menu is big and diverse, with a lot of veg-friendly fare.  It's a bit overpriced though."}
{"text":"I love the Great Dane because I can have a couple of drinks and get to play pool. Food is good and there is always great service at all of there locations."}
{"text":"I always come here when I am in town! I love love their Mac and cheese and pretzel! I tried their poutine burger. Honestly I would have just gotten the appetizer then the burger. Their root beer is awesome. I had to take a grower of it home. My husband enjoys their house made beer."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here on Friday nights for their fish fry. The baked haddock with couscous is fabulous.  Best I've tasted for baked."}
{"text":"Same wide menu as the other Danes in Madison and everything generally well prepared - and the view is great. The West African chicken stew was great! Wife's Tandoori Chicken was very nice although she's had better Humus. My London Fish was excellent.  Daughter's Bangers & Mash were just OK - She thought the brats were thin skined and slightly dry. Still, we'll be back."}
{"text":"I think \"The Great Dane\" is a pretty decent place, I have had a few drinks there and a meal or two.  Great wait staff as well but it can get very loud.  BUT really I have to say I will not return because of the ridiculous stance they have taken in not serving MillerCoors product.  Agree or disagree with the changes in the state budget but that is just flat out silly."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my family on Sunday afternoon. It had a nice relaxed atmosphere upstairs and down. The food was excellent with many options for side dishes. I took the hostesses recommendation for the Cajun sandwich and that was very good. The other specialty is the macaroni dish which my daughter had and she enjoyed it. They had at least 12 draft beers to choose from and we tried a sample platter with eight. The bacon on my wife's hamburger was crispy the way she likes it. And my sons hamburger was cooked properly - medium rare. All in all the great experience at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Only a handful of things on the menu I'd rather not have again. The cheese curds and Nakoma nachos are great apps. The beers are always consistently good. Never the best I've ever had, but really good over the course of the night.   I keep coming back for a reason. Try the OldGlory APA, the Peck's Pilsner and the Stone of Scone Scotch Ale."}
{"text":"Great beer and solid pub food make this Madison brewpub a go-to for casual bites after work or golf. The burgers are great. Vegetarians can find many choices on the menu. It is also kid friendly."}
{"text":"I've hit all the Great Dane locations was at the east side one today for lunch. Have to say food was a bit off. Had the Baja turkey burger. The guacamole was just not tasty and threw off the taste of the burger.  90% of the time I have had a great food experience. Today not so much. I want to say that you don't expect a home run every time, but if you are going to a restaurant you kind of do expect a home run every time. Otherwise what's the point of going there?  Would have been 4 stars but food not so great today.  Free wifi that's a plus."}
{"text":"I live close and come here all the time. It's hit or miss. If you just wanna drink, the beer here is outstanding. If you want food, come in the middle of the day. The last time I was in there it was about 8 pm, maybe 5 people at the bar, and I think a party going on upstairs. I order a beer and ask for a menu. Bartender pours me a beer then proceeds to ignore me for 20 minutes even though I had a menu sitting right in front of me. The food is decent, just dont expect to get any in the evening."}
{"text":"I used to live in madison and now that we don't anymore whenever we head there this is our place to go. I usually always get one of three things but they are always fantastic. Great beer, good food, ok service. One annoying thing is the parking situation and the bars are pretty tiny. Other than that I recommend it. Keep in mind it is bar food though."}
{"text":"This branch of the Great Dane is in a weird location in the middle of housing developments and fake community areas. But, whatever. Those people need to eat and drink too! Clearly they are not encouraged to drive, however, as the parking lot probably could only handle about 15 - 20% of the building's seating capacity.  At this point, I also feel calling this location \"pub\" is hilarious. It's a massive restaurant. Very banquet-hall feeling in both look and in service.  I came for Easter brunch with my family and the food was good, but the atmosphere was quite lacking. When we arrived for our reservation we had to wait quite a while as \"our\" table was still occupied by the previous reservation. When we were finally led to our seats, there were lots of open tables that would've seated 4 adults and a child, so I'm really unsure why we had to wait 15-20 minutes.  Overall, it was a nice time, but I wasn't particularly feeling it one way or the other. Nice food, pleasant service."}
{"text":"9/2/13 My wife and I stopped in to The Great Dane to celebrate Labor Day.  The space was Cloud Nine's at one time.  I had a magnificent Emerald Isle Stout.  I watched it as it magically settled and savored every drop as I drank it down.  My wife had a Templeton Rye Manhattan.  You can see the capitol from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Really like the appetizers.  There's a few tables upstairs that allow you to pour your own drink."}
{"text":"Tonight was very busy. We waited for our food longer than usual because the kitchen was backed up. We both got the prime rib, baked potato and green beans. It was served on what looked like a large salad plate. After trying to eat for several minutes unsuccessfully (hard to cut a steak when your plate is full of beans and potato) and when the waitress asked how everything was, we complained about how small the plates were. She said they didn't have a dishwasher that night. (They did however have four hostesses, so that's good) But she did bring us each another (larger) plate when asked. Meat was still somewhat of a challenge, mostly because of fat and tendons. Au jus wasn't especially good either."}
{"text":"Larger menu than expected. Good service and great beer. I'm particularly partial to the Scotch Ale."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I was torn between 3 and 4 stars - for one main reason. The Parking. It's horrible. Whoever planned this building area should find a new job. I've been to this location close to a dozen times, and I think I got a spot in their tiny lot once and I was just lucky to be pulling in when someone left. Be prepared to park far away. Not a huge deal when the weather is nice - but a huge pain with a baby in single digits and snow.   That said - the staff here has always been very nice and provide great service. Selection of food and beer is great and I've always enjoyed their food. Upstairs has a nice dining area, 2nd bar area and group room. Very nice place overall - just plan on parking no where near the building whatsoever."}
{"text":"Chose the Great Dane for lunch with my husband and my sister, who was visiting from out of town, as we had a gift card we had received as a gift and always wanted to try this location. Unfortunately, the service ruined our experience here, and we will not be returning. Upon walking into the restaurant, the hostess asked us if there were just going to be three in our party. We replied \"yes-3\". She grabbed menus and when she was seating us outside, realized she had only brought 2 menus with her, so apologized and said she would be back with a third menu. After about 10 minutes, it was clear she wasn't going to bring us another menu, so my husband and I shared, which was fine. The restaurant was not busy at all, so can't see a reason why the hostess would have forgotten to bring us the third menu. After about 10 minutes, a waiter greeted us and asked to take our order. My sister and I decided to split a burger, and my husband went with the Wisconsin Mac & Cheese. After about 20 minutes, a different server brought the burger out and asked if we needed anything else. We told her my husband had ordered a mac & cheese and was waiting on that. The waitress looked confused and said she would go check on that. Initially, I waited to eat the burger, as I'd wanted to wait for my husband so we could all eat together, however, after about 5 minutes, and our waiter stating that it would still be a few minutes on the mac & cheese, we decided to eat our burger or it would get cold. About 15 minutes after we got the burger, my husband finally received his order. I asked the waiter if he could please bring us a bottle of ketchup from inside (I don't like eating ketchup that has been sitting out in the sun, and have gotten sick from that before). He looked upset and instead of going through w/my request, which would have taken him about 5 seconds, he instead replied \"Oh. No-it hasn't been sitting out here long. Maybe just like 2 hours\" and walked away. It took about 20 minutes after my husband had finished eating his meal (and about 45 minutes after my sister and I had finished ours) for us to finally get the bill. Again, don't really understand, as the restaurant was not busy at all. When we finally did get our bill, we noticed there was an additional charge for my sister and I splitting a burger. While I don't agree with this policy, I understand some restaurants have it, but would have appreciated being told of this additional charge by our waiter, or having it noted somewhere on the menu, which it was not. The food was very average, the menu isn't anything special, and the prices are on the high side, but my husband and I will not be returning due to the terrible service we received while here, which ruined our whole experience. There are many other restaurants in the area that are far more deserving of our business."}
{"text":"Date of my visit: 24-March-2018 Time of my visit: Dinner Total bill (with tax, but not including tip): $32.08  My girlfriend's ice hockey team wanted to come here for dinner.  They placed us upstairs, by combining a bunch of tables together.  There still was not enough room for all of us.  My girlfriend and I decided to split the appetizer, so we ordered Old Glory Cheese Curds to share.  They were alright, a bit over cooked, but not burned, which, I thought, was interestingly weird.  For our main courses, my girlfriend ordered Chicken Pot Pie and I ordered Texarkana Burger (no cheese).  It did not take all that long for our food to come out, which I was a bit surprised that it was relatively quick (a very good thing!), given the size of the party.  My girlfriend enjoyed her Chicken Pot Pie.  My burger on another hand had some issues...  I usually order my meat medium rare, it came out medium...  I understand that some place can't/won't cook anything medium rare and that's fine, but just let me know.  The chips, it came with, on the other hand, were pretty good!  Overall a C+ experience!  I would try it again!"}
{"text":"The Pros:  -Tons of seating! Came here at 5:30pm on a Friday -- no wait! -Large menu with tons of options & a great fish fry -Open late w/ late night menu! -Their house brew IPA is great.  The Cons: -Brunch is just....not good. Skip it and head to one of the million other Madison brunch spots. -Very, very loud. -Pricey."}
{"text":"The fourth star is just for the variety.  The food is decidedly 3 stars--average and overly salty.   The number one thing anyone thinking of eating at any Great Dane should know is that the cheese curds are fake. I mean, the cheese is real, but it's the wrong kind of cheese. Wrong breading, and (grasping chest) wrong dipping sauce!!!  True Wisconsin cheese curds are served with ranch dressing. These had some kind of horseradish dip. Now don't get me wrong, they were tasty--they just aren't the real deal. You'll need to go downtown for the true experience (Paradise and Caribou are the first to come to mind).   Rest of the meal, as with the other locations I've visited, was just ok. Not so bad to make you wish you hadn't ordered it, but wonder if you should have chosen the other dish you were deciding between."}
{"text":"Solid choice for groups.  Their menu is really big (almost overly so) which suit many peoples cravings.    The beers are, well, lacking.   But that's just me.  And I'm a snob.  So my opinion doesn't count too much.  I got the sampler of 6 beers.   Our attentive server was very kind and didn't seem to mind us lingering at our table, since it wasn't busy.  This location has a huge upstairs, which was being set up for a private party.  Again, this would definitely be a great location to hold a get together.  If you're a beer snob, you may want to go elsewhere though."}
{"text":"I went for trivia the other night.  I put my name in for a table and noticed an open booth.  I asked the hostesses if I could be seated there.  They said yes but then did nothing.  It took them nearly ten minutes to seat us and then we never even received menus.  The hostesses were not busy.  In fact, the hostesses at this location tend to just social with each other most of the time.    When we finally sat down, the service was slow.  Yeah, it was trivia night.  But come on.  Check on us occasionally.  Maybe it was a busy night and things fell through the cracks.  Maybe not.  I dropped them a star because I tried their Apple Crumble.  It was pretty awful.  It was REALLY cold.  They took it right out of the fridge and served it.  The crumble was described as a granola topping.  It more like streusel or coffee cake.  For $5.50 and I expected a burst of flavor in my mouth.  The only thing I got was a sad, cold whimper.   I would skip the pie and try another dessert."}
{"text":"I came to Wisconsin for cheese and beer.  I found both.  Not disappointed in your great state.  But really, I came to Wisconsin for work and Great Dane was recommended to me by a local friend.  The beer was pretty good and I was so excited for the poutine.  I also ordered the Asian salad with seared tuna - probably not the best ordering decision I've ever made, as he put it - you ordered a salad.  At a bar.  With a non local fish.   Ok, you got me there.  I was tryna be healthy since we were eating fried potatoes with cheese curds and gravy on top!  I'm sure the other more typical bar food was much better.  Service was fine and location is great - close to the waterfront and right in downtown Madison."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place - it is a representative of Madison!  All locations are great, but our favorite is the East side location - we love to sit upstairs and look at the view."}
{"text":"The service was good, but the fish fry was WAY over priced. My husband got 3 small pieces of perch and fries for $14. The coleslaw had no flavor. I'm left wondering if this is just a chef issue since we have had fairly decent food here in the past."}
{"text":"We went for dinner tonight, it was my first time.  It is nice inside, but I don't know what all the hype is about I will never go back. I got the Cajon chicken sandwich,  it was the worst sandwich I ever had."}
{"text":"I was with a party of four just after noon on a Sunday.  The restaurant was moderately busy and we sat at a nice booth in the bar area which suited me fine.  Our server was moderately polite but sounded like a loud robot with the menu and choices and never smiled once. Last time we were there we had a much better server and I tipped accordingly.  i ordered a lighter bock type beer and bloody and both were great.  The rest of the drinks were sodas. The food was acceptable...not bad and not great.  The three burgers were big and my omelette was fine.   I have been at this Dane twice and will continue to return as I like the location, atmosphere and beer with acceptable food  for the price."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday morning (11:00 am)  It was early so it wasn't busy at all.  The dining room was clean and stylish and the waitstaff was friendly .  The parking lot is small. There is street parking.  We choose to sit upstairs based on other reviews, it's worth all the stairs.  The food was really good.  My husband ordered a Bloody Mary.  I took a couple of drinks and couldn't get past how super spicy it was but he liked it."}
{"text":"The vegetarian options are present, but mediocre at best. I resent having to pay extra for a Boca burger - they are boring and  just aren't that good - and none of the other veg options are any more exciting. Twenty years ago their beer seemed like a revelation, but now there are much better brewers in the area, too."}
{"text":"Came here with the family for dinner.  Had the poutine for a starter, which was pretty good.  I will note that the fries here are different than the Great Dane in Fitchburg, and honestly, those fries make their poutine a little better.   The group had burgers, sandwiches and a salad.  The salad was overdressed, but otherwise the rest of our meals were else good.  The waitress stopped by once to check in drinks, when we were pretty much done.  She also didn't bother with a pen to sign the check.  Thanks.  Kinda disappointed by the mediocrity of the service tonight."}
{"text":"Feel like this place is a little underrated on here. I got Tara's Cajun Chicken and it was delicious with just the right spice. Beer was pretty good and the brownie was amazing."}
{"text":"We stopped at this location of Great Dane on our way home from the Dells.  My husband and I started by sharing the Brown Ale Onion soup.  It was a good size for us to share.  Next we both ordered burgers.  I had the Dane Burger.  The artichoke dip was outstanding.  My husband enjoyed his burger (although I can't remember which one he got).  He also tried two beers:  Old Glory American Pale Ale and the Imperial IPA.  He enjoyed both.  We stayed for a few rounds of pool and hit the road but we'll be back next time we're in town.  I could see this being a regular hangout for us if we lived nearby."}
{"text":"We felt like dinner out.  The Great Dane is convenient plus we've had positive experiences here in the past.  Tonight we were seated upstairs.  Thank goodness because its much quieter up than down.  Saturday is prime rib night so I ordered the 10 ounce size.  My wife ordered chicken pot pie.  Our server, Katrina, did a fine job.  The prime rib was good, not exceptional but good.  It was a good value for the price.  Kathy's pot pie was also good.  She asked for a second pretzel roll.  She's a bread junkie and one smallish roll just wasn't sufficient.  I felt like having a sweet finish so I had the Mason jar lemon cheesecake.  It was served with a berry sauce and a crunchy oats topping.  I would not have missed the oats.  The cheesecake was just right.  Adequate lemon, not syrupy sweet.  And, again, a good value.  Yup, we'll return."}
{"text":"I love The Great Dane!    As a Madison local, I have frequented The Dane over the last 10 years of my life and have always been satisfied with their service, their food, and their atmosphere.    The Great Dane is a local chain, with 3 restaurants in Madison- all in excellent locations (downtown, Hilldale Mall & on a hill on the east side that gives views of downtown Madison and the lakes).    At the newly opened east side establishment we were seated by the large windows on the 3rd floor and had the best view of Madison that I have ever seen.    Having never tried a Reuben in my life (I know, I am shameful) I decided to try my luck at The Dane.  It was excellent.  They serve it on toasted marble rye with thousand island on the side for dipping.  Drool worthy.    What an excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"Arrogant and inflexible: Just had a bad experience. Asked for what I thought was a reasonable substitution, even offered to pay a substantial upcharge, but they refused.  I'd rather patronize a restaurant that wants to be open to their customers wants."}
{"text":"I have been to this Great Dane location a few times and it was always decent. Never 5 stars but always an option out of the very few in the area. Today I called in and ordered the Pub Wings with the Jamaican Jerk sauce-my favorite. Unfortunately what I got today was quite the opposite. I received some overly battered/breaded wings tossed in the sauce. Usually they aren't breaded or if they are it's lightly done and delicious! I still decided to go ahead and eat them but then they were salty and barely edible. Maybe they had a new chef tonight or maybe they changed the recipe-who knows! What I do know is that I probably won't be going back :("}
{"text":"Good food, good service, nice employees, fast service on the cheese curds. Nice clean place"}
{"text":"Came here a couple times this summer and had a so-so experience.  Great food in a nice building and great beer selection..but that's where it ends. The bartender downstairs that served us was pretty rude to me and my friend at different times. Never had that before anywhere. Sarcastic when answering a question and zero people skills or charisma.  Just a jerk.  Then the other time, sat upstairs at the bar where there was a really nice vibe. But when we asked the bartender if they could turn on the Brewer game, she forgot and was reminded 1 or 2 more times, but it never came on.  Not the greatest service either.  Incredible food though."}
{"text":"Came in here around 9 on a Friday.  It was busy but we were able to sit at the bar.  I'm just going to go down a quick list here:  1. The bartenders were super nice and ready to answer questions despite the fact it was busy. 2. The bar clientele skewed young--like college kids which is weird because-- 3. It's not cheap.  You're in $15 for most entrees and beers are another $6 or so. 4. Because it skewed young it was really noisy and people were sloppy with drink spillage and knocking into tables and stuff--amateur hour. 5. The food was surprisingly good.  I had shrimp and grits my dining partner had the fish tacos.  No complaints at all about the food. 6. The beer was good.  I had the Scotch Ale and the Emerald Isle Stout, my dining partner had the non-German Pilsner.   7. Large space with an upstairs.  There were darts and pool because people kept asking for darts and balls.  I'm sure I'd go back if I find myself in Madison again."}
{"text":"Returned to the Dane after their kitchen fire and was disappointed. Fruit flies everywhere. Seriously, we were swatting them away from our food. Service was ok. Not overly attentive, not overly friendly. We ordered an appetizer and food and everything came out at once. There was food splattered on the sides of the booths and a general lack of care displayed.   Between the fruit flies, dirty booths, and the kitchen fire... We won't be back. They need to clean!"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for Mother's Day this year. Reservation was easy and got seated within 5-10 minutes of showing up. (We got there about 20 minutes before our reservation!) so far so good. First problem I had was that there were four flights of stairs to go up to our seats, which is odd for a restaurant but it was fine, for me at least, for my parents and grandfather on the other hand, was probably a bit more rough. Anyways, had to walk to the other end of the building for the buffet. Keep in mind this buffet was a little over $24 a person. The selection of food was great for brunch! However the food itself, not so good. Over cooked, dry, tasteless or just gross. The only thing worth the price was the selection, and the food would have also been worth the price if it was at least decent! I wasn't expecting perfection for a buffet but at least edible! A few years ago, we remember good food at the Fitchburg location, so was hoping for a good experience at the madison location, however, will not be going back."}
{"text":"We came here for Easter Brunch because a Google search seemed to suggest that this was the place to go in Madison, and I can't search by Easter brunch on Yelp.  I tried making reservations here a couple of days before but was told they were all booked but they would have a few spots by the bar for walk-ins. The hostess reminded me that they opened at 9am on Easter. Okay, that seemed to be a good sign that their Easter brunch was popular enough to open an hour early AND they were all booked.   Well, Google fails, because the brunch was unbelievably disappointing. For $25, I expected way better. They had a carving station, a salad bar, other hot entrees like scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, cheesy potato hash, etc. But the bacon was overly greasy, the lettuce wilty, the chicken medallion dry. Out of all their offerings, the best was their biscuits and gravy and chicken tenders. The carving station was serviceable - they had ham, lamb, and prime rib, and the lamb wasn't bad. For dessert, they a variety of pies, and cookies. I chose a lemon meringue, which was still not quite thawed when I took a bite.   It really felt like they thought they could get away with a subpar offering and charge an arm and a leg just because it's Easter. I'm not a fan of any business that does that."}
{"text":"My first time at this location and I was disappointed in the food. I had the chicken and waffles, waffles were soggy and the whole dish was bland and soggy. My sister had the quiche of the day and she said hers was very good and it was a large portion. They make a very good Bloody Mary and don't go overboard with the garnishes.  Their beer list is very good and their homes brews are great, I recommend the Crop Circle Wheat. If they seat you on the second floor there is a great view of Madison and the Capital and all the booths face the window so every booth and table has a view. I will probably try them again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This is my favorite of all of the Great Dane locations because of the view! It would be a great restaurant for prom goers. I had my graduation party hosted here in the upstairs room. The staff was friendly and clearly prepared to handle the massive UW-Madison graduation crowd and special reservations that day. Everything was prepared well and everybody enjoyed their meal. The mac & cheese was the favorite of the day. There are separate bathrooms upstairs so our party didn't have to worry about walking downstairs to use the loo."}
{"text":"I have been to several Danes in town.  I use to live within walking distance of the Hilldale location, so this is kind of a comparison between the two...sorry.  The food in both locations has been very good.  I order the large nachos with chicken for take out quite often and they are consistently good.  I am also a big fan of the California Turkey Club sandwich.  The fish tacos are usually pretty good.  My old roomie gets their wings and is a fan of those as well. The mozzarella and tomato salad is pretty great too. Oh, and let's not forget the Prime Rib on Saturday evenings....it tends to be outstanding.  The beers at the Dane are good as long, but don't ask for a Coors Light (had out of towners ask for one once...it was kind of funny).  I like their Scotch Ale and they often have a seasonal or specialty beer that will hit the spot.  The building/space set up and staff is a big difference.  Hilldale has a better set up for me, a larger more spacious, open bar area as compared to the Eastside.  The staff at Hilldale also appears to be more professional.  I am all for fun, but when, on multiple occasions, I have to wait for service because the bartender is doing a shot with customers, that will lose you a star.  I would say that as long as you are coming for dining room, you are probably okay.  And I don't want to sound like the old man yelling to get off my lawn, but service still matters to me."}
{"text":"I have been to multiple Great Dane locations in Madison, and now I find myself within walking distance of this particular one.  In comparison to every other Dane in Madison, this one seems to have the best service. I'm not going to lie, the Great Dane restaurants in Madison are very very popular. But I seem to enjoy myself a little more than the others.  Tuesday night is the best time to come. They have trivia starting  around 7, and have appetizer specials.   This Dane separates itself from the others also because it offers a Mug Club. This club is a very elite group that allows you to bring in your own mug and they charge you a regular size beer price to fill it.  Now...I did say it is elite. Currently, there is a waiting list to get in the club, so make sure you get your name on the list asap!  If you come between 4-7 parking is a issue sometimes, so be prepared to park on the road and walk.  They also offer pool & shuffle board at this location as well!"}
{"text":"Good (but not great).  The beer is hit-or-miss but there is usually a wide range of options of Great Dane brews to chose from.  Best one recently was an Abbey Triple which clocked in at about 11.5%.  The food is quite varied and, like so many brew-pubs tries a bit too hard.  Best choices are to stick with the more traditional side of the menu (burgers, fries, cheese, pretzels, etc.).  They have a good fish-fry on Fridays as well."}
{"text":"I've been to Great Dane three times now since moving to Madison in May. It's conveniently close to my place so I can't help myself. I think if Great Dane wasn't so close to my apartment, I would very rarely visit it. Nothing there stands out as amazing. The whole experience feels very average to me. There are many amazing pubs and brewing companies in Madison. Great Dane just feels like it is sort of middle of the road.  The East Side location has indoor, floor, and upstairs seating with plenty of activities such as darts and pool to pass the time. The pub servers Great Dane beer, of course so there will be plenty to go around.  I am personally a dark, Scotch, and brown ale drinker. Sadly Great Dane delivers a mediocre stout and an above average Scottish ale. Nothing I have had so far on their beer list has wowed me. I am always trying new beers so if this ever changes I will post an update.  The food is stereotypical pub food and nothing innovative is going on here. The cheese curds are served VERY hot, have heavy breading, and the cheese doesn't taste fresh. I love cheese curds, but I don't think these are worth ordering unless you are desperate or want something better than Culver's...  I've had multiple sandwiches and burgers at Great Dane. Nothing was wrong with them, but there was nothing outstanding about them. The ingredient quality just seems kind of meh. Nothing special really to eat here."}
{"text":"I am always amused when we get seated at a restaurant and have to wait long enough for the server to know exactly what we want for dinner just to have them come by and be in complete shock that, not only do we know what we want to drink, but we have our dinner order all ready to go as well.  Apparently there was some sort of mix-up tonight and I believe the person who took our order wasn't actually our assigned server.  Still, not enough to ruin dinner for us.  It happens.  Great Dane has been pretty consistent for us lately, likely in part to the fact we generally eat early before the standard dinner rushes.  Service has been good, food is generous and tasty.  And it's nice that this location found a restaurant with staying power.  Entree prices seem reasonable but the appetizer prices are sure up there.  Saw one appetizer on the menu for $12.25.  That is what I'd expect to pay for a chicken entree.  I'm not in the restaurant biz, but it just seems apps should be between $5-$8.  Or maybe I'm living in the past!"}
{"text":"Lunch visit. Service was good and view of Downtown Madison is hard to beat from upstairs but food was lousy and overpriced. Grilled cheese on bread so hard and crusty it didn't chew,  just kind of became shrapnel in mouth. Had hardly any cheese either. Equally bad tomato soup - watery thin broth with few veggies. Aunt enjoyed Reuben Sandwich but rest of table was equally unimpressed."}
{"text":"This is always a must stop when we are in Wisconsin. The beer is really great and a good variety. My husband always gets this specific burger, pretty sure he would make love to it if he could lol.."}
{"text":"The Dane is solid. I've been to this locations many many times and particularly like it for it's upstairs dinning area. You get a lovely view of Lake Monona and the Capitol, and they have huge booths.  The menu has some absolute gems that any human with taste buds will enjoy, such as: Sara B's Beet Salad Chimichurri ranch steak salad Mediterranean plate Chicken potpie Inner warmth peanut stew  I could go on, but I'll stop there. A solid choice of dinner or lunch. I haven't been to brunch at this location, but if it's anything like their other locations, also a huge win. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Its not often that I sit down in a restaurant and am completely torn about what to order because so much sounds so good.  But decide I did and I was not disappointed.  My husband and the kids all loved their meals and the food was served in a reasonable amount of time.  The restaurant also offered many different seating options from outdoor to tables and booths and was not cramped which is a really nice thing when you are dining with 4 kiddos!  The next time we are in town we'll visit again for sure."}
{"text":"The East Side Great Dane is preferable to other Madison locations, particularly Hilldale or Fitchburg. The service was good and I thought the quality of food was a bit better at this location.  Also, the views from the second story of this location are really pretty spectacular, particularly on a clear evening when you will get a great view of the Madison skyline.    My only complaint with this visit was the screeching child in the booth next to us... of course this really isn't the restaurants fault - if I had screeched like that, I would have been banished to the care and barred from family outing for months... Thankfully the little screecher exited the building with it's parental units pretty quickly after our arrival.  Our \"server\" - the Great Dane has no waitresses or waiters was very pleasant and attentive.    It was potpie weather and I thoroughly enjoyed my chicken potpie. It came with a side of warm seasoned apples - sort of like apple sauce - pre sauce and a little pretzel roll.  Who doesn't like a little pretzel role."}
{"text":"The food was good, not great. There wasn't really anything special. The service as well could have been better. My husband and brother n law each had 2 beers. But I couldn't get a water refill to save my life. We ordered cheese curds as an appetizer. It was a bit skimpy for the price. Overall it was good. I just expected more. I don't think I will go back. Just not my cup of tea ."}
{"text":"The Great Dane is one of the few places I always recommend to out of towners. We've eaten at all the Madison locations, have done dinner, Sunday brunch, Mother's Day brunch buffet, special catered work events. The food is consistently high quality and you know whatever you order is going to be great."}
{"text":"For real. It is Christmas day. We are here with friends having a good time. Playing dice and just relaxing. It's a goddamn bar, and we for real just got yelled at because we were laughing too loud and making too much noise playing bar dice. It's a bar. And it's Christmas. This place is too hoity toity nose in the air and rigid and stuck up for anyone that would want to have a good time. Instead, we would rather listen to shitty music in a bunch of old people bitching about taxes.  It's a f'n BAR!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Dane never disappoints and now they have an east side location! The food is just as good as the other locations, the fresh beer is brewed at the downtown location and brought over, so its always fresh! The Friday fish fry is one of my personal favorites, although the original pub burger is always my fallback! The wait can be a major issue, as they don't take reservations over the phone so you have to come in person to get on the list. This makes for some very crowded situations. An hour and a half wait sometimes, really? At least they have a full shuffleboard table to help pass the time and lots of tvs."}
{"text":"Very nice place for a happy hour. The beers on tap are great. Food is also great. Service is also awesome and you can get also free popcorn. It just needs a little bit more variety on the menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here on the way home from a business trip on the recommendation of a friend.  I am REALLY glad we did! I had the Brat and Bacon Pretzel Burger.  It was juicy and Delicious.  ...One of the best burgers I have ever had...and I have had a lot of burgers. As a side I had the plantains.  They were a nice break from the norm and a sweet complement to the flavor of the burger. My wife had the Smothered and Covered Fried Chicken.  She only let me have one bite, but I must say it was phenomenal.  She ate the rest before I could steal anymore. My only complaint about our visit was that there isn't a location closer to our home.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"5/21/2016  Arrived at 5:30pm put in our order at 5:45.  At 7:15pm they start serving a table that was seated at 6:15pm.  The food comes out around 7:25pm and it's lukewarm and the fries were cold.  We were told like 3 times it would be a little longer.  On two occasions our drinks took 20 minutes because the bartender had \"stepped away\".  Twice!  The cheese on my wife's sandwich is hard and my prime rib tasted like cafeteria roast beef, it was cold and chewing.  They comped us our drinks but it was horrible.  We will never eat there again.  It was my son's 17th birthday meal.  The table next to us got a free desert for their birthday, we got ignored.  Save your money and go to McDonalds.  $50.00 for plates of cold food after an hour and a half wait with no explanation.  Avoid the not so great dane."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch after the Madison Half Marathon.  First off, was a bit disappointed to only have a small menu available on a Sunday for 'brunch'.  We were seated upstairs with nice views all around.   Ordered a standard burger with a beer but for a side tried the fried plantains.   The plantains were tasty but could have been fried a bit harder.   The burger was a standard puck and small (1/3 oz) but was seasoned well and had the right crispy bacon on it.  The beer itself was great - went for an imperial IPA which reminded me of Hopslam.   I liked it so much I took a growler home.  It's a fine place to grab a brew or a sandwich but I wouldn't expect gourmet."}
{"text":"Good pub and restaurant. Great service at the bar. Had the buffalo sustain burger. Very tasty.   Beers are good and many options of their own brews."}
{"text":"Great place. Have been here many times since they opened. Favorite dishes are the fish fry, tandori cicken and the chicken pot pie. Beers are mostly excellent with rotating seasonals.  I would give it a 5 if the parking was better. Tip: have a friend drive and drop you off at the front door."}
{"text":"We had an excellent Friday night at the Great Dane! The beer and food, as always, was wonderful.  Our server, Cassie, was amazing! We will be back! Our favorite dishes include the Mayan Chicken Wrap, the Beef Baja Burger, the Mac n Cheese, and the cheese curds. The Scotch Ale Rocks! Bring back the Buffalo Chicken Wing Flatbread Pizza; it used to be on the menu at the downtown location!"}
{"text":"From Chicago and was recommended this place for a big group. We had no trouble finding seating and it was nice and quiet on a Sunday night!  Be prepared to give yourself at least twenty minutes to pick your food and drinks - it is huge!   FOOD: I was suspicious about how good it would be since they had so many different foods from different cuisines, but my friend got a Thai dish that was delicious! All the soups were also pretty good. I had wanted time get the smothered chicken but they ran out so I got one of the burgers that I didn't think was too special.  LOVED the cheap beer prices and the beer flight options. Service was good too but it also wasn't very busy."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with friends on a trip to northwest Wisconsin.  It was a pretty solid experience - good food, good beer, and even the building itself was interesting.  I really appreciated that there were so many options for sides.  I thought the fried plantains were amazing.  The cole slaw and fries were also good, but I found the cous cous to be pretty disappointing.  I've never been in the Madison area, so I don't know how the prices compare to the area, but they seemed a little high to me.  Nothing unreasonable, especially since portion sizes were quite fair for the price.  I just would prefer to pay less for a little less food while keeping the quality the same.  Not giving the 5th star because nothing really blew me away, but don't let that stop you from stopping in sometime."}
{"text":"The brunch at the Great Dane is quite impressive and it also took my by surprise. I've always been pleased with the dinner menu, and the view of the downtown Capital is extraordinary. But, I tried the brunch for the first time today and the waffles were to die for. Melted in my mouth. I also had a bite of my aunts huevos rancheros which were delightful."}
{"text":"Madison local hang spot. They had some mean fish tacos when I was going there, if they still have them on the menu check 'me out."}
{"text":"Really should have been 5 stars all along. The Dane is a solid, reliable place to get a delicious, cold beer or cider and a yummy meal. Are they perfect? No, but in the grand scheme of things they don't deserve a drop in their rating over such small complaints. If anyone asks me where to go eat, my list always includes my favorite standby, the Dane. They do it right every time. We've tried macaroni and cheese at a lot of other restaurants and you know what? No one comes close. The second best option is when you buy the giant pan of macaroni and cheese from Costco and add about a cup of milk before baking, then chop up some scallions and tomatoes, throw on some panko breadcrumbs at the end of baking, and have some Frank's hot sauce on the table. As far as we're concerned the Dane puts all other restaurants' macaroni and cheese to shame -- even that Mac's place out in Sun Prairie, which did not do it for me. I'd rather eat at Noodles -- but I always get something else when I go there! Go to the Dane. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I have been here about 10-15 times.  Never had bad service and to be honest the service has been better than most restaurants that I have been to in the Madison area. I live very close to this Great Dane and can actually walk there.  I have visited the Great Dane a few times downtown and once in Hilldale.  All were great.   The food is spectacular. I typically get something differen each time I go just because they have so much on there menu that I want to try it all. Best time to go is on the weekend. Try there Friday Fish fry or their Sunday Brunch.  My favorite entree thus far is their Steak with potatoes. They also have good hamburger which you can never go wrong with.  I'm a wine drinker however I've tried their beer and it's good too. The atmosphere is pretty cool. Pool tables, darts, bar, etc. The one on the East side had an amazing view of downtown. Can't beat it. And I believe all of them have rooms for party if that is the route you need to go.  I've rented the semi private room at Hilldale and it was perfect for what we needed it for.   I highly recommend giving this place a shot. You can't go wrong. Enjoy!!  And don't forgot to purchase yourself a souvenir (pint glass). :-)"}
{"text":"The good: - Cajun Chicken Sandwich had an appropriate combination of kick and flavor - Vodka Lemonade and house brews are very solid - Plenty of outdoor seating  The not so good: - We picked the sunnier side because I love the warmth but we got a very lopsided table - I was going to ask for a different table but none of the open tables had been cleared - Server was adequate but didn't give her name and had to be prompted about refilling drinks  All-in-all, the food was very good, which is the most important aspect for me. The building is great and vibe inside good as well."}
{"text":"Booked the \"large\" meeting room for a recent lunch meeting.  Booking was easy, and the room cost was reasonable when purchasing food and drink.  The room includes a screen, however, the computer hook-up is on the side of the room, so the presenter cannot stand at the front.    Requested seating for a max 20 people, and it was set-up for 19.  Even after adding 2 more tables, the 15 attendees complained the space was too small, and it was hard to hear the presentation with the eating.  It was tight!    The food was good, and the service was great.  The staff did a good job refilling drinks and tending to everyone, even during the presentation.  At one point I had to close the door, because the kitchen was loud, and it was interfering with the sound in the room, but never had an issue with the waitstaff.    The location is great, however, I can't imagine ever needing such a small room again.  Make sure you see it before booking!  And anticipate you will not be able to fit 2-3 people per table (as they suggest)."}
{"text":"Food (Asian wings, Chicken salad, and Cajan sandwich) and beer were good but the prices were a little high for the amount of food. Quality was decent, nothing out of this world. The service that we received from Lacey was some of the worst that we have ever had. Took forever for her to great us, didn't refill drinks, was snobby when she asked questions (\"Is she done with that?\" When the plate had a napkin covering it with the tableware in top making it clear that it could be taken away.), slapped the check down after her rude \"did you save any room for anything else\", and when she returned with the card, slapped it down once again and rudely said \"thanks\". If the food and beer weren't good we wouldn't even think of coming back to this place."}
{"text":"The overwhelming impression of our meal here was how darn cold we all were from the overblown AC on the top floor. Really it wasn't that hot outside.   Anyway, the food here was decent. The fried cheese curds were average but the jerk pork tacos were quite tasty. Others in our group liked their meals but again their taste buds may have been frozen!    On the plus side the old fashion was well made and the service was good."}
{"text":"It's usually fairly busy because it's the only place in that area. I went here during March Madness time and had a very poor experience, if you want to watch a game other than a Wisconsin game, plan on going somewhere else - even if your team's game is just finishing up. I decided to give it a couple more tries. During those tries, it was just average. If I'm in the area and other people want to go, I'll go. Otherwise it's not somewhere I go out of the way for. If you really want to go to a Great Dane, go downtown."}
{"text":"A promising place in Madison to hangout and have fun ... Enjoy a good game of pool or shuffleboard while chugging a good beer from their menu.... Haven't had many food items on their menu but the cheese curds are top notch."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. We shared a bowl of the West African Chicken Peanut Stew. The stew was good but lacked some of the seasoning and spices you'd expect when you think West African.   I got the Cubano sandwich with pub fries. The sandwich was good. The bread was fresh and it was a good sized sandwich. The fries, however, were disappointing. They appeared to be frozen fries and tasted like it. Where's the hand-cut fries?   They have a lot of outdoor seating, which is great. And they also have shuffleboard! Definitely a fun spot to hang out."}
{"text":"We arrived the week they opened, and were very pleased. We were just there for a beer and some dessert. They were generous and helpful helping pick out a beer from an extensive and wonderful selection. Reservations would be a good idea."}
{"text":"It's a really nice interior to the place, but parking isn't convenient.  The food is good, but it's pricey. Same with the drinks.  A $9 margarita?  Seriously?  And it was 99% ice?  The cheese curds were not made fresh. They're from a bag. For a place this nice, in Wisconsin, for the price they charge--that's unforgivable."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff. I really dig the variety on the menu, especially the \"Daily Naan\" option! My one small problem with the Great Dane is that their bar doesn't have a blender...sad... During the summer they have a beautiful terrace to sit out on that I'd love to pair with a blended drink! Overall, I think this is the best location."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer, food, selection, and service! We stopped on the way from Chicago to the Cities and were really impressed. I highly recommend this place--nice patio and not too far off the highway, and even independent of those things this restaurant would have been a treat."}
