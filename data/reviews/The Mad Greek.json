{"text":"I just had a very delicious lunch from Mad Greek, it's unfortunate that so many other people's experiences were lacking... I must admit though my company ordered out, and it seems a lot of complaints were about the service. As for the food being inedible? Luckily what I had was pretty damn good, everyone else in my office seemed to enjoy their meals as well.

I ordered the curried veggie wrap with tabouli as my side- it tasted like simosa filling in a whole wheat wrap, awesome! Now I'ill admit the bottom was a bit oily- but I expect that from something that's curried and has been sitting in a box (our office is 20 minutes from the restaurant). A couple dabs with my napkin and I was good to go- and my food was still hot! The tabouli was delicious, very filling, maybe could have used a little less feta, but that's just me. My lunch cost $9.50 and I have a ton of leftovers. 

I would definitely order from here again, though the other reviews have scared me enough that I'm not sure if I'd dine in... We'll see."}
{"text":"The food was alright though -vastly- over priced. There are better, cheaper, Greek restaurants within a few miles, go to one of them."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I have had in a long time. The gyro was so salty I could only eat 1/3 of it before my tongue started to feel burned from the excessive salt. My mojito was made with gin for some reason. The bartender was rude: he swore in front of us (yelled \"shit\" at the register multiple times), checked his phone at least 3 times while working, never refilled water or asked if we needed anything. The bar itself is poorly designed and incredibly uncomfortable to sit at. There is no space to have your legs actually under the table while you sit. The temperature of the establishment was warm and humid. I was wearing a thin, summer dress and was sweating before my food arrived. My husband got a side of tabouleh with his dish that he said was good? I'm sure there are things on the menu that aren't terrible but we will never be back. There are too many options in the neighborhood to settle for such horrible service and lackluster food."}
{"text":"Great Greek food!! 

I'm afraid to try the Indian and would rather go to one of the many Indian food only restaurants around the area. 

However, there are not many Greek restaurants in the Cleveland area, and no others in the University Circle area, so coming here was a treat.

It is was an excellent place for a romantic date or even an intimate dinner with a good friend."}
{"text":"Here for lunch, Luna's full, alone, good falafel sandwich, pleasant staff, nice music, I keep forgetting how much I have enjoyed the past meals here, I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"A great place to go for wonderful Greek and Indian food. The ambiance is interesting and pleasant, and the meals are always great. Love the Samosas and Spanikopita appetizers."}
{"text":"I only give this restaurant two stars for the atmosphere/ambiance. We sat on the patio on a beautiful Friday evening. Nice flowers, music and \"water feature.\" The service was terrible. We almost died of thirst waiting for our drink order. I ordered one of the entree specials and it was flavorless! Three out of the four of us were not impressed with our entrees. Getting the bill was like pulling teeth. Maybe it was just a fluke bad night, but our first visit was not good. I have no desire to return!"}
{"text":"Went last weekend for Groupon.
First time there.

Decoration is nice, host was friendly, server was friendly too.

Food took forever to come, by the time they came, the appertizer sampler was bit cold.

Greek salad is mostly just spinach and lettuce and $7.00.

Main courses were average and of course, took a while to serve.

Dessert, we order tiramisu, we couldn't finish 1 slice. Very dry.  
The only restaurant that we couldn't finish a dessert.

I sent an email to the management, no offense wording either, but got YELLED back.

Never going back again."}
{"text":"This place really went down hill after the original owner moved on to the afterlife. Ate dinner there the other day, ordered the surf and turf special. Big mistake. The \"steak\" resembled the Salisbury Steak variety from a crap lunch line. The turf was a rubbery slab of Tilapia. After complaining a few times we did get the meal taken off our bill, which was a fair trade since I didn't even take a bite. The manager was courteous enough to do his best to remedy the situation. After a series of these mishaps, I can confidently say that I will not be back. Jacked up prices and sized down portions is great for the restaurant, but pure shit for the customer."}
{"text":"Terrible food!  I was so excited to try greek food at this restaurant hoping for the great quality I had in Texas.  This food was terrible! The chicken pita tasted like lime and was mostly flavorless.  Will never go again.  CHOOSE ALADDIN'S!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with my wife and it was a very average experience. Got a gyro and my wife got the butter chicken.  Wouldn't go back or recommend it."}
{"text":"My husband took me to this restaurant for my birthday. I was excited as I love Greek food, but admit I am picky as my grandparents immigrated from Greece. Service was awful. The server did not know the menu and rarely came over to check on us. The food was very Americanized. My husband ordered a plate that was supposed to contain artichokes, but had brussels sprouts instead. We asked the waiter if they had run out of artichokes, and he said, no those are a new type of artichoke.  Completely lied to us. Save your money for one of the awesome Greek festivals instead."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while after several negative experiences. The food is inconsistent and not very good. The decor is odd, and the place often smells of something bad or bleach."}
{"text":"The food was a bit bland, service was good, prices were fair. We don't plan on going back. I don't know what the other greek restaurants are like in the area but this is not Greek, and not tasty."}
{"text":"Pros: Broad menu including Indian and Greek food--something for everyone, friendly service, pleasant atmosphere. Recommend the gyro plate, soups, Indian curries. Reasonably priced for a nice place.
Cons: Some food--hummus, baba ganoush--was a little meh, especially for a place called the Mad Greek. Not bad, just not great."}
{"text":"today my boyfriend and I went to the mad Greek this restaurant give you a choice of Greek food and Indian food I only tried the Greek side of the menu we had mezze sampler it was really good they gave you a few choices my boyfriend had apollo chicken  it good on the plate but de tasteless I had roasted kasseri chicken it was tasteless no flavor my chicken was a little mushy GOOD the food came out fast and the waitress was good"}
{"text":"This place is confusing. There are so many choices and food options from different parts of the world that I'm not convinced they do one type of food right.  
I say pick and do that one thing well and keep it moving.  
I had a dish( Indian) that was remembered to not get again:(
On a side note...it is in a great location."}
{"text":"Bland. Only couple in the place and service was very slow.  Lamb meatballs had no flavor.  Serving was plentiful, wings were great.  Not a bad restaurant just not for me."}
{"text":"So, my dear friends, I write a review based on my personal experience for The Mad Greek. I gotta tell you, he's really mad. It must that he works there 'cause I'd pretty mad as well. As you see, I travel quite a bit and most probably, I'm Greek. I have had a few people from restaurants that I have said some unfavorable things about write me and to tell you the truth, I've even gone back and met a few of them. 

The Mad Greek manager, Chris C., who has a picture of himself on a golf course (so chic), not only is perhaps the greatest Greek cook of all time (oil seeping out of an eggplant????), he is also a psychic. He can tell by looking at a picture of my face that I eat in greasy dives (even though my reviews refute that), that I am a jobless loser (loser perhaps but once again, the traveling refutes that I am jobless) but also insults all of Canada in one fell swoop. I have no idea who Papa Nick's is on the West Side but if someone knows him, please show him how another ''restaurant manager'' defends himself by trying to drag other establishments down. I guess only someone with class, like himself, would go online and trash a person, another business and an entire country (it's Canada, not canada, Mr. Juvenile spelling and punctuation.....punctuation, look it up on Google).

I won't bother even responding to his whining and crying other than to say that being Greek, speaking Greek, French and Italian so I hopefully have an IQ a bit higher than the turnip that thinks that eggplants have oil in them,  I'll use a famous person's saying and say that ''I won't fight a war of wits with someone who is unarmed''. I would be more than happy to visit you in person the next time I'm in Cleveland and tell you the things I would rather not write to your face.

I also would really like to know which awards this house of slop has won. I guess that being rated the number 324 restaurant in Cleveland on Tr-p A-----or must be really prestigious. Stick with Eddie's Pizzeria Cerino (a manager that responds to criticism with tact, sort of apologetic and promises a better dining experience the next, which I have already done).

Curiously, my first impression that this place is filthy wasn't even addressed. If it oinks like a pig......  . I guess all the other people saying it sucks on here must also be wrong and get the same kind of answer. A real manager would try to answer concerns, not be stupid enough to answer like what you will find below, in this day and age of copy/paste and Internet.

In closing, seeing as his name is Chris and he might have some Greek heritage, a big ''de gami--e re m-l-ka kai tha ta poume apo konda'' is all I can really muster.

Enjoy...........

Hi Gee,

Chris C. has sent you a message on Yelp:

Your Review



From the manager - Our calamari is not frozen. Our hoomis, baba and tzatziki are award winning. Maybe your baba was a little oily, which it tends to be as there is much oil in the eggplant that seeps out once it comes out of the cooler. You should know this being the expert you are. $16 for a chicken entree is the going rate in Cleveland. Where you must be dining I don't know, probably some greasy dives by the looks of you. Nobody serves more than 10 ounces of chicken on an entree. This is standard restaurant portioning. How will you eat an appetizer, 1 pound of meat and have room for dessert, mister restaurant genius ?  Please tell me. Maybe you should actually know what you are talking about before you go ranting on and doing harm to good businesses. We have only been in business 35 years, and are a Cleveland legend. Our pastitsio is not dry. Souvlaki for $15 is the going rate. This is not Papa Nicks Diner on the west side, or some dive in canada where you eat. I have been to those dumps and maybe you should just stick with that. Nobody with any class would go online and slam a restaurant in such a juvenile way as you have. Get a life loser. Better yet, get a job

{"text":"Last last two times I was at the Mad Greek, the chicken breast dishes were not fresh. The potatoes were burned and the asparagus was pathetic. The baklava was so hard it could not be cut with a sharp knife.

And, the hostess was wearing strange shoes that made a very loud noise on the tiles. Sounded like machine gun fire passing by."}
{"text":"I want to like Mad Greek for its cool \"dark side\" and gorgeous bar, its street-side dining in warm weather, its location, its long history in Cleveland Heights.  

But they make it hard when you're seated in the brightly-lit \"white side\", nearly empty on a Friday night at 7:30.  Why not close the side and put everyone in the lively side?  Our server was, however, fabulous, and at least our bottle of red Greek wine wasn't warm - almost hot - like it was last time.   

The food - well, $15.95 for a small gyro and a side?  The gyro was good and so was the side, but that's pricey.  My husband ordered an Indian dish and asked for a 3 on the 1-to-5 spice scale.  He said later it lacked any spice at all.  Overall, I wouldn't rush back here."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, service was off that evening due to a large party in our section.
I may give it another chance on a slower night. Since it was my first time there,I was disappointed .
Poor service is a \"deal breaker \" for me:-("}
{"text":"A local favorite for reasons I don't understand. The menu, Greek and Indian, is an odd pairing and the kitchen executes neither well. No raita, no naan - basic menu items in an Indian restaurant. We had two chicken curries. The chicken was cardboard dry, inedible really, \"medium\" spicy was bland, our hummus was tasteless. The service was dreadful, the server rude and unpleasant. The terrace, however, was pleasant on a warm evening. I live in the area, love the neighborhood, and want this to be good.  I have been here several times. It has never been great but this last was so bad I can't ever see going back."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've been here and things have changed. First of all, they have a pretty grubby looking serving staff and the restaurant is old and dusty looking. The food was fine I guess, nothing special but the portions were big and the price is just about right. I sat at the bar and could see into the kitchen which was nasty looking and I watched a server wash her hands in the same sink that was being used to rinse lettuce, I found that gross. Honestly I probably won't be back, is a shame because I used to really like it there. Keep on keeping on"}
{"text":"I used to like Mad Greek a lot. Lately -- not so much. On a recent visit I got some of my Greek favorites -- avgolemono, stuffed grape leaves, hummus, Greek salad, and spanakopita. Everything was too salty, not lemony enough, and not so fresh or flavorful. The pita bread that came with it wasn't very good either. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Would not accept Restaurant.com gift card on Mother's Day. They stated their policy is not to accept \"coupons\" on the holiday. We thought this was really unusual. Service was also lacking and the wait time for the meal was rather long considering the restaurant was mostly empty. I ordered the Lemon Chicken which was overcooked, very tough or poor quality. I didn't know whether it was undercooked or overcooked, but it was rubbery and very hard to chew in places. I just wanted to make the best of it for Mother's Day as I rarely get out of the house to enjoy a sit down dinner with my family, but it was pretty bad. I noted the chicken to the server who didn't seem to believe me or care. She barely apologized. Also, considering, that it was flavored with lemon, etc, it was actually bland and for $18, it's probably one of the worst things I've ever ordered. The potatoes also didn't seem fresh, possibly reheated. Although, the other servers at other tables seemed friendly, our server was not attentive. She never even refilled our water once. We only had a couple extra napkins while eating with two 8 year olds. I tried my husband's fries which tasted also, reheated possibly and dry and very greasy. Just an overall poor experience. Wrong server, wrong food, bizarre policy while we tried to support a local business for the holiday. I would not try it again."}
{"text":"Drinks here were just average, not bad, but not excellent either. For an app, we did the sampler with gyro meat, hummus & pita, a grape leave (dolmades) and greek meatballs (keftedes). This was a great app, something I would definitely recommend. The gyro meat was definitely from a spit and was above average. If i go back, I'm all over the dolmades for my app and gyro as my entree.

We also did the greek salad, average salad with olives, feta, cucumber, tomato and onion. It was fine, nothing too amazing.

The entrees left a little room for improvement. I had the lamb shank, so lets talk about that first. The meat wasn't tender or saucy enough for my palate. It was served with orzo which was full of onions, which was part of the problem. There was an appalling amount of onions which once discovered, I had to pick out one by one. Other than that, the orzo was good as I love veggies. I want to give this dish a make over, by de-boning the meat, removing the onions, and adding a tomato based sauce to the top. Then this dish would have been divine. The fisherman's stew was OK, but was missing some more chicken or seafood stock (it was a little too tomatoey).

As a greek girl, I have had the best greek food ever made I'm sure. I really wanted to love this place. I think if I go back, I will try new entrees since the service was pretty good. Also, for what you get I couldn't help but to feel they were a little over priced. Not a cheap dinner once you add in all the little extras. So next time I hope I love it, so I can feel like I got a better value."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I LOVE Greek food. I have no knowledge if the Indian side of the menu, except that my family loves it. Ok- first, there are some Greek favorite missing from the menu- namely my favorite- chicken souvlaki. They do make up for it with other yummy specialties - dolmades, mousaka, etc. The baklava is awesome. The best time to visit The Mad Greek is in the warmer months when they open the \"garage doors\" and the summer breezes come in. The Cedar/Fairmount location is great with lots of free parking behind and on the streets."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend who had the groupon dinner deal. I think that's the only way that this meal was worth it because I wasn't that impressed. The appetizer was delicious and a good way to sample a little bit of everything. I think if we had just had this and some dessert, we would have been ok. But a restaurant can't survive on only apps and dessert. 

I had the Minos stir fry, which sounded great, but it seemed to me like they focused on giving you a ton of mediocre food rather than a bit of fantastic food. The entree was tasty enough, but there was nothing special about it. I had the chicken and shrimp option and the chicken had a weird texture and I picked most of it out. It seemed like the dish wasn't seasoned much at all. When I ate my massive amount of leftovers, I ended up making a sauce to mix in with everything and give it more flavor.

The drinks were pretty sub-par. They weren't the worst drinks we had ever had, but we weren't eager to drink them all up. The baklava ice cream was the highlight of the evening. Warm baklava, chocolate and some ice cream? Heavenly! 

I'm not eager to go back, even though the staff was super friendly and we had an overall pleasant night. The food just isn't calling me back...except for that baklava ice cream. I may pop in for some more of that sometime."}
{"text":"OK. I would put this (The Mad Greek) down to a zero if I could now. 
Just got a message from either a customer service rep or the owner of the restaurant essentially telling me I didn't know what I was talking about, that both dishes had tomato curry and were meant to be the same and that they had been covering their Indian dishes with raisins and almonds for 30 years. They went on to \"Wish me luck in my efforts to slander good restaurants, and they were sure it wouldn't come back to bite me\". 
What are you going to do... block your years and sing so you don't have to read pitiful yelp reviews? 

Let me explain a base principle/secret of \"Tomato Curry\" to you. Curry, for Indian food, simply means a sauce based in the word before it. So a tomato curry is a tomato based gravy that can be a multitude of things! It's like calling an Arrabiata, a Marinara and a Puttanesca sauce all the same because they are Tomato Sauces. There is meant to be a distinct difference in flavors. And chickpeas, mushrooms and whatover leftover vegetables are left in the kitchen have as much place in a bengal fish or a tasty tomato curry paneer as ketchup does in a chocolate covered vanilla ice cream!

Seriously... the owners need to grow up, accept the fact that I had a terrible time at their place and either deal with or, or try to improve the experience. Telling me I'm an idiot for not truly appreciating their food and that my \"slander would catch up to me\" is just stupid!


For reference - other people's reviews:
\" This dish came heaping w/ white rice that wasn't cooked appropriately (I'm sorry, if my rice is crunching it isn't done.) and a very small portion of the Cauliflower curry.  Cauliflower is cheap people, for $15 I expect more than 1 c. of veggies.\"

\"Not good at all. I had the Greek, she had the Indian. Just moved to town from the Rockies and I've had Greek food all over the world. This was, by far, the worst! I've had better Greek food on a ferry. The place was not clean and had the feeling that they were about to close. Server was OK but knew zero about Greek cuisine... In fact, the kitchen knew zero about Greek cuisine! \"

Need I go on?

Give this place a miss and you and your date/company will thank yourselves for it!

UPDATE: This review is my opinion, and in my opinion, THIS PLACE SUCKS. But then again, this is my opinion. Stating that explicitly (even though the yelp's online contract states that every thing that is posted is pure opinion only) because the owner just sent me a message threatening Yelp and me with a lawsuit. Poor guy can't get his head around the fact that most people here think his restaurant sucks! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!"}
{"text":"The waitress was super nice.  The food was okay.  Way over priced for what you get.  It was the first ordering Greek food here and got the $15 sampler.  It only came with 1 spanakopita and two dolmades and meat balls.  Then so few pita chips and charge us $2 for a few more chips.  Then the gyro portion doesn't have anything either.  The Indian food we ordered as a main course was tasty.  The chicken was dry and you only get a small ladle full of it.   It will probably be a long while before I go back here, if I ever do."}
{"text":"I have frequented the Mad Greek for almost 20 years.  I went there again recently after having moved away from the area (it's been at least 5 years since my last trip).  This place used to set the standard for Greek and Indian cuisine.  Unfortunately, that's not the case any longer.  The menu has recently the changed and there is more of a focus on Greek food and less on Indian dishes.  The baba was good, as was the hummus, but the Indian was less spicy and not as tasty.  The prices were still high but it's only a shell of what it once was. My companions were also frequent diners from long ago and all shared a similar sentiment.  I\"m sure there are other places in the area serving comparable fare - so do your homework!"}
{"text":"Highly impressed. Great, family style lay-out, cool decor, great service and good menu. Half Greek, half Indian food, which is cool. I sat at the bar and had amazing service from the manager, who did everything in his power to appease my fussy appetite... and succeeded! I had the (modified) Apollo's Chicken (modified to my allergies), and it rocked... an awesome balanced, fresh, relatively healthy meal, perfectly cooked. Definitely recommended. I took off the star because the prices are slightly high considering the ingredients, BUT it is in a high rent area, so you can excuse that. Definitely going back. (I put NO next to the outdoor seating, but if you sit in the open window, you are basically outside...)"}
{"text":"First, I would like to say that if I was just rating the food, I would have given The Mad Greek 4 stars instead of 3. I am giving it only a \"fair\" rating because of a few things. This place is pretty expensive. I got a seafood pasta for $19. The past was good, but the portion was on the small side. I could have easily eaten double the amount before getting full. I also brought the rating down because there is no bread given prior to your food being brought to you. If I am spending $19 on my entrée, then I expect to get bread at the table. We had a voucher coupon so we ended up only having to pay half price, but it would not have been worth it at full price. In summary: food was good, but price and portion was not."}
{"text":"The service was not all that great and it took more than 25 minutes for a burger and gyro to come out of the kitchen. Water glass has been empty for at least 20 minutes with no waitress in sight.

The 'mad Greek burger' is appropriately named. You must be 'mad' to think this ordinary burger is good or Greek in any sense. The cheese looked sad and there was nothing Greek about it, not even the spices.

The gyro meat was dry and after one bite my thought was 'Beat Gyro' does it better than the Mad Greek. In addition the tabouli was so lemon intense, it was barely eatable. should've gotten the Greek fries.

Total thumbs down."}
{"text":"Gotta say, I was so very disappointed with the food and service at The Mad Greek last night.  Starting with the drink delivery - which was slow, slow, slow, and the appetizers that arrived cool (and that included the Saginaki that, by definition should be hot given that it's flamed).  Only three of the four diners received water and silverware.

On to dinner - again - all the dishes arrived and were tepid at best - the tzaziki sauce was thin and unimpressive.  The wait staff never checked back to see if we liked the food, to refill drinks or water.  To top it if - despite saying I was picking up the check, the delivered the check to the only man at the table - OMG how 50's is that.

All in all - this restaurant could pay closer attention to the food coming out hot, and do some training for the wait staff.  I used to go to this restaurant in its first incarnation on Coventry - and I gotta say the years and the move have not improved The Mad Greek."}
{"text":"Oh good lord, I wanted to like this place... I wanted to say that it was delicious and tasty and a great experience.  But it's not... and it's no where close.

I'm pretty sure this restaurant will be going out of business soon, but I can't imagine how people would voluntarily go back.

We went on a Wednesday night, and we noticed there were a fair amount of people inside, so we expected good things.  The best part about our meal was our server... and it all went downhill from there.

We shared two appetizers... the saganaki (flaming cheese) and the indian app sampler (samosas, pakoras, bombay wings and chutney trio).  The saganaki was pretty inedible, it tasted like a lump of melty, greasy, left over cheese.  And the sampler?  Oy vey... samosas were truly greasy, the pakoras were a little funky, and the bombay wings were strange.  We both love indian food, and this could hardly be called that.

Our wine was based on the servers recommendations and it was worse than boxed wine... I wish I was kidding.  My \"cabarnet\" was fruity, sweet and seemed carbonated.
My guy got the fisherman's stew for dinner... and it was mediocre at best.  I got the goan curry on the recommendation of our server and it was pretty terrible... every bite tasted different and only one bite was close to being \"good\".  Oh yes... don't forget that this is an indian (and greek) restaurant that doesn't serve naan.  

Ambience?  Well... it's pretty tacky... 

Don't waste your money, I'm still a little bummed I wasted mine."}
{"text":"I decided to try the Mad Greek for the first time.  I love Greek food and this is definitely not as good as the Greek food I can get at Greek festivals and other Greek restaurants.  The calamari isn't fresh and I can tell its frozen.  The seasoning is overly salty and and leaves something to be desired.  They don't serve it with lemon either.  The chicken souvlaki is ok.  The chicken itself is pretty good.  However, the orzo and vegetables that are served with it are overly greasy and oily.  The tzakiki sauce on the salad is a nice touch, but nothing special.  The food is severely overpriced.  The souvlaki is 15.95 for 7-8 small pieces of chicken, greasy orzo and vegetables.  I would go to someplace like Layalena or Aladdin's if you want good Mediterranean or Middle Eastern food- its cheaper and much more tastier."}
{"text":"I joined my girlfriend on the Mad Greek Patio on Saturday for some Happy Hour and noshing.  

The Patio was great, very pretty.  Our server was nice and fairly attentive.  I love the interior of the restaurant too though, so I think that would have been nice as well.

For the food:
The Samosa appetizer, while good flavor, was a little on the greasy side.  The baba was great.  The dinner...way over-priced and small portion.  I ordered an Indian dish, and in my experience the plate comes heaping full with your entree and then there is a small side of rice.  This dish came heaping w/ white rice that wasn't cooked appropriately (I'm sorry, if my rice is crunching it isn't done.) and a very small portion of the Cauliflower curry.  Cauliflower is cheap people, for $15 I expect more than 1 c. of veggies.

I don't think this is someplace I'll frequent often, if at all again."}
{"text":"There were no mad Greeks around, but definitely a mad Asian girl right here. 

The food was really just boring and not that great. I don't even have that many words to describe it other than to say it was \"blah\". 

To top it off, the place is incredibly expensive! My boyfriend and I came here one night for a snack and left with a 50 dollar bill! I ordered pita and hummus for goodness sake. If I had known this place was so expensive, I would have gone across the street to the smoothie place and gotten my late night fix there. 

Mad greek is definitely not one my list of places to revisit."}
{"text":"Please bring back The Mad Greek at Beachwood Place. I loved your chicken gyros there. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the food was so wonderful there, but is not so great, in my opinion, at the Cleveland Heights restaurant location. Best of luck. I will visit if the mall location returns in the future."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.

There are not many places that you can ask for greek or indian food.  Apparently, the place was founded by a couple from different ethnic extractions:  guess which extractions?  :)

The food is decent and definitely edible, but the flavours are a bit heavy handed (at least for the Indian food) in the dishes we tried.  

Plusses:  The decor is actually very charming.  It's designed to take advantage of the warm season of Cleveland, with touches of an older era.  

Minuses: price is on the higher side, especially considering the okay flavouring of the food.  The curries we had textures that were a bit thick for my taste.

Would I go again, maybe.  It's close to my house."}
{"text":"Jeeez....I'm not sure if we just luck-out when we go or what, but my husband and I really enjoy The Mad Greek!
Our serves have been friendly and attentive, the food is delicious and flavorful and the atmosphere is pleasant!  I read a few of the other reviews and was shocked at the problems people have had.  The only \"complaint\" would be that the top-shelf margarita was pretty average-to-bland...and it was $9.50.
Otherwise- great food, fine service and delightful dinner.  
ps: Gorgeous little outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"Opa! (Up Your Mouth)

THE UP-SIDE:
Fantastic Greek and Indian food in a really pleasing atmosphere.  Great place for a first date.  If possible, sit by the window on a summer night; they open the whole front up to the outside.  It makes for a really nice dining experience; especially if it is it's a little rainy outside.

THE DOWN-SIDE:
Always difficult to come up with a \"down-side\" to a five star establishment.  Um...  

THE SUM-IT-UP:
Go here for tasty food and the romantic atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The food is 5-star but the service deserves 0 stars.

Good God, why is the place so slow???!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!  

Every six months or so, I'll clear my entire schedule and go to Mad Greek to get some pita (the smallest portion around!), some hummus and the island of minos stir fry...and maybe some baklava, if I'm up for it.  Stupidly, on my last visit I opted to order something off of the indian portion of the menu, in an attempt to switch it up.  Not much can be said for that except that I'm pretty sure the restaurant is \"The Mad Greek\" and not \"The Mad Greek and/or Indian.\"   This is NOT an Indian food place and I really wish they'd stop billing themselves as such."}
{"text":"The food is a little bit on the expensive side, but I've enjoyed my meal the two times I've been there. 

The lemon chicken is some of the best I've had, but the portion size wasn't gigantic, so I'm not sure it was really worth the price. 

The atmosphere isn't the most romantic of all restaurants - it seems like they're trying, but they're just not quite there. 

I've been there twice, and it's been good, but not THAT good for what you pay."}
{"text":"I want here with my boyfriend last weekend. The food, to be honest, was terrible. The service was good though. She was always asking us how everything was, refilling our water, etc. My problem is this...The food is not edible. I had the gyro. It was so greasy and it was extremely hard to eat. I know this place has been there for a long time but my only question is this...why??? The staff was outstanding. That was the only positive thing I can say. We actually left and ordered take out from Hunan Coventry after because we were that unimpressed. I hate leaving bad reviews but this place needs to know it must make a change. They have a great patio and good drinks but the food was miserable. My boyfriend was sick for two days. I wish I ate somewhere else."}
{"text":"The lentil Soup was awesome as was the half chicken .  The staff and management took great strides to make sure we  were satisfied.  They are true to form here.   recommended."}
{"text":"They have greek food and indian food. We only
tried the greek food. The food was pretty good. Very large portions.
The service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"I use groupon quite a bit for restaurant deals and decided to try this place since I had a taste for Indian food and have not had it in awhile. My son was with me and he was game to try something new. Upon entering my first thought was the place looked dated  and tired, it was also empty but the patio had some people eating. My son wanted to sit outside and so we did. Our server was very nice. I order the chicken tikka with a side salad and my son got the shrimp rangoon. I also order a beer. I got a semi chilled glass and a barely cold bottle of beer which turned warm rather quickly with the outside temperature. The food came pretty quickly but our server forgot to bring the side salad out first so I ended up asking for it. My chicken was good, flavor wise and spice wise but the chicken itself was not tender. My son liked the shrimp but didn't care much for the curry. Overall the prices are a little high for the size of the portions. The service was just okay and the atmosphere was also just okay. Would I go back? Hmmm, maybe...?"}
{"text":"This place was ok.  They have a \"Greek\" style home fry that is pretty good, and the gyro sandwich wrap is delish."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend to use a Groupon that my girlfriend purchased months ago.
We've both been to Mad Greek in the past and our experiences were so-so. We weren't expecting much and this time was no different.

After a 10+ min wait, we finally got our waters and put in our appetizer order.
We started off with a Greek sampler appetizer which had hummus, pita bread, falafel, greek salad, and gryo meat. The sampler was generously sized but everything was just alright.  After the appetizer we both had a greek salad and placed our order for the main course. The greek salads were pretty much the same thing that was on our appetizer but in a larger size. However the balsamic dressing was pretty good.

Anyhow, I order the tikka masala and my girlfriend had the alu ghobi. We both opted for medium spiciness. My tikka masala was definitely more towards hot than medium and the alu ghobi was barely mild. Anyhow the chicken was over seasoned so the outside texture was dry/grainy. The flavor of the seasoning also didn't carry through so it probably wasn't marinated long enough. Overall, quite disappointed. The alu ghobi was better and was properly seasoned.

The Groupon also included a dessert. We opted for a pumpkin spiced cheesecake which was good (no idea if it was house made).

While dining, both our neighboring tables complained about errors on ordering and the long wait for their food. For us, the service was also a bit slow too but it wasn't so bad since we had a few different courses.

Overall, when considering the discounts with the Groupon, its not too bad ($34 for the groupon, 1 app, 2 salads, 2 entrees, 1 dessert). However, all that aside, this place is way overpriced for the quality of the food & service. I believe the original bill would have been close to $80!"}
{"text":"Great food. The Indian side could use to be a bit more heavy handed with spice (never EVER thought I'd say that. I order at a 5 and some nights I still think it's a bit mild). It's my sister and my favorite place. We always start with the mezedakia and samoas (the mango chutney kicks ass!), and then pick both an Indian entree and a greek entree to split. 

The Tamarind fish and Bengal fish are AMAZING! The pumpkin chicken curry and paneer with spinach curry are to die for. As for the greek entrees, the keftedes and santorini are kick-ass. I'm not a fan of pastitsio or moussaka in general, but theirs is actually edible (I seriously don't like them anywhere else).

Honestly, the service sucks on the left side (I call it the white side....probably not accurate, but the walls on that side are white). I've eaten there numerous times with my sister and despite the fact that we tip well, we're still blatantly ignored. There's this one brunette woman who is just exceptionally bad, to the point of infuriating.

However! On the side with the bar, the service is amazing! There's one gentleman in particular, I wish I could remember his name, black fellow with dreads and funky glasses....Love love love him. He's amazing and attentive. 

Oh, and for Cleveland, you CAN'T beat the kick-ass parking."}
{"text":"though a bit slow, the service was good. the food on the other hand..... 

appetizer: greek fries-  boy, oh boy do they use a heck-of-a-lot of salt, and there were only two tiny slivers of tomato in there. i just don't get it??? it would'a been A LOT better with less salt though.

entree: salmon in lemon-butter sauce- the salmon was dry and a bit over cooked, and once again, someone doused this dish in salt (it's common scene here, i guess). I did like the spinach though, and the potatoes weren't bad either.

dessert: baklava ice cream- have you ever had freezer burnt ice cream, you know, when you can taste the watery ice crystals in the ice cream? if you don't want to, don't try this dish. also, this dish could have been saved, if the baklava pieces on top weren't also stale. yes, it is a generous portion size (as are all their dishes), but that was the only (arguably) good part. 

The atmosphere was good & i also really like the color scheme here, it'a a very 'warm' environment.
  
p.s. i peeked in the kitchen, and i kinda wished i hadn't. there were: cooks wearing pajama bottoms and t-shirts (one guy came out and poured himself a nice, strong drink around 1pm), and splatter's of some grimy looking stuff on the wall, also, too top it all off, i saw a guy filling these large cans of \"red baron tomato sauce\" with a bit of water and walking back towards the stoves; my guess is, he was thinning out there homemade tomato sauce       #gross"}
{"text":"This review is a bit limited, since I had mostly finger food and wine. By the time I'd gotten here, I'd been up about 30 hours, flown across three time zones, eaten only crackers (\"Stewardess, do you have any more Sprite?\") and did a long walk from the wrong train station to this place. 

Even so, my impression of this place was still positive. It has that nice, dimly lit romantic atmosphere and the place was roomy enough that it didn't feel crowded despite it being fairly full. All the finger food was excellent and the service was very attentive (in fact, they may have been refilling my wine glass a little too expertly...)."}
{"text":"This place is OK. The menu looks and sounds delicious, but the food itself was bland and not very good. The service was slow and inattentive, and the food itself seemed very overpriced for what we received. Also there really isn't a good place to park, there is on street parking but it's usually very crowded and it's either drive around in circles, or park (illegally) at the giant eagle. Definitely not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty terrible (whether it's Greek or Indian food), especially given the prices, but I go back every so often because it's conveniently located.

Upgraded to 4 after two years because my friends and I started going to the bar. Jim is a great bartender, who always hooks me up *and* protects me from chauvinist jerk-offs."}
{"text":"Extra star for being so nice to my cousin even though we came in 10 minutes before the kitchen closed. Our server encouraged us to order ASAP, but didn't rush us at all to finish our dinner and get out of her section so she could head home. 

I've been here a few other times, which were pretty tasty. Prices can get a little steep if you get an entree, but portions are huge. Sandwiches and flatbreads are the way to go if you're on a budget, and they're pretty tasty, as well. The patio is lovely during the summer."}
{"text":"Visited on a Wednesday night and was disappointed. The service was slow even though the place was dead. I can live with slow service if the food pays off but in this case it did not. The calamari was the best as an appetizer but the entrees were mediocre at best. The Mad burger ordered medium well was served well done; the bun was burnt on both sides. The same held true for the veggie sandwich. I had the Mediterranean chicken sandwich and it came without chicken. I was told you had to pay extra, but why is it called a chicken sandwich? This was after the waitress was actually looking at my sandwich trying to tell me there was chicken present; somewhere.....they did send it back to the kitchen to add chicken but you get the picture."}
{"text":"I went expecting very good food as a friend had said the food is very good.
But I was very disappointed. It was bad, flavorless and extremely disappointing.

I ordered a gyro to go. The restaurant is only about 10 minutes from my apt. By the time I took a bite it was cold and tasted like it was leftovers.
If I wanted a $5 gyro I could have just gone around the corner.

While waiting for my gyro I ordered a dessert that the bartender recommendd. 
It was disgusting. Don't order the baklava with ice cream. 
It is too sweet and the ice cream seems as though it may have been sitting there for a few years.
Extremely disappointed with the food. I thought I would try their Greek this time and Indian the next time, but there is no going back."}
{"text":"Two recent visits demonstrate an improvement.  Service was spot on.  Menu seems a bit smaller, but quality is better.  Outside dining on the patio is a plus.  I hope they keep it up."}
{"text":"I went here with my mom who had a Groupon for a 4 course dinner.  We went before seeing a show downtown and told our server this.  She was very accommodating with checking the time and making sure our food came out fast.  We got an appetizer (mezze sampler), each got a salad (greek with the yogurt dressing), I got the goan coconut curry entree with mussels, shrimp & scallops and my mom got the apollo chicken, and for dessert we got the baklava to go.  I thought the appetizer and salad were really good.  Although, I think I would have been satisfied with just those two.  The mezze sampler was plenty of food.  I liked my entree, but my mom thought it was too hot for her.  I was disappointed that it had nuts on it.  I was planning on giving my leftovers to my boyfriend, but he is allergic to nuts.  It would be helpful if the menu listed all of the ingredients and possibly which ones are hot.  My mom enjoyed her dinner as well.  We both agreed the baklava dessert was really good and a large piece.  My only complaint is that my mom mentioned she was waiting for our server to greet her at the table some time before I arrived."}
{"text":"I had a pretty great experience. Good food - we had samosas to start with lamb shank and risotto and bf had gyro. All so good and service decent."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Got to the Mad Greek at 6:30. Waited to be seated 10 minutes and the hostess asked us if we had reservations. I looked around and only 5 tables had customers! Really? We got a table, drinks, and appetizers. Placed our Oder and we waited....and waited...and waited. 1 1/2 hours later and three apologies from the server, we still did not have our meals. The other couple with us left.... Got tired of waiting. Thank you Mad Greek for ruining our night! I will NEVER return! One last note...the tabouli sucks! All bulgar wheat and NO parsley! And they call that \"parsley salad\"..."}
{"text":"A very dear friend of mine gave this place an excellent review so we decided to check it out. We had a very sour start to our dining experience since we appeared in an appropriate time, when lunch was coming to its logical end and dinner has not started yet. As our very frustrated and angry waiter explained the merge from lunch to dinner involves all kinds of changes and shenanigans such as change of menus, prices, taking out the window for dramatic \"in the street\" dining experience, maybe even carriage turns into a pumpkin, who knows. 
 And we, suckers, landed in this grey undefined zone - 1545- and our Greek was very mad about it.  
I was very tempted to explain to him that sometimes life just happens to happen in the grey zone, like you are starving at 1545, and that restaurants are supposed to serve customers, and not the other way around, but he was beyond himself throwing menus at us, and rushing us to order before magical 4 pm. 
The ordering process was simply ugly. He literally yelled at one of my friends who said Apollo chicken in the NASA kinda way, and he corrected him: \"Titles please! It's 'Apollo, not Apollo\". 
We were simply scared to object. He was all accent, muscles and attitude. He could totally mess up my cerebral friends who wanted some fancy lemon chicken with a spaceship name. 
 Why 3 stars? Well besides the Hitler of the waiter, food was good. I mean lemon chicken was fantastic. Hummus was beyond average - tasteless and watery.
 And gyro meat...well, I don't know maybe I just do not have an ejection fraction to handle it. It was dry, fatty and immediately threw me in sodium coma aka CHF exacerbation.
 Salads were prepared in the orphanage kind of fashion - scarce lettuce, 1/5 of a slice of the cucumber and white onions; yogurt sauce was super spicy which I am not sure it's supposed to be like this.
In the middle of the dinner he gave us up, just like kids for adoption, to another server, explaining to us again all the intricate mechanism of the lunch-dinner switch. We realized that we trespassed the sacred dinner zone and nervously looked around - restaurant was just as empty as before. Our Terminator left us to take out the window obviously relieved by not having to deal with us anymore. And very nice quiet lady kept refilling out glasses trying to fix what was already broken - our dining experience. 
We left her a very good tip just to piss our aggressor off and left very promptly. After all he is a very mad Greek."}
{"text":"I actually feel bad for them... :(
I went there with my boyfriend last Sunday with a reservation. It was about 7:30 at night, but the restaurant seemed empty. We went there because I received an email from them with 10% off for their Sunday brunch and dinner buffet. It says on the email that buffet goes until 8:30. However, when we went there, I noticed that there was no buffet! The hostess said that they had to end the buffet early because they were not busy and they didn't want to let the food sit there. We left with extreme disappointment and sadness... I respect them for doing the right thing by not letting the food sit there, but they did not honor their promotion and promise. Needless to say, if I ever think about going there again in the future, I will call ahead and make sure they are able to deliver what they promise to deliver."}
{"text":"An employee on his break would NOT let us alone, even as we were walking out the door!

Food was OK, bar was stocked. Not going back."}
{"text":"This place is strange. I used to really love it - I would always get something tasty and satisfying. Great comfort food. One day I got into an argument with a co-worker. He said the Mad Greek was good sometimes and bad sometimes, tasteless food and such. I defended the Mad Greek to him, saying I went there all the time and it was always good!

So this argument left me craving some Mad Greek, and I went back a few days later. Terrible. Salty Indian food with no flavor. I was stunned. Since then I have experienced the same a few times.

I would definitely give this place a 4 or 5 star rating for my usual experience. It's not the most authentic, but it's delicious and different, and they have Indian and Greek food for an interesting combination. But occasionally, it's terrible and ruins your dinner. So I guess 3 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service with a great menu. Tons of choices with a friendly staff. I'm blind and my server had knowledge of the clock method for a person like me to enjoy my meal!!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this place at first... Greek AND Indian?  REALLY??  After the first few bites of baba ghanoush, I was optimistic.  After my husband dug into his Indian food and I into my Greek food, we were pleased.  

Great food (the Indian was especially yummy), excellent service and sitting near the windows was lovely on such a pretty night."}
{"text":"We've been going here for the past 26 years and have always been impressed with the quality of the food an ambiance. Went to dinner last weekend and found that they had walled off leased the nicest part of the restaurant..so much for the ambiance. Our biggest complaint was with the quality of the food. I've ordered Chicken maharajah dish for years with a spicy 'hot' rating.....usually at least good and many times it was exceptional.  I guess it is a sign of the times or something but the quality for all of our dishes was poor at best and extremely bland in flavor.

This is the last time we will spend over $100 for meals that are mediocre at best."}
{"text":"It's rare to find a restaurant that serves both Greek and Indian food.  This place is good for both dine-in and takeout.

I've ordered a large number of both the Greek and Indian dishes.  Some dishes are good and some dishes are very good.  I most recently had the roasted kasseri chicken entree.  The sauce was great and the two large pieces of chicken were well cooked.  Overall the dish was very rich.  The Indian food is tasty - not my favorite Indian food, but good.  I've eaten the butter chicken, pakoras, and samosas and have left satisfied.   You can order the Indian entrees here on a 1-7 spice scale.  The chutney has a reasonable amount of spice and a level 6 entree is actually spicy.  I had some of the baklava ice cream for dessert and thought that the baklava could have been a little better.  

Portion sizes here are generous.  The waiter seemed fairly new, but he was very friendly and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time."}

{"text":"I hadn't been here in years...we took a chance (per yelp reviews) and decided to revisit one of our old \"first date\" spots before checking out a play.  We wanted Greek and Indian dishes.
First, the place was clean, including the restrooms.  
We waited a very long time (20 min) for a server to appear.  We had to get the host to find her.  However, once we had service, she was friendly and attentive.
We looked at the menu-we could not find our old favorites so I went for something \"safe\".
We ordered the shrimp cocktail app and it was not your traditional fare.  It was seasoned shrimp in a tomato based sauce that reminded me of marinara.  It was very good, though!
The menu is quite different.  I liked the old menu items much better; I used to always get the chicken Corfu (spelling?) and it was my favorite; while my husband would get the lamb curry.  Nothing under the Indian section sounded appealing, so he also went with a classic.
This time, I ordered the salmon with a lemon-butter sauce and capers, served with red skin potatoes.  This dish surprised me with its flavor; and the potatoes were perfect.  My husband ordered a form of bouillabaisse, only it was called something else; basically, it's a seafood stew.  He said it was excellent. 
He had a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon and I had the pineapple \"martini\".  They were slow to arrive but my cocktail was perfect.  
The atmosphere is nice; except I would not recommend sitting in the bar area by the window as your view is traffic and its loud due to it being a bar area.
The only cons: slow.  It took two hours to dine here and the place was not busy.  We had to find our server.  Also, there was nothing Greek about our food, it was more American.  I would love it if they got the old menu back...
All in all, this place is not The Mad Greek from ten years ago. However, what we ordered was much, much better fare than what we experienced at Rockefeller's and definitely NightTown as of late."}
{"text":"It's out of my way from where I reside, but I always try to stop in when I'm in the area following a visit to any one of Cleveland's museums. I really liked the calamari and can't wait to try their other dishes, like the lamb shank."}
{"text":"I was a little reticent to try the Mad Greek after reading the Yelp reviews but several co-workers insisted that it was great. I've been three times now, once for lunch and twice for dinner. If the weather is good, I really recommend sitting out on the back patio. My only criticism of the restaurant would be the service can be a little slow.

The food, however, is quite good. I've tried items off both the Indian menu and the Greek menu and have really enjoyed both. The pumpkin curry chicken was a very nice portion size with a creamy rich sauce. The \"hot\" level of spice felt like more of a medium to me, but I tend to like things very spicy. On the Greek side of things I really enjoyed the chicken souvlaki and spanakopita both were rich, well seasoned and delicious.

Most entrees tend to be in the $10-$15 range, with hummus or baba ghanouj and other appetizers around $8."}
{"text":"Stay Away! Beware! The Worst Restaurant Ever!
This is the filthiest,most disgusting, smells of cockroaches and the servers, manager etc are RUDE, obnoxious, dirty and sloppy. 

My wife and I went for a nice dinner and this place was filthy, had bugs and we were treated horribly

In all of our years, we have never experienced something as bad as this!

Avoid this restaurant at any cost! Free is too expensive!"}

{"text":"I love Greek food.  In my home town, every other restaurant, fancy or humble, was run by someone named Spiro, Nick, Demetrios or Alexandros.  Sadly, although I know several Greek restaurant owners in Cleveland, they don't serve Greek food.  So I was really excited to try the Mad Greek.  Finally a taste of home, right?

No so much.  The spanikopita was so salty I couldn't finish half of it.  As were the potatoes. And the lamb. The moussaka was oily and salty.  The baba was oily and unpleasant.

It's too bad, because the place is cute.

Could SOMEONE in the Greek community here open a good Greek restaurant?"}
{"text":"Last night my cousin and I decided to use a coupon we had for The Mad Greek restaurant on Fairmount Hill.  We arrived when the restaurant was fairly empty.  The hostess seated us next to a large table but told us \"Don't worry, you will be gone long before this party arrives\".  Famous last words.

We began by ordering the babba ganoush appetizer.  It arrived with well toasted pita wedges and tasted delicious.  We did have to wait ONE HALF HOUR FOR THE STARTER TO ARRIVE!  Seriously, were they harvesting the eggplant?

My cousin ordered the \"special\" of the evening which was described as \"shrimp in a white wine, garlic sauce with mushrooms, served over pasta\" and I ordered the moussaka which was described as \"ground beef with egg plant and a bechemel sauce...the Greek lasagna.  Served with a Greek salad\".  ONE HOUR AND 20 MINUTES AFTER WE WERE SEATED (and after the large party next to us began to arrive), our food was served.

My cousin's dish  ($19.00) had shrimp (3 of them), scallops (one white and one yellow), no mushrooms and a thick white sauce which the dish was swimming in...they served it in a bowl!  My dish arrived ($16.50) with no bechemel but with an acidic tomato sauce on top.  Next to my moussaka were veggies (not mentioned on the menu) that were so greasy, they left an oozing oil slick on the plate.  I had to ask for my salad.  We told our waitress nothing was as advertised.  The owner/manager(?), who never introduced himself to us, came over and argued with me that this is how they have served their moussaka for 30 years, never mind what the menu said.  He had no excuse for my cousin's meal.  He took her meal off but left mine on the check.  We ate nothing but the appetizer. The people behind us had to have their check \"adjusted\" also due to poor quality.  Our non-meal cost us $31.00 and we wound-up driving through Wendy's!

My advice: DO NOT GO TO THE MAD GREEK unless you want to pay for inedible food, that is!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars and rounded down.

I always check Yelp before I go out to eat, so normally I would never go to a restaurant with such low Yelp reviews. However, I'm also not one to always make a fuss if I'm with a group of people, if the place that is agreed on to go is not my first choice. Such a scenario happened last night.

When I walked in to Mad Greek with my small group, I noticed that the decor was sort of striving to be kind of upscale/intimate, but still used shoddy tables and chairs. I normally like places that focus more on clean and cozy.

When we got the menu, I noticed that one side should of been labeled \"affordable\" and the other side \"unaffordable.\" And even the affordable side was on the high end. I absolutely hate it when restaurants have really uneven pricing on their menus. 

I decided to order the Veggie Curry Wrap off the more affordable side of the menu. It actually was rather tasty, but not worth coming back for.

I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"The most interesting thing about this place was the juxtaposition of Greek and Indian food. 

I ordered a sample platter of Greek appetizers and some Indian moong bean dip. It was all very good, and I boxed more than half of it for a next day lunch.

I also had a Greek coffee, which was great, and I loved the sweet grounds at the bottom.

The couple across from me ordered something that the waitress lit up in flames. Then they ordered a second one of those and I got to see the flames again.

Summary of items from what I can remember:
+Greek platter:
++rice-stuffed grape leaves
++meat nuggets
++spritzy yogurt sauce
++light and flaky spinach thing
++pita bread cut in dip-size
++ground chick peas and tahini
++block of feta cheese and greens
++thinly sliced meat

+Indian moong bean dip
++the dip
++crispy fried and thin, large as small plates crackers

+Greek coffee
++sweet and dark
++came in a small teacup that was actually pretty deep
++put some ice in the left over grounds for a sweet desert


I would go to see the flames again."}
{"text":"If you don't look closely, you might miss The Mad Greek. Their sign is microscopic, unfortunately, and they are a bit off the main drag in the Cedar-Fairmount neighborhood.

Having said that, this place is well worth hunting down. This place is great! The parking is in the back, and it's free. 

One particularly notable thing about this restaurant is that their service and food is excellent at all hours of the day. I've been here at noon for lunch, in the evening for dinner, and late in the evening for drinks...and each time, I've been impressed.

I really like the Gyro Platter--it comes with a salad and pita bread, and I've found that I always eat plenty and still have a sizable amount to take home for lunch the next day. The dressing on their salad is especially good...mmm. I've never had any of the Indian dishes, mainly because there are several other great Indian restaurants in the area and I know of no other Greek restaurants.

My only caveat is to make sure not to sit in the area with the patio doors in the wintertime. Plenty of cold air still seeps in, and it can make for an unpleasant dining experience."}
