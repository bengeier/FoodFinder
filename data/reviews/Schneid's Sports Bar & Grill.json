{"text":"Like a fine wine, Schnides requires more than a single tasting to fully understand.  My first take on this place was certainly off.  My experience is week nights, but this place has some really good lunch time food deals (such as $2 burgers).  Non-regular client√®le occasionally causes mischief, which resulted in Schnides having an 11 oclock bedtime.  This is a mixed blessing: it's a bummer to leave early, but you get to work on time the next day...  I tend toward drinking beer, but their mixers and shots are generous and prices are great.  The food is also well priced and you can get a gyro, a \"Jerry Special\", or a good bar burger.  The regulars, and the bar staff, make this place fun.  Everyone gets a nickname.  And there are plenty of TVs and at least one really hardcore Wisconsin sports fan always present."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Love coming in for a quick bit to eat or a night cap. It has a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been meaning to eat at Schneid's for years and finally got around to it tonight. Now I'm kicking myself for not having gone sooner!  The service was friendly and attentive, and the dinner was tasty and filling.  Their fish fry is one of the best in Madison and the prices are very reasonable.   The people near us were friendly and humorous--just a whole lot of fun.   We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Ever wanted to see the effects on alcohol on a human body?  Come here and there will be at least 5-7 specimens sitting at the bar. Yes, its divey.  But unlike other dive's, where people go just because it is a dive, at Schneid's a fog of sadness and despair hangs over the room.  A few pool tables and dart boards to keep you entertained.  Friendly bartenders.  Standard bar fare.  No pretense.    Check it out, tip back a few, just don't brag about having a healthy liver as it might depress some of the regulars that only wish the same could be said about theirs."}
