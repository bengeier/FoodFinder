{"text":"The food came cold and after a very long time.  The beer tap didn't work.  Bad experience overall. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I have a blast coming here and bringing friends! The patio in the summer is awesome and the view of the fairy lake dam is unique. As far as the food goes it's super trendy, fun and delicious. The buffalo chicken waffle cones and deep fried ravioli are my two favourites hands down. I love having a place like this on Main Street Newmarket. If you haven't been, you should check it out."}
{"text":"Place is pretty. Nice ambiance. Food is ok. Nothing to write home about and probably not something I would come back for."}
{"text":"Got the ravioli, grilled cheese with fries and chicken tacos. The ravioli and grilled cheese were amazing. Chicken tacos nothing special but this place is super cute and the waitress was lovely. Went for lunch, would def go back."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in mainly because of the cute decor and the menu seemed interesting. The entire place is very well decorated with many insta-worthy  spots to take photos. There were different coloured wallpapers, tons of neon lights, graffiti, light box signs, a swing, table toppers and even a photobooth. The entire place seemed to be designed for photo-ops. Unfortunately the food was quite disappointing. I did notice a lot of the items I saw on yelp and Instagram were no longer on the menu which was also a little disappointing.  We ordered the chicken tacos $7, rock shrimp $14 and sushi burrito $12. There were a couple of other things I wanted to try but decided that I'll only order them if this first round was good. The chicken tacos weren't that great, but we're very filling for $7. It came with 3 mini tacos and came with a sweet spicy sauce. The tacos reminded me a lot of chicken shawarma wraps, but I would have preferred a chicken shawarma wrap. They weren't bad, they just weren't special.   The rock shrimp was good but a bit too salty. It came with warm shredded lettuce tossed in (sesame?) sauce which was surprisingly good. The dish was good but I've had a similar dish done better and cheaper at other places. I felt that the dish wasn't really worth $14; especially compared to the tacos.  The sushi burrito was disappointing. For $12, it was quite skinny compared to other places and didn't have much flavour. It was interesting that they had shredded seaweed which made a cool pattern on the burrito instead of the original sheet of seaweed. I found that those bits of seaweed would just stick to your lips with every bite.  I was skeptical at first about the food here and I was right. Most places decorated that well usually feel like they're compensating for something else - in this case, the food. I wouldn't really find myself coming back here for the food but I do think it would be a cute spot to meet up with friends and go for drinks - the venue itself is very nice. And for that I gave it three stars. I definitely got the vibe that this place was made for Instagram but like most \"insta-worthy\" foods, they're usually disappointing."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is awful. We waited very long for our drinks and the server forgot to give us cutlery, forgot one of our drinks, one of the meals took longer than the others. It was very unprofessional. I found the hostess was very discouraging too, seemed like she didn't want us to put our names in. It was very weird."}
{"text":"Cute little place in Newmarket offering a variety of \"snacks\" - its more like mini sharable plates. The service was great and the decor was very hipster-like.   It's a great place to visit if you are in the downtown area.  I ordered the chicken tacos and the fries with rosemary and garlic aoli. The fries were good but not something that I haven't had before elsewhere. The tacos seems a bit bland and it was really the mole sauce that helped bring out the flavor more.  I would return to try their other dishes and have more variety to share with other people."}
{"text":"Popped in one night for a quick drink, was empty but still an ok time. Service was good."}
{"text":"Snackmrkt just opened this week and we came to check it out- mainly for it's desserts.  The restaurant offers many \"snack\" options for people to choose from- a variety of different types of snacks.  We were extremely happy with the desserts we ordered, altho, there was only 2 options- it did not disappoint.  Atmosphere was nice- seating inside wasn't a lot but had quite a bit of outdoor seating.  Service was So-So but that is expected from a new restaurant. Overall, it wasnt bad and we will be coming back again to try some of their snack foods.  ------------------------------------ Update on Snack/Food Items:  Quick run-down  Snack foods were good and tasty. The duck skewers were horrible as our only complaint for what was ordered. It was tasteless, very small and didnt taste like duck. Also, the Perogies were so-so. Everything else was good.  This place is definitely not a place to have a full dinner entree; hence the name Snack Mrkt. If you are thinking of doing that, your bill will end up being quite expensive.  It's only good for quick small snacks and drinks."}
{"text":"Loved the lunch here as the portion was just right for \"Snacking-for-mealtime\". We had mac and cheese popped with Cheetos crumbs. It was amazingly simple but so flavourful. The brussel sprout was tasty, actually.   The seats were great, but the wait for our food was really bad (35 minutes), and it was not even busy. The drinks were okay.   Long version short, I would come again but ensure that they don't forget about my order."}
{"text":"First time was okay, but I was expecting so much more. All the food came cold, the deep dish pizza was not cooked on the inside and the dough was still raw. Everything else was good, but like I said before...cold. Second time was terrible. My sangria literally just tasted like orange juice. Lamb shank was cold, and I'm not really sure how you are supposed to share the Dish. The sushi burrito was not what it said on the menu.. it had WAY too much cilantro and chunks of ginger, no salmon at all and a sliver of tuna. The flat bread was LOADED, and I mean loaded with walnuts, ham and arugula, barely any cheese and barely any balsamic glaze... zero flavour.. I think we ate 3 pieces and left the rest. We did complain about the burrito and they took it off the receipt, which was very nice. So disappointed because I wanted to like this place so much!!! I do love ground burger bar though, so I'll just stick to there from now on."}
{"text":"SnackMrkt's menu is a fun take on tapas with smaller-sized meals. They offer a good variety of hot and cold snacks. Their drink menu is also fun. I have tried the Pink Flamingo which was good but needs a little more (or stronger) booze. In 4 separate visits, I have tried the lemon chicken, the perogies, the ravioli, mac n' cheese and tacos (beef and chicken). Everything was quite good. The service is good too."}
{"text":"When you walk in you're really excited because you're wowed by the atmosphere, but then you get your food and all of that excitement disappears.   The seared ahi tuna bowl ended up being a medium well done tuna bowl with no broth.  The lamb shank came with no shank, and ended up being a pulled lamb concoction.   I see the potential, provided the chef and service step their game up."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place when I was in town. As the title suggests, this is a great place for small plates and not necessarily a full meal unless you plan to pair.   For starters I had the Fairylake Falls cocktail - I only drink when it tastes good and this absolutely passed the test. For dinner, I had a combination of perogies and mac and cheese. The perogies were great - simple, but tasty and surprisingly filling. The mac and cheese is topped with jalapeno Cheetos, which pack a little bit of heat but not specifically pricey.  But the initial draw to this place? The ice cream sandwich. Very simple concept but worth it.  Only complaint is the cookies were a little burnt, which kind of ruined the experience a bit. Had the cookies been just right, the simple idea of adding the dip and the topping is spot on. A perfect treat to a \"snack\" meal.  Not to mention this little area of Newmarket is really charming - lots of neat little places to go nearby, walk around the lake, and the splash pad just down the street. And of course Snackmrkt itself is right on the \"falls\" so you can sit right by it, or inside with clear sight lines over to it. The location really is a knockout."}
{"text":"Don't know why there are so many negative reviews.  Our experience was quite positive! Service was quick and friendly! Our order arrived within 20 minutes. The red sangria was to die for!!!! Food was  delicious.  I'd re-name the 'stuffed mushrooms' as they weren't really stuffed.  I'd recommend to Others."}
{"text":"More of a teenage hangout then a restaurant. Staff were very undertrained. Had the shrimp/scallop (very overcooked and dry) and the rage beef was actually just vegetables in a tomato sauce.  This place could do well if it had a new kitchen and bar staff."}
{"text":"I can't even write about the food because we had to leave (I had a flight to catch and we thought an hour for a bite would be sufficient). We thought being a small portion sharing restaurant that food would be served promptly. When we arrived the young male host was energetic and polite (the only person out of the 4 we interacted with that was a positive experience). We ordered 3 waters and a corona. We received 1 water and 1 corona and reminded the waitress we needed 2 more. We ordered 4 dishes. 5 or so minutes later, our waitress returns asking to confirm our order because the printer in the kitchen broke. We then wait another 20 minutes for our 4 snack-sized dishes. Our waitress isn't in range so we ask another one if she could check on our food. Her immediate response was \"oh, I'm not your server. Let me go tell her\". We wait a couple more minutes and ask her when she passes by again with an update. She responds that she spoke to our waitress and she doesn't know either? Odd. We then signal our waitress over for an update and she tells us the deep fryer broke for a few minutes so everything got backed up. We tell her we'd like our food in the next 3 minutes otherwise we're paying for our 1 beer and leaving. The manager then comes over and asks us if there's a problem. We explain that we've been waiting over half an hour, and she immediately snaps that we've only been waiting 26 minutes. Hold up. You're going to challenge your patron over wait times over 4 minutes? We then correct her that we actually did order over 30 minutes ago because of the printer issue. She seems more interested in wanting to have us talk for a few minutes to buy time for the kitchen.   By this point I have very little patience for a hospitality manager that makes me as a customer feel like waiting this long for food is appropriate and I should feel guilty for causing an issue. Somehow 2 days earlier at Jacob's Steakhouse in Toronto I managed to receive 2 steaks and 5 side dishes in less time.   We put $10 on the table for our single corona and left. I am now en route to the airport sans meal, and my mother is at home making her own meal on Mother's Day.   If you value customer service, I'd try somewhere else on Main Street. 30+ minutes for 4 snack-sized dishes in a restaurant only 50% at capacity is substandard."}
{"text":"Struggled between 2-3 stars. Went for lunch and the restaurant was definitely not busy- several empty tables. Waited 15 or more minutes before waitress came to take order. Waited 35-40 minutes before food came. We were with our 6 year old son who was starving. Wait staff did not seem friendly or happy which  makes me wonder what the management is like. They rarely checked in on our table during our meal as well as the table beside us, and when they did, they seemed almost annoyed. The waitress did appologize for the wait and gave us a free brownie. Decor is great and food was pretty good, some dishes were great (coconut chicken, tacos, olives, smores), others not so much (mediteranean fries). This restaurant has the potential to have a really great ambience if the staff were happy and friendly, and if they were better staffed, and food served timely. This restaurant clearly needs more wait staff and staff in the kitchen. This was my 3rd visit to this restaurant and each time have had to wait extremely long for the food. Would not advise taking kids or if you are in a rush due to the wait."}
{"text":"I love the food here! It's very creative and delicious.  Myself and five other women arrived on Saturday night (after a particularly horrible experience at a different restaurant nearby.) And we wanted some dessert!  We were served right away and totally taken care of. The lady behind the bar with the brown ponytail (I wish we got her name) was so great - she even walked over next door to grab blankets for us so we wouldn't get cold out on the patio!   We shared the deep fried brownies and the s'mores - amazing! What a wonderful experience. I would definitely recommend this place. I'm certainly coming back."}
{"text":"The food is really tasty, I definitely recommend getting the Thai chilli wings. I'd have to complain about the fact that for the size of the snack, it's pretty expensive and can add up quickly if you want to get enough food! I definitely recommend the avocado fries as well."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place more for its location and decor, but the food was just okay and it was pricy for the portion size.  Yes I know they are snack size but for the price they are charging, I would expect more in either size or quality. Between my husband and I, we ordered the fried chicken waffle cone, avocado frites, perogies, Mac n cheese and duck slider.  There were 3 chicken waffle cones per order ($9) but they are pathetically small, two bites each max. Same thing with the perogies, three pieces $8, my husband finished one per bite..Me, two bites. The Mac and cheese is too saucy and gooey for our taste. overall the quality of the food is not bad but nothing spectacular, nothing memorable, I will probably forget what I had here in a few weeks.  The patio is nice though and service is ok.  At the end we paid $60+ and neither of us were full (yes I know it's supposed to be for snacks..) nor satisfied with the overall meal.?"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far. The first time was when they first opened, where I would rate the food 2 stars and the second time was later on, where the food was a 3.5.  The first time we got chicken tacos, lamb crostini (not on menu anymore) and this soba noodle bowl (not on the menu anymore). The tacos are always good and the lamb wasn't bad, just a little over cooked and too heavy for the crostini. The noodle bowl was way too salty and didn't taste good so I'm glad they took that off the menu.   The second time was a lot better and all the pictures were all from this time. The pork belly baos were really good and my favourite thing was the rock shrimp. Least favourite was the sushi burrito, since the seaweed wasn't in sheet form and didn't create a nice texture. Also, the rice wasn't very well made.   They're always upgrading the menu, which makes me want to come back to try more things."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're hungry. Come here if you enjoy a beautiful atmosphere, cute tapas and craft beer. Located on Main Street Newmarket this establishment has added some new flavour!  Came here for lunch with le sister and we had Skewers (duck breast, marmalade, hoisin sauce), Frites (rosemary, truffle oil, parmesan and chipotle aioli) Dumplings (Pork, leeks, enoki, ponzu, wasabi) and Crostini (Alheira sausage, mushroom, sour cream, oarmesan, balsamic reduction and baguette)  Everything had good flavours and small servings. The service was fantastic! I would come back if there is a game on or if I just would like a little snack. =)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday and it was kinda dead (which was nice!), maybe because it was super freezing outside or that we were a tad bit too early for dinner. This was my first time coming here and I immediately loved the place. It's so chic and I love the atmosphere and vibe.   We were seated very quickly and the waitress came to grab our drink orders. I got the red sangria which was delicious, I love the small teeny blueberries that was in my cup. My cousin got an old fashion that wasn't on the menu. It was nice to see them being very accommodating. My brother ordered an apple cider somersby.   After our drinks arrived, we ordered our food. I ordered the salmon tartare, my brother and my cousin ordered the chicken tacos. We also wanted to try a couple things on the menu but was kinda disappointed that they weren't able to make it because they were changing the menu. I really wanted to try their pork bao bun and their sticky ribs. There's always a next time. My cousin also ordered the beef steaks which was yummy. It was cooked medium rare and had a lot of flavor.   My salmon tartare was delicious, need a little bit of chilli flakes but overall it was amazing with the fried wonton chips. I was debating on getting the mac and cheese but I was already so full from the tartare. There will have to be a next time since we still wanted to order desserts.  I should have ordered the fried mars bar because my chocolate chip cookie ice cream was alright. I ordered the the ice cream sandwich with chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream and dipped in blue raspberry and m&ms. I think I would have enjoyed it more without the blue raspberry or the m&ms.   My brother ordered the ice cream sandwich with vanilla ice cream dipped in chocolate and oreos. It honestly looked better than mine.   My cousin ordered the smores, which he demolished on his own. All of us were too stuffed to try it. It was pretty cool to roast your own marshmellows inside on top of a small hibachi!   Overall, I liked the whole experience. We had fun trying new things and our server was pretty cool too."}
{"text":"This is a very cool place and amazing for a bite or snack.  My favourite are the chicken and waffle.  Actual bite size chicken served in an ice cream cone.  It's a bit pricey for the size of the tapas but a fun experience and great location ."}
{"text":"I'm saying it's closer to a 2.5 right now but am hoping it's just because it's new. We've been a couple of times and it's getting better than it was when it first opened. I'll update my review in a few months if it continues.   Parking.  Nightmare if you go during prime dining time. Get someone to drive  Decor: Super cute. They might be the problem with the food. They worried about making it super cute and forgot to make it super tasty.   Although it's still fairly new and hopefully it's just growing pains although it's the same owners of the - awesome since it started- ground burger bar.   Food: The most disappointing. Tried the sushi donuts twice. Both times the rice was old and wasn't even sushi rice. Was regular dry white rice.   Popcorn. The popcorn comes in a small vessel. It doesnt even fill that vessel. There's crumpled paper at the bottom. Seriously. It probably cost (without the bacon and stuff 2 cents to make the popcorn. Geeze fill the container. Its tiny.   Brussel sprouts made me want to cry. Over cooked. Over seasoned and under seasoned. If you are one of each it was perfectly seasoned.   Rillet was great though. Drinks ok.  Service:  So the hostess wanted to seat my 9 month pregnant 4 foot 11 waddling friend on the bar stools. Didn't get that she couldn't climb up. Had to ask to sit at the large community table.  Sigh.   I'll be back because I really want this place to be great. Only I'll wait a bit to do so"}
{"text":"Came back for a second visit, very disappointed with the speed of their operation.  Downgrading to 2 stars.   Everyone from waiters to cooks were moving at a TURTLES PACE... my god.  If you order additional items, expect to wait even longer!!   It took almost 45min to get our first dishes, and there was only 1 other table.  We made the mistake of ordering more food after our initial order, waited almost an hour for the second round to come!!  Will not be coming back, there are better options in the same area"}
