{"text":"I love b urban chicken and this restaurant does it best. so glad we found it. Thanks for the memories"}
{"text":"I've had decent food from Bourbon Street Grill, but this particular one at Pickering Town Centre is in short disgusting. Bland, tasteless and not even hot. Felt as if this was sitting there for hours.  Jambalaya Rice with Green Beans and Bourborn Chicken, came to a grand total of $9 and change. Chicken was bland, rice was stale and tasted too sweet. I only finished this disgusting meal because my girlfriend purchased this one and I didn't want her money to go to waste. But I paid for it after in the washroom..."}
{"text":"Food: 4 stars The jambalaya rice was really good! I like how it's got a bit of a kick to it. Just the right amount of mild spice. Their signature bourbon st chicken is consistently good. At this location, we got a good amount of meat with lots of vegetables.   Ambiance: 4 stars The food court area is very spacious with nice seating area with tvs. Spacious with many eatery choices.  Service: 3 stars Standard food court service. It's nice how they will usually offer to let you try a certain flavour if you're unsure whether you'll like it or not."}
