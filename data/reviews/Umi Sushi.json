{"text":"and this is why you have to yelp things before you decide to drop-in a random restaurant just because you happened to be hungry but in an area you're not familiar with.  this place is ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. service = disgusting food = DISGUSTING (how could you serve slimy sushi like that? our salmon was streaky with brown spots on it!!!)  can't believe i ate here.. my poor tongue and stomach."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go to this place after seeing the reviews. Afterwards, I was left scratching my head wondering if I had gone to the wrong restaurant, because this place is really sub par. I only ordered takeout, so I can't vouch for how the service is, but as for food, it was some of the most bland sushi I have ever tasted. The crunchy spicy tuna rolls were not crunchy and had no flavor at all. Usually most spicy tuna rolls will have a nice toasted sesame flavor, but that wasn't anywhere to be found. Both the veggie tofu soup and the dumpling soup had no flavor whatsoever. The chicken and steak teriyaki combo had almost no sauce on it and the chicken tasted like someone grilled a chicken breast and seasoned it with nothing but a hint of pepper. The steak was well done even though we asked for it to be medium. Also, don't use their online ordering service. Aside from denying the order after we entered the correct credit card information twice, the prices online are screwed up. Its a good thing they denied the order, because when we called in and made the same order on the phone, it turned out to be $11 cheaper than it would have been if we had ordered it online. If you want sushi just go to Sakura near the Arbys in Strongsville."}
{"text":"Not worth the price and I dunno how they are still open especially on nuns island! They have a competitor sushi palace just across!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was not. Stopped by recently for the first time love their bento box. All the ingredients were fresh. The atmosphere was nice. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Picked up take out hibachi. Inside very clean and modern. Food fresh and flavorful. Price is reasonable. I hope that they are around for a while."}
{"text":"1rst time there, ordered a plate of sushi but everything tasted bad, not fresh, smoked salmon had small white spots on it so I had to throw it out. Today, I gave it another chance and ordered a sauteed seafood udon hoping a cooked meal will be better. Nope, it was just as bad, got 2 small shrimps, 1 mussel, 1 scallop and some shredded imitation crab meat. The scallop did not taste as it is supposed to; gamy, disgusting, probably stored in the freezer for way too long. Therefore, I did not take the chance for the mussel...only the udon noodles. Nothing is fresh and it's a Japanese restaurant. I will never return there, I DO NOT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick dinner. Service was great!  I had the miso soup,  avocado salad and 2 rolls on special.  Everything was spot on! The avocado salad had an entire perfectly ripened fresh avocado sliced on top of a nice mix of greans, not your typical blend.  The sushi was very fresh tasting. Loved it! The happy hour specials are great as well. Was very impressed! So happy this place opened near me!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. But the service is awful. Our server was so rude & I'm so embarrassed for even suggesting this place. It's going to be a while before we go back. Maybe she'll have an attitude adjustment by then. As servers ourselves at a successful restaurant in Tremont, we know & appreciate excellent service. & this place was definitely a disappointment in that department."}
{"text":"Awesome \"little hole in the wall\"  The Bento box I had was really good and their Gyoza was simply the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"The reason why no one reviewed this place is because no one goes here.  They have NO repeat customers because their food is not fresh and presentation is shit.  I dont know how they even pay rent.   Ps.  If u r tipping, give it directly to the servers because the cheap ass Korean owners pocket them if you throw it on ur debit or credit cards."}
{"text":"I was not going to go here because I thought it was just a Sushi place but I totally misjudged it by its name!  They have delicious Appetizers (potstickers) and Hibachi and much more.   The decor and ambiance is contemporary and clean yet comfortable!  Finally, an independent new restaurant in Middleburg Hts!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Clean, friendly, fast and the best sushi we have found since we moved to the cle area. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I'm torn. On the one hand, the beef, chicken, scallops & shrimp was VERY well cooked & generous.  On the other hand it is VERY heavy on the packaged sauce (teriyaki), it is very Chinese stir fry in its entire taste & appearance which makes sense because they're Chinese, but what really put me off was getting sand in my scallops.  Bleccgh.  I will give them another shot because I really think the portions are good for the price (take the Lunch specials, ignore the rest) but the sand in the scallop thing? I better not get that again.  I'm on the fence. I need a second try before confirming.   Also could they please turn the lights on? I could barely read the menu. I'm not THAT old, but it was way too dark."}
{"text":"Leur menu midi est très généreux. Pour 21$ vous avez une variété interessante de sushi et de sashimi mélangés. Les tranches sont épaisses et goûteuses. La qualité du sushi est extraordinaire. La fraîcheur du poisson comme je l'ai rarement vue.  Le service est ok, disons poli.  Le prix est raisonnable même pour le souper, vu la qualité des pièces présentées.  Je recommande le thon saisi. Le tartare est étrange, je ne l'ai pas aimé. Bières japonaises & vin au verre."}
{"text":"Good service and ok sushi..pricey for what you get.  That's my summary of this restaurant. I came here one day after craving sushi for weeks and ended up ordering the large sushi boat to share with my husband. When it arrived (a very long time after we ordered despite the restaurant being empty), we were super excited because it looked amazing. However, bite after bite, we found ourselves to be underwhelmed with rolls  tasting bland and all tasting the same with the occasional surprising good roll every now and then.  Our server was very very nice but I am not sure that we would be back. Around $70 for two people (no drinks) is a little steep for subpar sushi.....no?"}
{"text":"Just tried Umi Sushi for the first time as a visitor from Brooklyn with locals. Lovely evening - great food, tasteful decor, mellow atmosphere and excellent service. The food was fresh, and a great sushi selection. Nice to know this little gem is on Nun's Island. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I've been coming every week because it is so delicious. The staff is so attentive, the food is amazingly fresh and the flavors are subtle yet delicious. And the presentation is amazing! I love Umi Sushi!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and excellent hospitality. Most importantly very affordable prices for lunch."}
{"text":"The price was right for what we got. Missed the mark with overcooked rice and poorly prepared tuna. Will need to return to better assess but it was not what we expected."}
{"text":"Always fresh and always yummy.  The spicy tuna has just the right amount of heat and perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Our first visit...and everything was absolutely delicious!  We loved every bite and we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Umi is quickly becoming one of my favorite sushi spots in the southwest suburbs. We've been here twice now and both times have been outstanding. I always roll (pun intended) with the sushi platter which is 9 pieces of nigiri and a tuna roll. The fish is always fresh and the sushi is well put together. My wife likes the hibachi chicken except for the fact that they use way too much pepper on everything. I tasted hers and I can agree...and I love pepper. It takes away from the other flavors a bit. The miso that accompanies the entrees is excellent, our two year old can't get enough of it. As for the salad that also comes with...one of the better ones around. It's not the standard iceberg with carrots that you get at most places. It's a fresh romaine blend with shaved radishes and the homemade dressing is out of this world. As for the service, both times everything was great. We really enjoy Umi and we look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Nice sushi for a suburban, strip mall located place.  Had the sushi roll lunch combo.  Good miso soup, solid salad (not all iceberg and good ginger dressing), and the sushi rolls had a very good filling/fish to rice ratio.  Kitchen food looked and smelled good.  Reasonable prices and fast service. Also, they have some decent happy hour specials.  The food reminds me of Daishin (closed) in North Olmsted.  To nitpick, I rather not hear WDOK music and I don't like tempura flakes in spicy tuna (when did that become a thing?).  Overall a good experience, would return."}
{"text":"Have dined in and had takeout from Umi several times now, very good each time! You can't beat their happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been there a few times now and I love the sushi. The prices are good and the service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Food was great and the service was friendly! Can't wait to go back! The Godzilla roll was my favorite!!"}
{"text":"I went here with few coworkers and I can possibly say this was the worst sushi I have ever had! It wasnt fresh, over priced and their appetizers tasted like they had been in the fridge for over a week. It was a party of 3 and our bill was 80 dollars, in which the tip was already added which I would have been okay with I'd the service and food wasn't so bad. I wouldn't recommend going here"}
{"text":"Very helpful friendly staff. The sushi was fresh and delicious. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I went here about two years ago and just joined Yelp. It was such a horrible experience that I still remember it.  Sushi was warm (and not in the good way), ice cream was rock hard.  Better choices for sushi buffet are Spring Rolls, 168 Sushi buffet, and Kanda. All are much better.  On top of the attrocious food, they build the tip in to the receipt. Now I expect this for tables of 6 or more, but not two people!!!   Never going back again."}
{"text":"If you are loking for a great cozy place for some good sushi or  teriyaki dishes this is the place. The sushi is always fresh and service is friendly. They have a great lunchtime special for 12.99$. Great food for what you pay for."}
{"text":"Since moving from NY to Cleveland we have had a hard time finding really good Japanese food. The sushi is very high quality as well as all of the appetizers we had tried so far. The service is great too. We live in Strongsville and this is definitely one of our go-to places for an outstanding meal."}
{"text":"The location and exterior of this restaurant are incredibly deceiving. From the outside it appears that it would be just a mediocre sushi joint in the middle of suburbia. However, once you start eating, the experience and food is stellar. The waitstaff was friendly and personable making sure our tea was always filled and we had everything we needed. With just my husband and myself we ordered the grilled whole squid app which was cooked perfectly although a bit more spicy than I expected at first. After the first bite of heat it was heavenly, a mixture of the seafood with a smokey grilled flavor and a spicy mayo sauce. Then we ordered a sushi platter for two which included 2 regular rolls, 1 special roll, and 1 signature roll. We went with the tuna roll, Alaska roll, two thumbs up roll and the Godzilla roll. The winner for us by far was the Godzilla roll which we devoured. Overall really great meal for $50 including tip for two. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this new restaurant.  I ordered the chicken and veggie bento box for lunch.  Miso soup was hot and tasty, salad was fresh with perfect amount of dressing.  Cali roll and shumai was good.  Chicken with veggies was hot, fresh and yummy.  It was 2:30 so no wait for a table and service was excellent.  Total cost with hot tea was only $8.91 + tip.  Great food at a Great price!"}
{"text":"Best fast casual Japanese in the area. Get the hibachi noodles; game-changing flavor. Also, the wasabi tobiko sushi with quail egg yolk is pretty phenomenal."}
{"text":"The wife and I went for lunch today.  Clean, quiet place with fast, friendly service.  I had the Sashimi Lunch, she had the General Tso's Chicken Lunch Bento Box (she had me eat her sushi pieces).  The food was well presented and tasted very good but not quite great.  Very good value on all of the lunch specials."}
{"text":"This little gem is rated 4.5 stars on Yelp. So I gave it a try. Yes, great sushi place where you wouldn't expect it. Lots of artistic detail go's in to each dish. And better yet it tastes great too."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi restaurants i've ever been to in my life !! It was intensely good. Lol. We got here around lunch and OH-Em-Gee! I've never been so satistied with my meal like this haha. Made me wish they have one in California.   The Bentos are SOO bomb ! They made everything freshly cooked. All the sushi are nothing like i've had before, we've been to a lot of sushi restaurants so saying this is quite a statement. Big portions and Ingredients are all on point! So flavorful and just really delicious. It is a little pricey but absolutely worth it.   Looking at the place from the outside, you'd think it's a small ugly restaurant lol but don't judge. When you get inside the restaurant, it's really cute & very clean. Our server was so nice and friendly.  Must come back!"}
{"text":"Love Umi Sushi. Always fresh, always friendly.  I am by no stretch of the imagination a sushi connoisseur, but I know what tastes good and I know what tastes fresh, and that's what I get at Umi Sushi. Their presentation is always very nicely done as well.   I have ventured a little bit off the sushi menu as well, and have found their other offerings to be good too. The Yaki Udon Seafood Noodle, for example, is where I usually land if I'm not going all sushi/sashimi. I've also had their more \"Americanized\" dishes such as the General Tso Chicken, but I would recommend sticking to what they're good at; Sushi!   Finally, I would highly recommend their chocolate lava cake for dessert. I know, I know, it sounds crazy ordering dessert from a sushi joint, but this cake is to die for. I'm certain it's from a box or some other pre-prepared arrangement that's cooked up in the microwave, but it's delicious! And I wouldn't lie about chocolate cake!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. The presentation was beautiful, excellent service, relaxing decor and extremely clean. The prices were reasonable and everything tasted very fresh. Best Spicy Tuna Roll, Salad, and Pink Lady we've ever had. I was also pleasantly surprised to find they serve beer, wine and Saki, though I wish they served mixed drinks as well. Overall though, this was the best sushi I've had in years and by far blows all the other local sushi places out of the water. Very impressed."}
{"text":"The place looks good inside, however the quality of the sushi is really so-so... As well, for the price you pay, you may as well go to another restaurant downtown to get better sushi."}
{"text":"I eat sushi a lot but only in Georgia there is nothing ne that I love and it's the same as this one but this sushi is amazing I love it and we will be back..."}
{"text":"The sushi here is so fresh! They have very fair pricing and always have our take out orders ready in under 15 mins. We order from here all the time and will continue to do so. Also they are very helpful with dietary restrictions. And The mints they have are the front desk are delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered the teriyaki chicken lunch special to go. Came with a good amount of chicken and mixed vegetables, rice, 4 pieces of a California roll, 3 fried dumplings, miso soup, and a spring mix salad for only $8.75. All of it was fresh and neatly packaged. They seemed a little rushed/overwhelmed when I went to pick it up but I think it was because the restaurant is new and it was during lunch hour. Hope to go back soon. Interior isn't huge but it's brand new and well appointed."}
{"text":"Found this sushi restaurant through Yelp reviews and agree this is a great find. A cute restaurant tucked in a small strip mall. I did carry out of a couple of rolls & their dumpling soup. The dumpling soup was delicious, rolls were good but a little pricey (their special rolls). I would recommend a visit here and would return again."}
{"text":"Great staff, excellent variety and my roll was very fresh. Definitely a must stop for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"I'm sporadically regular customer of Umi Sushi for years. The restaurant is still the best sushi joint on Nun's Island although relatively pricey. It is also a little cozy place with real table cloths and small sushi bar, where you can wait to pick your take away. There is a nice fish selection in the sushi list, variety of rolls and fresh sashimi you can fill your sushi boat with. The menu has also a good choice of dishes. The service has been always very attentive. My last visit was on Friday night and the personnel was definitely overwhelmed with the amount of people they need to take care of, two people were struggling to run in between the tables to take care of the customers orders."}
{"text":"What a great place.  The staff is so eager to please.  Everything is so delicious and served timely."}
{"text":"Really loved the food!  Excellent and so fresh.  Music not so good.  Same elevator piano song over and over.  Recommend a change.  Other than that - awesome!  Highly recommend you try."}
{"text":"I love having Umi Sushi so close by! Everything we order is always fresh and delicious! All of the food presentation is beautiful even for take out."}
{"text":"This place is legit! The chef really knows what he's doing. The service was lovely. Everything we ordered was so flavorful. I'll be coming here every time I visit Ohio now. Pictures say it all."}
{"text":"The last time I tried Uni Sushi, their peanut butter dumpling appetizer tasted like dishwasher water and their fried calamari were uninspired and bland.  It's a shame, because I had good memories of their sushi many years ago. There's not many dining options in nun's island, even fewer good ones, and sadly this isn't one of the good ones."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant, but luckily my friend and I beat the rush for dinner! The tables are close to each other too, so be comfortable having people around you while you eat.   The service was very quick and polite. I also love how they name each of the item once they serve it to you. It was like the star of the show was being presented to us.  FOOD TIME! First things first, I had to get the gyoza. We didn't even wait too long for it, and the presentation was BEAUTIFUL. (Look at my picture) I took a bite, and WOW, it was one of the tastiest gyoza I've had. I'm sure it's difficult to make bad gyoza, but this one didn't have that generic taste that you get with heating up frozen gyoza. It was the perfect size- I wasn't struggling with my chopsticks to pick it up. It had the optimal filling to wrapper ratio; I enjoyed those bites for sure.  Then, I ordered the salmon nigiri (salmon sushi) and the Angel Roll. The salmon nigiri has PERFECT fish to rice ratio! I love it when sushi places don't put a huge wad of rice!!!!!!! They didn't skimp on the fish either. As for the Angel Roll, it was subpar. I think there was a horseradish sauce on it, and I'm not a big fan of horseradish, so eating it was not as enjoyable as eating the gyoza. But the presentation yall...... so beautiful. (Again, look at my picture)   Overall, I'm not gonna judge a sushi place because I didn't enjoy the taste of the roll. The fish was fresh and the ratios mentioned above were on point. I will definitely come again to check out the other rolls (and order more gyoza)."}
{"text":"First time trying Umi.   I picked up takeout of teriyaki tofu and a few vegetarian maki rolls.   First impression the interior was very clean,  bright and nicely done.  Staff was attentive and very happy to help me.  Food is very good everything fresh and seasoned well.   I hope Umi does well and I will surely be a repeat customer after this first experience!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at this restaurant when I have cravings for AYCE Sushi. This last visit however, the tempura shrimp was a little soggy..  The lady owner could be a little more friendly though. She hardly smiles....  The tip was already added to my bill (for my party of 5) so it came to almost $150 which was not the best value in town."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here today for a nice lunch, we weren't expecting much but boy we're we blown away. Their food, service, price, and environment was amazing! For an appetizer we got the spicy garlic edamame which wasn't too spicy or even to garlic-y. My boyfriend got the lunch special of 3 sushi rolls (he chose spicy salmon, eel, and California roll) which consisted of a total of 18 pieces for only $10.75, he loved everything about the sushi and went on to say it may be the best sushi he's had. I ordered the teriyaki tofu bento box and it was delicious. Both our meals came with soup and salad as well. For two meals and an appetizer we only paid $25 which is a deal. We will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Great new sushi place.  Don't let the strip mall concern you. Very clean and modern. Staff is great. Food is fresh and well prepared. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant we will most certainly be coming back to! We made a reservation for dinner as it was Mother's Day and we had not been there before. As we walked in the hostess acknowledged our reservation and gave us a table for for as we were a group of 2 and a baby in a carrier. We needed the extra space since we each ordered an appetizer and didn't realize our entree came with soup and salad for each. Our sever was very prompt on clearing plates and refilling our drinks. The food was delicious with our favorite being the Angry Dragon. Presentation of food was beautiful too!"}
{"text":"It was simply, okay.  I eat a lot of sushi in different states, monthly.  The menu was impressive. Only ordered a couple small rolls & miso soup. My spicy peppered tuna roll was not enticing or appetizing. The tuna was grey & dry, not red ... definitely not fresh. Miso was good. Did not like the add on charge to have seaweed outside of rice. Larger rolls were a bit pricey.  Service was eh.  One server with service about a 2/5.  I wouldn't rush back again, unless I went for happy hour."}
{"text":"When my dining companions suggested that we visit a new sushi place in a strip mall on Pearl Road in Middleburg Height, I'll admit I was skeptical! What we have here, though, is a totally solid sushi bar, friends! The ingredients are fresh, the portions are generous, and the price is right! As an added bonus, there were plenty of menu options for the less adventurous eaters in our party; my dad enjoyed a heaping portion of General Tso's Chicken and my mom raved about her tender, flavorful hibachi steak! The interior of the restaurant is bright, modern, and sparkling clean and the service was wonderfully attentive. We all agreed that we would hop at the chance to come back again!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  The hubs and I were looking for someplace to get sushi as it was our first date night after baby - and I hadn't had sushi in 9 months and was craving it like woah. This place fit the bill perfectly since it had to be close to his parents house as we had 2 hours to work with before baby got hungry again.  We started with the chili garlic edamame as another Yelper recommended - really nice! Not too spicy and still tasted like edamame.  For dinner we ordered the Maki for Two which came with 2 regular, 1 signature and 1 special roll all for about $35. It also included salad and miso soup. This is a great deal. We figured they would make the rolls smaller for a presentation like this, nope! We got a ton of sushi and were stuffed by the end of the meal, couldn't even finish the last few pieces! The presentation was delightful - did not seem like strip mall sushi presentation - seemed much more fancy. The sushi was also so fresh and and the rolls were creative. Our favorite that we had was the Umi Roll. Do yourself a favor and get that one.  Last, service was great and the decor inside is much nicer than you might expect from the outside. Very impressive, Umi Sushi. Thanks for a great meal."}
