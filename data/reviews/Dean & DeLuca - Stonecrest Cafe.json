{"text":"I asked multiple times if my pizza looks proper or not! They confirmed multiple times that it looks OK and then tried find an excuse since I was insistent. I responded that I would be more appreciative if they would have accepted their fault right away without me repeating the same question three times. The day before both condensing coils had ice on the display cabinets and they were dripping all over the deserts. I warned employees multiple times to get it addressed. They should not serve the deserts that got water shower but I saw some of them selling those desserts that day and the next day too. This store needs a manager and should certainly improve the customer service and operational quality."}
{"text":"Place has really gone down hill. Bread is stale, lots of workers milling around but no one asking if you need help. In fact, they almost seem put off when you ask if they can help. Then (in my recent experience) even when they do help, they completely get the order wrong. Very different experience when you go to Phillips Place. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Always have a great salad....except this time i ate some semi frozen romaine lettuce and an UN-ripe, hard avocado.  C'mon man."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the sandwiches and salads here, especially being able to make my own. The rest of the food and beverages appear to be of high quality, but I usually run in for some lunch and haven't tried much else. There is a nice area to sit outside and enjoy your food if you have the time."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! We've had hot and cold entrees, desserts, salads, sandwiches, and bottles pasta sause, pesto, etc. I don't like that I have to walk to the back to order food, then to the front to pay, then to the middle to sit and eat. Wish they had table servers, but I'm not going to cut their rating because that is just their setup. All food is fresh and delicious. One exception: their recipe for 7-layer bar has raisins, which is not to my liking, even though I like raisins. They just don't belong in a 7-layer bar.  Really miss the D&D at the lake. Used to get Christmas baskets there for employees and it was easy and perfect. Maybe they'll come back..."}
{"text":"My wife and I would always make a trip to Dean & Deluca when visiting her parents. During this last trip we went in for lunch. A few hours later she was violently ill due to what we suspect was old soup. She vomited for 6 hours straight. Nobody else in our family was ill, so it wasn't the flu, as only she and I ate there.   I also felt ill after eating a cajun chicken sandwhich. I noticed the top of the remoulade container was crusted over.  We will never eat at this location again."}
{"text":"Tried Dean & Deluca for lunch the other day. I agree with the other posters, that it seems to be a little overpriced. I also ordered the \"sirloin\" sandwich, and was expecting something more steak-like than a cold roast beef sandwich. The service was good and they have some unique items, but it just didn't impress me very much."}
{"text":"Always a favorite no matter the city. I'm always extremely satisfied when I leave Dean & Deluca. Whether it's a small quiet location like this or a packed one in NYC, it seems the same to me.  It has everything, soups, salads, sandwiches, sushi, etc. All the drinks you could ask for and not to mention the sweets. Once I spot a Dean & Deluca I have to run in and admire all the cupcakes, cookies, brownies, candies and cakes.  I try to do the right thing and get a small cup of butternut squash soup for lunch but rather find myself leaving with an entire cake (able to feed a small army).  Dean & Deluca is a great restaurant with amazing food & service!"}
{"text":"The fun thing about Dean &Deluca is it reminds me of snobby back home up north specialty food stores.  And I like it.  It's not a full service grocery store.  The store is divided into a candy/chocolate counter, dessert counter, meat/cheese counter, a fresh premade counter(with cold noodle salads, fruit and egg salads, lasagna, etc.), wine aisle, and high priced fancy cooking gadgets(you should only buy if your serious), and a small coffee counter.  It has the best candy/chocolate selections.  And you can sample before you pick which candy/chocolate you'd like and by weight.  If you dont want to pick and choose they have a lot prebagged next to the counter.  I really like the special kinds of whatever covered almonds, and corn salsa.  I would skip the coffee;it'd be better to drive back to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Its a high end (which means High Priced) deli. While their food is really good the only turnoff is the prices. i understand that they use good quality foods but $75 for a small cake??"}
{"text":"Awesome service, great food and coffee, cozy inside. This is a smaller version of the Southpark Phillip's Place location. They have a great outdoor patio with a view of the fountain to enjoy on sunny days. The inside is smaller with some tables in the back and a few by the windows and a couple in the center around the wine. The only downside is that the sweets are way overpriced compared to other stores like Reid's or Amelie's."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance here but it is far too expensive for what you get. I had a turkey sandwich for around $9 and it came with no sides.  Ordered a small ice tea and it was $2.71 for a very small cup.  Looked at the chicken salad in the case. It was $16.00/lb.  The desserts also look amazing but cheesecake was $10.50. The place was empty for the hour I sat there and I think others would agree the prices are just too high.  I love the coffee and other drinks/food but won't come often."}
{"text":"This is a spacious location which is great for mom with a mammoth stroller!  My mom's group meets here for coffee occasionally and it is a wonderful spot to stretch out and relax!   The coffee is delicious as are the pastries.  I need to come back for lunch/dinner.   One small complaint - there is not a changing table in the ladies' room.  I'd certainly give 5 stars if they installed one....:-)"}
{"text":"Oh My Goodness!!!  No other words can fully explain how awesome it is to walk into this cafe looking for a sweet tooth fix!!!   This review will be totally based on the desserts, but I do look forward to going back and trying their deli items.   But back to the sweets; they have everything you could possibly want to enjoy. Cookies, cakes, cupcakes, brownies, scones...I could go on and on!   The presentation here was excellent! When I walked in the store was clean and had a very open floor plan...but my eyes found the dessert counter and it was a wrap after that!   The staff was super friendly, I was greeted right away and given plenty of suggestions and ideas on what to try. I ended up going with a red velvet cupcake.  The cupcake was moist and very good, not to over powering with icing! But a real treat was the there was cream cheese filling in the cupcake!  Overall, this was an awesome visit! Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Got a 11$ sand which and it was tasteless, small, and plain. Idk how they can even charge that much for a basic sand which. I will not  go back ..."}
{"text":"Dean and Deluca at Stonecrest is a great place for lunch, coffee, dessert, or to grab a few high end groceries to enjoy at home!  For lunch I personally love their tuna salad sandwiches on wheat and their tomato & gouda cheese soup.  It's served cafeteria style so you can either grab it to go or take a seat at one of their small tables inside or on the patio.  It's a pretty solid lunch spot as they have changing daily specials as well as their solid staple choices, but what I love at D&D is their dessert case.  They have so many amazing desserts: cupcakes, , cookies, brownies, full and personal-size cakes, lemon bars...too many for a quick order.  You'd think I was making a decision regarding national security if you were to watch me in front of their dessert options.  Favorite desserts would have to be the carrot cake, red velvet cupcake, mint chocolate chip cake, and lemon bars.  They're all the perfect size to split with two people (unless you really want to indulge...I won't judge).  The grocery portion has great wine selections so it's an awesome afternoon if you can make your way out onto the patio with a slice of cake, glass of wine and a good friend!"}
{"text":"I like the wide selection in food items here. I always have difficulty ultimate time deciding on which to get when I drop in for lunch with friends. Service and cleanliness is topnotch I love eating outdoors on nice days. My only disappointment is that I feel lunch specials are lacking for the price. I'd love to see combo put together that offered a side and/or drink. I leave hungry but at least $10 poorer. Not cool!"}
{"text":"While not as well-stocked as the Philips Place location, this little store-front has a lot to offer... whether you are looking for a cup of coffee, a  delicious sweet treat, or a prepared salad or entree, they have a bit of everything. It's also nice to stop in for a beer or wine before sitting on the patio to catch a bit of music during the spring/fall outdoor music series."}
{"text":"Consistently good food  beautifully presented.  Don't expect any bargains - prices are New York prices."}
{"text":"I take Dean/Deluca for granted but this morning I was at a loss of where to go for a bite before our Easter Sunday brunch - I get up early and can't wait until noon to eat - so I went to breakfast at D/D.  As always there coffee is outstanding and as I was drinking my coffee and eating my eggs/toast/fruit salad/bacon I wondered why this place is always a go to place when I am at a loss of where to go. I feel you get good value; by that I mean in the afternoons you can buy a bottle of wine and sit outside and drink from a real wine glass and just enjoy the Charlotte weather or you can order a pizza and a bottle of wine - for $20 - and enjoy the weather plus the fantastic value of your order. I am not sure why folks complain about the sandwiches or what they are comparing them to but I always found their sandwiches to have top quality ingredients and to be delicious.  I also favor their Phillips Place store for great cheeses and salamis. Yes they are pricey but  if you can taste the difference between Boar's Head and real French or Italian cheese and salami then this is the place to shop for them in Charlotte. They have, in my opinion, the best selection of imported cheese and salami in Charlotte. For your kid's lunch Boar's Head is fine but when you are doing a special hor hourves platter they are the place to go. One other thing is that, yes, Amelie's also has great coffee and the best pastries but I never see a tip jar at Dean & Deluca like I do at Amelie's and other places. I think D/D is a class act."}
{"text":"Somethings here are ridiculously priced (cakes), but others are just right and delicious!  The pizza is very good and the beer and wine prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Dean & Deluca Market Cafe in Stonecrest is a just a stone's throw from me and I enjoy coming here for a quick and easy dinner.  It's perfect on those weeknights when I just really don't want to cook anything. And there's lots of seating both inside and outside.  My choices have primarily stayed with the salads and the pizzas. I really like the spinach salad with chicken and my hubby really enjoys the sandwiches and soups. They are willing to customize your salad and sandwiches, so it's great for picky eaters. I have experienced that they tend to run out on some soups - so if you're hankering for soup - try to get there early.  It tends to be quiet on weeknights but the service is usually very friendly.   The dessert case is always tempting and I usually give into something - one of my favorites is their key lime tart.  It's really good! It has her perfect amount of tart shell to the key lime filling.  I'll continue to keep Dean & Deluca on my list for those \"too lazy to cook\" nights :)."}
{"text":"the people that work here are super nice!  the chocolate babka is obviously really good.  I've had the tiramisu, chocolate cake, oreo cheesecake and coconut pineapple cake here as well. The coconut pineapple cake is definitely the best thing I've tried. the rest of the desserts were good just not amazing. Definitely had had better tiramisu elsewhere. Kind of overprice though. the slices of cake were like 8-10 bucks."}
{"text":"Great place for coffee and dessert or maybe a glass of wine.  It's a great atmosphere in the spring and summer when there are live bands outside.  I usually only go here before or after a movie at Stonecrest or for an after dinner treat.  The foods in the deli case do not look very appealing and I would not suggest any of them, go to Harris Teeter instead if that's what you are looking for."}
{"text":"I have never been to the Dean & Deluca, located towards the front of Stonecrest, but I am so glad I made a stop last night for some sweet treats.  After dinner at Smashburger, I decided to check out Dean & Deluca and see what they have to offer.  All of the employees that I encountered were extremely friendly and helpful.  Within the shop they have wines, salads (potato, tuna, chicken, pasta), packaged items such as nuts and pretzels, I saw pizza boxes, so I am assuming they do pizza - but what I was looking for was some dessert.  Holy cow, do they have desserts!  Cakes, cheesecake, cupcakes, tarts, chocolates - amazing.   The have whole cakes, but most of the choices were single servings.  I chose a vanilla cupcake, which was meh - cake had the taste of a poundcake, but slightly lighter, but it was dry and not terribly good.  Icing was fine, but not in my top 5 of cupcake choices.  It was late in the evening, so it was probably fresher that morning.  My other choice was a pumpkin pecan bar and it was excellent (eaten the day after purchase after spending the night in the fridge).  Good pumpkin flavor with plenty of pecans, nice crust that held together well.  So rich though - it was hard to finish.  I also picked up a Beef Jerky chocolate bar (WHAT?!) for my boss who likes interesting eats.    Wine by the glass.  Nice seating area with high top tables/chairs.  One side was more of the deli/food service, while the other was wine and desserts.  Lovely, clean space and I am looking forward to returning to try more."}
{"text":"This location has really gone down hill. We came for breakfast and the fruit had mold on it. We returned it with the cashier asking if we wanted anything else.  The outdoor patio area is quite littered with tea bags and other debris.   No changing table for kids."}
{"text":"Been in here a number of times for breakfast and lunch, mostly as we transfer grandchildren between parents and us or just as a casual fast food alternative to the burger places.  They have a great array of salads and a number of sandwiches along with soups.  That said, it takes for ever to get a sandwich made or to get someone to scoop out salad for you.  Nice staff, but one just get the feel that they lack organization.  They want to satisfy, but get in their own awkward way in doing it.  I think the prices are higher than they need to be.  And although there are lunch lines here, they are not as long as they are at other places in this mega-mall area.  I guess voting with your feet might be an indicator that all is not well here.  But it is convenient for us and breakfast is the best bet, although the sun will blast you out due to the siting of the restaurant and windows."}
{"text":"I regularly visit Dean & Deluca with friends for wine and sushi and I must say it's never let us down so far.  You can find good wine at a reasonable price and the same goes for sushi.  I have yet to branch out and try their hot/cold food but I hear very good things.  Their coffee/espresso bar hits the spot and they have soymilk!  Score!  The place is clean and the staff is very helpful.  The one and ONLY complaint I have (and the reason there are only four stars instead of five) is the uncovered pastry counter.  I will never eat a pastry at Dean & Deluca until they start putting them behind a glass case.  Seems way too unsanitary for me.  And flies always seem to find a way in to places like this.  Please - D&D, if you're reading this, cover those cupcakes!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Southpark location.  This location is another story. Staff are not friendly and the food I would avoid. The coffee is still okay and I do like that they offer herbal ice tea. The store itself is needs a deep clean. The tables seems to be rarely cleaned."}
{"text":"Well another wonderful experience.  Annika is fantastic.  Made my day    made my favorite drink so when I got to the register it was ready. Love her!!!! Everyone should go to Dean and deluca now"}
{"text":"I love the Dean & DeLuca concept but unfortunately this Stonecrest location cannot hold a candle to the original Charlotte SouthPark location. I found this especially troubling because I have tried and tried to like it, as it is a half mile my home; however, I have finally given up. There are just too many better choices around the area, including the HarrisTetter deli located in the same shopping center.  I have tried both breakfast and lunch here over the past several years, and have found everything to be average at best. Even the coffee leaves a lot to be desired. On my last visit I had breakfast and although the serving size was plentiful, the eggs were dry and the service just fair. The staff in general seemed uninterested and apathetic at best.  Nothing is horrible mind you, it's just average; yet, Dean & DeLuca's prices are anything but. I'm sad to say that two stars is best I can give and that may be a stretch."}
{"text":"Permanently closed! So sad to not have this place in Ballantyne anymore! They had a lovely outdoor dining area and very fresh food!  We will miss this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited your store around 8:00 pm on March 8, 2017, the staff were helpfull, but the food we ordered was stale!  My orange cupcake was cold, dry & stale and so was the piece of oreo chocolate cake my husband got.  We also got a bag of 6.00 red fish and they were very hard.  This place needs some fresh food or new management to make sure it gets better fresh food!  We were very disappointed!  We gave 1 star for the bottled water to help us choke down the stale cake!"}
{"text":"Although ALL D & D  market Tropicana as \"Fresh Orange Juice\" Yelp's management has decided that I could only warn fellow Yelpers about the one store that I had been to ..... and deleted the other reviews.  Fine, when I  find the time I'll check out each one in turn and report on them- unless other Yelpers ask the store they go to what \"Fresh\" Oj means.   8^P"}
{"text":"Everyone here is really nice and accommodating. I usually get a half a sandwich with a cup of soup and sometimes a dessert. I only gave it three stars because sometimes their desserts are very stale and sometimes they are amazing and perfect you just don't know until you bite into it and by then your money is already spent."}
{"text":"Hypothetically, I love Dean and Deluca. It's my kinda place: lots of fancy ingredients and prepared food, shiny cookware, and lots of stuff to covet but never buy due to lack of funds. Sigh.  Anyways, this isn't that kind of Dean and Deluca. This is, as the name says, just the cafe part. I'd like to give them more than 3 stars, but I can't. Here's why:  1) They're expensive. All Dean and Deluca's are, but read on. 2) The desserts are good, but the sandwiches are disappointingly mediocre, especially given point 1 3) I don't have a point 3, but did you know that the human mind prefers to have things in threes? Consider this list item to be my gift to you.  I'll stop by the D&D Market Cafe when I just want dessert and a coffee, but I think I'm done eating lunch here."}
{"text":"Oh, Dean and Deluca. You used to be so good, and it all went downhill. One couldn't ask for a better location, but there are so many things that this place does that bother me.   The food isn't bad, some of the stuff on the menu is actually quite good. It all seems pretty fresh and there's a wide variety. The dessert selection is vast and delicious as well. The service, though, is what bothers me. I have experienced some of the rudest workers I've ever seen. There is this attitude they have that is \"we're better than you and we know it\". Yeah right. I am a paying customer, I don't appreciate this. They're just rude and not happy.  The prices are also absurd. It's like $8 for a tomato and mozzarella sandwich, I mean really? The desserts are even worse. Last time I was here, the place was about 80 degrees inside and I just wanted to leave. Do yourself a favor and go to Qdoba, Smash, or TRUE instead of here."}
{"text":"I must praise D&D.  Their version of a Cobb salad, while not accurate to the actual recipe, is closer than most (Daily Grill is the only restaurant not named \"The Brown Derby\" to nail it, including the dressing and presentation). As a bonus, they assemble it for you freshly when you order, building the salad within the to-go box as you watch, putting the hardboiled eggs through the dicer and slicing half an avocado for the salad on the spot--dinner and a show.  Browsing the desserts and pastries section is like visiting an art gallery. The workmanship on some of the cakes is remarkable, and I've never had a bad dessert there (just ones I liked more than others).  The sandwiches are likewise very good and the portions are large.  They also feature splits of various wines, if you want a couple of glasses while you eat there or if you're assembling a picnic lunch on the fly. Sitting outside by the water fountain (which does a decent job of drowning out the noise from Rea Rd) can be a very enjoyable venue.  Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"I like places like these: outdoor dining, cafe food inside a market with lots of other goodies to take home (cookies, candy, coffee, chocolate, etc.). There is a decent amount of options for lunch, and the food is fresh and quickly made in front of you, visible for you to see. Service is very friendly and the interior as well as the exterior is great. Very good place for a casual lunch a bright day with a pal."}
{"text":"Overpriced, overrated, and my husband felt ill after eating a basic sandwich wrap. There was nothing special or delicious about the takeaway lunch food we paid $29 for. It gets two stars only because I was able to buy enough vegan salad and broccolini to get me through our 10-hour road trip."}
{"text":"Wife tried the chocolate brownie bite.  Said it was great.  I really haven't had anything negative occur in any of my frequent visits to this location.   Prices are a bit high but i know that and accept it."}
{"text":"I love Dean and Deluca...they always have the best sandwiches and salads!  When I arrived in town for Thanksgiving, it was the first place I visited.  I love that you can visit and get a whole meal to go, eat lunch there, or go for a dessert and coffee.  It truly is all things for all people.  I only wish we had one in Houston!"}
{"text":"I will agree, the establishment seems a bit snobby, but I really enjoy the sandwiches.  They are made with fresh ingredients and they whip them up pretty quickly, even when the line is kinda long.  I like to come here on gorgeous Sunday afternoons and grab a tuna sandwich and sit outside with a Fosters.  I have noticed that it is mostly an upper-middle class, older crowd, this doesn't sway me from coming here though.  The prices are a little steep for a sandwich and a beer, but the bread is fresh and the tomatoes that I had on my sandwich were so juicy and plump.  It is a nice place to sit and have a nice conversation near the fountain.  Go here for an afternoon delight."}
{"text":"I can always tell when a business (mostly restaurants) will close down. I have a sixth sense and am rarely wrong. I had been a long term customer for the last decade.  After my last few visits here I could tell this location was headed for trouble. But I didn't know BOTH locations were closing."}
{"text":"The price of the sandwiches has gone up, up, and up. I can't pay $10 or more for a sandwich! Desserts are too much for my pocket! Haven't been here in 2 years, plenty of other great places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Somehow, I had never eaten at a Dean & Delucas in my 30+ years on this Earth, but we decided to stop for lunch while running some errands in Charlotte last weekend getting ready for a wedding that night. Dean & Delucas is an upscale lunch counter in some fashion. The place is pristine, the selection is impeccable and the food is outstanding.  When we walked in the aroma of pizza hit me in the face, and at that point there was no other option than to get a pizza. I don't remember the name of the pizza (had pepperoni and sausage), but when I ordered it, the chef (Brandon) asked me a question. He asked me if I had ever had pizza at DandD and I replied no. He told me I'm not going to say you're going to love this pizza, but I'm pretty much saying youre going to love this pizza. He asked me to come back in from the patio after eating and let him know what I thought.  He was right, I loved that pizza. It was perfect. Doughy, but crispy. The perfect amount of cheese and sauce and delicious meats. Writing this review has me craving this damn pizza. (Side note: Kelly ordered the turkey avocado sandwich with banana peppers and it was spectacular too.)  Needless to say, they have created a fan and a customer. Shout out to Brandon for preparing a pizza like that. I plan on stopping in any time we are in Charlotte from now on.  That's my word and I'm sticking to it."}
{"text":"There is a special place in my heart for Dean & Deluca. This location is nestled close to my family's home so I come here pretty often with my mom.  At times can be pricey but you're in a D&D...   At the deli I usually split the turkey sandwich with avocado and alfalfa sprouts (HUGE) and split one of their salads too...heaven!  Sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful Charlotte weather."}
{"text":"Now- in my profile I admit I hate yuppie places. This is one of those. Yes the selection of cakes and sweet tooth galore items look wonderful, and my husband assures me the stuff that gets catered to his work is to die for I dont like places that charge way over the top prices whle the ceiling over the bakery box is peeling and the vents above your heads while eating your $8-9 sandwich had a ton of nasty dust on it.  Yes this place has a beautiful array of food choices to eat in or take home. the \"sirloin\" sandwich on the overhead menu that I ordered was described in the catering menu as a \"roast beef\", and that is what I got, slices of roast beef with COLD carmelized purple onions on cold sour dough bread. I for some dang reason thought I was going to get a sirloin steak like sandwich that would be warm! I also had a small amount of lobster bisque, which was REALLY good. my daughter had the classic pizza which was a cheese pizza with pepperoni and pretty good sausage.   i'm sorry but the only bargin in this place was the $10 pizza. over $5 for a slice of cake? and if you want the whole 2 layer 9\" round cake that will run you $48! un believable.  Now if the place was 5 star quality I could see charging prices like this. But my sandwich was $8 all by itself. and wasnt all that great. YUPPIE place. sorry but I can make a better sandwich at home.   the staff seemed very very pleasant"}
{"text":"My husband and I lived so close to Stonecrest and really, really wanted to like Dean and DeLuca. We gave it at least 4 tries before giving up. Every time we went there, we were disappointed. The baristas there have no idea what they are doing! They use a traditional espresso machine yet do not use a temperature gauge as they steam the milk. As a result, our lattes were always lukewarm or burned (milk burns over 170 degrees)! One visit, I brought my lukewarm drink back to the counter and explained the issue. The barista said she could either microwave it (which would ruin the espresso) or re-steam it (which is incredibly unsanitary). I said, \"No, I would like you to make this again, please.\" She obliged, and it was just okay. Pretty much every visit was similar to this.  There are plenty of nearby coffee shops that offer consistently better service, like Caribou Coffee on Fairview Rd. or Amelie's on Rea Rd.!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch with a few friends.  We all were very pleased with what we had.  Two of us had Spinach Salads and they were delicious. The spinach is combined with bacon, hard boiled egg, and croutons. It didn't need any additional meat as far as I am concerned. I choose the pear vinaigrette and loved it. The large and satisfying salad cost less than $7 (sold by the pound). My sister had their daily special sandwich, which was roasted chicken salad.  She is on a mission to find the best chicken salad in Charlotte, so she has tried many places.  She said that this was right up there.  The place is a wait on yourself type place.  It is clean, the staff seemed nice and helpful.  The sweet case looked incredible but I steered clear. We were catching up with an old friend and stayed for hours. No one needed our table so no one seemed to mind us staying.  I recommend for lunch and I would go back."}
{"text":"Went in today for a quick dinner. The food was bleh. Tomato basil soup seemed to have been scraped off the bottom of the pot. But the food is not the reason for this review. As we were cleaning up our table ready to head out my husband saw a huge cockroach. After I got a look at it I told him to tell the employees. The guy behind the sandwich counter put on a glove and came out to see it. At first he said it was a water bug. My husband chuckled and said \"ok dude\" after a few seconds of hesitation and looks of disgust he agreed that it was indeed a roach. Needless to say, my stomach is turning and I probably will never be back to this location again....Oh yeah, and there was no paper towels in the bathroom."}
{"text":"I'm so glad there are D&Ds in Charlotte! The coffee is great, as are their pastries. I love that you can buy chocolate babka here, too! I'll frequently have lunch al fresco in the Spring, Summer and Fall. Their sandwiches, salads and pizzas are delicious. They also have a great kids meal - a sandwich that comes with chips, and a cookie - that my son loves. It's conveniently located and the food and service are great. Love the D&D wine room in Southpark, too!"}
{"text":"Found in the same shopping center with Jo Jo China Bistro (and another several dozen shops), the location is great.  It's right next to the fountain, and on a warm spring night, the ability to pop in for a single-serving dessert and a drink, then sit on the patio by the fountain, or even around the corner and listen to music, is perfect.  What is missing is that the market cafe concept isn't quite the same as the full-fledged grocery store of other locations, such as Philips Place.  That's not to say that the other locations are actually full-fledged grocery stores, but if you've ever been, you should know what I mean.  Frankly, I think that Dean &amp; Deluca is missing a bit here.  The \"market cafe\" concept seems to be to just be off the mark.  I'm not a regular patron of either type, but it seems that the full-service location offers just about everything that the cafe does, and more, while the cafe falls just a bit short.  Perhaps the idea is that by putting the stripped-down version, they simply aren't selling items that won't sell in this environment, but I would have loved to have been able to purchase some wine and cheese and sit by the fountain and enjoy some music, but it wasn't possible.  The ability to get some dessert was nice, but it wasn't what I was after.  And Philips Place was too far away (and didn't have the music, or the rest of my party), so it was a bit of a let-down.  Another time, perhaps this would have fit better."}
{"text":"Ummm - overpriced.  $8.50 for a sandwich  with no side/drink? Yea, I have no idea why I keep going back.   I'll admit, the pizzas are good and their sandwiches are pretty unique.  My favorite is the Cajun Chicken Sandwich - Grilled chicken breast with light cajun spice (not freshly grilled... kinda subway style but def not processed), cajun mayo, really fresh cucumbers, and a hefty portion of avocado.   I usually get it panini pressed.  All of the produce is really high quality but nothing about their meats strikes me as special.   So why am I giving this place two stars?  It's incredibly overpriced for what you get.  If the sandwiches were more like 7 bucks, I'd eat lunch here every week.  But that's not because they're all that great.  More so because I work 5 min away, it's a healthy-ish option and I can go back to the office without feeling \"weighed down\".    Honestly, at the end of the day, D&D doesn't need to drop it's prices.  They get a good amount of business as they are in an affluent suburbia area.  They have something you can't find elsewhere and people are willing to pay for that.  They've clearly assessed supply and demand well so I can't blame them for their prices - it's a good business decision."}
{"text":"Great night to hang out on the spacious patio. Both the wine and beer selection were great with local craft brews available. I steered clear of the desserts, but they alway look great. Did I mention the beer was cold?"}
{"text":"Good place for a dessert or a meal on-the-go. There is not as much selection as the Phillips Place location but still, it has what you need. I am always impressed by the meal selections - sandwiches and pizzas cooked to your liking, yummy soups, and a large variety of pre-made sides, salads and meats you and purchase by the pound. There's also a dessert and coffee bar. On my most recent trip, I got a buckeye and a cake ball. I was disappointed in the buckeye - the chocolate outside was good, but the peanut butter inside was bland. The cake ball however, was very dense, moist & decadent. I should have gotten two of those!"}
{"text":"Oooooh Dean and DeLuca is always a stop for me for a quick fix of black coffee (always fantastic), but this time I tried their mango smoothie. So good and fresh. They also have food, desserts (cakes, cookies, etc), and cute to-go snacks -- a bit pricey though. Their staff are always friendly and knowledgeable. Their shared outdoor seating area with the fountain is also a great place to catch up with friends and enjoy the day!"}
{"text":"I'd never been quite so amazed as when I saw a Dean & Deluca in Charlotte. It's a little piece of New York set up in the south. Delicious baked goods, try the Macaroon Madness it's so good I got mad! So good that after tasting it the lady in front of me got one too and she didn't even want a bag because she knew she was going to handle it immediately.   The sandwiches are fresh, the people are pleasant and it's a shame they don't have one in LA."}
{"text":"I usually don't complain about prices. But, when the food doesn't match up to the price, it bothers me. This location of D&D is right up that alley.  6$ for a slice of chocolate cake is fine, but, it better be good. Was it? No.   Almond croissant was doused in almond extract. The flaky layers of what was probably once a good croissant was barely recognizable in this version.   The flatbreads though are freshly baked, reasonably priced and tasty. So it's been a hit or miss so far. For the right thing, I will still go back. Those tarts arms to be calling my name each time I am there. They will probably earn them an extra star soon, from me."}
{"text":"Terribly disappointed. We had a sweet tooth and went in to try it. They had a lot to offer and looked really good.  Unfortunately, after dropping $28 for 3 treats, we realized it was bad.. In fact, we likely ate $5 worth and the rest went in the trash.  We've heard a lot of good things but for us, just didn't work.  Looks like a million bucks but tastes like a dollar."}
{"text":"I've visited this location a few times and have been pleased overall. I usually get a frappe and coffee cake. On the last visit I decided to take the plunge and try some of the food. Ten dollars for a turkey sandwich with no drink or side is a lot, in my opinion, but I tried it anyway. As a matter of fact, the majority of their stuff is overpriced. The sandwich wasn't anything special. I've had better tasting turkey, so I won't be purchasing anymore food. I'll stick to the frappes, which I really enjoy. The atmosphere is nice and it looks great. I haven't experienced any poor customer service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Dean & Deluca's options. On my way to spend the day at the pool with some friends I decided to stop in and pick up some sandwiches and drinks. They have multiple prepared sandwiches, as well as allow you to make your own sandwiches. The service was spot on and everyone enjoyed their lunches.  Note: I also decided to purchase some chips, fruit, desserts and they were great."}
{"text":"I live in the area and this is the second time I've eaten at Dean and DeLuca in 15 years.... with that said I figured I'd give it a try again! I had half a panini and soup.  The panini which was supposed to be grilled and crispy was basically soggy and inedible.... I watched them make the sandwich they took the meat out and it's basically precut rolled meat like you would see in subway..... the sandwich was disgusting.   As for the soup it tasted like water with tons of salt in it.  There was a reason why I never ate here and I just remembered it tonight.   Oh and to top it all off my half a sandwich and small container of soup with nothing to drink and no chips cost me $11.50..... Thanks so much Dean and DeLuca for making me realize that there are so many other better places to eat a sandwich and a bowl of soup."}
{"text":"How I love you Dean and Deluca... I love your Cannoli's.... I love them so much, it allows me to forget the ones back home at this little joint in Little Italy SD.   You're coffee is grand as well, but it's the overall cost that keeps me from frequenting it as often as I would like.   I have yet to have tried any other food there, but I will... hopefully soon. Being on a tight budget kills me (saving to buy here in the QC-yep I said it... looks like I am staying).   But for now, I am pleased to bring a book, get a Cannoli, a cup of coffee and enjoy the simple pleasure of just that..."}
{"text":"Dean and DeLuca gives me a little feeling of NYC every time I go in. Yes, the one in Phillips Place is bigger and has more options, but with their outside dining possibilities in gives you the feeling of being where ever you want to be in the world."}
