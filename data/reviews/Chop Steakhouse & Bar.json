{"text":"An all-round, top-notch steak and seafood restaurant. The staff are well dressed and well behaved around customers, their attire isn't too formal but still very classy and professional. The service never fails to meet our needs and answers all questions without  hesitation or failure. Our waitress, forgot to catch her name, never failed to forget about our table and arrived every so often that it wouldn't bother us at all. She also recommended the daily special (an alcoholic drink) which we purchased and were very impressed with the well mix of alcohol and other juices, perhaps the best mix I've ever had (I don't drink much).  The food was brought out in a fair amount of time but the wait was completely worth it in the end. The 5 of us all got steak with either lobster or crab with different sides, but all of them tasted amazing and mixed so pleasantly well together. The steak(s) were very well cooked, seasoned, and not at all difficult to cut through. The food presentation was very attractive and enjoyable, also given a big amount of sides, which I dearly enjoyed.  The pricing was a bit higher than what I usually pay, but the quality of the meal was completely worth the price. Will visit again on my next arrival to Canada."}
{"text":"Alright I heard a lot about this place so I tried it today. I ordered a medium well New York Striploin Steak with chop cut fries. The steak was bland hard like a rock and to be honest I've tasted better for a cheaper price. Fries were alright again I've had better. The service and staff were phenomenal but I go to a restaurant for good food as well not just for service.   Enviroment to sit in: A Friendly staff: A+ Parking: A+ Food: C+ Service: A+ Price: B- Service: A+"}
{"text":"Stopped at Chop last weekend for a casual dinner out, and thought the food was quite good. I opted for the ahi tuna and wasabi infused mashed potatoes. Both were quite tasty (although I would have preferred the tuna without the sauce on it). Reviews from my fellow diners were overall good, and we also enjoyed a nice bottle of wine. I'd definitely return to try something else from their menu. A nice alternative for dining at Chinook, but a bit on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Excited to go to a new restaurant both for dining experience and social evening we chose Chop heard good reviews. Upon entering we were greeted immediately and seated just as quickly.  Walking through the dining area you can't help but notice the majesty of the decor and unique ambiance they have created.   Our server was very pleasant and informed of us drink specials and recommendations I had a Chop special Caesar it was perfect. I chose to have the chop experience ; sirloin ordered medium but came medium rare which i know is how steak should be eaten but when i see red it turns me off but ate it no matter was tasty  served with seasonal vegetables which were broccolini peppers squash stuffed crusted tomato all were lightly roasted enjoyed the veggies  mashed potatoes were not very good  could have used some sort of flavor - garlic mash? and too chunky I prefer smooth mashed potatoes. Desert menu was fine I had mini Jamaican rum cake it was meeh not authentic Jamaican rum cake ordered cappuccino and unfortunately it was very weak. So overall experience service was great ,love love love the decor but food was honestly JUST OK would expect a great steak at a steak house - sorry."}
{"text":"This restaurant was so good, we actually dined  there 2 nights in a row. I also overheard another group who was back for a second  as well, so we obviously weren't the only ones impressed.  They were quite busy for Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, but service was excellent.  Our server, Sara, was outstanding, and I observed other servers giving similar attentive service to their customers.   Although I normally eat a plant-based diet, I made  exceptions for these two evenings.  For the first meal, I had wasabi seared tuna, which was cooked perfectly, with delicious sides of mashed potshot and kale. For the second meal, I had a filet mignon as part of a dinner special and it was as good as steaks I've had at much more expensive streak houses. Sides were rice pilaf and kale with a wedge salad and house dressing, which I also recommend.    I also tried a gin and tonic there, which was garnished with cucumber and star anise, and was very enjoyable. I will definitely visit them again when in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Food ***** Service**** Ambience *****  Delicious food. The starters were amazing.   Strongly recommended"}
{"text":"While the wait staff were awesome at ensuring our meal was less than memorable. Chop burger was ordered with a gluten free bun that was as hard as a hockey puck and the chicken salad was drenched in dressing to the point the lettuce was swimming. Chances of returning are slim unless only drinking"}
{"text":"Dropped in while on a business trip.  Friendly, attentive and quick service.  Awesome rib-eye steak.  Definitely someplace to take customers, colleagues or that special someone.  Reasonably priced too, for an upscale establishment.   Shout out to Stephanie, our waitress, for excellent service."}
{"text":"A fairly standard steakhouse fare. The decor is quite interesting and the service is good. I ordered a mushroom ravioli dish bathed in a creamy sauce, which overpowered the pasta itself. I was told the steaks ordered by the others were quite good.   Location was central for east- and west-enders, a selling point for choosing this restaurant."}
{"text":"OMGGG this is the first steakhouse I've been to and it have such a good impression. The waiters were SOO nice. The waiters even volunteer to take a picture of me and family. That's really a first. The food was so so good. The steak was really cooked well. It was delicious and tender. The interior was designed so nice. Since it was also a bar it was designed how one side of the restaurant was quiet and the other loud. Don't even get me started on dessert: one word. D E L I C I O U S I really recommend coming her  *:.?. o()o .?.:*"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there for our anniversary. We weren't that impressed with the food, service wasn't to bad. I had the steak Oscar, shrimp was the best part. My steak was over cooked for medium rare. Chop Burger wasn't anything special, could Goto smash burger and get a better one. But it was worth the try and don't regret it but won't go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Nice decor however our food was all either over or undercooked. One of our guests meals didn't come until everyone else was done eating, even then it wasn't cooked right. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Our group of mommy friends went there last night as part of Winterlicious.  It was so nice to go somewhere grown up nearby to our neighbourhoods in Etobicoke.  We all really enjoyed it and some even said it was better than the other big steak places. The food was very good- I had butternut squash soup which was velvety, short rib which was so moist and tender. Mash was ok but I am not a huge mash potatoe fan, I think next time I would ask for a baked potato or rice.   Desserts were the best, all made in house. I had the cheesecake which was one of the best I had.   We were greet so friendly by the hostess and our server was very attentive. Was she a young beautiful girl in a skimmy dress...yup all the waitstaff were but we didn't care. She served us just as well as any of the business men there as well.    One of our group noted she was really good about most of the table just having ice water and constantly refilling this and the free bread. Impressive considering some places make you feel like a cheapo with Winterlicious and no \"add ons\" Liked it so much going back with husband and kids on weekend."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for a glass of wine after shopping at Chinook Mall and this exactly what a gf and I did on Saturday. I really, really want to like this place more, but I will probably never eat here again. This was my second time back and the food has been equally bad each time. My friend got a salad and it looked nice, she enjoyed it and I am happy for her so because of that it gets it's stars. I however was not as smart and did not get the salad and ended up having to salt and pepper my bland meal. One star for salad, one for wine and one for service."}
{"text":"Great service and very attentive. Food was fresh and flavorful. Music was not too loud. Price was average. Recommended."}
{"text":"The prime rib is the best I've ever had. Absolutely succulent and tender with a crisp crust. The ambiance is really upscale. The service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Went with a few friends to meet up and the appetizers were delicious! Entree was ok. Could use more seasoning but my steak was perfrctly done. The seats we got by the lounge area were a tad awkward and looks like it came out of a dracula movie lol. Youll understand what i mean if you see it. Our waitress on the other hand was top notch... checked in every few minutes... brought more avocado for a salad that was lacking...took pics of us in portrait, landscape and with flash and without! She was super nice and kept our booze filled and the food coming. Great service. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Contemporary steakhouse Food quality good to high but my sirloin was a good cut but lifeless in flavor  Added butter and salt then was acceptable  Baked potato flavor was good but slightly undercooked Prices are fair maybe a touch high  Nothing to amazing here Clean place and good cuts"}
{"text":"A little more expensive than the Keg but their Smoked Rib Eye is fantastic and the appetizers are good too.  I've gone twice and enjoyed it both times."}
{"text":"I went there last night for summerlicious with a party of 5 and had a fantastic experience. Right off the bat we were warmly welcomed by the hostess and the manager. Once seated our server Sonja greeted us and she had such a comforting and friendly demeanour, that I knew I was about to have a wonderful dinner experience. Her high level of friendly and attentive service continued throughout our dinner. I ordered the crab cakes which were very crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. I also tried my husband's Caesar salad which was very creamy and tasty. For my main, I ordered the baseball sirloin topped with a lobster and gorgonzola sauce. It was so delicious. I was afraid that the steak would be a bit tough but it just melted in my mouth! The topping was also very generous. My dessert consisted of warm apple pie with ice cream which I also loved. The pastry was so buttery and flaky and the inside consisted of large chunks of apples.  Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant and had an absolutely delicious dinner!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Top Sirloin 'Éxperience', the only thing I experienced was flavorless steak. I ordered medium rare, it was pretty close to being that. +1 star for being able to cook a steak properly at a steakhouse.  The flavor in the steak/baked potato/whatever green schlop vegetable was non-existent. I have bought 5$ steaks from the grocery store and made them taste better than what I experienced here. I've had steaks at diners that tasted better than what I endured tonight.  The wait staff was good, attentive and quick."}
{"text":"We arrived (party of 6) and the hostess told us there were 5 groups ahead of us, so we went to the bar, and waited, and waited, and waited. After an hour, we went and asked the hostess where we were on the list - still 3 groups ahead of us. Actually, they overlooked us. We sat in the bar, but we're told to move so they could seat people on the waiting list.  This place was a waste of time. Bad service, bad management, and we never got to eat. Too crowded at the bar, and they were rude.  Best advice, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"A wonderful place for a meal and a drink. The bar staff is attentive and mix good drinks. Prices are reasonable. The steak that I had was cool to the correct temperature and had good flavor as expected.  Vegetables were well cooked, I asked for extra veggies instead of a starch and received a nice portion of freshly grilled asparagus. A busy place, good to go when traveling by yourself and don't want a quiet dinner. Always possible to chat with folks at the bar. If undecided on what to eat and meat is an option this is is good choice"}
{"text":"The best smoked  rib-eye steak ever. Cooked in 1700 heat aged for 35 day... WOW AMAZING FLAVOR. The meat is cooked in perfection. Perfectly smoked and flavored. I normally don't write reviews but this steak was super delicious that I had to share my experience. Thank you Chop in Toronto."}
{"text":"I probably won't be coming back to Chop ever again. And I'll preface this by saying the Steak Bites...awesome. Caesar salad....extremely tasty. I should have stopped there & left. They get 2 stars because of those 2 items. Trying to find my waitress was like going on a fox hunt. Then I waited 1.5 hours to get my meal...packed up in a to-go box. I ate it in my hotel room. Basically I paid $90 for room serve without the delivery benefit. The prime rib was Outback quality & the mashed potatoes were flavorless. I asked about the crowd & the kitchen back up & was told that Tuesday & Thursday are their busiest nights....meanwhile it's a Wednesday. The restaurant is also located near the airport & center of a number of large hotels w/ numerous conference rooms. But it makes sense that if you are aware of your busy week nights, you would know to schedule more help. Right? Their OpenTable profile boasts abundant parking...Nope! They spent more effort on the dark lighting & waitresses tottering unsteadily in heels than the quality of the actual food & service. I travel a lot & take the time to seek out good food. I don't have the patience of overpriced mediocrity. Actually I changed my mind. They get 1 star. Just don"}
{"text":"We had awful service at this place. Some of our food was forgotten (salad at the beginning and drinks while eating). There was a pushy staff who commended himself in front of us for \"up selling\" the food. Our food took almost an hour to come and when all we wanted to do was leave we still had to wait a good 15 minutes for our bill. We did make a complaint and received a dessert to take home, but it really wasn't worth it. The food itself however was very well done but unfortunately does not make up for the lack of service."}
{"text":"My friend and I celebrated his birthday at this location. This was our first time at Chop Steakhouse.  I'll get right to the point - gorgeous decor, good customer service, terrible food, giant bill.  The decor is beautiful. Great planning and execution.  Our waiter was courteous, friendly, polite and attentive.  The food! First of all, everything on our plate was cold - potatoes, vegetables, steak, all of it. Secondly, we ordered our steaks to be medium rare... which they were, but somehow they were extremely dry and it felt like we were chewing on cardboard.  I have no problem paying good money for a fantastic dinner. If you're going to charge me $60+ for my steak entree, get it right! I've paid much less for way better steak.  Needless to say that I'm not going back to Chop Steakhouse."}
{"text":"Glad to see this place FINALLY up and open   Had the Oscar sirloin! Amazing!!!!! Perfectly charred and pink. Would love more wasabi flavouring in mashed.  Had a bite of the braised beef ribs.... Getting that next week!  Mojitos not that great... Jack Astors have better a version....  Beautiful decor, friendly knowledgeable staff...   Will definitely be a regular here. Goodbye Keg ..."}
{"text":"I consider myself pretty easy going. I travel quite often for work which takes me all around the world. I've had serval bad dining experiences at supposedly \"nice\" steakhouses but none of those experiences have ever warranted a negative review. The Chop House & Bar unfortunately is my first and hopefully my last review. The ambiance is good and that is about it. The food was terrible. You would think for a steakhouse that advertises 28-Day-Aged cuts of meat would know how to properly cook said meat. Now I understand it's a \"new\" location and they are still figuring things out but there is a difference between flustered inexperienced staff and smug/ignorant staff. I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt but I just can't. Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"Left waiting at our table for over 20 minutes with no one taking our orders. The manager apologized and gave us free drinks.  I had the peppercorn steak which was alright. The mashed potatoes were not good.  My dad had the steak and lobster. The lobster tail was very small as was his steak.  Overall the portions were too small and the service too poor for the price."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go to Chop steakhouse for our two year wedding anniversary. We asked for our steaks to be cooked medium-well. When we received our sirloin steaks they were small and less then 5 ounces. They was also burnt!!!!! The waiter was not attentive at all. This was the worst wedding anniversary dinner we've had. What a waste of $79.00."}
{"text":"This was a very good dining experience overall. The beer selection was good. My friend and I both ordered steaks, I ordered the ribeye and my friend ordered a fillet.  My ribeye was cooked to medium and it was done perfectly and the taste was very good with the right amount of flavor for a ribeye. My friend ms fillet was also cooked just right and was very good. We sat outside and it was a very nice outdoor space. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Steak was super small and came out over cooked so I sent it back. I though they were kidding with the portion it was big enough for a 5 year old. After a 10 minute wait it came back over cooked again. The rest of my table was not very happy with their meals either. Poor service on top of that. Seemed like my server hated his job. Too bad the Chop in Calgary is fantastic."}
{"text":"The service here was amazing! I was the only vegan in a group of 9 and they catered to me and made me my own tofu dish. It was sooooo good! The manager, Kyle, also took the time to let me know anytime I come in again to call and they'll make sure they have something for me. I was really impressed and so happy to not be stuck eating a boring salad."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Chop Steakhouse. The food was great and the service was excellent! For appetizers we had the parmesan bacon Fire Roasted Chicken Wings (A+); Iceberg Wedge Salad & Caesar Salad (A); The Chop Experience dinners Top Sirloin & New York Striploin (A+); wine Red Blend, Apothic (A). We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty and spacious. Food was good. The truffle potatoes don't taste like truffle. Service was ok. Would go again."}
{"text":"Winterlicious lunch review  We RSVPed for saturday lunch here and even though they just opened we were quickly seated. The set lunch was $23 and I got the mixed green salad, braised short ribs and tiramisu. Starting off the portions in each course are very generous, we had more than enough food that we had to take to go! Having been to a number of restaurants for both summer and winterlicious, I would say this is the first time.   The showstoppers would definitely be the braised beef short ribs and tiramisu. The short ribs were extremely tender and flavourful and was served with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The only small suggestion I have is to cut the short ribs as it came in brick form along with a giant scoop of mash potatoes. The presentation and flavour for the dessert however was fantastic, I wish I could get seconds!   The service was subpar, felt much like we were eating in a chinese restaurant where they just did the job to take your order and serve your food. Aside from that, I think they did an amazing job and would come back for the regular menu and another summer/winterlicious."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting chop and probably won't return. The waitress took her sweet time for everything and we had to ask to see a menu... My friend asked for another drink and he never got it. Food was pretty good though. Being ignored really sucked especially when it wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"Smoked Rib eye was a little thin and over seasoned.   Had a hard time with a so called 35 day age steak and it being sooo rare? I ordered Rare because of the aging process. Nice place, overpriced, bad music but had a pleasant dinning experience."}
{"text":"Tried Chop a couple of times. First time the experience wasn't good but we gave it the benefit of a doubt since it was new when we went so we tried it again in a few months & it did not improve much. Beautifuly designed place, however food could be much better. Appetizers were good but the mains were dissapointing. They have a pretty good wine list though so if you want to do appies over drinks then it's a good spot for that."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic. We visited there recently and ordered prime rib, smoked rib eye, and top sirloin. They were all delicious. The server was very attentive. We certainly would like to go back again."}
{"text":"Dinner for six c/w a $90 bottle of wine, including tip, $400. Not bad.  Food was very good, service outstanding, decor pleasant.  Going back .... For sure!"}
{"text":"Very Disappointed in the quality of food and service. Some of our family (9 guests) got together last night to celebrate a big promotion, and we were all disappointed with everything, we really don';t think we will ever come back. Our server never checked up on us to see how we were doing, our water was never refilled, nor was anyone asked if they would like another drink. Those who ordered the lobster dinner, myself included, found the lobster to be chewy and vegetables that were served with it raw. The extra $4 upgrade for lobster mashed potatoes were not worth it, was there even lobster in it??? My mothers ribs came out 10 mins later then everything else, and it was only when we pointed out that my mother has not received her meal yet that the serve went to go check it out, later apologizing that the first rack of ribs were burnt and they were re-making it.....why weren't we told of this from the beginning!? NONE of our food was hot, everything was served luke warm, especially the steaks! The crab cakes and onion rings were over cooked, very hard on the teeth and leaving a burnt after taste on the tongue. My cousin said the fish tacos lacked flavour. We were all a little hopeful when we saw the dessert menu, as everything looks delicious...however this fell short quickly. My cousin ordered the small chocolate dessert but was given the full size, which was too big and he ended up paying for. The creme brule was cold and thick- and the Caribbean rum cake was nothing but angle cake with whipped cream- very misleading and not worth the price at all. The only 'good' thing I could say was that the portions were a good size, which we could of enjoyed if the food was actually served hot and had flavour. When it came to pay our bill, our sever mixed everything up, and many of the items on my bill, were from my aunt's bill and vice versa, we were so disappointed in the lack of professionalism with the waiter we didn't dare to ask of this can be corrected. I am very angry that my sister got charged almost $3 for bbq sauce, why weren't we told that their would be a charge for this item?? We spent a lot of money in this restaurant, and a small serving of BBQ sauce couldn't be complimentary? Even McDonalds does this! I found this place to be over rated and not worth it at all, really was a shame as we were looking forward to celebrating with out of town family.  https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d3374894-r415242575-Chop_Steakhouse_Bar-Toronto_Ontario.html#"}
{"text":"I'm hooked! Tried this restaurant last Friday and I would return in a heart beat. There is reserved parking for restaurant customers in front of the restaurant located in the south end of Chinook Centre. I found the decor very stylish and urban - I loved the porcelain deer heads on the wall. (I hate seeing dead animals on the wall so this was a nice change). The food came quickly. I had a Chicken Apple salad with tossed pecans. The lettuce was crisp, fresh and cold, the chicken breast was tender, juicy and warm.  They even give you a nice COLD fork for your salad.  It's the small things that count.  My favourite part of the evening was the Caribbean Rum Cake. You can taste the rum, and the vanilla gelato is Divine. So creamy...you will not want to share this with anyone at the table - you can tell your friends to get their own.  The restraunt also had a bar upstairs and I believe a patio.  We were seated in the main level dining area so I'm not sure what it's like upstairs.  Washrooms were also nice and clean.  LUV! LUV! LUV!"}
{"text":"The Highs and Lows of CHOP Steakhouse.  We all went to Chop Steakhouse at the Argentina location for my wife's birthday dinner. After looking at the menu we were very excited to enjoy what Chop had to offer. The first hickupp was that we had called for a reservation and asked to be seated at one of their best tables. When we arrived the server was clueless to this prior request and we ended up at one of their regular tables. Firstly we ordered cocktails. My wife had the Italian Lemonade...which had a very nice flavour,  light on the alcohol but overall a decent choice. I ordered the Chop Manhattan (a staple drink that I regularly order) and honestly I was dissapointed. Firstly they neglected to add the brandy soaked cherries, not good. Next, the flamed orange peel...was not flamed. Overall it was too bitter and I was not impressed with the execution. My daughter had a virgin pinacollada which was very good...you could taste the real ingredients such as pineapple and coconut.  We then ordered our starters. This is where the evening started to improve. My son ordered the Parmeson Bacon Chicken wings which were very tasty. The Blue cheese dressing was very good with big chunks of fresh blue cheese. My daughter enjoyed the Albacore Tuna which also was very delicious. My wife had the beef carpaccio and again we had another hit for the evening. I took the servers recommendation of the Smoked Chicken Tacos and I was very impressed. Full of flavour and the hot sauce to accompany was excellent. We were finally off to a winning start after the earlier stumble at the gates.  Our main entrees arrived and we were ready to carry on the winning experience. Unfortunately that did not happen. We were all very underwhelmed by the \"Steak\" experience. I ordered the large Prime Rib...it was barely warm and very flavourless. First time that's ever happened when I ordered Prime Rib. The crispy onions on the side looked like they were thrown on as an after thought. We did like the tomato with what looked like a paresmesan breadcrumb topping...an homage to old school steak restaurants. The truffle scallop potatoes had the faintest hint of truffle...if you  didn't read that it was in the dish as per the menu you certainly would not have known that it came with truffle. Both my daughter and my wife had the the Smoked Rib Eye. My wifes entree came without the fries she ordered...another mess up in the experience. Not sure how you only sear one side of the steak and not the other but they managed to accomplish that. Other than the over abundance of salt that was on the steak which is maybe their way of adding additional flavour the smokiness did come though but I can't say it made the experience any better. My son had the Chop Burger. Maybe it was the giant pickle that weighed heavily on the burger that made it look like someone had squashed it but it was not impressive to look at. As for the taste it was decent...not anything great. My son commented that the burger he had at Kelseys looked better and that the taste was comparible. After a dissapointing meal overall we had some dessert. My son chose not to have anything (I think that says it all). My daughter had  the chocolate cake which was good...again not anything special. I had the Caribbean rum cake which was supposed to come drenched in Appleton Rum...I think they forgot the rum...very much like the cherries and fries...etc. Another let down for the evening. The only redeeming factor at the end of our evening was the added touch of a Birthday card that was hand written by much of the staff and delivered with a free dessert. That was well thought out...it's a pity much of everything else wasn't.  I can't say that we will be going back as their are many better Steak restaurants In my mind that we can take advantage of and have an overall better dining experience."}
{"text":"July second time celebrating one of our families birthday at the Chop house. The table we asked to have reserved was for four and a private area where we could enjoy our meal without being close to traffic of the kitchen or bathroom.  The appetizers were small bites size pieces of what I think may have been tenderloin as it was so tasty with the two sauces offered the tastes danced around our mouth. Then I got the iceberg salad with basil dressing, awesome yummy! The families meals were the sirloin Oscar, the mini cut steak and one order or the mushroom ravioli. The desert was a sample of three really tasty treats! Good service great tastes for a adventurous palette! Loved their mojito's!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place, and I've been there before, but I was in for prime rib, which they are known for, got my meal and the Prime Rib was rare to medium rare. It was too sinewy and for me under cooked. I should have said something. But overall the experience was nice."}
{"text":"Worst experience. I didn't finish my steak - a first for me. I love steak, and this is the first time in my life I couldn't finish. I ordered it Chicago style as I always do but the layer of char on the steak was so thick that I dry-heaved at the table. Also, the steak was supposed to be 14oz but looked like a 10 oz. I called them on it and the chef denied it even though the server acknowledged that it looked smaller than a 14oz. The lobster mash was disgusting. The waitress was new and still getting the hang of things. I can understand that. Nonetheless, when she brought me a used napkin I almost lost it. Save your money and go elsewhere. The fries were good, as was the French onion soup. We will not be back."}
{"text":"This place was a horrible experience. Our server Nick was condescending and acted as though Americans were not welcome in this facility. His response of knowing we were \"Americans from a mile a way, or kilometer\" as he stated was one of the disrespectful and condescending remarks. There were many more.   Totally ignored our table multiple times and took us forever to get any response from anyone.  Considering the amount of money we spent, a little respect would be appreciated. The food was average at best. Considering that, the attitude was not acceptable."}
{"text":"I thought Their seafood was Better than their steak it feels like a better more upscale version of Joeys"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. fantastic food. amazing management and staff. would highly recommend for an exceptional night out. Go in and try the 8oz filet mignon or smoked rib eye to experience the highest grade cuts available. or the famous maple bourbon haddock or citrus soy glazed salmon, only the freshest cuts are served. service is beyond exceptional. shout outs to FOH staff, dillan, matt, ash and joe."}
{"text":"The waiters were ok but customer service akills need to improve drastically. My wife ordered a steak well done and they brought a steak that was completely burnt! 2 other people from my party had to return their burgers because they were also burnt including their bacon. The server got an attitude when we were sending the items back and at times rolled their eyes. The manager was good as she covered one of the burgers. Will not eat here again. Go to the Keg!"}
{"text":"Went for my wife's birthday dinner. I had been here before for appetizers and drinks, but never a meal.  For a Saturday night, it did not seem busy at all. We sat in the lounge area as opposed to the dining room as we thought it would be a bit more lively, but it was just us and another couple dining already. I hope its is busier normally.  The food was great. Smoked rib eye was awesome. I would go back again. A bit pricey compared to The Keg considering it was an almost empty restaurant. I was anticipating a full Keg-like dining atmosphere so I guess I was kind of surprised that it was not as busy as I was expecting. Decor and everything was great, a bit cold, but we were probably seated next to a vent or something.   Nonetheless, I enjoyed the food and the drinks. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Expensive selections, but worth it.  Found out that you can only get your burgers we'll done in Canada here, but they make them good.  Best whiskey sour I've had.  Good service, but t he place fills up fast if you don't get there by 6:30."}
{"text":"It has a good steak , but the bar makes the place noisy and waiters become overwhelmed!!!   Not to repeat and it is quite pricy too."}
{"text":"Nice place with modern decor. The service is awesome! And serving is relatively big which is more than enough for normal appetite. We got several dishes, the halibut, hunter chicken, tuna and a 20oz ribeye, surprisingly all of them taste delicious. Except the mashed potato that came as side is on the dry side. Overall, highly recommend this place for ppl looking for a fancy restaurant for dating, business dinner or even just a family gathering."}
{"text":"I had great hopes for this restaurant but was a bit disapointed. The service was just ok. I was not impressed with my steak. I had the peppercorn New York. It was rough. I ended up only eating half of it. The appetizers were very good. We had the veggies tempura. The mashed potatoes infused with wasabi were also delicious."}
{"text":"I had the AAA sirloin topped with lobster which was excellent. It was done to a perfect medium rare and served with several sides. Eventhough the price point for the meal was $35 it was definitely worth it! Another benefit (being a guy) is the waitresses wear short tight dresses...so I had that going for me, which is nice."}
{"text":"Had the steak-bites and iceberg lettuce salad.  Pretty damn good!  Ambiance was trying to be high end.  Very attractive clientele and even more attractive waitstaff.   If cleavage and bodies at least an 8 are your thing, this is the place.  I would go back for the food...change that...I will go back for the food, stay for the people watching."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  I worked at a steak and prime rib house for many years where the executive chef was a CIA graduate, so maybe I am being overly critical. That said, here we go.   We ate there on the evening of 22 August 2015.   When we entered, the three of us were seated in the bar section on swivel stools without ever being asked if we wanted to sit in the restaurant proper or in the very loud and raucous bar area. Maybe the main dining room was full because of reservations?  No, this place stayed half-full all night.   That said, the restaurant's layout is fairly pleasing and it is clean.    After we were shown to our seats, we got to wait about 15-20 minutes without any of the staff so much as looking in our direction. When I finally went to the hostess station and explained that we were interested in ordering drinks and food, I was given three menus and an apology.  We then got multiple staff coming over to ask if we had menus, although none of them turned out to be our waitress.    Our waitress took another five minutes to come over and introduce herself.  She wanted to start us on wine before we'd discussed any food options, and said that she was fairly knowledgable on a good glass of red. Based on her language, I am taking a wild guess that she was trained as neither a wine stewardess or wine waitress.   When we did finally get served, we got to experience what seemed to be something out of some kind of bad foodie movie:  sparkling water bottles being opened and nearly hitting my wife in the face (twice!), ordering prime rib and getting butter knives (we had to request steak knives), the (chintzy)steak knives being dropped by my wife so fast we all (waitress included) jumped because it nearly cut her hand, food coming out without the sides (we all ordered the exact same thing), etc.   As for the food, I'd say mediocre at best. French onion soup and Caesar salad dressing were over salted, the prime rib cuts were very stringy, and the waitress' visits were too sporadic to make any major positive impact.    Overall, this place looks like it is aspiring to be a great steakhouse with a modern feel, but until they work out the kinks I wouldn't come here unless I was getting some free food or I didn't have any easily other accessible food options.   If you aren't picky about the quality of your food and are willing to pay prime rib prices for flank steak quality, then you can give this place a try to see if you disagree with me.  I'd be interested to see if my experience was an anomaly or par for the course."}
{"text":"I like this place, great food and service"}
{"text":"The new Chop in Mississauga is now open! I love the Chop Steakhouse in Dixon road near the airport. The food at this new location was great as I expect from the Chop. I had the steakbites, tuna tataki, tempura vegetables and this was only a lunch meal. The atmosphere at this new location is just as good if not better than Dixon road. Your eyes and your stomach will be happy. Nicola took great care of us and made us feel very welcome.  A great experience!"}
{"text":"First off, let me say that this place is very pricey - equivalent to The Keg.   Now that we've establish that, let me say that the food here is truly delicious!  The side of rice was very flavourful, the steak was great and the lobster was divine.   Service was also very good.  Minus 1 star for the location, it's very inconvenient if you're not in the area."}
{"text":"The food was actually great here, interesting menu, tasty, served hot.  We were a group of business women and one man.  However, this place is definitely targeting business men.  Many female staff skimpily dressed.  That would be okay if the service was good, but it was not.  They get an A for enthusiasm, but we had so many missteps it was actually entertaining.  In fairness, the place is brand new, so there are glitches that will likely be worked out.  If you go there in the next few weeks, be sure to bring your sense of humour with you until they get their staff properly trained.  Some of these staff seemed brand new to the service industry.  I was in their shoes many years ago, so I understand, but it would be good if they had a few experienced people on hand to balance it out.  If the service had been better I would have given it 4 stars.   My female colleagues didn't appreciate the blatant overstaffing of young women wearing little clothing.  It is nice to have an upscale and trendy spot in the airport area where the options are pretty limited, so we were happy to see Chop open in the vacant space beside the Sheraton.  This restaurant seems to be a Western Canada success with several locations, so it should do well once they get their service challenges resolved."}
{"text":"It is quite rare for me to be entirely satisfied with any restaurant after being in the restaurant industry for a while I consider myself slightly judgemental for the little things because I am aware of how it works.   This restaurant is incredible. I loved the service, the food, and the atmosphere. I've been here quite a few times and each time is as great or better then the last if that is even possible.   The food is so delicious! I've had the tuna steak a couple times which is just scrumptious. I've also had the mushroom ravioli which is just unbelievably flavourful and fantastically filling. They also have the best appetizers. Always get an appy. I promise you will not regret their tempera or steak bites, SO GOOD.   The atmosphere as well is just lovely. An amazing patio during the summers and impressive and cozy during the winter. The staff seem utterly amazing and trained spontaneously well.   Well done Chop!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food but portions are too small and not great value.  They were rushing us throughout each course so I wasn't too happy with the service."}
{"text":"I give it one star because the bar and bartenders are great.  Food is low grade dog food. Don't believe the 1800 degrees, steaks come out cold. Go for drinks, that's it."}
{"text":"Very nice waitress but poorly managed facility. Short staffed tells me they value profit more than customer satisfaction. Talked to the manager but was completely ignored by our concerns. I manage a staff of 500 and still need to meet objectives of cost vs service. Would give this establishment a failing grade for the management. Food not bad (how do you serve a backed potato that is not hot?)"}
{"text":"Ok, I am a wine guy and while I appreciate restaurants attempts to point me to their wine list, attempting to charge $30 corkage fee is outrageous. If you are going to have moxie to ask that kind of money, your wine list better be able to stand up and of course theirs doesn't. For being a high end offering of a larger chain, Chop has got a lot of learning around how to treat customers that are looking for wine related experiences. #1, go out on a limb and put some vintages on your list, #2 - Train your staff to be able to speak to every bottle. #3 - Don't make it prohibitively expensive to bring in your own or just say no we don't offer that service."}
{"text":"Bok! Never would have guessed, but Chop is definitely a place to hit up if you're looking for some *very* tasty chicken wings. Sure it's a swanky place and most people are dressed much better than this dirty lil' fowl, however don't let that keep you away.  Chop's got Parm Bacon, Hot and Bourbon chicken wings that were perfectly cooked with the saucy meat literally falling off the bone. Nice presentation with a tasty dip on the side (but no carrots or celery) and decently priced at $11.50 for about 12 wings.  Add to that lots of great beers on tap and some big screen TVs all around the 2nd floor lounge and it's the perfect pre or post movie venue.  These may be some of the best wings I've tried so far in 2011.  Stay saucy and for more great chicken wing info be sure to check out HotWings.ca of course."}
{"text":"Chop Cuts it!  Great Service and Hospitality!   There is only one Chop Steakhouse & Bar in Calgary. That's the reason why it understands service and hospitality and always gets it right. I hope that it stays this way and that they do not open any more locations. That will be a mistake.   Let me explain. I go to restaurants for extraordinary food, but come back for extraordinary service.  The main reason why I return to a restaurant is recognition. Once I'm welcomed back, I'm there for life.   Great hospitality, as opposed to great service, is making me feel good about the experience. The way I'm treated, the way I'm welcomed at the door, the way I'm greeted when I leave, the way the staff pay attention to my needs, that is how a great restaurant adds value and distinguishes itself from the riff raff out there. And that only works when you have consistent, dedicated and well trained staff. Not the preening, pre-pubescent, adolescent young adults who believe that they are doing us a favour, when serving us. And service implies clearing and serving from the right side, making sure the wine and water is filled to the proper level in the glass, and the wine served at the proper time, and off course, my pet peeve, not dumping the full 8oz carafe of wine into a 10oz glass. That's not cool boys and girls!   The staff at CHOP are consistent, well trained and attentive.  They get it! Because they are well managed.The two smaller dining rooms downstairs have a different atmosphere to the larger lounge upstairs, and serve different purposes. I prefer the atmosphere of the lounge which is more in keeping with the new and inspiring restaurant design trends found in Europe.    The ambiance is expansive and exciting, the furniture and décor trendy, and the colour palette pleasing and inspiring.  The servers are tantalisingly gorgeous, short skirted, leggy and mature. I notice these beautiful details, okay?   And they know the difference between a Pinot Gris and a Pinot Noir, unlike a certain Fish Club, down the road, that will remain unmentioned.  Ok, the guys are equally inspiring and attentive, although I will not bother commenting on their muscular chests.   They have a delightful menu, extraordinary food, which is well prepared and attractively presented. Their wine list is great with some excellent wines priced over a reasonable range..they also have daily drink specials.   Go and try CHOP - sit back and enjoy the beautiful atmosphere, the passionate patrons and the delightful servers and promise me you will start off with a bottle of Veuve Clicquot and their Caribbean Rum Cake!    Then place your order for food. And don't rush through your meal!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great food Nice and quiet Great presentation Great server Kara whom loves country music Great ambiance"}
{"text":"Man, the service here was outstanding. In the lounge on the second floor anyway. Food was pretty dece for a chain but. Everyone made us feel better welcome! This is def our go to when at chinook! Two thumbs up. Ps. Love their Caesar dressing"}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant. To bad there's not many people in it. I'm sure it will be popular very soon. Our lunge server Heather was amazing and handles our party of 7 so well, thanks Heather!. Great menu choices and everyone was happy with there food. A much better choice then moxies in the same area. Will be back."}
{"text":"I read reviews from other yelp members and decided to give it a try since my friends and I went go karting nearby for a birthday party. We had a party of 12, and when the hostess brought us to our table she just left us there without any server. Most of us were just standing around since we wanted to shift the tables in order to sit together. When the servers greeted us (around 3-5 mins later), they seemed very polite. Later on, one of our friends wanted to get 2 vodka shots for the birthday boy and told the server to put it on a separate bill (since the birthday boy insisted on taking care of the bill), but it never happened. Another problem I had with the server was that he we asked him to take a group photo for us, but instead, he dropped off the cake and left.. didn't see him again until we finished the cake (note that we waited for him to return for a few minutes before the birthday boy blew the candle).   + points:  good atmosphere near go-kart  tasty food  no cake fee no mandatory 18% large party tip  - points: mindless servers who forget what they promised their customers"}
{"text":"Never got a chance to eat there.  I purchased 2 American Express Delight Vouchers at $99.  each.  The server informed me that they were not valid.  Then the manager smugly also told me the same thing in the foyer in front of the two hostesses and other Waiting  Patrons.  I was totally embarrassed in front of my invited guests.   Supported another airport restaurant, and had a wonderful meal.  Would never go back to The Chop Steakhouse based on the rudeness level.  My money wasn't good enough.    Turns out the vouchers were totally valid, and the server and manager were just either giving me grief or not properly trained at customer service.  Save your money !!!"}
{"text":"Abit late review about chop, this location was in ethobioke area.   The inside dining area is fantastic and combines very well with the experiance throughout.  I got a sense that this use to be an old Moxie location but didn't fact check that.  I just drank a few draft beers and my friend a few glasses of wine.  Menu seems just right with man options but not over done.  Servers were very educated and very tempting to get us to eat more.  Pros - Staff , experiance  Cons - location , run of mill chain store"}
{"text":"The best Steakhouse. The interior is incredible and the food is beyond amazing. The steak is tender and juicy. The service is really good. We tried the prime rib and filet mignon and both were really delicious. The french fries we got for our kids were not so good but that's ok since we came for the steak."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Happy to learn that they only serve fish that, population wise, is not threatened (they have sustainable seafood standards), and it comes from the wild (farm raised fish require catching wild fish to feed them=bad). Food was decent but for their sustainability efforts, I would return."}
{"text":"I ordered the prime rib with the wild rice pilaf as the side dish. The prime rib was huge but not as tender as I expected it to be due to lack of marbling.  The wild rice pilaf was tasty and tender!  We ate on a Friday night and service was slow and below average. Waiting for the menu, food order and bill took longer than usual. When our glasses were empty, it took a long time to refill it.    For food, I give 4  For service,  I give 2.5"}
{"text":"Steak was a far less of a portion than what it was suppose to be. Ordered a 14 ounce ribeye but only got about a 9 ounce not very appetizing steak....not a good way to keep customers. Food was ok at best. My sons steak was obviously burnt but they brought it out anyway and didn't even apologize or anything. Overpriced menu as they clearly have unskilled chefs working here."}
{"text":"Over all a good experience food was exacted well and the service was great and in my opinion it was priced right. However it was more of your topical stake house not enough to keep me from my usually pl"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday with my brother  and it was so wonderful I came back yesterday with my husband for our anniversary. We were greeted warmly right when we walked in the door. Then we were seated and met our waiter Preston. He was funny and professional and gave us the best service. I don't know what it is about this restaurant but both my experiences here have been stellar. They seem to be able to read their customers and give us what we need without being a bother or annoying. Preston was our waiter this evening and he was awesome. He brought our drinks right away and kept the complimentary bread coming as per my request. The appetizers were Yorkshire pudding with prime rib on it and steakbites..mmmmm...both were so super delicious. Then not long after we finished our appretizers, my steak Oscar came and it was perfectly done to my desire. My husband's peppercorn steak was also very delicious and they got it right..a perfect medium. The sides were delectable. We adored the romantic ambiance and it made my special day even more special and meaningful. I think CHOP at this location is the best kept secret..from the managers to the wait staff to the hosts at the door...you are made to feel uniquely special and welcomed..they all come across as sincere and attentive.I'm thoroughly impressed with Preston, our waiter. I've told all my friends, co-workers, family, neighbors to come here. The price point is more than reasonable, the food is delicious, and service is five star. I cannot wait till my next dinner whic I plan before x-mas..lol I've even requested for CHOP gift cards for X-mas. Thanks CHOP for the unforgettable experience"}
{"text":"We went to Chop tonight for a nice dinner on a Friday night out. Our waitress was less than attentive. She was asked four times for a pop refill, finally we had to ask another  waiter and got it right away. Our meal tasted good but our waitress was never to be seen until it was time for us to leave. We asked another waiter for bread as our waitress went missing. It's sad that poor service at Chop ruined my dining experience. I am disappointed that it was such a horrible experience. I was so excited to have nice evening out. The dining room was full but it wasn't that busy. We saw our waitress standing around the odd time gossiping with another server. We were so disappointed as it's  not cheap to eat here. It's going to be a while before I come back. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok place ... just meh. Honestly the keg is better and for the price you expect more from their steaks but honestly not that great. My friend got the peppercorn New York and the steak he ordered medium well(slight pink) but came rare and they had to redo the steak and came back tough."}
{"text":"I usually don't order Caesar salad but did here and it was excellent.  Glad I did. The halibut was prepared well and our server was very fast refilling drinks.  Not sure if folks notice but man... The staff working there are attractive.  Guys and gals alike!"}
{"text":"Steaks were over cooked and had to wait too long even though had a reservation and restaurant had plenty of space. Too much hype for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I actually visited this place 1.5 months ago, so about time I reviewed it!   New restaurant, excellent decor, interesting chairs and booths wrap around just right so everyone can see and talk to each other. The wait to be seated was not long, got seated pretty soon.  Got the white sangria and it was pretty decent. The steaks were really good, cooked to the right level requested, could use a tad bit more flavour but still overall really well cooked steaks. Their lobster gorgonzola dip seems to be one of their speciality points, and my steak came with it. The dip actually has lobster bits in it, so it was interesting.  The service was pretty good, contrary to what some of these other reviewers said, I guess it depends on the business and waiters working the night. In our case, our server Patricia did a really good job. We were celebrating my birthday a day earlier, yet they still gave us a complimentary dessert with a sparkler. They even gave me a card & coupon, and the whole crew really went above and beyond.  Overall, their intended competition is probably The Keg, which explains the higher prices. I honestly think I've had the slightly better of steaks at The Keg, but the experience and service was good enough for 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun, but loud. The service was great, and the food was really good, but it was definitely overpriced. For a $50 meal, I expect more. Something unique, or something worth telling others about. This was neither, it was just a solid steak and great service.  FYI: I purchased the smoked ribeye with asparagus. I'll try to attach the picture I took.  Long story short: I've docked one star for overpriced food and another for the obtrusive music. Otherwise a very good experience."}
{"text":"The service is very friendly at the Chop Steakhouse, although a bit too much at times.  A friend and I ordered the 12 piece parmesan and bacon chicken wings, and they were flavorful, although I wish the temperature of the wings were a bit hotter.  If I eat here next time, I will have something different and the rating may be higher, as for now the rating stays."}
{"text":"Last Monday, my best friend and I decided to meet for dinner at an Airport area restaurant. The CHOP Steakhouse on Dixon was what he recommended. He lives 60 miles out of town, but had still heard great things about this place. Firstly, this restaurant is located just a short walk from the Sheraton Hotel. As soon as you open the door, you see that Chop Steakhouse is very slick and classy looking inside. It has great ambiance. There are some TV's on the wall, and yet It still possesses a cool, comfortable vibe. The full bar is at the back of the room, and looks big and inviting. Both my buddy and I ordered their Rib Eye steaks. Mine was done medium-rare, and cooked to perfection. I love the way they seasoned it. My pal said his steak was also excellent. They were pricey tho, $ 28-32 bucks each. We also shared a great bottle of wine called: \"Buried Hope!\" I remember thinking that this Chop Steakhouse location would be a great place to bring a girl for a special date, like her birthday. Keep in mind, you'll be spending more than a few bucks. It's a great place if you don't mind laying out some coin for dinner. ****Of Special Note: The service was fantastic!! We had several friendly waitresses come by our table, just to ask if everything was to our liking. That was nice...to say the least! In part, because every single woman who works in this place is beautiful looking !  More importantly, they seemed genuinely nice. That counts for a lot."}
{"text":"This was some good steak!   Visited the restaurant for Winterlicious dinner. We sat in the dining area, in a booth. It was busy, but somehow still private. The restaurant had a really nice atmosphere. Very calming but also fun.  Ordered the caesar salad and crab cakes for appetizer. Very yummy. I really liked the crab cakes but I'm also a bit biased because I like crab cakes in general.   Then we had the Top Sirloin and the Prime Rib for entrees. The 9 oz. prime rib was huge compared to the top sirloin, but I think I still prefer the sirloin steak. The seasoning was amazing! The only thing I couldn't get over in the entree plate was wasabi paste on the side. It just killed the overall taste profile of the dish.  And last but not least, we had tiramisu and a souffle cake for dessert. They were good but nothing special worth noting. It was just your average flavoured desserts. It didn't ruin our experience or anything, since we were really full by then!  Service-wise, Chop Steakhouse was really good. Our server checked on us a good amount of times; not so much that it was annoying and enough to keep us satisfied.   Overall, a good meal and a good experience. Exactly what you want for a good dinner!"}
{"text":"Not bad , food was ok , staff was friendly , not bad overall. In my opinions it needs to be more taken care of in terms of cleanliness ."}
{"text":"I had never been to Chop so my  friends and I decided to try it out. And were very happy we did. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable. Oh yeah, the food was good to.  I recommend the steak bites."}
{"text":"Average food and very poor management, especially kitchen!!  Veggies with entree... Was a bunch of kale and 2 small wedges of beats when it was to be beats... It didn't say two small beats!! A wedge salad which needed bacon and I guess I'm charged for it.... They were small little bacon bits and got dinged 2.00 for them and then 2.00 for blue cheese when I chose blue cheese dressing, wow, awful and won't go back! It's not about the 4.00 overage, it's the bad experience!"}
{"text":"My husband took me to chop to celebrate our anniversary.   I have an anaphylactic  food allergy, so trying new places can be very stressful for me.  The staff at Chop put me at ease right away.  Most restaurants I've been to will just remove the allergen from the food, leaving things really bland or unbalanced.  Not chop.  They had the executive chef prepare my meal in a separate part of the kitchen, and he reworked his recipe to something that not only could I have, but it tasted fantastic.    I had a sirloin steak from their specials menu, it was topped with crab poached in lobster butter.  They had to cook my steak in a pan to ensure there wasn't cross contamination, but it was wonderful, and tender.  The asparagus that came with it was cooked perfectly with a bit of caramelization that made it slightly sweet.   The service was over the top, absolutely fantastic, and the executive chef came out multiple times to make sure everything was okay for us. This was by far the best restaurant meal I've had in Calgary, as well as the best service."}
{"text":"We where here tonight for my sons birthday.   The restaurant was full but we had reservations and were seated promptly.  The waitress came over to take our drink orders and seemed very flustered. I asked for a the beer selection and I picked one on the list. She came back and said they were out of that brand. Picked another and the same thing happened. I finally asked her to find out which one they had in stock and picked one of those. The drinks came and two were wrong. They had to go back. The waitress then took our orders and we didn't see her for the next 20 minutes. Sitting there with empty drink glasses, the food finally came. My steak was way under cooked as well as one of the other guests. We debated sending them back as who knows what happens in the kitchen when you send food back! The steaks came back and mine was the same but cold and the other was way over cooked. Guess that shows us not to send food back. My other guests had pasta and they said it was very good. I will give this restaurant another try but for the price I want better service and perfect food."}
{"text":"I didn't have any problem with the great customer service and food. There were plenty of variety to choose from the menu. I had the Smoked rib eye and lobster tail, definitely recommended! Our waiter was attentive and kind. It was close by our hotel, next to the Toronto Airport. I had a great time and the place was beautiful. The parking lot had a lot of spaces to park."}
{"text":"service started great but as the night progress, the service got slower and it's not even their peaked hours yet. then our entrees came, I ordered the prime rib. Expected so much from this place since it's a steak house. It was the worst prime rib I've ever had. Steak was super tough, it's like chewing a super stale gum. Consistency of a flank steak without the flavour of it.  terrible service, horrible rib eye!"}
{"text":"Came on a weekday night. I was planning to get Summerlicious, but ended up getting distracted by the lobster specials insdead:p Bread (3.5/5.0) - The bread came straight from the oven, still steaming when I cracked it open!! Can't tell you how much I appreciate fresh bread;) The taste felt a bit flat though (and Ruby Chris' has better butter:p) Lobster linguine (3.5/5.0) - I guess the taste was good...? But it was soooooo spicy that I chugged half a glass of ice water just to numb the burn (which also numbed my taste buds a little). Sure wish they had one of those little chilli pepper warnings on the menu:( The lobster meat wasn't very fresh either, which makes me wonder if they threw in the chillis just to mask it... But well, I heard this wasn't a good year for lobsters, so it's understandable:/ The restaurant was busy, the ambience was nice, and the servers were attentive. However, I found it surprising that I didn't received any warning about a dish this spicy... Might return again. (Not for lobsters though:p)"}
{"text":"I enjoy the atmosphere of this restaurant. It's very modern and the interior is well designed and appealing to the senses. I notice all the great reviews and I was anticipating a good experience here but unfortunately I must disagree with the other reviews. Maybe I came on an off night (although it was a Saturday night), but I was not happy with the service or the food.  A friend and I were seated in the lounge on the second level. it was not a very busy night, yet it took at least 10 minutes for our server to arrive at our table and take our drink order. While we were waiting we were debating getting up and leaving because it took so long.  Finally she arrived and she was pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Both my friend and I were in for just a small bite to eat so we both ordered the chop salad with chicken. Now, I don't know what the thought process was going into making this salad, but it was really terrifying how huge this salad was. It resembled a pre-packaged salad you would find at a grocery store. Each ingredient in the salad had its own row on top of the lettuce and I swear they dumped half a bottle of bacon bits on the salad which sat in a large heaping pile on one side of the plate. The cheese was cut into large chunks, as were the eggs and tomatoes. I needed a knife to cut through everything. Because the plate was so full I could not easily mix the dressing in (which, by the way, was sitting under everything, not mixed in).  The only tasty part of the salad was the chicken. I ended up leaving a large portion of the salad untouched because first of all it was way too large, and second of all it was just not very good.  I would give Chop a second chance just because I would like to know how the rest of their food is. But if it is anything like this salad experience I would never go back. Really, a restaurant should not screw up a salad, it's a really bad sign."}
{"text":"Food is gross and over priced. Dessert was good tho. Wasabi in the mash potatoes, over seasoned. Trying to be \"high end\" I'd rather go to the keg! Don't waste your money here!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and the food is always good and it is a nice upscale setting. This time I had the smoked rib eye steak which is the first time I ever had a steak that way. The outside was nicely charred while the inside was medium to medium rare. Great flavor added by the smoking but not over powering. Also had the mashed potatoes which come in a huge portion and are not over mashed. I would say this is going to be my go to place when I stay near the airport. And one of the best things is that there is plenty of parking which can't be said about other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I like chop.  The decoration is warm and comfortable.  Sometimes I need a nice relaxing place to enjoy dinner in with my wife or friend.  So I pick shop for that reason.  More than that the stuff are incredibly nice and friendly.  All that will not be completed without a perfect and good quality of food which they also have in shop. I recommend it for you if you want to spend money on a good quality dinner"}
{"text":"I'm sorry Chop, but you weren't able to sway my devotion to The Keg. The service, decor and prices were good but that's where it ends.  The drinks I had were a crushed grape martini and white sangria. The martini was tasty, but very little was served- about 1/2 the glass. The sangria was like watery fruit juice. My boyfriend's mojito was so-so and my mom's wine was definitely JUST barely it's claimed 5oz.  The appetizers were: vegetable tempura, quite tasty with a light batter and yummy sauce, and beef carpachio (I can't spell that properly) but anyway it was quite tasteless and you definitely can't split it 4 ways without someone getting less. The only flavor was from the garlic on the bread.  The meals: I had prime rib which was ordered medium rare but came medium, almost well. It was quite dry and chewy. My veggies and mashed potatoes were yummy. Everyone else had steak oscars which were cooked nicely. The bearnaise sauce was not nearly as good as The Keg and it didn't have any scallops in it either!  Overall it was mediocre and there are better steakhouse in Calgary by far."}
{"text":"I have come here multiple times and continue to receive very poor service.  Food/drinks seem to be ok, however the service is always slow.  It's too bad because the location is very convenient - next to the movie theatre, however I have had much better experiences at Joeys right around the corner.  Will not be returning."}

{"text":"Had dinner here two months ago, steaks were undercooked and took forever. Great customer service as they took the food off our bill. We decided to give them another shot but this time for lunch. Ordered grilled chicken caesar salads and the Chop burger. The caesar dressing was overpowered with garlic to the point were it was practically inedible. Also, the grilled chicken breast might have been only 1/3 of the size of a normal chicken breast. The burger was forgettable, looked like a pre-grilled patty that was warmed up ie. no juices or taste. Should have gone to Kelsey's down the street."}
{"text":"There is only 1 word to describe this place other than AVERAGE...this word fits almost every category"}
{"text":"First time.  Ambience is decent. Very spacious. Good for large groups.  Diverse menu options. Had the steak and lobster, overall steak is about 7 out of 10, lobster tail is just ordinary. French onion is pretty good. The fresh baked rye house bread is yummy. Our service was slow at first but without us complaining, they recognized we weren't looked after properly. So they sent over a really good waiter and service was great then and he offered us complimentary coffee, tea, cappuccino, lattes, etc....."}
{"text":"The apps were great (steak bites were amazing)  and the steak and lobster were amazing. The sides that came with it were terrible... Dry \"mashed\" wasabi potatoes that had no flavour, and an assortment of steamed carrots of all sizes so the baby ones were cooked perfectly, but the monster carrots were essentially raw.  The main meal was also served on a ruffled like unevenly raised plate that made it impossible to cut your steak all the way through.   We tried all the desserts, the rum cake was great,  the rest was just alright.   The staff were amazing though and the manager was great.  He compped our first round of drinks for letting him know the mashed potatoes weren't prepared properly and then brought out a plate of properly prepared mash. The texture was much better but it was still lacking in the flavour department.   I probably wouldn't choose to go back just because if I'm going to pay that price, I expect the whole meal to be great.  But if a friend really wanted to go, I'd go."}
{"text":"The service was amazing. Everything flowed well. The food was delicious. Im glad i decided to keep my reservation. It set the tone for my vacation"}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday and it was a great experience. We ordered the chop house experience and were very happy with the portions and taste. The service was excellent and quick. We definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Chop is a great place, very classy and upscale.  How can you not like it??  With this great summer weather it's nice to hang on the lighted patio or stay cool in the fashionable dining room or bar.  On a Thursday night after the dinner crowd it's pretty quiet.  Which is good if you want to talk.  Just had a couple of drinks at the bar.  Bartender and staff were exceptional as usual."}
{"text":"I seriously do not understand how this place has 3 1/2 stars. I just had the best steak of my life. And it was a top sirloin, not even a filet. They cooked it to perfection. The mashed potatoes were phenomenal and the service was superb. Samantha didn't try to upsell anything - just gave me good suggestions and let me know the best deals. I can't wait to bring my coworkers back here next week!"}
{"text":"Came here for a business dinner. The interior is a little clubby/douchey and it was hard to hear each other when we first sat down. We spoke to staff and they gave us a private room, which was great.  Some drink mixups (brought me wrong thing) and bill mixups (charged me twice for drink they screwed up), but all was dealt with professionally. Food was good - for this kind of fare. I don't expect too much from a mainstream Alberta steak place and they neither disappointed or blew me away.  Would dine here again if stuck near airport with a group."}
{"text":"I've always liked the food and service here, but always find the seating to be really weird for a group. I host business dinners with up to 10 people. We either get crammed into a booth that should at max fit 8, or get some weird corner piece that makes the middle person hold their pee all night.  Well executed steak. Just don't bring a group."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Chop for about a year, and was anxious to try their steak bites. I was definitely disappointed in them today. The taste was not the same as I had remembered. The beef, whatever cut they were using had chewy pieces.  I asked the server about the steak bites, and he told me they had changed the marinade. In my opinion, they should go back to the old preparation of the bites.  I also ordered the Maple Bourbon Haddock. It's blackened, and comes served with rice pilaf, parsnips, and greens. I found the main Entree was pretty good, but they could've gone a little lighter on the salt.  Overall I would have to say, that I walked away feeling somewhat disappointed in the meal I had tonight. Maybe because the steak bites appetizer had left a bad taste in my mouth.  I won't be back for a while. Not the worst meal I've had, certainly nothing that stood out in a positive way either.   Please use a better cut of beef when serving the steak bites.  That's what brought me back, and that's what's keeping me from future visits."}
{"text":"I went here on Thursday March 3rd 2016, my big 28th birthday with my mother and brother. I have always driven by this location and curiosity always takes over when I hear about a Steakhouse.  My family went on a Thursday evening, clear weather outside and it just started to snow. We arrived around 8:00pm. We were greeted immediately and we were shown to the dining area. The restaurant bar area is wonderfully decorated, the atmosphere of the restaurant seemed very lively. I can imagine enjoying myself with my friends at the bar on a Friday night.  My brother and mother ordered the PrimeRib Experience $31.95 each and I ordered the Top Sirloin $23.95. In comparison with The Keg, Food was good, very flavorful, not over done nor over salted. I asked for Medium Rare, I received Medium Rare.  Our waitress was a young lady with dyed bright red hair, I forgot her name. She sat us down, she asked if it was our first time at chop (yes it was) and if we'd like anything to start off for drinks. It took sometime to wait for our drinks. Once drinks were delivered, she asked us immediately what we would like to order. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, but I do enjoy having a service experience, even if it's small talk about the menu, or weather... She could've at least advised us what promotions or nightly specials they were having. We placed our orders, we already expected a 40 minute wait for a great steak to be cooked... for the 40 minute wait, our waitress did not check up on us once. The only time we saw her was when she was talking to her coworker and we heard her gossiping about her other co-workers... The story doesn't get better. Finally our food arrives, we were waiting for fresh ground pepper and our 2nd round of drinks... Again no one to be found. My 65 year old mother needed more water to take her medicine before eating, luckily we saw a gentleman cleaning the tables, he was nice, we asked him for our drinks and ground pepper, we also asked if he can take pictures of my family for my birthday while we were having dinner since our waitress was missing in action again... He was exactly what we were looking for in customer service. Once we finished our food, our waitress comes back and asks if we want desert, my mother responds \"Hey, we're here for my sons birthday\" (assuming in any other restaurant, a simple desert with a candle would be a celebration for the birthday boy), she replies \"okay, happy birthday. Did you guys want deserts?\"... Every birthday for my family we always go to a restaurant to celebrate, maybe it's my westernized culture to assuming birthday desert will be brought, any restaurant I've been to always give a happy birthday desert... We asked for the bill... I thought maybe if she brought the bill, she would bring something... of course she brought the bill and immediately had the machine to cash us out. Our bill after tip came up to almost $200, we still gave a standard 15% tip. First time in my 28 years, of all the restaurants we've been too, this is the first time where I never got a happy birthday desert. The service was very poor, my experience was terrible, to the reviews, the best customer service I got from this place was with the bus boy who took our photos and cleaning the tables. Funny how in every other Yelp review, there was a birthday desert. We were going to make a complaint to the manager but I just wanted to leave.  Overall, the restaurant is beautiful, the food is comparable to The Keg, it's a pricey restaurant, but I feel if I'm paying top dollar for my food, I better get some decent service. Am I coming back to Chop, no thanks I'd rather spend my money somewhere it's appreciated. Food will always be a priority for me but the customer experience is what really matters.  Food - 4/5 Service - 1/5 Atmosphere - 4/5 Price - Minimum $40-50 per plate after taxes & tip"}
{"text":"My team and I wanted to celebrate our year end budget being done, so we went to Chop. The decor was decent and we were welcomed at the door. Our server was friendly plus the food came in a nicely fashion.   We started of with 3 appetizers, We started with their Albacore Tuna Tataki, Lobster, Scallop & Gorgonzola Dip with mushrooms, and Vegetable Tempura. The appetizers were all great, the tuna tasted fresh, Lobster and Scallop dip was to die for and the you cant go wrong with some deep fried vegetables.  For the main course, I went with Blackened Haddock Burger. The burger was filled with spicy Haddock patty, house-made tartar sauce, pickled onions, slaw. I loved the burgers as the fish was spicy and non breaded.   Overall, quite a good experience."}
{"text":"We went to Chop with our three children and they were as accommodating as could be! From the moment we stepped in the door, we were waited on left and right by several staff members.  Each as polite and friendly as the next.  I have a garlic allergy and the chef prepared me a delicious lemon-caper sauce for my halibut since I couldn't have it as prepared on the menu.  My six-year-old son is \"anti-green stuff\" and they cheerfully took back his pasta to make a fresh bowl with no parsley garnish.  When I asked if my husband's fries had garlic, as I wanted to share, they surprised me by bringing me a generous portion, just for me, garlic-free.  The bread is served warm and fresh -- I probably could have made a meal out of it all by itself!  Delicious!!  My daughter got the lobster, my ten year old son got the prime rib (and broke all records finishing his entire plate-- couldn't get enough!), and my husband got the New York Strip.  Everyone was very happy with their meals-- generous portions prepared with great care.  The ambiance is trendy, but welcoming.  The service: absolutely exceptional.  It's pricey...but worth it.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went out on a Tuesday night and glad we made a reservation as the wait for walk-ins was the better part of an hour. The restaurant has a contemporary, hip feel to it.  The service was fabulous as our waitress had very good knowledge of the wine list and could accurately describe how various dishes were prepared and provide excellent recommendations.   Turn around time on the food was excellent as well especially considering how busy the place was. The menu is strong on steak and prime rib dishes with a chicken, a pasta, and a couple of fish dishes to provide some variety.  We both ordered steak, one Filet and one New York Sirloin along with a couple of appetizers and dessert. The food was good, not great. If I was in the area, I would consider going back as the atmosphere and service were excellent.   If you are looking at having the best steak in town, a couple of downtown locations would be a better bet but the price at these establishments reflect that."}
{"text":"Drinks were on point. Service was impeccable. The ladies here got it going on. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Visiting Chop for my birthday last night inspired me to finally join yelp just to write this review.   My experience was amazing. The waitress, Katie, was extraordinarily kind and gave us fantastic service. One of my children was very tired and fell asleep during the meal and I was a bit uncomfortable about it, but she put me at ease and even joked about it with us. Our glasses never ran empty and our food was done right the first time.   Receiving a birthday card signed by the staff was absolutely the icing on the cake, what a sweet gesture that was very appreciated. When I mentioned my left overs were for lunch the next day, that was written on my container. It's the little things that not only brought a smile to my face, but also showed that Katie was listening to us.   Fabulous food, reasonable prices and well trained staff deserve this 5 star rating. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Came for drinks/dessert. - The staff was unprofessional. One waitress made a sniping comment about a coworker to our table. - We were all served the wrong tea. Found out after we paid that someone had put all the tea leaves in the kitchen in the wrong containers (eg earl grey was marked english breakfast, green tea was marked earl grey etc) - Their gimmicky tea pots leak, spilled hot water all over the table, let tea leaves/sediment through into the cups. Yet the waitress still argued that they're great when we showed her? That was weird. - While chatting, we abruptly left our table after paying when I spotted a massive bug resting on top of our booth. A staff member caught it in a glass, and it was identified as a COCKROACH.  So... Not great. Probably the worst experience I've had, to be honest."}
{"text":"Was at nearby hotel for a conference and stopped in for dinner. I had the mushroom ravioli and my boyfriend had the chicken with basil lemon pan jus. We liked it so much we came back for lunch the next day. We got the steak bites, which is their specialty and worth trying - very yummy, and the lobster tacos. The tacos were a bit limey but still good. We told them the lime was a bit overpowering and they appologized and removed it from the bill without question. Great service! Then we got what I think is their best dish: the lobster scallop and gorgonzola dip.  One word: amazing. The toasted bread 'chips' added the perfect crunch to the dish. The waitresses are a sight to see as well. Ambiance is awesome. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hats off to the chef: I will always appreciate a good steakhouse when I see one. And this is by far one of my favourites. From the service to the food to the ambience.... 5 stars! We ordered the pulled chicken tacos to start- one of the best tacos I've ever had. The highlight of our dinner was the smoked ribeye. The cut, the taste, and the meat were made to perfection. The full filet mignon was also really good, but its the smoked rib eye that I'll be dreaming about. Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"My impression of this restaurant prior to my first visit was a twist on the Keg. My hunch was confirmed when I spotted \"Sirloin Oscar\" on their menu.  My family and I went on a Friday night at 6pm. As expected, the main floor tables were all waiting on their reservations to flood-in. We were prompted to the lounge upstairs with no one to politely show us the way.   After we aimlessly found our way to the lounge we sat at one of their long centre tables to enjoy our meal side by side with another group of patrons.  We went with steak, as this place is suppose to be known for, and to my disappointment I found myself chewing the meat as if it was past it's expiration date. I like my steak medium rare. This would be excusable if the other 3 steaks my family had weren't the same.  If I want to hit up steak restaurant, I'll go with the Keg over Chop."}
{"text":"Super awesome Steak Bites to start before going into a nice perfectly cooked Choice Prime Rib. Great wine list and brews on tap while enjoying the ambiance and views."}
{"text":"It's nicely decorated. The staff are generally friendly. The food was ok. The appetizers were good. My server was a major disappointment. I was told I could not have my burger the way I wanted it. Drinks came out flat due to an issue with the soda fountain but the server persisted in claiming there was nothing wrong. Chop definitely needs to train their servers better & remind them that the customer is always right..."}
{"text":"I wasn't thrilled with Chop....  I stopped in during a work trip to Toronto upon reading the great reviews.  It seemed to be very popular because it was totally packed on a Wednesday evening.  However, aside from some trendy decor (and really loud patrons), I'm not sure what is drawing people in.  Service was ok - they didn't greet me for a while at the table and even though I was by myself, they put 2 menus on the table (it's not that uncommon to dine alone is it?).  I had a regular server and one in training.  The one in training didn't speak one word, so maybe she was really really new?  I asked a question about the menu (about the level of doneness on a burger) and the server sort of aggressively said \"all of our burgers are cooked well done\".  This was surprising...if this is a steak place, wouldn't you offer multiple temperatures of burger?  Is the burger not high quality meat?    I ordered the burger and it was small!  It did taste good, but it was sort of oddly charred and smaller than the bun.  I asked for aioli on the side...and while it did come on the side, it also came on the burger?!  Fries were greasy and overcooked.  Overall, I thought the atmosphere was fun, but the food was lackluster and service was only ok.    Food - 3 Atmosphere - 4 Service - 2  Value - 2"}
{"text":"The only way my experience at Chop could've been better, is if the waiter accidentally brought someone else's cake to our table and started singing happy birthday to me.  If you're looking for a night out for some great steak, then you've come to the right place! It's both modern and cozy, and the staff is helpful and friendly. The food is exceptional, and there's no end to the choices you'll get. I got the prime rib, and it came with some seasonal vegetable great sides and your choice of potato.  Our party had nothing but a good time, and our waiter made sure our glasses were always full. If you're here for a quiet night with your spouse, to close a deal with a partner, or out celebrating graduation with your family, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Recently went to Chop for a birthday dinner, group of four only. Very busy, service reasonable. Two in our group ordered steak well done, both came very pink  and cold! Returned to sender, came back overdone on the outside, still pink inside! Expect far better for their prices. No adjustment made on the bill either for kitchen error, which made half our group eat later than the other two. Wouldn't return in a hurry, better dining experiences in Calgary. A place like this needs to stand out, and unfortunately, they just don't."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The food is amazing! We ordered the Steak Bites, Maple Bourbon Haddock and the Hunter Chicken. The steak was flavorful and cooked to a tender medium well. The fish didn't have that offputting \"fish\" smell. The maple paired well with the bourbon. The mushroom sauce in the chicken dish was flavorful and it was the perfect gravy for the mashed potatoes. Great quality ingredients and cooked to perfection. The service was wonderful as well. We were seated right away and the server checked in regularly. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"First visit was blown away. The decor threw me back to the 60's and yet it felt modern. We had steak sandwich, veal sandwich, fries and a salad. Goose Island IPA with a slice of orange.  All of that was amazing!  Fresh and prepared eloquently.   The service was warm and inviting. Aces to the staff and food that made our first visit wanting to return the next day!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me for dinner here a few months ago, forgot to write a review but everything was awesome! My boyfriend ordered the steak and lobster surf and turf, with crab on the side for us to share. The lobster was phenomenal, extremely fresh and tasty. I ordered the top sirloin which was a little tough but otherwise everything was great! Service was quick and the server was great as well. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant good food but can be pricey had someone with my party that was severely Allergic to citrus and the chef and waiter made sure that if someone else at are table order something with citrus the chef would make it without citrus. I would definitely recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Spacious dining area and clean tables. Staff is friendly and service is fast. Food is bland, steak was not well seasoned, it seems that Chop was up against many other specialty steak houses based on pricing but after visiting and trying two different cuts, I wasn't wow-ed by the quality of meat or the searing/ infusion technique. I wish the chef focused on how to tenderize the meat more, add a bit of rosemary, sear it in pure butter... give it some taste please"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner last night! I do not eat red meat so I didn't try the steak but my friends all had great things to say about it! I ordered the Hunter Chicken (comes with mashed potatoes and creamy mushroom sauce) and it was absolutely delishhh! Overall, loved the ambience, the staff is super friendly, and the food was great!!! Definitely visiting this place again!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and accommodating. The layout of the whole restaurant from walk in to the lounge and the top is very well done but a nice place doesn't make good food. The Caesar salad dressing was very bitter and harsh. The filet mignon that was ordered medium rare came to the table cooked much past well done and the second one came to the table well done as well. The lady who served it the second time asked me to cut in to the filet to make sure it was done \"to my liking\" and when I did, there was no pink in this one either. I told her I would eat it anyways and she acted like it was a hassle instead of offering to make it right in any way. Worst 80$ I've spent a meal."}
{"text":"The food, service, and ambiance are outstanding. This is a safe bet for a business dinner when you want to be focused on discussion, and not have to worry about the details of dinner."}
{"text":"Another great steakhouse in Calgary, not sure if you're noticing a trend, however I love steak, I love Alberta and I love steakhouses.  Service at the bar was fantastic, ask for Austin."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the kick of of Winterlicious 2018. Their dinner menu was $43 PP, and had a nice variety of options for all the courses. I had the starter will mushroom and prime rib soup, it was VERY good. My husband had the Caesar salad, it didn't have bacon in it, which we found odd. For the main he had the top sirloin, 7 oz, it came with seasonal vegetables, both very good. I had the prime rib, with mashed potatoes, also very good. I ordered Apple crumble for dessert, it was FULL of blueberries, which I don't like. My husband ate it and loved it. I had his cherry cheese cake, which was very good as well. Service was excellent, very attentive."}
{"text":"Pretty average and definitely not better than the Keg. I had high expectations for the steak but it was alright, portions are filling and the staff is very accommodating and attentive (they brought me a brand new steak with sides when the original one I ordered wasn't cooked properly).   I wouldn't personally visit again."}
{"text":"Traveling across Canada I always enjoy stopping in a Chop's for dinner and drinks! The atmosphere is great, very nice interior design and nice touch on details (e.g. The lamp shades are hats). I had the chop experience and stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer. The mushrooms in particular were not as I expected them (small mushrooms oven baked with LB's of Parmesan cheese, quiet heavy). The steak came along with a side salad, wasabi infused mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. Food and service were fantastic and the steak on point. Will be back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, dining area is broken up so it's not super noisy, and you can actually have a conversation with your dining companions. Our meals Were cooked exactly to order, and we inhaled the cheesecake. I am already planning two more trips."}
{"text":"Def a place for male business travelers, as the waitresses are all dressed in tight short dresses and high heels. Not my style, but the girls were prompt and polite! Seared ahi tuna was excellent and the portions were surprisingly bigger than I expected. Nice upscale business dinner place!"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant, the feel, the food , the staff, everything was perfect. The staff was very polite and helpful with recommending new things to try. The food did get delayed which was a setback but the quality of it was amazing. I do recommend the bacon covered chicken wings, they were delicious."}
{"text":"I do not eat steak so moooooove along. LOL.  This place has a classy, crispy and fun vibe!!!  It was my first time and Chop left a great impression.    The door magically opened as if they were waiting for me.  The hostess greeted me with a friendly smile.  I was seated immediately.  The place was fresh, clean and trendy.  Tvs everywhere but it didnt have that bar/grill feel, which was good.  I know  most people compare Chop to the Keg.  But Chop is the newer and trendier version.    Service, I have to give an A++++.  The server was smart, quick, a good level of funny, and was well informed of their menu.    The drinks were brought right away.  They were very accommodating on all aspects.  The server and manager dropped by very often maybe too often to check up on us.    We ordered the chicken sandwich.  It was very flavourful.  We also got the chopped salad, a Chop recommendation. Chop's chopped salad.  The food was fresh, and the chicken was juicy and delicious.    After the manager came by and we had conversations about the restaurants, the locations, the food and she insisted we stayed for desert.  We ordered the trio:  brownie, rum cake, and creme brulee.  They desert was ok, nothing special.  Maybe the regular portion sized desserts are better.  Sometimes when I have ordered the trio from Moxies, I find the flavours different compared to the reg size plates.    As we were ready to leave, the manager came by again.   She said out desert was on the house.  This totally made my day!!!   Who doesnt love free food???   My first experience here was amazing.  The staff is friendly and efficient and the food is good, I bet they steak is great but ill never know, haha.  I will definitely return to the Chop!!!"}
{"text":"We splurged on our last night in Calgary at Chop and we were happy we did! Our service was prompt and helpful. I had the petite filet mignon & truffled scalloped potatoes...delicious! The finale was the delectable mini raspberry creme brûlée!"}
{"text":"Where to begin...  I was at Chop for my company's 'holiday' get-together where all of our company's staff members all over the city came to celebrate the end of the year. I like how Chop is set up looks great, design wise works and the high ceilings make it top notch.  There wasn't a set dinner or anything, more like finger foods which is totally fine with me as I had a bit to eat before heading down there for the nights festivities. After downing a beer or two I decided to fill up my stomach with something other than alcohol.  I started with the Onion Rings which were big, crunchy, not greasy whatsoever and anyone who knows me personally knows how much I love Onion Rings. I also tried out these steak cubes which were freaking awesome! I couldn't help but keep coming back to fill up my plate with more of these. I can't really remember a time where I've eaten crab cake but for what could be my first try at it I thought it was delicious as well. The chicken wings looked tasty too but I refrained from eating anything that requires my fingers to get dirty (I'm a diva, I know.)  There were waitresses with a tray of shots walking around and aggressively were trying to get us to buy some all night and so finally with their beautiful looks we gave in and bought a whole bunch. BOY what a bad idea. Honestly, I drink enough to know what I'm drinking and how much alcohol is in it. These 'shots' of sourpuss? Was more like shots of JUICE. Don't tell me that there is alcohol in that when you can't even taste it. What? Did you put like .0005 oz of alcohol in it?  Also these waitresses needed to communicate better with their bartenders because for the whole night our drink tickets could be used for doubles. Later on in the night when we went to the bar instead of through a waitress the bartender refused to give us doubles for a drink ticket.   Besides those things the staff were friendly and for the most part almost all the waitresses were really pretty. I hate snobby waitresses who when you joke around with them seem to think you're some kind of creep. The ladies here were nice about it and laughed along with us which I thought was great!  I'll probably be back here on a regular night to try out some of their food (I won a $100 gift card to Chop) woo!"}
{"text":"Meh, food was ok, very average prime rib. Cesar Salad was good, pulled chicken salad very good.  Whiskey pour was exactly one ounce, that is weak at a steak house.  Waitresses was ok, came by too often. Managers plz explain, welcome, take order, check 5 mins after good delivered, then go away...  Music was too loud and hip-hop, really?? How about R&B or Blues, not hip-hop, terrible.  Would not come back, better choices out there."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  First time my husband, best friend and I went was totally random - we didn't even know it had opened up. We decided to give it a try and we are SO happy we did. Layout and design of the place is great, staff was awesome, food was phenomenal.   Prices aren't bad - we paid about $150 for dinners/drinks for 3 people.   Haven't been in a while - writing this ad has inspired me to go! Will definitely be going in the next few days."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed. Our table of four all ordered prime rib. The steak didn't even look like a prime rib. It was a flat steak, tasteless and small. One dinner member got sick halfway through dinner and vomited in the bathroom. He claims the steak was spoiled. The manager came by, and refunded his dinner. We won't be back. Get it together!"}
{"text":"Second time through Chop. Second time they come through with a sub par performance.   Sat on the patio for a pre movie glass of wine. The table was sticky. Eeewww. The waitress was clearly near the end of her shift and seemed rather standoff ish. Ordered steak bites - no deal. Sold out.   It's Thursday night. Get your poop in a group people.   As the sun set it got a little chilly. Hey can we turn on the natural gas heaters? No deal. They're broken.   I don't remember when this restaurant opened,  but it couldn't have been more than three years. I'm pretty sure two. It's been a steep downhill slide.   Little bit of TLC,  Chop could compete with the Keg. Dollar for dollar? Go across the street."}
{"text":"Had a large birthday dinner for my friends' birthdays tonight and I must say...for a large group, service was on point.  Food came out fast and was good as well.  The lobster cheese dip for their app was amazing!  My daughter couldn't stop eating it.  This was my second time here and I would definitely come again.  Atmosphere was very modern and upscale looking.  Great for conversation as it was not loud in there at all."}
{"text":"Well where should I start...  So we planned a surprise birthday dinner for my sister and YAYYY!!! SUCCESS!  She had no idea.  Ok ok, now about Chop....  Atmosphere is amazing, from the modern touches of the decor to the chandeliers to the chairs...just great touches to make you want to hang out.  Even the layout of the bathrooms were fancy...one side note, not feeling the black toilets they had...kind of offsetting about a black toilet lol I don't know, that's just me.   The service was great from beginning to end and was consistent.  Our server Stephanie did a great job for a table of 9 ladies.  She was polite, friendly and attentive.  Made sure if everything was okay, refilled our drinks and came by enough times to check in on us.  We were also informed prior to our reservation that we would only have our table until 8pm due to another reservation and that we would get moved to the lounge.  Great news that we didn't have to move from our table anymore so that was a plus.  The food on the other hand was subpar to me.  For a steakhouse, you would like to hope that your steak would be cooked to your desire.  For the money I paid for my meal alone, I do not feel I got my monies worth at all for what I got.  So I started with a white sangria (great) and then got my app, the lobster, scallop & Gorgonzola dip served with crostini, which was ok...not much to rave about.  Then I got the Chop experience which can be made to any of their steaks and you get a starter soup or salad and you get two sides instead of one.  I got Caesar salad which was WAY too garlicky...I'm a person who loves garlic, but it didn't really taste like a Caesar salad.  I also got the top sirloin with the lobster topper and a lobster tail on the side, seasonal vegetables and mashed potatoes (as you can tell, I was on a lobster tip lol).  Dessert was the white chocolate raspberry creme brûlée, which again was okay.  Now, my steak...I asked for medium rare...I probably got medium well-ish...not a way to have steak.  I'm the type of person who doesn't like to complain about their food as I don't want ppl messing with what I eat if it gets taken back or re-made.  So I ate it, but didn't enjoy it.  But for the money I paid for, I should have said something.  But the food did have good flavour.  My lobster tail, for $20!!! Where was the rest of it?  The lobster tasted ok, but the butter that came with it had a offsetting taste.  Truthfully, I probably enjoyed the tomato with bread crumbs on top the most and it was probably just a garnish lol.  The mashed potatoes and vegetables were good and had good seasoning.  I think for the majority of the table, maybe 2 or 3 out of the 9 of us got our steaks made correctly.  No Bueno for a steakhouse.  So my sister's friend got sautéed mushrooms as a side for her steak and there was a circular piece of cardboard in it, which probably came from the box it was in.  It was brought to our server's attention and the manager handled it right away.  He took full ownership of the problem and stated that's inexcusable and apologized.  Took the mushrooms off the bill and her drink.  Oh and my sister and her friend both got a cappuccino and both stated it was on the weak side.  Also, it was cute they wrote happy birthday on the dessert plate, but even funnier when it was written on the wrong plate as the birthday girl had creme brûlée because it was written on the rum cake plate instead lol.  Overall...service 5/5, atmosphere 4/5, food 2/5...which was why I had to give 3 stars.  I've been to Chop at the Dixon location and I probably like that location better than this one, sorry!  I feel like I spent a lot of money and didn't get my monies worth tonight, don't think I'd come to this location again."}
{"text":"Women were gorgeous, food was average and experience was slightly better. If they could figure out how to improve the food with more spice, heartier cuts and a wider array of sides, this place would take off.  At least the ladies serving were engaged, gracious and helpful."}
{"text":"Went there with co-workers.  The steak bites were delicious, as were the desserts.  The crab cakes were small, you get three small ones. The steak was OK. It wasn't terrible but it was not delicious. I expected a little bit more for the price we paid. Most likely will not return for dinner or a special occasion, but might be a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"I went for dinner Monday night and had a wonder dinner.  My business associates came to town Tuesday night so I told them about Chops and bragged about the food and service.  Tuesday experience was not pleasurable at all.  Once we were seated we were not greeted at all.  I went to desk to ask for service after sitting for 10 minutes.  There was plenty of staff.  they we're just all in small groups chatting.  Finally a server arrived took our drink order.  And we also ordered appetizers.  Our assigned waitress finally came to say hi and apologize.     All good!   Then our soup came before our appetizers, my steak came out way over cooked, the waitress got busy again, once the plates were cleared, we sat for 15 mins waiting for the waitress to come and take a dessert order.  Finally we just went to the front desk and asked to pay.   No one really cared.  Everyone was more concerned chatting with fellow employees."}
{"text":"We had the most scrumptious steaks and overall dining experience here with a wonderful server (Devon). 3 crab cake miniatures and a tomato bisque were served first. Both extremely fresh and appetizing. Our entrees were appealing well balanced. I had the Oscar Sirloin (shrimp included) and my boyfriend had the large PrimeRib dinner special.  The desserts comprised of the fallen chocolate soufflé cake and the strawberry rhubarb cheesecake with an espresso to top it off! The rhubarb topping on the cheesecake, not very tasty.  We had such a great meal!!  I will be back here surely. Complete."}
{"text":"I like this place. It has a more contemporary, comfortable, atmosphere, and very friendly service. I must say that not only is the staff nice and quite accommodating here, but they are also very attractive... a big plus in my (shallow) view. ;-)  As for the food, I was with a big group and everybody seem to enjoy their orders.we had a bunch or apps and they were yummy. A couple folks had the maple haddock, which they were raving about. Me, being that it was early (4:30), I custom ordered a Cesar salad topped with Ahi. I ordered dressing on the side because typically salads get overdressed. Low and behold the dressing was on the salad, and yes it was overdressed. But tasty nonetheless.  This is my second time here, but I failed to review the first time. I will certainly visit again and maybe try their steak as the others looked cooked properly and they said was delicious."}
{"text":"First time to Chop....Reserved through OpenTable for 6 people, to celebrate my wife's Birthday....Seated right away...Service was prompt and exceptional....All of our food was delicious, my NY Peppercorn steak was cooked Chicago-style to perfection....My wife was very happy with the petite filet, very tasty and tender...Great portion size and presentation for all of our meals....Andrea was awesome and fun; best service we've ever had ! Was able to answer all of our questions and make some great suggestions....Would request to sit in her section any day....The manager come over to ask if everything was to our satisfaction; once again very cordial and friendly....Andrea gave my wife a complimentary piece of chocolate cake to acknowledge her bday, which was a nice little touch to cap off a very pleasant meal.....We've been loyal supporters of the Keg for years, but will choose Chop over it in the future....Great experience !"}
{"text":"This was my first time at one of the Chop franchises because we wanted to try a \"new\" steakhouse that's not The Keg or Milestones and I was surprisingly delighted with the food!  My boyfriend and I shared the Mason Jar Crab Dip that was on the feature menu as well as a \"Chop experience\" 20oz bone-in rib eye with vegetables and scalloped potatoes as the two sides and prime rib soup as the starter.  Ohhhh my goodness. Asides from the rib eye, which was a bit too fatty and undercooked since we had asked for medium rare and it was more like rare, the food was SO delicious.  Starting with the crab dip, the combination of freshly diced tomatoes, creamy guacamole, and shredded crab meat was such a refreshing appetizer. Then the prime rib soup arrived and DAMN, that was one hella delicious and boujee soup. It was rich and savoury like gravy (but less fatty) with several slices of tender roast beef.  This all led up to our massive bone-in rib eye, which was truly a sight in itself. Like I said before, I'd recommend you order it done medium if you like it medium rare (it's hard for them to maintain doneness throughout because this particular cut was closer to the bone).   I was very happy with the vegetable side because they didn't cheap out with a \"frozen mix\" and instead, gave green beans, roasted peppers, and a deliciously grilled tomato. The scalloped potatoes were also super creamy and cheesy but my only critique is that it was too oily.   I really just ordered the \"Chop Experience\" because I wanted the soup and I'd totally do it again! It was soooo good, especially for dipping with bread!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Chop a few times all for different occasions, the food and staff have always been wonderful. We always try something different on the menu and never regret it. The restaurant is beautiful and the staff, management and of course food is always top notch. I would highly recommend this restaurant over other steak houses e.g. The Keg, Once you try Chop you wont go back to other stake houses."}
{"text":"This was truly a pleasure to have lunch here with the family.  I had the prime rib which was tender and tasty and pink and just the way i like it, my son raved about his pepercorn steak, his mother loved the steak oscar, the appetizers were great, the drinks were spot on, the desert was delicious, i had a chocolate soufle type of thing, and it was light and not overly sweet and really topped off the meal, but the best part was, they surpised my father with a lovely desert for his birthday as a little improvised bonus.  The waitress was professional and attentive and really scored points on her service.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Only thing good about this place is the decor and environment, nice patio. Food was disgusting!  almost felt like puking . Service was unacceptable they were very rushed and clearing the table when some guests were still eating  and having their drinks.  For the price your paying your better off going somewhere else! #yuck"}
{"text":"So - this was one of the oddest experiences.  we ended up getting into a slight argument with the server over beans.  He absolutely insisted the long green veggies on our plate were asparagus but they were most definitely green beans.  green beans which we had explicitly ordered as a side dish off the menu.  the waiter was either super green or super dumb. i'll be charitable and say he was in training.  steak was overcooked and not to my requested temperature, nor were the steaks of my colleagues.  flavors of main and sides were very good however and the meat appeared to be of a good quality (sadly mutilated by overcooking)  I have to get back to the service though which was slow, inconsistent and frankly laughable.  if I weren't on an expense account I would want my money back and I would feel cheated that I just shelled out so much for such a crummy experience."}
{"text":"Very nice experience.  Steaks were very good as expected. Nice selection of appetizers and cocktails.  Service very nice. We enjoyed specially the time we had at the bar after dinner."}
{"text":"The place is cozy and inviting. The servers were very helpful in recommendinf what's good in their menu. My favorite was the lobster, scallop and gorgonzola dip! Although it was a little bit pricey for an appetizer, it was worth it."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with our experience at Chop Meadowvale. We ordered quite a bit for a party of 5 and we all agreed that the theme of the night for our food was: SALTY. Apps (fire roasted chicken wings in bourbon glaze and parmesan bacon, and lobster, scallop, and gorgonzola dip), mains (ahi tuna with salsa verde, top sirloin, chicken and ribs, hunter chicken, and roasted mushroom ravioli) all echoed this theme. I don't think I've ever drank that many glasses of water at a restaurant before. I also ordered a side of truffle scalloped potatoes that were super undercooked. The only passable item was the French onion soup. Even the Caesars were poorly made - felt like we were drinking straight tobasco sauce.   Our server was friendly, albeit slow. My friend ended up advising the server of our undercooked scallop potatoes and this was taken off the bill. All in all though, the quality of food, and suboptimal service convinced our group that we will likely not be back."}
{"text":"I loveeeeee this place. Came here for summerlicious and will be back for more!!! The food is really good and they didn't cheap out on the summerlicious menu. For $35 dollars really worth the meal we got.   I got the lobster pasta and my husband got the top sirloin! Oh yummmm - the salads were equally good and so was the dessert!!! We got the 9 inch cheese cake. I can't believe just how big the slice is. I didn't expect it to be that huge! Really worth the money and I highly recommend coming here for the summerlicious menu.   I might just have to come back here for another meal!   The atmosphere was fanatic as well. It's comfy and they have these really cool hats as lighting fixture   5 star!!!"}
{"text":"I recently took a trip to Toronto and visited chop steakhouse, the food was excellent and the service as well , I recommend the Steak Oscar although the steak wasn't quite big it was very filling !"}
{"text":"We had dinner at their patio which was very nice ambiance. I had the ribeye steak and cranking...pretty much Surf and Turf kinda dish. I was very satisfied...perfectly cooked. Service was a bit slow but food definitely compensated for that. Price wise this restaurant falls into the average steakhouses around the city. Overall I would definitely go back as well I would recommend it to friends and families alike."}
{"text":"This is my second time to eat at CHOP.  Great place for an after work cocktail or beer! The atmosphere is really nice and they have a delicious menu. 4 solid stars."}
{"text":"Hangry and on the road? Tired of road warrior hotel restaurants? Salvation is at hand, at least in Toronto. This place is great. Good soups, salads, steaks and desserts. You can't miss; oh, and the service?  My server, Lilly was charming and amazing. All her recommendations were spot-on!  The French Onion soup is simply amazing! The peppercorn New York strip, wonderfully flavorful!  The rum cake...to die for.   Five stars! Now, EAT!"}
{"text":"Since I was on a work trip, I decided to forgo the free dinner at the Hampton Inn in favor of Chop. Great decision!! Our servers were very nice and well versed on the menu. The appetizers were very tasty (steak bites and vegetable tempura). I'd get them again in a minute! I had the mushroom ravioli and they were very rich with a white wine sauce. Couldn't even think about dessert, way too full but I'm sure that would have been delicious too. And the decor - really cool! Loved the chandeliers in the big bird cage."}
{"text":"Was good service but the food was not worth the money.steak was mediocore would rather just go to keg. The mash potatoes with Wasabi was bland and so dry might as well of had mashed drywall. Let's just say it's on the list of never agains!"}
{"text":"Ita understandable that big groups are hard for restaurants but the service was beyond slow. Took us over 20 mins to be seated when we had a already RSVP. We were than asked to move once seated because they sat us in the wrong area. After that..it took them 15 min to set up our forks n napkins. After ordering our drinks it took them another 20 mins ... my friend got her water 5 mins after we all got our drinks. Everything about our experience as just bad. We were all hungry n didn't want order fearing that the food would come after 1 hour. So we just had our drinks and left.   Overall the restaurant is okay, but it was way to under staffed for a Thursday night. The restaurant was fully booked and they only had a handful of staff. Kinda disappointed because it was a celebration we were supposed to have."}
{"text":"In reality it's a 4.5  We were on the top floor, an open air patio which was nice, and had tasteful decor. The service was fairly good, and the food was yummy. We both had chicken, that came with rice and veggies, all were well cooked and seasoned. Desserts were very good and cooked in-house. I had the pink lemonade cocktail and it was really good, although I'm not sure if there was truly an ounce of liquor in there. Prices were high, but worth it, it would be somewhere I'd like to go to for a special occasion."}
{"text":"This is going to be a two-in-one review for both times I was there in the past two months.  The first time I was there I went with a girlfriend and we made reservations. It was an early Friday evening and we were expecting it to be as good as it was the first time we went almost a year ago. It was not at all like our first experience. We were seated at our table and we then proceeded to wait close to 25 minutes before our waiter came around. I couldn't believe it. He was very nice but was not near as attentive as he needed to be. The place was not very full and he walked past us numerous times. However on the other hand the food was delicious. I am always impressed by the food. I think I had the Chop burger and my friend had a salad.  I was there again last week and the service was better however, our waitress left our menus on the table the entire time! I has parents that were in the restaurant business and I've been going to restaurants my whole life and this has never ever happened to me. Is this normal?? However the food again was delicious. I had a bowl of their seafood chowder and crab cakes. These were some of the best crab cakes I've ever tasted and i would totally recommend them to those who like them.  All around Chop is great for their food but their service is not that fantastic. I wish i had had a better expereince with them because it really is a great restaurant."}
{"text":"With the exception of the Chop restaurant in Vaughan that I've seen all the others have been attached to or right beside a hotel of sorts.  The first time I've visited a chop was in Richmond, BC at the Sandman close to the airport which happens to also have a Denny's as well.  The Sandman on Dixie has a Denny's but no Chop and the Sandman in Oakville by the QEW has both a Chop and a Denny's.  I guess it's a thing?  Well this Chop near the corner of Argentia and Mississauga Road just south of the 401 basically shares the same parking lot as a Hilton Hotel.  While the Hilton is not a Sandman but still at least in this case near a hotel.  It was a night to go out as it was our mom's birthday and while we didn't have any reservations anywhere to speak of I know that going to places like the Keg or Canyon Creek can be packed on Saturdays.  Part of my idea to go all the way out to Argentia is that it's basically a business park area so to speak.  \"Pill Hill\" as it's referred to is basically a commercial and  offices type of area so I took us there with the gamble that it may be less busier than say the Keg at Sherway or the Chop near the airport.  Arriving there the parking seemed rather packed at around 630.  Although there's signs saying it's pay parking there are also signs with designated areas where parking is free for 3 hours for Chop customers.  Whenever I see pay parking in Mississauga I sort of roll my eyes unless it's the airport.  I mean there's always lots of land and parking available and to be attempting to charge for parking seems inappropriate.  Either way parking was free for Chop customers so it was all good.  The main entrance appeared to be getting some sort of facelift because around the door frame was some sort of protective green tarp but it wasn't blocking the entrance at all.  The building itself is attractive and has a look to be stone on the outside while the inside has intimate warm lighting and has a general look of being trendy and upscale at the same time.  Unfortunately there was no room in the main dining room and the wait would have been long.  Our hostess suggested the patio and my wife went to check it out.  It was a very nice evening, warm and not cool at all with a slight breeze and since they had nice lighting and comfortable booths outside to be able to fit us all we went for it.    The booth fit 4 adults and one child.  I could probably have fit one more child or perhaps 5 adults comfortably.  The area is not covered so if it were to rain you'd get wet.  Since it's fall dusk came quick but the lighting outdoors was good and if it did get cool there were overhead heaters if necessary.  Overall the seating and outside area were great that evening and it was both great weather the booth although slightly elevated was comfortable enough for our party.    Since we were at a steak house everybody ordered steak.  They do have alternative options to just steak like burgers, or fish etc but we all felt it was a steak kind of evening.  I started off with ordering the beef carpaccio as an appetizer for us which came with a platter for the beef and another for the crostini.  The appetizer was sort of what I was expecting as it's a pretty standard type of appetizer.    For the steaks there's an option to order the \"Chop experience\" with any steak and what that is basically you get another  side to select in addition to a choice of side salad or soup for another 8 bucks.  The regular orders just come with a single side.  I ended up going for the bone in ribeye while my wife ordered the blue cheese filet.  I'm always a fan of the well marbled generous cuts of ribeye steaks cooked medium rare and Chop did mine just how I was expecting it and just how I like it.  It was topped with garlic and shallot confit.  For my additional side I chose grilled veggies and mashed as my starch.  The starter that was included I ended up selecting the soup of the day which was a cream of mushroom with prime rib bits.  The soup was good although less mushroom flavor and more meat.    The service was good and wasn't necessarily lacking at all I felt.  The ambiance was great and the weather helped that being as we were outside and the food I'd say met out expectations.  It's not too often we'll go out for a nice steak dinner but I'd say Chop is right up there with the others of the same echelon like the Keg and Canyon Creek."}
{"text":"Came here at night for a birthday party, total of 22 people.  Atmosphere:  very nice, looks fancy, definitely a nice place for you to hang out with your friends, etc.    Parking:  kinda lacking, considering how big the restaurant is  Food:  for the price (below), I expected better quality and taste.  I ordered the burger, which was not bad, but it tasted like Wendy's burgers.  It was soft, had a Wendy's like bun (which is nice), meat was okay.  The fries that came with it was over cooked.  Looked like it was re-fried to me.   For ~$20, I expected a burger to blow me away.    I had a taste of my friends' dishes.  The lobster dip was too salty; the steak (sirloin) was okay (I would say The Keg was better); chicken was good (same as Swiss Chalet)  Price:  here's the big issue.  Everything I tried tasted \"okay\", and does not command such a high price.  ~$20-30 for burgers, chickens, and dips apps is simply over priced.    The steak dinners are like $40, but at The Keg, which tastes better imo, they charge less.  Comes with a huge salad and a delicious sirloin, etc.    But I do understand why they charge so much, because it probably cost them a lot to build and maintain such a nice looking place.     My 1 simple burger dish with tips and taxes came to $29.   For that price, I could have went to a lovely buffet hot pot (eg. Moral's hot pot) for all your can eat beef, pork, shrimp, veggies, noodles......    Conclusion:  The only reason I'd come back is if my friends organize a get together and they pick this place.  If I had any influence on the location, I'd pick a buffet place where everyone will realize how much further their money could stretch."}
{"text":"I enjoyed it. It's a typical steakhouse, with great steaks - as expected anywhere in Calgary.  Might be considered on the \"pricier\" side of things - but eh, that's Calgary for you.   I really liked the venue most, a few different floors, and various seating options to accommodate groups of any size and type. From loud and rowdy to quite and intimate. I loved sitting on the balcony and just watching the crowd in the parking lot.   As per the food -- mmm. mmm. delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly! Medium rare - which at times can be hard to find.   4/30"}
{"text":"Went there for a team lunch. For roughly $18, I got a burger with a cold patty, which was probably prepared in advance of the lunch rush. My cheese slice laid on top sadly because the patty was so cold. The fries were semi warm. Service was good but not good enough to make up for the bad food. Also we went right at lunch time and two teammates asked for the prime rib sandwiches but they were fresh out of the prime rib when there was barely anyone in the restaurant. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Found a piece of pepperoni in my cheesecake, pretty sure it was store bought too as it tasted of freezer burn. Service was rather slow"}
{"text":"I was reluctant to write this review purely out of selfishness to keep this place a secret!    A three storey palace, perched at the south end of Chinook mall. Chop Steakhouse Bar is what a relaxing evening out with friends is all about. Chinook mall offers over 1000 parking spaces, above and below ground, which generally permits hassle free parking right outside Chop's front door.  This place is enormous, with a roof top patio on the third level, lounge on the second level and restaurant on the ground floor. The decor is magnificent--funky, modern and luxurious. There are a couple of lighting fixture I would like to take home. We opted for the lounge and settled ourselves in a plush suede booth.   The atmosphere is friendly and cosy and the servers are fast, polite and know what they are doing, not to mention they are all stunning looking young ladies.  The food was incredible and I highly recommend the steak bites. melt in your mouth. They even made the perfect rum and coke. But does all this luxury come at a cost I hear you ask? No, not really. The steak bites were $12 which I consider an average price for an appetizer. Twelve dollars very well spent in my opinion.     A hassle free, fine dining experience in a casual environment.  Thanks Monica (Senior Assistant Manager), we will see you soon!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times now, all during lunch.  Each time there were very few people there, which was fine for me, but I can't comment how they handle larger crowds.  Each time I am shockingly impressed with the food.  As far as steakhouses go, this is in my top 5 worldwide.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned steaks and not ridiculously priced.  Last time I got the lobster tail with the sirloin.  The clarified butter had this amazing addition of unknown spices.  I also got the steak bites to start which one might think was too much red meat, but not when it's this good.  We also got the special lobster dip which came with this very original kind of toast.  I wolfed it back with no care for others at the table."}
{"text":"This is a great alternative to the Keg since it has more creative menu choices. The smoked steak was tender and buttery with enough smoke favor. Unfortunately the steak oscar wasn't as tender and had a bit of a tough exterior but the mash potatoes with horseradish was a nice accompaniment. The dessert menu was just average though - we had the trio... It didn't fall flat but was nothing special."}
{"text":"This is definitely a step up from The Keg. Everything from the food to the service was beyond exceptional. The steak was so juicy and tender, one of the best steaks I've ever had. I can't wait to come here again!"}
{"text":"I had extremely high hopes for my first time at this restaurant. My sister and I decided to have our birthday dinner here. Unfortunately, we had a terrible experience. I first ordered the shrimp appetizer, I do have an allergy to lobster so i decided to ask the waitress about any cross contamination since she delegated to ask any one if they were food allergies the kitchen should be aware of. She checked with the manager and they store the two together so it would not have been save to eat. So i then ordered the salmon, my friend order the same thing and hers came with two sides and mine was missing one. The salmon had no seasoning and was very thin (considering this dish is around 28$). So this dish was also sent back and i decide to get the steak bites, because that should have been safe right... well no. apparently they fry the lobster in the same oil as the steak, at this point you could have guessed i didn't eat dinner at my birthday dinner. Also, i need to add that one of my friends is a VEGETARIAN. She ordered the tempura vegetables (this appetizer has a V beside it on the menu for Vegetarian, she also asked if this was truly a vegetarian dish and the waitress assured her that it was.) Unfortunately, they fry this in the same oil as the steak and lobster.They had to clear her bill. I will not be returning to this restaurant and i do not recommend it to anyone, especially anyone with food sensitivities."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and watch your favorite team. Good selection of draft beers. The chop burger was excellent although I learned only comes well done in Canada."}
{"text":"Chop is a happening place on a Saturday. Half of it being a bar and the other side being a quieter sit down restaurant. It was a darker, more upscale, hip vibe. They also had multiple TVs for various sports games going on.  I ordered the Top Sirloin. Everything looked so small? I got a small piece compared to the other people at my table who ordered the same thing. I ordered medium rare, and it seemed more like medium. The price was reasonable for a steakhouse ($27-46 PP). It came with a choice of side, half a tomato and the best part imo is the french fried onion strings lol"}
{"text":"Chop Steakhouse (Toronto Airport location) has always caught my eye as a very distinctive building: it stands out as a off-black, blockish structure, with the words CHOP in large lettering. It looks like something that you might build in Minecraft (I liked the look!). Plus, the name of the restaurant is so focused: Chop: one syllable, like: Meat. The reviews by fellow Yelpers piqued my interest in Chop as a steakhouse to consider. And, happily, I have now dined at Chop and hope to dine there again. My Mother wanted Steak for her Mother's Day dinner. My thinking went something like this: Mom; Steak; Crab; Bread; Veg; Price; Park; Go; Chop. Chop was half-bar style and half sit-down steakhouse style dining. With my Mother along, we chose the quieter dining option when we made reservations. Our dinners were excellent - all of us at the table were very pleased! My Mother felt pampered by the attentive, but not overbearing, service. Just to get it out of the way, all the sides of bread, veg. and starters were very well prepared and none of us could find anything to criticize. Even the servers were professional, polished and friendly. Now: on to the meat and the crab! Smoked Rib-Eye is their signature dish (according to our very pleasant waiter), so my husband ordered it without hesitation. It came as he ordered, perfectly medium rare, and oh my it was so good! I tried a bite, and I think that it's worth going to Chop for that one cut of beef! My Mother and I each ordered the crab/steak combo. It was a special of the month, and featured 6 crab legs, along with a top sirloin steak. Top Sirloin is not my favourite cut, but as a rare steak (which is how I ordered it) it was very tasty. My Mother likes her meat medium-well (WHY??) and she's used to waiters who really balk at it. So she said to our waiter, \"Waiters hate it when I say this, but I would like my steak rather well done.\" Well, at Chop, the waiter didn't even look disapproving: he just took the order and the steak came, looking grey and lifeless, just as my Mother likes it. She reported that it was excellent. I could not even think about tasting it! I just ate mine, which was beautifully red, juicy, flavourful and rare. We also both enjoyed our 6 crab legs. My daughter ordered rare (thank goodness!!) NY striploin  (her go-to order at an unfamiliar steak house), which was also very satisfying and cooked just to order. But that Smoked Rib-Eye ... I am still thinking about it, and have begun to wish that I had a smoker at home. I suppose that I will just have to save some money and go back to Chop. It is not inexpensive, but, relative to other higher-end restaurants, not a bad deal for a steakhouse: based on my great experience, you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"My wife took me last night for my birthday.  Decided to try it as an alternative to other steak houses (you know the one...). Decor and ambiance is quite nice.   Hostess seated us, and provided us menu.  My menu has some kind of stick residue on it.   Server, Michael came over, made mention of the drink specials.  Ordered a Whiskey Sour and my wife had a pink lemonade.  Both drinks, quite good.  We shared the Lobster Scallops and Gorgonzola Dip.  Not bad - recommend you ask for Lemon along with it.  Very Rich.    My wife and I both decided on the Dinner, she chose the Gorgonzola Filet, I picked the prime rib. My wife went with the Fries and Vegetables, me, Wasabi Mash and a loaded baked potato.  We also both decided on the Cesar salad.  The Cesar was horrible.  So much garlic that it over powers everything. Michael tried to replace it with a lighter dressing. It only tasted like a watery salad.    When the mains came, what were were expecting was a well prepared plate.  The fries were well above a normal portion and were shoestring cut.  Something maybe more suited for a take out burger place.  The Demi Glaze red wine reduction tasted charred and burnt.   The premium Gorgonzola sauce amounted to maybe a table spoon.  The bowl of fries had most of it caked on the side. The seasonal vegetables were green beans.  Boiled, and squeaky.    The prime rib was incredibly fatty and the 1800 degree sear had no impact due to the fact that it sears gristle.  Michael tried to make things right.  He was a great server. The restaurant let him down. The table salt shaker was broken, no side plates ready on our table.     Michael had the manager come over (who never introduced himself).  He squatted  down and told us about the 1000 positive ratings the Chop restaurant had received.  As my wife was explaining her experience, he interrupted her to find out my thoughts.  Incredibly dismissive.  He said I want to make this right... he came back with a 3 piece dessert (mini creme brulee with berries, a chocolate tort and and a bundt cake with ice cream).  Nothing incredible, but, not bad. He offered to be his guest the next time we came in.  Left us with a card and a $50 certificate off the next meal.  As far as making my 44th birthday memorable, it was.  Unfortunately, not for the right reasons.  With as many other steak houses out there, I don't believe that I will be making Chop a priority on  places to go."}
{"text":"Pretty underwhelmed by this place. The pictures made it look pretty good but unfortunately the food just didn't live up to them, especially for the price.   Sat at the head of the bar and although it was busy, there were two workers who saw me and still took a little while to just bring me a water.  Started with a Caesar salad (good) and then had asparagus, baked potato and NY strip for an entree. The baked potato wasn't very good, and was even a little cold. The asparagus was fine. The steak though just really lacked flavor and juiciness. It was cooked how I ordered (medium rare) but just ver underwhelmed by the meat quality.   Overall I wouldn't recommend this location, I feel you can find a better overall meal at the same or better price."}
{"text":"Steak Steak Steak I can never get enough steak.  I will never get tired of visiting a new steak houses.  This is just another good one to add to the list.  Im sure you have noticed that there has been Chop Steakhouses opening up around the GTA.  This past weekend I finally was able to visit the airport location.  We had a 7pm reservation and all went well and we were seated on time.  Our server was amazing she was super friendly and very quick with attending to our needs.  I ordered the bone in rib eye with the loaded baked potato and rice and of course a Caesar salad to start.  My meat was cooked to perfection but lacked a little taste.  A tiny bit of salt fixed that problem.  That wasn't a big deal.  Overall I was extremely pleased with the meal.  A friend of mine that was with our group ordered her steak medium well and she received it medium rare.  These mistakes happen all the time so its not that big of a deal but it was the way it was handled that was special.  They asked if she would like her steak remade or just but back in to be cooked a bit more.  She was ok with just cooking the same steak a little more.  So she would not be the only on not eating the waitress quickly gave her a complimentary salad so she can eat with the group.  Within minutes the manager was over to apologize to us and advise us that the chef would like to buy our table dessert.  That was a GREAT gesture as the rest of us were totally fine with our meals and no one was even upset about the error.  Management and our waitress handled this beautifully.  Made us feel that they cared for their customers."}
{"text":"Are you in the mood for MEAT?!  This was a pretty nice steakhouse to have an expensive meat based meal.  The menu is pretty standard and people come here to eat meat and everything else is just fluff.  The complimentary bread was warm and addictive.  I did hear complaints from my party about how garlicy the Ceaser salad was and that they tasted garlic for a week after having this salad.  I skipped the salad and went straight to my delicious $32 petite prime rib.  It was tasty and well prepared and came with grilled asparagus.  For dessert, I got the $14 dessert trio that comes with smaller version of the Caribbean rum cake, crème brulee and fallen chocolate soufflé cake. This was a great choice and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the chocolate soufflé.  There's a private lot with plenty of parking for the restaurant and is located right next to the Sheraton airport hotel.  ....| \      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,       .../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \ -  ;  ;  ;  , _     ..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .

{"text":"I'm torn on a review of Chop. On the one hand, the steak I had was absolutely amazing. Much better than the Keg. But, my friend and I were interrupted so many times during our meal that it felt like we couldn't have a full conversation before being interrupted again. My friend was facing towards the aisle and would cringe every time she saw the waitress coming towards us.   Plus, the waitress who served our table provided suggestions to me that had nothing to do with what I asked about. For example, I mentioned that I wanted garlic mashed potatoes and her recommendation was the $8 scalloped potatoes. (Those are two very different potatoes dishes!)   My friend and I were going to stay for dessert, but after the pushy service we opted to leave."}
{"text":"First off I want to start off by saying I've been to the Chop location on Dixon road a few times for dinner and fell in love with this steak house and their concept. So when a friend asked for a recommendation in Burlington to have a special occasion party, I suggested here. It's an elevated premium casual dining restaurant.  I came out to this restaurant today for a special occasion at lunch time. So my review will be for lunch items.  The first thing I noticed was the eclectic design art work in the front entrance( hooks,knives etcetera all framed on one side) interesting conversation pieces. Gold painted tree stumps-that's cool. The \"designer\" in me was impressed. They have also different lighting chandeliers throughout the main dining area.  Service from the moment you step foot is very friendly & quick. Our server was attentive & knowledgeable about the menu.  We ordered a few apps: shrimp cocktail was very good in the traditional steak house style (boiled & served with horseradish sauce), Yorkie sliders (these are Yorkshire pudding buns with primerib in a sauce & dollop of horseradish cream) wow! Amazing - I want to order those again! We also had two types of chicken wings, one with hot sauce, the other Parmesan bacon sauce(this one was  my favourite). I love how the wings are put on a metal skewer - reminds me of a churascaria. Points scored for that. We tried the steak bites -these are tender morsels of steak chunks that came with two dipping sauces; a creamy one & red tangy one. Can't remember the actual names of the sauces. But the bites were good even on their own. We also had the mussels in lime cream sauce -omg! Winner- the sauce is light yet creamy & mussels cooked perfectly tender. For my main lunch item I had the veal Parmigiana  sandwhich and had a bowl of French onion soup as a side. This thing was delicious and tender. The bun is soft (softer than a Italian bun) but hey we are in a upscale casual place so who needs all those crumbs flying on the table. Lol - the French onion soup was very rich & cheesy & full of flavour.  The open faced prime rib sandwich was also  ordered by my mate and he enjoyed it- he had fries with it. It was very filling & delicious as per him.  I would come back here again when I'm out this way. By the way I call it Burlington but this location is on the border of Oakville & Burlington, so that's why yelp has this one listed as Oakville.   Oh had a Hendricks Gin and tonic (my pic says him-lol) it was smooth and love the presentation. Yum"}
{"text":"My family and I came here to celebrate my cousins birthday. We all did the summerlicious menu which was well worth it. Service was good and effecient. Food was good everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. I must say this place is a hidden gem of sorts. Located near the airport one would not think of it right away but you should.   It is expensive if you are doing ala carte, but aren't all steakhouses?"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and was blown away! The ambiance is great- very classy and cozy. The server we had was very attentive and nice.   I ordered the ahi tuna entree and wasn't all too impressed with the look of it when it came out. But after taking one bite, I was in heaven! The ahi tuna was fresh and seared perfectly. I think the green salsa/ sauce on top was a little too much and would've tasted better just drizzled on top, instead of a whole ladle-full. But other than that, the Asian coleslaw perfectly complemented the entire dish.   My friend said they enjoyed their dish as well but I can't speak on it as I didn't give it a try. However, it looked amazing!   They also had creme brûlée that I wanted to try but I was too full from my entree. I would come back again for sure! Chop chop!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location about 3 times, the restaurant is nicely decorated. The staff are friendly.The food is great"}
{"text":"I have been to this location about 4 times since opening, and it's close to home the restaurant is nicely decorated. The staff are friendly.The food is great!  great for date night, celebrations and just to hang out in the bar!"}
{"text":"Monday is half price wine, which of course means you drink double. When in Mississiissauga, well....  Stuck somewhere between an Abe &Louies and and an Outback, Chop is fine. Very nice staff. The tight dresses, bad make up and lousy shoes brought me back to my women's studies class at community college.   Had the filet, but like everything else in Canada, it had some kind of sauce on it. Still ate it,  why not, was into my 3rd 10oz glass of wine by that time.   Enjoy yourself, and stumble on back to the Hilton. The water slide is open till 10pm."}
{"text":"The best Steakhouse so Far.. my Family love it and we're looking forward to go back again and again soon..!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for steak! Make sure to call ahead and make reservations as they are always busy."}
{"text":"Sorry but never again. Service was terrible food was sub par. I had to remind them twice of my drinks order, received my tea mid way after I ate half my desert. Best of all they ran out of steak.  when we received the replacement steak it was way over cook. Two steak at our table were over cooked.  how do you over cook a steak in a steakhouse?"}
{"text":"Worst steakhouse I've ever visited. The service was ok (until the end when It felt like a bit of a hostage situation and she asked us to make sure our bills were right because \"serving a large group is hard\") and that's the reason it's getting 2 stars instead of one. Had the misfortune of trying several of the appetizers: lobster Gorgonzola dip, which, if they were being honest, should be called \"mystery protein tomato soup dip\". The chicken tacos were...forgettable. The steak bites were pretty decent, but after I got my dinner portion of steak, I realized that they're just the product of raping the actual steaks of the best part. My entree was the sirloin Oscar and I upgraded to the truffle scalloped potatoes (for $3.50 extra). I asked for medium rare and got a blue rare, tough piece of meat that was about the size of my 11 year old's palm. On a giant mostly empty plate, except for the extra thimbleful of yellow, gluey tasteless sauce that they claim is bernaise sauce. The tiny tough steak was topped with 2 really fishy tasting shrimp, next to a sad tomato with some breadcrumbs on it. The scalloped potatoes were so underwhelming that I won't even bother to tell you about them. The wine...oh yes the wine. A bottle of $12 wine that I paid $49 for. Don't even get me started. All in all...just a really expensive, incredibly disappointing, flavourless dinner. Save your money and go get a much better dinner at the Keg, or spend a little bit more and go to La Castile."}
{"text":"You will notice I hardly ever leave a bad review. The reason this gets a \"meh\" from me is that despite being a steakhouse, the steak was frankly, not even as good as a $15 steak sandwich at a pub (it was a bit worse, in fact) and was over twice that amount.  Pasta was good, drinks were okay, and service was great (hence the two stars, mostly for the service tbh), but the steak at a steakhosue called CHOP better be at least average. We had to send it back the first one (i have never done that before) because the meat was off. the one that came in after that was not unsafe to eat but it still was pretty lackuster."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for dinner.  Very nice and Classy steakhouse, just a little pricey but the food was very good.  Jamaal, our waiter was super nice!  Definitely will recommend it."}
{"text":"Chop is an upscale steakhouse chain that delivers top notch service, but in my opinion only marginal food.   I had the opportunity to visit their new Mississauga location on a recent visit. The decor itself is exquisite, with beautifully appointed dining rooms that live up to expectations. The menu is somewhat varied, and reasonably priced.  After looking at their different steaks, I opted for the prime rib, prepared medium. We also chose a number of appetizers, including escargot stuffed mushrooms, steak bites and vegetable tempura. Of the three appetizers, the steak bites were the best - very tender chunks of beef with two different dipping sauces. (A steak appetizer before steaks? Why not?) The vegetable tempura was fine, nothing special. The stuffed mushrooms were the most disappointing. I couldn't really discern the mushrooms themselves - the dish is more of a mini mushroom-and-escargot casserole.   The best word to describe the prime rib: flabby. It was a touch undercooked and very fatty. It was a bit of a challenge to cut through with my knife and that's not a good thing. It was also covered in a sauce that I would've rather had on the side. Having said that, it was very flavorful and I ate the whole thing.  We were so stuffed afterwards that we skipped dessert.  The service was fantastic. The food was just ok. 3 stars..."}
{"text":"The location is pretty easy to get to.  The interior decor is mind blowing. Each room is awesome.  The staff were friendly and fast.  The food is on the more expensive side which is ok when it's worth it. The steaks we ordered were ok. I'd give them 7 out of 10. I ordered the rib eye.  It was a little grey but tasted ok.   I managed to be clumsy and spill my $10 cocktail on the table which the hostess saw.  She quickly cleaned it up and got me a new one.  I was a little sad to see she had charged me for it though. A bit of a sour way to finish off the night."}
{"text":"Great service and food!  I had the top sirloin steak with the king crab and both were amazing!  The French onion soup wasn't great though, just tasted like cheap broth with too much of a soggy bread crust, but my husband liked it, so maybe it was just me."}
{"text":"Really great restaurant. I never would have noticed it, it's a little hidden off the highway. Really great majestic atmosphere. Great food of course. One of the best steaks I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"This is a late post, went here for Summerlicious back in July. Made reservations for my mom's birthday and was extremely excited to try a new steak house.   We arrived and the first thing I noticed was the service, it was a step above The Keg and most other chain restaurants but definitely felt genuine compared to other steak houses.   The ala carte menu was also being offered which was a nice touch. After everyone arrived we got a bottle of sparkling water and some wine for the table. Their wine prices are reasonable and good selections.  During the ordering process there seemed to be 2-3 servers waiting on us, so it was a bit confusing. No one ended up taking my order... which was fine because I decided to not order a main anyway.  The appetizers came and 3/9 were wrong so had to be sent back and a few of them had to wait a bit for their dishes to come out.   The mains came and my mom's pasta was under cooked for sure. My sister's pasta was just cold, so my mom being the way she is ate it without saying anything. Only when I went to take a bite did I realize how under cooked it was.  My sister did send her's back because it was pretty cold.   My brother's steak came out well done instead of medium rare as requested and his mushrooms were very overly salted.   All these were rectified as best as possible and when the food did come out correctly most of it tasted good.   Due to the quality of the service and atmosphere I would have still given Chop 4 stars even with all the blunders.  But then dessert happened...  My sister in law who is 7 months pregnant (very visibly) asked about the desserts because she can't have specific ingredients due to allergies. They gave her a chocolate souffle dessert instead and she finished it smiling. The desserts came out at different times and by the time she finished hers is when 2 more pieces came out for my sister and myself.   First bite into it and my sister realized there's alcohol in the cake... you can understand my sister in law was very upset since she doesn't drink herself, hence she didn't recognize the taste, without knowing has had a whole piece made with alcohol.  She with surprising patience talked to one of the waiters who also seemed unsure if there was alcohol in it but said that he would check. He came back and said yes there is kaluha in the cake and all their desserts here are made with alcohol of some sort. We looked at the menu and sure enough all the descriptions in the main menu stated the alcohol they use in the desserts (ice wine, rum etc) except the chocolate souffle didn't mention any. On top of that the summerlicious menu all dessert descriptions left out mentions of alcohol.   My sister in law spoke to the manager who offered her meal for free and apologized, but sadly the damage for her has been done. We all know that alcohol percentage is cooked out with heat and what not, but for my sister in law who has spent her whole pregnancy not even eating cheese or yogurt to protect her little one and who nevers drinks out of choice. I really felt awful for her.   So just as a tip for future visitors. The manager did say they were going to change the menu and add the new description in there but as of today their online menu still doesn't reflect those changes."}
{"text":"We arrive in late afternoon. But the food comes fast. Great suggestions for the food and drink choice."}
{"text":"Subpar food .  The chop experi3nce starts with a salad.  Theres only one choice really the ceasar.  Ubless you like empty calories in iceberg with the wedge.  The cold smoked ribeye was not smoked at all.   I tasted no smoke flavour.   Its a total lie that they cold smoked the ribeye.  Its just a plain cut of ribeye you can get from safeway.  They actually charge you for the bone an extra 4 bucks.   60$ per person isnt two dollar signs,  thats 4.  Ive had 6 course meals at muse that cost the same but nuch more exotic and well cooked.  The steak was plain with just some montreal steak spice.  The market vegetables were bland and earthy,  someone didnt wash the vegetables.  The rice lacked pepper,  so I liked thenfresh crack pepper grinder and started to grind pepper and the top knob fell off into the bbq sauce that also sucked.  If you cant be bothered to make a steak at home,  skip this place and try somewhere else...."}
{"text":"Went here for my anniversary, the staff was polite. they weren't too busy it was a Thursday night. We both ordered rare steak and had to send it back twice for being well-done and we settled on the third steak being medium because that's just a waste. They didn't offer to pay for our meal and we were there for so long waiting. They offered us a free dessert but they had nothing of interest to me. So disappointed because the patio and the steak was the reason I went there. I also heard from more then a handful of people that they had a similar experience. I don't mind having to pay for my dinner but if I have to wait 3hours for mediocre you should be accommodating. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I was promised greatness.   Another sub par chain resuraunt.     The service was great.  I think that's the only reason i gave it two stars.    I order Hunters Chicken.   It was tough and slightly dry.   I received a glass of wine with mystery object clinging to my glass.  The waitress replaced it and comped it.   Which goes to the great service.  Due to kitchen error we received a free starter which was generous! It was decent.  Again service was great.  My wasabi infused mashed potatoes was lack luster.  I love wasabi and tatters.  Another let down.  Something disconnected tonight.  Think I'll stick to my mom and pop places."}
{"text":"One of the best spots for a business lunch in the area. The food is great and the interior is gorgeous and modern. Also, it was not too busy at noon and not too loud which was nice. The service was great and the food arrived quickly.   I ordered the lunch combo which was half of a pulled chicken/bacon sandwich and soup. The sandwich was tasty - loved the pulled chicken, although the bun was a bit large. The soup of the day was a seafood chowder with salmon which was very yummy."}
{"text":"Outstanding.   Was taken here by a work colleague and very impressed.   Much thought and effort has gone into the menu and ambiance as well as a hand picked and well trained staff.   Appetizers are enough to make a meal out of delicious. Steak bites and Tempura excellent. If you have a big appetite try the signature smoked bone in rib-eye for dinner .  Bar side gets lively and great people watching. Dining side looks like a nice place for a business diner it date night.  I hear they are coming to the US.   I will be there.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Very nice place. We booked for a Christmas party lunch but the table wasn't ready when we got there.  Most of the food was good except the salads which were ridiculously overdressed and was inedible. Tried the dessert trio and it was not very good, rum cake was just ok, creme brûlée was yummy but came in a very tiny portion. Various meat dishes were all good. Vegetable tofu was delicious, best I've ever had. Service was good in the beginning, food came out quick with no errors. Service near the middle to end was slower especially with water refills. It would be nice if they had more options for vegetarians when it comes to mains or have tofu in the kitchen to swap with meat options. Probably would be back."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on a girls weekend and went on a Saturday night.  Atmosphere was awesome and really good service.  They have a great variety of food to choose from and everything we ordered was tasty and fresh.    Prices are a bit more on the expensive side but no different than other steakhouses.  Great for a special occasion or date night.  Worth the visit."}
{"text":"Travel a lot for work and enjoy a great cut of steak.  This place is great!  I have been to thousands of places and this place is very good.  From the service at the bar or tables to the food served this place was good.    Kinda surprised in the reviews tho considering the other steak places in Calgary.  This place is a must when in town.  Period."}
{"text":"Second time at this location and like the first I had a great time. My server, Bianca, was awesome! She knew her wine and pairing with with food and her smile really  made my night. She is normally there Fridays so ask to be seated in her area. Remember to order the crab cake ad an appetizer as these little guys are delicious. Their steaks are way better than the Keg. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in my first experience at a Chop Steakhouse here in Canada. I ordered the Teriyaki sirloin which came with a soup or salad and mixed vegetables. I opted for the soup and chose to go with the French onion soup. The broth was decent but the cheese used to top the croutons was very strong. The sirloin was not very tender and had very little flavoring of teriyaki. The mixed vegetables was a combination of broccolini and beets. I should have asked or I would have gone with another choice for my side item as those two veggies are not in my list of favorites. On the plus side, my server was very attentive and friendly and the manager did come by twice to ask how everything was going."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight. The food was expensive, but I must say it was good. Had the prime rib. Glad I ordered the petite, because anything else would have been too much. It wasn't cooked quite right, but I sent it back and they fixed it right away.  I must say I was not expecting a noisy bar atmosphere. And I haven't sat in a high chair since childhood."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  I really enjoyed the crab cakes and the filet mignon is the best I have ever eaten.  It was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  The wine selection is great and they have a nice range of prices to suit all types of wine lovers. My only disappointment was the dessert.  I ordered the Fallen Chocolate Soufflé Cake, expecting a souffle type dessert, but I wasn't fussy on the taste or the texture... maybe it was just because of personal preference but I couldn't be sure.  But that won't stop me from returning again and trying other desserts. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I decided to check out this location for my birthday this year as it was fairly inexpensive for a steakhouse and I hoped would be decent quality and within everyone's budget. It was my first time going to Chop Steakhouse and I found the ambiance and quality left a bit to be desired. We were a party of 14 and they separated us by tables of 7. I could understand the logistics of it and the convenience for people to access their seats, but it made for a very awkward group conversation and hindered our ability to communicate.  I chose the steak appetizer, garlic bread and onion rings to start, as they seem to be three of the most popular dishes. I found the steak bites to be incredibly salty, but the side sauces it was served with help enhance the flavor off the steak bites. I didn't care for the thorough brown look of the meat however, as it made it look incredibly unappetizing and not very steak like. The onion rings we're a very large serving and I was able to share with a table of 7. The garlic bread was delicious and I was able to share it with my table of 7. They did serve fresh baked bread that was warm and served with a churned sweet butter, which went very well with the overall meal. My main dish was the King of Steaks which I found to be very fatty. I did however thoroughly enjoy the sweet, slightly caramelized onion that was served on top and would not hesitate to order that meal just to enjoy that. Dessert was the most disappointing of the experience, I didn't particularly care for their creme brulee cake and left most of it untouched.  Service was great. They were very attentive and engaging without being intrusive and allowed us the time to converse before bringing out our meals. I would say the kitchen is very considerate of their guests and timed serving the appetizer and entree well. We never felt rushed. I did appreciate that for such a large party they didn't charge an automatic gratuity and for many people that is a huge factor when choosing a venue for your birthday.  Food I would give 4 out of 5 Ambience I would give 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place. Sadly I don't live close by but it's worth the drive. Food is incredible and the servers are great. Management is very visible and checks up on everyone. I haven't had a bad meal here ever. Steaks are phenomenal and the steak bite appetizer is a must. I travel a lot and am fortunate to go to some very nice restaurants but this one is my favorite."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the first two times were pretty good but the last time I came here I wasn't too too hungry so I had like the smallest steak they offered the one which they don't even state the weight of the meat on the menu and I was served a very depressing looking plate of food, a tiny steak and a blob of mash. Looked like cafeteria food. Word of advise, add some greenery on the plate even if it's a garnish!"}
{"text":"This is my first time dining at this location.  Ordered the Maple Bourbon Haddock with green beans and wild rice pilaf.  The Haddock was seasoned and blackened nicely.  I did find the Maple butter tasted a bit like sweet and spicy Thai sauce...would love it more if it was a bit more buttery.  Other than that, I really enjoyed the dish.  The desserts were very rich in favour.  Melissa was our server and she gave us incredible service...super attentive to our needs and gave us lots of info on the menu.  Thank you Melissa!"}
{"text":"Had the best service here. The women working our table really took her time to discuss the wine menu with my elderly grandmother and made multiple trips to the kitchen to confirm celiac options. We weren't the easiest table to deal with and I greatly appreciate her kind demeanor.  Plus the food was fantastic! Very impressed."}
{"text":"Slow service. Just warm soup. Missing vegetables on dish. Potatoes we're also just warm. Basically a mediocre experience given the high price of this place. Sorry, but one and done with this place."}
{"text":"I cannot recommend this place to eat. Needs improvement in the kitchen. I had the seared tuna salad over butter lettuce. The quality of the ingredients were poor. Granted it was Canadian Thanksgiving when I was there, but someone with a keen eye for fresh and properly prepared food ingredients is needed."}
{"text":"Really pretty waitresses... Really mediocre service.  The restaurant wasn't busy at all and we had a party of about ten people. Drinks took a good 20 minutes to arrive.  I understand this is a new restaurant but they need to up their game a little.  Food was good. Apps were well presented and the steak was wonderful. Higher end pricing but worth it. I'll try again in a month or two."}
{"text":"First time at this location and wow the interior is super modern with lots of upscale finishes you expect from a steak house.   Friendly hostess and service was top notch.   Lunch menu has many items to choose from salads to burgers to steak of course.   Well portion and well cooked. I had the steak sandwich with onion rings.   Dessert was chocolate soufflé cake mini was perfect size.   Large group and service seem to suffer when paying up.   Overall great place for steak and socializing."}
{"text":"Was OK.  Food was good and service attentive.  Got a couple of things wrong, but very willingly and quickly put them right.  Would go there again."}
{"text":"When i come to calgary and stay at the hopwell holiday inn I usually grab dinner here.  Granted it's a bit pricey, but you can ask for the lunch menu and grab a steak sammie.  It's pretty good. The steak is usually very nice and the meal over all is excellent.  Often times the place has happy hour specials as well and very proffesional great staff.  As far as a steak sammie goes my #1 is still 328 Tap in victoria, but this is decent too.  Their 1800 deg searing system should be in every steak house.   I only deduct a few points for the following: The bread of the sammie should be more dense like a home made heavy sour dough. Loose the lettuce and tomato under the steak. Although visually nice it takes away from the steak. Toss a few capers in the Caesar to make up for the lack of anchovies and boy you'll have winner."}
{"text":"They have excellent steaks. The only problem is the steaks are way too small. Good service and a nice beautiful environment. It's a bit pricey..."}
{"text":"On Sunday I tool the family to Chop at Macleod Trail. I would have to think for quite a while to point out anything positive. We had reservations, there were only three of the tables in the 12 table area we were shown so the place was not busy.  Let's review the evening: - On entering thee were shown down a set of poorly lit stairs designed, it would seem, to make it difficult for anyone without good night vision to use. - We sat and ordered. After more than half an hour with nothing on the table a \"complimentary\" bun sliced into 4 pieces arrived. For a table of five this left us with the problem of who was going to be left out. If there were plates so we could have put the buttered bread down it would have been an improvement. I guess the majority of us were luckier than my wife who got a very long blonde hair in her slice and spent several minutes gadding. - When the food arrived after a further half hour I wondered how slow the meal would have been on a busy night. - My chowder was cold, the beef had an inch wide strip of under cooked (not even - warm) fat down the middle which I could have sliced out if the knife had been sharp enough, the vegetables (green beans) were too tough and too stringy to eat. - Looking around the table everyone looked as if their meal was of equal quality to mine, but as I was paying , didn't want to upset me. No lip smacking or compliments were evident. - We declined dessert and the ladies left to use the washrooms. My daughter asked at the desk as she passed where the complimentary dessert for my son was that she had arranged for his birthday. Apparently nobody had noted the instructions on the reservation - When the waiter arrived at the table to correct the oversight of the dessert it was way  to late to rescue the evening  Eat there again? I doubt it."}
{"text":"Came here for a casual quiet dinner with my family! Right now until after Valentine's day they have the three course meal for $50 dollars with 4 options per course, something for meat and fish lovers out there! We had the clam chowder soups and I also had the blue cheese lettuce salad! For mains the fillet mignon cooked to a perfect medium- well as requested it was melt in your mouth and the wine reduction was really good! The cheesecake was absolutely delicious and normally I absolutely hate cheesecake!  The food was very picture perfect and the service was impeccable!  Will definitely be back for more special occasions as the prices are higher that other places around that also have good steaks and dishes!"}
{"text":"I was here in April for the first time and back in June for my birthday so that should say a lot! You come to a steakhouse for the steak and a perfectly cooked steak from Chop you will definitely get. Service is great and they take their customers with allergies very seriously and it is greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night for Winterlicious. My gf booked that day and got the last reservation for 7pm. Every seat in the house had a butt in it when we got there.  I got the mixed green salad, prime rib and tiramisu. My girlfriend got the crab cakes, prime rib and apple crumble. Timing for bread and salads were great. I've gotten the mixed green salad here before and became a fan of it. The dressing they use is really tasty, so I was excited for this. Totally finished the salad. My gfs crab cakes were just ok. You get two kinda small cakes. After the starters is where it went downhill. We waited 30 minutes + for our entrees! Even the table next to us got their food first and they were a group of four that came AFTER us! I had to ask our waitress what was taking so long and she said the kitchen got really busy. Uhhh??? Really, not a good excuse. Anyways when the food DID finally come out, it was actually really good. My gf and I both got our prime ribs done medium rare. Both were juicy and tender. I just wished they had regular mashed potatoes because their wasabi infused mash is disgusting. That's why I had to opt for a bake potato this time. Which was alright I guess. Came with all the fixings.  Dessert followed within a reasonable time. Would never get the tiramisu again. It's basically a cup of cream with bits of cake here and there. There really weren't any layers to it. Apple crumble was only good because of the ice cream.  I had a better winterlicious experience here last year (I think) but this particular time they only earned themselves 3 stars. I'm not going to lie though, they do a good prime rib."}
{"text":"Looked forward to trying this place for a long while. There Summerlicious menu was very well described and looked very appetizing however the problem with the dinner that I had was I think the people who wrote the menu and the people who cook the dinner for two totally separate departments.   The food was mediocre at best. The starter ceaser salad was essentially chopped up store bought romaine that looked like it was bought like that with \"double smoked bacon\" which wasn't fresh and was just bacon out of a bag! Really.   The main course, and I had the 16oz smoked rib eye. Terrible. Bland, no flavour, bad sear. Yes it was technically cooked medium rare but the cut itself was very fatty and poorly presented. The \"seasonal veg\" that I opted for instead of mash or fries was string beans again done poorly and 2 pieces of terrible tasting squash or corn, couldn't tell as there was no seasoning.   Dessert was also very mediocre. Though I don't have a picture, it was not freshly baked or made and the compote too sweet, with the creme brule and soufflé being blah.   Not worth it on a regular night and possibly only worth it on a discount like summerlicious."}
{"text":"We have been here few times already and all the time we get the same experience. At least they are doing fine in terms of consistency. The food is OK (we have tried different dishes) but nothing that I can highlight or take them to the highest level in terms of taste or design.  The service is always good and waitresses or waiters are all professionals and making a great experience for the customers."}
{"text":"Excellent all around from first greeting, fast drinks, salads came immediately, great server and management, steaks were great and the desert \"sampler\" was like 3 full deserts. This will become a new regular spot for us !"}
{"text":"My husband & I were treated like royalty when we chose to celebrate our anniversary at Chop. Delicious steaks, surprise  (complimentary) glasses of bubbly, and a sweet chocolate lava cake with ice cream & raspberries.  The staff was awesome - attentive without being annoying.  We will 100% return."}
{"text":"Had the Winterlicious lunch special a couple of months ago and still think about it.  Was fantastic.  I think about how perfectly the steak was cooked to my preference.    Service is great too.  I've been here a few times since that meal, and have tried a few different things and am pleased with the place.  It's really nice, and has a great ambiance.  I prefer it over other steakhouse chains (i.e. big K).  Portion sizes are right-sized - not huge, not small.  But quality over quantity seems to be the way these folks think.  I can't wait to try out the new one that opened in Vaughan recently."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful for and good comoradarie with Abdullah, our Maitre D as well as Sean our waiter. I can't tell you how much fun we had with their competition and the fun we had playing them against each other. One of the best places I have ever eaten"}
{"text":"I am really upset with it, thought it was going to be awesome!  The service WAS fantastic though, 3 out of 4 of us got the prime rib and all of ours were way undercooked.  One of us sent it back to get his done again and then it was perfect!  Unfortunately after seeing my steak I just lost my appetite so no point, but it was definitely rare as opposed to medium rare, couldn't even chew it.  The sauces and sides were fantastic though, as well as the dessert and service.  Would recommend just be wary about how well it's cooked before you start eating it!"}
{"text":"We landed at this restaurant after being stranded by our restaurant where a reservation was made well in advance. Luckily, we were ushered in immediately. Surprisingly, the place was not that busy.  Service was \"par excellence\", pity cannot say the same about the food. The French onion soup was good, my better half's red pepper bisque was luke warm....... nothing like a luke warm soup on a cold Valentine's day,eh?   For main course I ordered a steak, the size reminded me of my visit to Texas but the taste.... it was rubbery and dry. I had ordered a medium steak but this was way over-cooked, The prime rib was a-okay, had better at Milestones.  Perhaps the best part of the dinner was dessert, the creme brulee was do die for and my hubby also commented that the chocolate mousse cake was the best he ever had.   We complained about the steak to the server, the manager apologized profusely and gave us a full credit for my meal. We also got a gift voucher to experience a meal again.  Under normal circumstances I would never visit this restaurant again, but the \"par excellent\" service for the sub par food would make me go again. Unlike other reviews, the hostess was extremely polite, courteous, efficient and more..... could go on and on about the superior service received.  Worth a visit!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Chop for a work related team lunch and the place did not disappoint. The restaurant is nice and upscale, perfect for work functions and date nights. There doesn't seem to be any particular dress code required for the place, as my team went in for lunch with our normal casual clothes.   Environment: There are plenty of free parking space available outside for customers, with some restaurant specific parking spaces available. Inside, the restaurant is beautifully renovated and very classy, great for formal events. The restaurant is pretty big and can definitely accommodate large groups and buy-out for corporate events. We went in a group of 20 and we were seated comfortably in 2 tables.   Food: Overall the food was pretty good. Since I went with my work team I didn't get to take pictures of everything, but the steak I got was awesome. They offer a select variety of steaks for lunch, and I ordered the 14oz rib eye steak ($42), medium rare, with baked potato on the side. I'm delighted to see the steak actually came out medium rare, while many other restaurants tend to overdo it. I think my favourite part of the dish was the baked potato though. I got it with butter and bacon bites and it tasted phenomenal and I devoured it within seconds. The dish also came with some fried onion strips and it was pretty good as well, however I wish it came with some complementary salads or veggies so not everything was so greasy (you could choose veggies as your side).   Service: You know the place is fancy when the waitresses are all dressed up in tight dresses and high heels. My team was under-dressed compared to them lol. The servers were very professional and patient with our large group. They would periodically come over to check up on us and clear empty dishes.  I probably wouldn't come again on my own since this place is kinda pricey. But hey, if you're ordering on a company credit card, then go wild and pick whatever you want ;)"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend decided to check out Chop ever since finding out my sister had once worked there as a server. Greeted fast by Chelsea our server, polite, knowledgeable of the menu and was happy.  It took us a while to figure out what we wanted because many of the choices had interesting names that we couldn't figure out...exactly what the product was. Anyways, I decided to go with the featured soup of the day which was a creamy onion or garlic soup. One of those. And he ordered a steak and didnt want scallops on it. Midway - Chelsea came back and said the kitchen cannot remove the scallops and we were dumb founded...because if it was an allergy, would they still not have removed it? I had a feeling she was talking bullshit but we waited............ Once we got our food, my boyfriend just removed the scallops himself and we laughed because we couldn't believe \"the kitchen couldnt to remove the scallops\".  Anyways, The food we had was delicious, price range is slightly pricey, but a very luxury like restaurant to go too ..especially for dates. I work at Moxies and noticed similar things in terms of service and atmosphere....etc. I would come back here if I know we wouldn't get a hard time with changing anything on the menu..."}
{"text":"Thought I'd check out Chop for a steak with a friend and it wasn't too bad -   The ambiance is pleasant though it's somewhat cavernous the music could be turned down to allow for better conversation across the table   I'm a fan of salads and the chop and Caesar had good flavour and I particularly enjoyed the Caesar dressing and could taste a hint of anchovy amongst the garlic   The prime rib was enjoyable and given when we arrived certain \"doneness\"  were not available though it was meaty and juicy at medium   The standard striploin had a decent salt based crust  and was cooked close to perfectly medium rare as requested though I loathe the marbling with corn and grain fed/finished beef on a striploin  - I'd suggest the ribeye as a better juicier bite   I was disappointed with the creme brûlée as it was generally flavourless egg and butter and was set More like benign pudding under a sugar crust - though the gluten free chocolate cake was as far as desserts go flawless  It's pretty standard fare for steak - though I wouldn't go out of my way expecting what can be had at a Keg at a slight better price point and not having to yell across a table  - though it was a nice change of ambiance - this feels more like a hotel sports bar with steaks"}
{"text":"Very simply put...  the best steak I have ever had in Calgary.  Great service.  Clean.  Comfortable.  Love it."}
{"text":"Extremely busy place so others seem to love it.  The staff is very well-trained and clearly have a mission to take care of the customer.   In the bar, I found the music a little too loud and brash for a nice dining experience, and the bar has A LOT of tables.   The food was decidedly average, with the best rating going to the desserts.    I wouldn't go again, but the manager and staff went above and beyond to make us happy and seemed to truly care and that does count for a whole lot."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Chop and I couldn't have been more impressed. All the staff were so great! And the food was absolutely on point! We had an Ahi Tuna appetizer that was to die for and a ribeye Alberta stake that was so tender and flavourful that it melted in your mouth. Awesome food, great and knowledgeable staff, atmosphere was wonderful... the Keg who? needless to say. I'll be going back there and would highly recommend Chop"}
{"text":"I visited Chop for lunch during Summerlicious with nine of my colleagues. First, let me start by saying that the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. It's great for groups, business meetings and even date nights.  I ordered a ceasar salad and a (open face) steak sandwich off the Summerlicious menu ($23). The ceasar salad was exceptional - very fresh and the right amount of garlic. The steak was very good quality but really lacked seasoning. I had to add a ton of salt and pepper and even considering asking for HP. However, the meal itself was above average.  The only issue was that eight of us all received our dishes at the same time. We waited for a good 7-10 minutes for our other two colleagues' meals to come out; meanwhile, all our food was getting cold. Finally, around the 10-minute mark, the manager came out to say that their food would be \"a couple more minutes\". We thought it was odd as they ordered the steak sandwich special as well. Anyway, we all started eating and another 15 minutes goes by without our colleagues' food arriving. Finally, the manager brings out three teensy weensy crab cakes (cocktail party size) for the two of them to share while they waited. We were almost finished our meals before theirs arrived and, to further add insult to injury, one of the steaks were burnt. The restaurant didn't charge them but still ...  Anyway, having said all that, I'd like to return in hopes that the mismanaged kitchen repairs itself. I would have given it four stars but the teeny weensy crab cake offering kind of put me off."}
{"text":"What can't you say about this place? The food, the wine, the atmosphere. You feel like a million bucks eating here. And you pay the price, but hey - you deserve it every once in awhile.  I had the baseball sirloin with lobster and scallop sauce, rum cake, and oh the wine! If you're in the area and don't mind dropping a few sheckles on something truly opulent...don't miss it."}
{"text":"First off, there I want to make sure people understand that Chop is by no means a bad place to eat, the only issue I had of course was that the food quality was not as good as the rest of the experience.    So to start, the environment and decor = excellent. Its a very nice place to be at and it is a comfortable and upscale atmosphere that is still casual so you don't have to worry about dress code.    Secondly, the service is excellent, hats off to the waitress Tiffany (or I think thats her name) for excellent service, being very attentive and always smiling. It always makes the experience better when the staff there seem to be enjoying things at the very least.   So coming down to the food, we ordered the beef carpaccio as an appetizer, a filent mignon and a prime rib to share. We ended the experience with the raspberry creme brule.   The Carpaccio was very good, looked very elegant and very enjoyable.  The Filet Mignon...was ok. It looked good and the sides that came with it were good but the meat itself just wasn't the juicy, ultra tender melting taste that I have had before. The taste was there, but it just wasn't juicy.    The prime rib was also ok. It tasted alright but like the filet, just was not juicy. I mean it was decent but the tendons were really tough on the sides (or my knife was too dull), and when I bit into the meat, it didn't flood or overwhelm my senses with flavour. So in short it tasted fine.    Dessert was a raspberry creme brule, nice and sweet and was satisfying. Nothing mind blowing here either.  So what does it bring it down to? Well it was fine but I expected a whole lot more for a place that had such excellent service and nice environment. It was a nice place to try out for sure and I'd probably give it another try sometime, but as it stands, there just are better places out there."}
{"text":"\"You Can Do Better!\"  Having been to a few CHOP Steakhouse and Bar locations across the country, I can't say that I have ever been thrilled with the interiors, the service or the food.  The location on Dixon near the airport is perhaps one of my least favorite CHOP locations. If you sit near the window in the winter, be sure to bring where a coat as the temperature is cold. And if you order the Jumbo Shrimp cocktail, don't expect to be overwhelmed by the \"jumbo\" aspect or lack thereof.  As a second choice to the best steak restaurant in the area, (The Keg), the first impression on booking a reservation is good. A friendly voice answers the phone and finds you a table for 4 during the busy Holiday period. And a nice enough waitress introduces herself and starts off the service promptly. But that's where the \"nice\" part ends. You sit down and ask to order something very quick, because you're hungry, and an order of onion rings takes 20 minutes. Then unannounced, a male waiter approaches your table and asks if you want something to drink, and you say, where's the other waitress? He says she's actually the bookkeeper and comes down to help once and a while. Rewind the tape.....:Hi, my name is ____, and I'll be taking over for _____\". That would have been much better.  Then the 3 orders arrive, 2 NY and 1 Prime, and the Prime which was ordered medium rare shows up well done. Now you have 2 people wondering when to start eating and another wondering when they will get their correct order. Next, a Manager struts over with the corrected Prime and you somehow get that feeling that a Manager is coming over to apologize, but no, he just drops off the dish and says nothing!  Overall, my impression of this CHOP is that the environment is \":cold\", both literally and in a service sense, the food is about average and prices are not representative of both of those shortcomings. If I were in charge of improving the restaurant, I think I would....  1. Like the Keg, bring some warm sour dough bread close to when the guests are seated, or some other food item that can appease hungry guests as they wait for other guests or their server.  2. If you make a change in wait staff, ask the new staff to introduce themselves.  3. Deal with the \"cold\" issues...there's nothing like warm cloth napkins on a cold day.  4. Warm the plates before you serve the steak. Cold plates are never good for a hot steak.  5. Next time you design a new CHOP, use leather on the benches instead of the velour or crushed velvet type of cloth you have there now. The seating areas (by the window) look dirty and worn and I think the restaurant is only a few years old."}
{"text":"The ultimate Chop experience is a sunny summer day up on the rooftop patio which gets plenty of sun. The upstairs bar is my second favorite. You take the elevator up, likely have to wait for even a standing cocktail table or a booth by the door but that is just a testament to how popular it is.  When a new cocktail is created I am always game to try it, so last Friday when they had come up with a proper pina colada on ice (no premade mix or slush here) I knew I had to give it a go. Delicious!! I normally would order a White Greyhound/ Wine/ Manhattan/ Old Fashioned and save the pina colada for on a beach in Mexico... but these guys know what they are doing. It was perfect!  The reason I didn't give a full 5 stars is because for me 4 stars is the highest a chain restaurant can earn, it may not be fair but for what category Chop falls in just know 4/5 is high praise."}
{"text":"Bennet on the bar and the other bartender truly provide exceptional service. Suggested a great blonde by GLB and provided some great insight into the menu offerings for the night. Definitely will make this a regular spot after a great visit tonight!"}
{"text":"Here I am,  again in Toronto. This time I had to stay close to the airport as all hotels in town seem to be sold out due to the F1 race (at least that's what I guess). Anyway, I happened to be at walking distance from this place and, despite some bad reviews, I decided to give it a try. It's useless to say, it was a decision I regret pitifully. First thing I noticed was the youngness of their personnel. All waitresses seems to be right there on the 21 milestone. That gave me a big tip about the bad service reviews here on Yelp. My waitress was kind of attentive at first but that went south really fast. She got my glass of Malbec and I ordered a wedge salad and then a filet mignon with mashed potatoes. The wedge salad and the bread did come really fast and I have to say they were a really good salad and bread service (hence one of the two stars). The kind you will find in good, reputable steakhouses. After that everything developed in the opposite direction. I got my steak (10+ minutes after I finished the salad) which looked good on the outside. I normally raise my steak from the plate to see if the cooking was consistent and that's when the problem raised. Since this was the first time I got the beef in front of me, not a return from a bad temperature fix, it is very unlikely that the steak will have a perfect knife cut, like the ones you do when the waiter wants you to check on the temperature. Knowing, no chef in the world will make a cut in a beef to check the temperature (that's extremely unprofessional), the only conclusion possible was that that piece of meat was cut before cooking or, my worst guess, it has been returned from another table. I patiently waited for at least 10 minutes waiting for someone to ask me about my food. One thing I noticed was that the manager delivered the plate to my table. My waitress was nowhere to be found. After 10 minutes I saw her standing up from a table in the back of the room where she was with other waitresses working on something (I give her the benefit of the doubt). When she approached me I was already beyond the point of no return. We all make mistakes in life, but it is the way you recover from mistakes what makes the difference. Told the girl the problem and to take the plate back and give me my check. She did the first and sent the manager. I told him I don't want an apology neither another opportunity. It was late, I was tired and they mismanaged the situation. He waived my bill and offered me a $50 gift card (here is the 2nd of the two stars). I thank him for the gesture and said good bye..... for good.  Recommend this place? Well guys, there is a Jack Astors right in front of the street open till 11:30pm.... you got the point, don't ya?"}
{"text":"Really good steak and wonderful presentation and service! Hubby and I loved the food here so much! Just a bit pricey. Great for special occasions!"}
{"text":"Portions were not great, really expensive for what you get...more quality and quantity at The Keg."}
{"text":"Had the chop salad and it was amazing. As a big guy I didn't think it would be enough for me, but it more than enough. This is a great place for business meetings, dates or getting together with friend.   Enjoy your time here."}
{"text":"Had the smoked rib eye steak and it is one of the more enjoyable steaks I have had. I love smoked anything, but they definitely do a good job."}
{"text":"I really liked it. Food was really good. Liked the menu. My spouse found it too open, but I was looking at the tv.  Service was great. Friendly, honest and helpful. Thanks Inez. *chocolate creme brûlée is more like a mousse. Very chocolatey and tasty, but not usual \"creme brûlée\".  And Thanks yelp and Olio for the free dessert! I do recommend."}
{"text":"I seriously wonder how this place has good ratings.   My friend and I got prime rub (medium rare) and baseball sirlion. Both were flavorless and tough to chew. The baseball sirlion was so tough it was inedible.   If this wasn't a business expense, I would have returned it to the kitchen and probably left. I've never done that before, but the food was THAT bad."}
{"text":"Food tastes great we had Italian  veal sandwich and salmon salsa burger.  I found the menu to be overpriced for office lunch outings.  Especially when you are competing with Jack Astors, all star wings, JJ, and many more around this location.  The service was extremely poor. We are chatting post our meal and the waitress kept interrupting and implying for us to leave the place. It was not a full house anyways.  I don't think I will be going back here."}
{"text":"Chop was a great place to get dinner on our layover after a long flight. Their kitchen is open late and they have many options for gluten free and other food allergies. Being allergic to wheat, vinegar, and oats makes it hard to eat out sometimes. Our waitress was super helpful and had the manager personally deliver my food to ensure no cross contamination. The food was tasty. Only complaint was that it seemed fairly expensive for what we got. Overall decor was top notch and luxurious looking. I would definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant surprise on an unexpected stop over in Toronto pretty close to the airport. The decor was very nice and the steak was very good. A small negative side is that they measure the drinks very scientifically and I always feel when you're paying that kind of price they should make a healthy pour. It's worth noting also that there are no ugly employees in this place; if youenjoy being served by very attractive and well dressed ladies, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We had the Carpaccio and Small Lobster Dinner.  I have had better (and at a better price), but the hostess, bartender and chef were extremely accommodating.  We were tired and looking for a store and a decent place to eat.  I came across Chinook Centre and saw Chop and said that's where we're going, please see if they are open.  It was 11:35pm and they closed at midnight.  Very nice hostess said if we ordered by 11:45pm, they would serve us.  I told her we were also looking for a convenience store and she directed us to a 24 hr. store just down the drive.  We took seats in the bar, ordered at the top of my head, had a good drink, good conversation, and a pretty good meal.  Considering we were probably all not at our best, it was very good and we appreciated the Canadian hospitality."}
{"text":"Overall not that impressed, I've been a few times and nothing stands out. I've tried their onion rings, salmon, steak bites, Cobb salad etc. The last time I went one of the steaks were undercooked asked med brought out with a very rare center, they took back the entire plate and then brought the same cut back over cooked (it's a steakhouse!) the French onion soup was way too salty, and the other steak had too much steak spice on it it completely over powered the steak. My prime rib was good (I asked for med rare came med but I didn't mind cause it was a roast, steak would've been a different story) along with the sides, which in my opinion were a bit over cooked (I prefer grilled veg to be del dente.)  The service was good, although I felt bad for our server when the kitchen messes up your tables experience. The two I was with that were unhappy with their steaks got theirs taken off their bill and were asked for their email addresses, but swear that wouldn't even bring them back and could take the steak spice the next morning. So they did try to make the situation better."}
{"text":"The venue is beautiful. Service has always been fast but the food has never satisfied everyone in my party, including myself. I've been here 3-4 times now typically for a after work function and I find they add too much salt/seasoning, especially on some of their steaks and French onion soup. They need to let the steaks speak for themselves (at Jacobs steak house they offer salt on the side) This time I opted for 'the chop experience' my medium-rare steak was served medium which was ok but opposite of what my colleague asked for with his, which is just unacceptable for a steakhouse to get 2/3 wrong. The seasonal vegetables (heirloom?) carrots were blackened at the tips and smothered in sauce, I always finish my veggies and I didn't with those. We shared onion rings which were delicious, the bread w whipped butter is always good and a seasonal lobster & Gorgonzola dip that 6 people didn't manage to finish, cause it just wasn't that good. Personally, if I'm going to pig out on a cream based dip, and French onion dip it needs to be mouth watering- I won't waste the calories if it's not worth it. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  The food was really good, but what made us love this place was the friendly staff. Our waiter went out of his way so many times to make us feel welcome. He suggested a few delicacies, drinks and main dishes and everyone was happy with what they got. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Visiting on business to conference center  -party of 6, no reservations. No issues, sat in bar booths. Missed ages of guests.   - Malbec by glass was perfect.  -we had the steak bites and tuna tarte for starters, both delicious  -I had the petite filet for main, it was pretty cooked and seriously impressive. -entire party commented on how delicious the food was. -clean and modern decor  -lovely and friendly server -would return"}
{"text":"I had a client meeting at this location on Monday. I had the Grilled Chicken & Pancetta Club. In a word...excellent. This is a solid restaurant that delivers a solid meal. It's a do-over for me."}
{"text":"Picture this...a restaurant that positions themselves as a mid-high end Steakhouse but only delivers mediocre food & service. Hmmm...not a good combination for ANY restaurant! Now, to be fair our server repeatedly told us that this location was a training store. I'm not sure if the word \"training\" meant carte blanch for \"to be mediocre\" or not?   It started out ok with a typical but boring Caesar Salad. The dressing should have been house made but it wasn't, I could tell by the flavour profile.   The main was a small fillet w Blue cheese which was very tasty & cooked to my liking. The sides & dessert is where the wheels fell off.... a warm 1/2 tomato with a crumble (should have been hot in my opinion) & truffle potato's that we're almost completely tasteless. The server (Ahmed) was good but he \"hovered\" which he should have.   They attempted to make up for the tasteless potato's by a complimentary dessert. Mine was Baked Alaska. Ice cream was good but the cake sponge was so frozen I needed a knife to cut it. The cheese cake was not good as it had that \"left open to the fridge\" taste. Should have been covered.   Don't think I'll be venturing back to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"A few friends and I decided to have dinner at Chop before attending a comedy show at the nearby Laugh Shop. I had never been before, but I'd seen it during my outings to Chinook and the menu looked pretty interesting. When we arrived, our table was already available since we had made a reservation, and our server was very friendly and helpful. We ordered drinks, which were pretty good (I had the Bellini) and then our food. I was pleased that everything came out SUPER fast. The crab cakes we had to share were really yummy, as was the french onion soup I had chose for my starter. I decided to go with the steak for my meal, since it's a steakhouse, but was really disappointed. Perhaps it was the cut or the way it was prepared, but it was tough to cut through and tasted fatty. My boyfriend also commented that his tasted like liver (I don't know what that means haha). We also shared the dessert trio, which was pretty tasty. It was a decent meal, and the service was great, but it is WAY too expensive for what you get. Our bill came out to around $140, and I felt that we could have had the same (if not better) meal somewhere else for a lot cheaper. It was a fun experience because of the company we were with, but I would not return to Chop. It's nothing special and seriously overpriced. However, I will comment that the restaurant itself is beautiful and the bathrooms are really nice!"}
{"text":"The old fashion we ordered was grossly sweet, and we had to exchange it.  It was one of those things that took 3 tries to get right.  We started with the crab cakes.  Tastes like it was from frozen with little frozen vegetables in it, like corn.  Then we shared the ravioli (added chicken) and chop salad (added steak).  Ravioli was alright, and chicken was not dry.  We were surprised by the \"chop\" salad.  The plum tomatoes were just cut into quarters, so it wasn't chopped at all.  Huge chunks of everything, it was like we were eating straight from the produce aisle!  The steak was seasoned oddly, tasted like teriyaki.  The timing of the food was excellent however.  Drinks, starter, mains all came out within a reasonable time.  The server even checked to make sure we were done with the appetizer before sending out the mains.  Overall, a decent meal, nice and clean establishment and good service.  Nothing stood out however and we feel like the menu could have more flare."}
{"text":"Came for winterlicious and I am not disappointed.  Crab cakes are very tasty.  I had the sirloin which for me the portion is really small and taste wise is fair.  My husband had the prime rib which is really excellent.  Dessert,  Chocolate Soufflé is really good.  Ambience is very cozy and nice.  Our server was really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my bf and his sister and brother in-law on Saturday. The place wasn't as busy as I had expect it. It could be because it was the first nice super hot weekend we had in a while. We had quite a few drinks amongst us and for appetizers; we had the escargot stuffed mushroom, albacore tuna Tanaka, crab cakes, lobster scallop & gorgonzola dip, and the prime rib Yorkies (the Yorkers was in error, it was supposed to be for another table)  For dinner we ordered the citrus soy glazed Salmon, surf and turf and two orders of prime rib. It was all so tastefully flavoured and cooked perfectly. Food came out nice and hot and in appropriate time, as it should be for the price that they charge. The bill came out to around 400.00 for 4 people (Thanks Sandra). The service was great and friendly and the place was properly lite and clean. I would of given this place 5 Stars but the time that we went there ~ there was some constructions being done to the restaurant and it was a bit distracting."}
{"text":"First steakhouse experience in Calgary, and it was memorable! Me and my colleague didn't know what to order, so we asked Alex for recommendation. Thanks Alex for all your help and we are back in Vancouver now. Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Solid. Lobster fettuccine was delicious. Impeccable surroundings and Mad Tom IPA on tap. Gem in the area. I will be back."}
{"text":"I was here last night for a Corporate Christmas Party, It was very professionally organised. The servers well welcoming and knowledgeable in making drinks. The appetizers were amazing , very tasty, the chicken tandoori was very tender, tasty (but a bit spicy) . The meat and onion rings were very good too. I was feeling so full after the appetizers that didnt really go for the main courses, just tried the salmon and mashed potatoes. it was really good.   They have a DJ and dancing area, we had a good time. Will definitely come back  with my family."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here and loved it. We started with the beef carpaccio which was very good. We then had the wedge (me) and French onion soup (him). Both were good...we both ordered the prime rib medium rare. Both were a little more on the medium side but had very little fat on them and excellent flavor. Next time I'm back in Toronto I will be back here."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Had the filet and Caesar and glass of Pinot noir. I enjoyed the service - keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Great food and good service in the restaurant. Martinis are teeny though and overpriced. OK wine list and good desserts."}
{"text":"I had supper this evening at the Chop Steakhouse, which is close to my hotel.  I sat in the lounge, rather than the dining room, which was more relaxed.  Sabrina, my server, started me off with some complementary warm rye bread and butter ... yum!  I ordered prime rib with a baked potato (minus the horseradish).  I found the huge plate an odd choice as it made the baked potato look small (which it was).  I ordered my steak medium.  It was cooked just the way I like it ... just a bit pink.  It was good, tender and tasty but cold and the au jus was warm but not hot.  They need to adjust their temperatures a bit.  I would have given four stars had the steak been the proper temperature.   Sabrina was very friendly and took excellent care of me."}
{"text":"Gord and I had an early supper today at Chop Steakhouse & Bar.  We sat in the dining room.  I ordered Oven Roasted Chicken ... I'd had it last month in their London location.  I ordered it with mashed potatoes and no veggies and received mashed potatoes and rice pilaf.  That was fine with me.  The chicken was tender and the pan jus was lemony.  The potatoes and rice pilaf were good.  Gord ordered the Chop Burger.  He said it was a delicious burger and he'd get it again.  Chanel was our server.  She was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! I've been by this location about 100 times, and saw it pop up on Open Table so gave it a whirl to start our Christmas vacation.  Being superfans of the Keg, we spent most of the dinner comparing the two. I don't know much about the Chop chain (seems to be mostly out west), but I definitely liked the service from start to finish. The seating booth was comfortable and we liked the cage lighting fixtures. Some neat hat light fixtures as well.  They have this tasty Veltliner wine, I'm a huge fan of Veltliner. Extra star for that. Such a fun, easy drinking wine.  Crab/Shrimp Cakes to start, very good indeed!   Of course I had the Teriyaki Sirloin to compare, and was very happy with the portion. Cooked perfectly. Patti had the Prime Rib, which was huge! Great portions for both.  Can't remember if we got dessert, was a long holiday...  But we'll definitely return! Not sure if it will break into the Keg area of my heart, but happy we took the drive out!"}
{"text":"This was hands down the best dining experience I have had in a long while! Went here with my friends for Winterlicious menu and it was fantastic from start to finish! I had the season green salad, to sirloin steak and mashed potatoes with the apple crumble to top it off. Everything was absolutely delicious! The staff was extremely accommodating, and the managers were on top of everything! Also, one of the best whiskey sours I've ever tasted! Well done! Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"We went here for my dads birthday because he's loves trying new steakhouses.   The decor of the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous and the patio is so romantic!   We ordered the Ahi Tuna salad, the Top Sirloin steak and another steak dish (I can't remember the name of). Honestly, the food was mediocre and the portions on the steak dishes were underwhelming. (see photos)  The biggest disappointment of the while dining experience was the service. It was incredibly slow, from beginning to end. We waited 45 minutes to get the bill and had to ask 4 times to 3 different people.   I'm usually not usually one for fine dining/fancy restaurants - and this experience reminded me exactly why. I had high expectations for the place but left disappointed :("}
{"text":"Busy place, great service,we were in booth in the cocktail lounge, spacious( sorry real estate agent talking) great value prime rib (little fatty)but medium size plentiful . Wasabi crusted ahi tuna tasty. veg crispy  mash and baked potato done perfectly.The experience includes salad,two excellent sides. business crowd, 25-50 . We will return ."}
{"text":"I was really excited to finally stop here before movie at Cineplex, it turned out to be a disappointment. I was looking forward to a couple of fancy cocktails, but nothing was to my liking, any fancy martinis with some juices or cocktails with flair were lacking! My hubby enjoyed his Moscow mule, there were old fashioned or whiskey sour, all very appealing to my hubby, but nothing for me! So I ordered a rye ginger!  Then time to order off the menu they had a steak and crab special on for$50 I never eat all my meal, so we decided to share, and I love crab, and a good steak! The portion was small, approximately a 6-7 oz steak which was flavoured well but very tough a cheap cut no doubt as we ordered it medium, the crab was okay 2 legs, and we had scalloped potatoes which were okay but in all the meal was not worth the price!! Very disappointed! We didn't want to stay so we got the bill and left!  The only things I liked were Melissa the server, the bartender was very nice and tried to accommodate me,and the ambiance was nice with a few T.V's in the lounge! Won't be going back sorry personal opinion, also saw a hamburger with fries go to another table, looked great wish we would've ordered that!!"}
{"text":"Had an overnight in Toronto.  No food in the hotel. They pointed me to the restaurant.  Everything I had was top notch.  From the Ceasar Salad, to the Smokehouse Burger with one of the finest examples of great bacon that I have ever had, to the Cheesecake.  Not bad for a back up, and more than enough for a great meal.  Highly recomend the place."}
{"text":"People calling it \"High End\" clearly need to eat out more. CHOP is like a Moxie's vibe but with the steak quality of The Keg. Really enjoyed my meal but the atmosphere was not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are positive reviews on this place.  Our group started with the steak bites, tempura appy + tuna tataki to start.  Sadly, this was the best part of our meal.  The restaurant was empty, it was a Monday evening, I guess it's busier during the day for business lunches.  Ordered the prime rib, expecting it to be similar to The Keg, and it wasn't.  The tasteless au jus was smothered on my prime rib (wish it was served on the side), and it was more like a gravy than an au jus.  I guess you just can't beat The Keg for prime rib beef.  Unless you are having someone pay for your meal, you won't be that impressed.  I will say that the décor, seating and room is well done, it looks like a high end place, but the food doesn't match the décor."}
{"text":"We had a reservation in the bar and in short terrible service and average food.    The white wine is served at the same temp as red which I've not seen anywhere I've dined (this is how server described it).  I don't often have white but when I do I want it to be colder than my red.  Our server never asked if how our food was and I guess that's good ... don't bother with the onion soup it was disappointing, our friends said the escargots was not that good, cesar salad ok.  For the entrees the ribs and haddock were declared as very good as were the crab legs.  One of our friends ordered steak medium and it was very well done.  The dinner salad served with steak and mushroom ravioli were uninspiring.  I don't know if they were short staffed but the service was not good.  She disappeared for blocks of time, perhaps she was also serving tables in the dining room.  The dining room area was smaller than I expected.  No need for us to return."}
{"text":"Carpaccio and Chop Salad were amazing. Dessert menu was a bit limited, so we walked over to Joey."}
{"text":"June 2016 Beautiful upscale restaurant. Rebecca was a perfect server. The Steak and Crab was excellent. The Steak Oscar was almost excellent. A more intimate setting than The Keg. I will try the Prime Rib next time."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Chop, with the great reviews on this restaurant, I brought my girlfriend there to try it. The atmosphere is great but service extremely poor. We ordered prime rib and sirloin both medium. The sirloin came out cold, we thought it was because we chose the steak to be medium done. When we asked the waiter about it, he questioned us back saying \"are you sure it is cold;  with no apologies he said he will call his manager.  The manager came , again no apologies and just asked whether we wanted the steak to be heated up or if we wanted a new steak.  We chose to have a new one, the new sirloin came out perfectly after 15 mins.  However, our mood was already gone; my girlfriend already finished her own dish.  After plates were all cleared, the waiter just dropped of the dessert menu on the table and left Without saying anything. This is totally unprofessional. This is the worst experience we had at any restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chop burger with Caesar salad.  The burger was ok..not a fan of the sauce on it.  The dressing on the salad was too much and made the salad soggy.   Also order the chicken fingers on the kids meal menu.  The chicken fingers were hard when they cooled off because there was too much breading on it.  The kids couldn't eat it.    I've been to this restaurant many times and I've been disappointed with the food on most occasions.   Restaurant is very clean and very nice decor.  Staff was great but the food is a disappointment."}
{"text":"Ate here as it was walking distance from my hotel. smoked Ribeye was amazing. Ate at the bar. Was busy and a little loud but I prefer that over a formal quiet steakhouse. Bartenders were awesome. I will be back."}
{"text":"Chop, Chop, Choppity Chop! Never had steak or beef in AB, but golly this changed that. We stopped in for lunch fare. Atmosphere is swanky AF. People are dressed nice, very catering. We sat at the bar tried the goji soda. I would pass on it, and get the lemonade. Way better! Our server gave it to us on accident. But it turns out it was meant to be. I had the Chop House Burger. Now I'm from Texas and beef is religious, but damn can Canadians make a burger. Thought it was filled with flavor. Scrumptious and Savory. The cheese, onions, meat seasoning, with that basil aioli. Changed the way I worshiped the lord. Dear Jesus forgive me, but this beef was heaven. Side salad to go with it greens were mean and tasteful. Would not pass up if you're in the area or at the airport. Calgary is huge I cannot imagine! Thanks Canada. You're beef has blessed me."}
{"text":"Tried this place recently, and have to say it was one of the best stakes I've had.  Service was great as well. I'll definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"This relatively new (1 month) restaurant in the Hilton Hotel Peking lot is great for this business industrial area of Mississauga.   Since we have an office here  I was able to try this place out and thoroughly enjoyed my experience.   Service - from a technical point, the service was challenged at best. Slow, inconsistent, forgetful, disorganized. However I quickly overlooked this and give them a solid 4 star!  Why???? Because from the host/ hostesses at the entry to the server, wine guru and the manager, they know that they are staffing up and that the kinks are being addressed. Their attitudes and focus are 5 star and their attitude is fantastic. So in this regard I this gonna be great.   Food - we all enjoyed it. The menu is your typical steak house fare with hamburgers, pasta,  salads, chicken and different steak options. I was excited to see prime rib in the menu also!  I used my special test which I grade all steak houses. I ordered a Filet Mignon Blue, which is both very rare and difficult to make tender and melt in your mouth. Here, they did an awesome job as it was very, very tender!    My colleagues all enjoyed their steaks which was a Steak Oscar and a New York Strip.   Beverages - great wine selection and I love the wine gurus who assist in the selection of the wines. The reds are laid out from light to heavy and this is an awesome way to choose wine for someone that is a novice like moi.   Ambiance. - 5 star for sure. The entire feel is a bit of a hip and happening place. Everyone is enthusiastic and very attentive. Dressed to kill or fashionable, everyone looks ready to hit the nightclub. As a guest you can be casual or more upscale, I have seen everyone from dressy to shorts and flip flops. This is the best as it is not pretentious and your experience is personal.    The patio- the outdoor seating is an amazing  addition and I was fortunate to enjoy it on a summer day where the humidity was low, a slight breeze and cool. The day before this it was hot and humid and wet. That would not have been fun. They do have heaters for the cooler months and I wonder how that would be. My experience was that it was just right!  Gk says check this place out!"}
{"text":"Decided to visit this place as it is newly opened and looked pretty sharp from outside (they got flames in their patio). It wasn't that crowded for a Friday night but not dead either. Food was average. Fast service and nice decor. I would recommend to try it."}
{"text":"Winterlicious review  Came for lunch with a friend.   App: Caesar salad - appropriate portions, was a good tasty salad. Nothing really different.   Main: Chop Burger - again not really a big deal. It tasted good. Can't really brag about it aside from the fact that coming from the place I'm glad it tasted well? If anything I really wish there was something unique to it to make it the signsture burger. Otherwise it tasted just like any other burher  Dessert: Chocolate mousse cake - probably my favorite part of the meal. Sweet, decadent, rich.    Service: was great, our waitress always checked on us and was friendly.   Overall 3/5 for the winterlicious menu, Not because of the experience but mostly because of the menu choices. The Chop Burger needs more individuality to make it stand out from a similar burger in other restaurants."}
{"text":"First time eating at the restaurant. Went for lunch with my family. Steak bites and sweet potato fries were great!"}
{"text":"This was one of the more delicious steaks I've had in a long while. First of all, this restaurant is huge. They've got a dining area, a tv/music bar area, and a patio. We sat at a high top in the bar area. Had a very clubby feel. The hostess, waitresses, and bartendes were attentive and extremely attractive. All the steaks were aged 35 days according to the menu. I ordered the smoked ribeye medium. The steak came out quickly and was cooked perfectly medium. The house made ketchup/bbq sauce was very good as well. Price wasn't bad for the quality of food. Would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our second time to this location. There is ample parking and they take reservations. The food is very good, as is the service. The only criticism I have is it was my daughters birthday and they do give a complimentary desert but it is the small portion (which is very small). I think you can afford the regular portion (just saying) like other restaurants.  I do recommend a try!"}
{"text":"I went to chopped after treating me and a friend to a great meal after a days work. .my friends mentioned that the food and service were great so i decided to go myself and find out.   I started out with the shrimp tacos as my appetizer. It basically looked like shrimp salad in tacos with mayo and scallops, it was okay but i could taste it in my mouth 5 hours after the meal ..the lingering seafood taste.  The french onion soup tasted like broth and water, it was ridiculously salty especially for someone who has high blood pressure.  Mashed potatoes were alright however the steak was just average. It had no flavour to it. It should be marinated or have some seasoning to it   King crab legs are definitely NOT worth the price. We received 3 legs and there was basically NO crab inside, in addiction the staff did not supply us with any cracker to open the leg so we had to use our hands to pry the legs open.    Sauteed mushrooms were drenched in salt, and grease the mushrooms that were on the bottom were completely black and full of salt.  The cob salad which the waitress recommended was not worth it. It comes with boiled eggs, bacon bits or your choice of meat, cucs, tomatoes,and avocado The surprise dressing was served on the lettuce which had just a vinaigrette.  It upset me that i had to mix all the ingredients together and the plate was definitely not the good size to be mixing everything together.  The salad was pretty plain and cost 20$ . if i knew that i would not have ordered it.   We told the chef to ease up on the salt so hopefully he takes the advice.   Overall the food was alright but for the price i had to pay i would not go there again."}
{"text":"The chicken wings are to die for.  The prime rib and New York steak are good. Get the chop style with any steaks."}
{"text":"Came in when it was very busy, found a place at the bar and ordered drinks and dinner.  Bar staff works hard and does a great job of taking Care of a very groused bar.  The food was excellent, as you would expect.   Very good experience"}
{"text":"I waited to visit this place a couple of times before I posted a review. My original visit consisted of drinks and a salad, there was an iceberg wedge of some sort that wasn't too bad.  Again, not a lot of options for Vegan/vegetarian.  The second visit wasn't as great. And it seemed as though the menu had been changed to cater to some sort of seafood/lobster Festival.  Warning to seafood lovers: seafood comes from the ocean and should be eaten fresh.  Anyhoo, the waitstaff looked tired and underpaid. All of them were falling out of their high heels and miniskirts. Most of them had on so much make up that you could see orange sparkle rounding the size of their faces and necks. I know this isn't reviewing the food, but it makes it hard to order food.  Peroni was on special that night, which meant it was only about three or four dollars more than what you could buy it for at the store. I had a couple of Caesar's That were actually made to order and tasted pretty good. Let me tell you, is very very difficult to find a good Caesar most times.  We split a pasta- Butternut squash the soybeans, Asparagus and some other unmemorable appetizer.  Butternut squash was fine, just fine. Soybeans were absolutely atrocious they were slimy and drippy and not at all what you would want to eat with your hands.   Asparagus was asparagus - not too great not too bad, at least it wasn't woody or really small.  We left owing around $150, and were seated outside on the patio overlooking the parking lot.   One thing that struck me as icky from the beginning was the fact that the white plastic chairs you were to sit on had not been scrubbed down at any time this patio season.  I think I would return there for drinks, But not too many. Before a movie or something like that. Otherwise I would stay away from here for food."}
{"text":"My family had a group dinner for 12 here about a month ago. It included a delicious prix fixe menu that was very filling. All courses were churned out quickly, despite the restaurant being filled with people.   The server (I think her name was Elizabeth, long blond hair) was remarkable. She was so polite and gracious, despite all the pointed requests my family was throwing at her. She stayed calm and smiling all dinner. She is the reason why I will return in future. Obviously has received excellent customer service training.  Also, try the steak bites!"}
{"text":"Great location ,great decor and nice lounge , Food was OK, but not worth the price , the prime rib portion was quite small,compared to similar restaurants, over cooked and horse radish was Blah, worst of  all was the service , slow , with obviously limited experience with no wine knowledge , it's  to bad , the restaurant has potential, but in the very competitive market, I will choose to spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Is this the BEST?? Surprised it was rated #1. I ordered the half lobster since it was their special and it was just ok. My son's mushroom ravioli was lacking something - salt or just more flavor in general. I ordered the forgettable \"unforgettable\" apple pie. The best item was the vanilla ice cream - the apples had no taste and they doused the plate in cinnamon to compensate for the lack of flavor. The crust should be the best thing on an apple pie and it was tasteless and rubbery. Will have to drive to downtown Toronto for better restaurants.   Pros: good service, nice ambience and good wine list."}
{"text":"Had a steak lunch which was very good. With the exception of a fried tomato with cornmeal on top we both completely cleaned out plate."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday once and it was an amazing time. Everyones food looked delicious, no complaints from anyone.  It has that classy romantic vibe espeically on a saturday night with your partner. But for a party it was great.   At the end of it I got a birthday card and a gift card for my next visit only because it was my birthday.  Loved my first experience here at Chop!"}
{"text":"Awesome food at a reasonable price $$$. Absolutely loved the chopped experience and the French onion soup has got to be one of the best in the city"}
{"text":"First time here and very impressed. I tried the prime rib and it was the absolute best prime rib I've ever tasted and the mashed potato went perfectly with it. If anyone is looking for a great priced and delicious dinner I would definitely recommend Chop Steakhouse"}
{"text":"Our dinner at CHOP, next to Chinook Scotiabank theatres, was a good experience. We arrived at around 6:40 p.m., but had we arrived at 6, we probably would have made the 7 p.m. movie showings next door.   We ate in the dining room, not the lively lounge upstairs. The décor of CHOP is lovely, equipped with large comfortable booths and a good amount of natural light.   We started with a Caesar ($6 Wed special), good flavor, fresh celery and red pepper, spiced perfectly.   Our mains were both good. The Hunter Chicken ($25) was chicken breast with a mushroom sauce, seared crispy skin, seasoned well. The skin under the sauce got soft so I opted to remove that but the meat was delicious, tender and of a good size. Also was wasabi-infused mashed potatoes (no wasabi flavor that I could tell) and perfectly cooked green beans and red peppers.   The large prime rib ($35) came with one side, we didn't opt to go for the \"Chop Experience Dinner\" which would have meant for the same price we'd get a petite prime rib instead of large but also two sides (rice, baked potato, mashed potato, fries) plus a starter salad OR soup. We were happy with the large prime rib and one side, of which we got to choose a seasonal offering, lobster mashed potatoes. Not a lot of lobster. But excellent prime rib. They said it would melt in your mouth. It does melt in your mouth. We asked for it to be cooked medium.   Finally the Caribbean Rum Cake with vanilla gelato. Excellent. We ordered the mini size ($4).   Great dinner. Our server Jesse was cool. He looked like Justin Bieber. The Biebs serving you a delicious large prime rib is solid good."}
{"text":"Was not a fan of this place.. the food is okay overall I don't think I would go there"}
{"text":"Chop is a hit. Did you see the pic of prime rib experience.  It truly was a mouthwatering dish. The wasabi mashed potatoes was a first but not a last time for me. I went for a engagement party and the whole staff was so accommodating.  They also had decorated the dining area. I will be back,  maybe after a workout.  Got that protein pump."}
{"text":"Wow. What an amazing experience this was!   My fiancé and I came in to have a birthday lunch. She is sensitive to gluten and dairy. I have never seen any restaurant, especially a chain, be so cautious and considerate of food allergies. They had a dedicated food allergen chart that showed which items on the menu had what potential allergens and alternatives to how you can still enjoy the dish. That was surprise #1. In addition to that, the manager came out to explain the allergen menu and went through how the dish would be prepared so that you don't get upset.   On to the food... The food was great. We had the steak bites as an app, my fiancé had the top sirloin and I had the open face prime rib. The food was excellent. Tasty and perfectly cooked. Portions are a bit small for the price, but the quality makes it justifiable.   Second surprise was the complementary sorbet with Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the plate; and a signed birthday card from the staff. That was an amazing touch that we didn't expect at all.   The attention to allergies, the awesome service and surprise birthday gestures made this experience one that will bring me back again and again.   TL,DR: amazing attention to food allergies, awesome service and a surprise at the end made this experience one we won't forget and will return because of it."}
{"text":"Busy steak house but wasn't the best steak I've had. Prices are pretty high, but my steal was very chewy with veins. Good atmosphere but we were crammed in a small booth   Food 3/5 Service 5/5 Experience 3/5 Price 3/5"}
{"text":"The service at the bar was excellent!!... The cocktails were really good!!... The food was not bad, but nothing amazing... I think is a good place to go if you are in the chinook mall and want to have some drinks or if you arrive early to the movies and have to wait for some time..."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance, excellent service, attentive staff. The food on the other hand was terrible. Our party of four all ordered the top sirloin steaks. I ordered mine medium rare. We all agreed that the steaks were very tough. Our appetizers and desserts were great but we came for steaks ... which were terrible."}
{"text":"Service & Food was FANTASTIC! Went here for me and my wife's 10 year anniversary. Even received a card from the workers there. Food was phenomenal, server Milan was the best server we've ever had."}
{"text":"Came for dinner a couple nights ago. I was greeted promptly and though my dinning companion had made a reservation, I was given the option of the lounge or dining room. I went with the lounge.  The lounge is on the second floor and there's an elevator to get up there. It's fairly spacious with a horseshoe shaped bar with a ring of large booths around the outside. No matter which way you're facing there's lots of TV's to catch the game.  Our server was very friendly and not intrusive. She just let us be to have our conversation and talk shop while we slowly decided on our dinners and wine.  I went with the mushroom sirloin. The meal was done well, but the piece of steak I got wasn't great, a little gristle-y. The baked potato hit the spot."}
{"text":"I forgot to write a review about this place.. came here a couple months ago and I enjoyed it. The steaks and apps and drinks are really good. I will definitely come back here again. They have more options then The Keg and the drinks taste way better here. Steaks are both equally good, I can't say which is better.. but hmm.. Yeah, the peppercorn steak here is way better then The Keg.. (I tried my friends). But the filet mignon, I have to give it to The Keg."}
{"text":"I had the escargot with mushroom caps with the mushroom sirloin.  The steak was prepared perfectly and escargot was very hot and good the bread that was good to dip in the oil. Martini was to my liking. Well done a happy customer."}
{"text":"Ambience us really nice and decor is good too. Service was great, but unfortunately the $ for food value was not there. I don't mind paying more for the service and ambience, but the FOOD has to be top notch as well.. That's just where it fell flat for me - my opinion. I think everyone should check it out at least once to see for themselves."}
{"text":"One of my colleagues suggested that we meet for dinner at Chop. I immediately understood \"why\" when I noticed that every member of the staff was young, female, attractive, and wearing something tight and semi-revealing.    That said, the food here is pretty decent and our server, Anna, was excellent.    The steak bites (seasoned in soy and sesame, I assume with some ginger and shallots, too) are a great appetizer.    The menu is varied, but not overwhelming.  The place has a decent vibe, but it is clearly aimed at the male business traveler, as others have mentioned.    If your choice is Chop versus a hotel restaurant, this is clearly a huge upgrade in the quality of the food, ambiance, and...scenery."}
{"text":"The service started slow, but then was very attentive.  My order came out and the steak was not hot.  They fixed the problem right away.  However, the quality of the food was mediocre.  Okay if you are staying next door at the Sheraton (which I was) for convenience, but i wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"If you don't like a gorgeous wait staff, this is not your place.  I sat in the bar area...  I had the Caprese salad. It was good. More than enough for one person.  It definitely has a smoky flavor.   I wanted something lite so I was talked onto the Carpaccio. It was also very good. The two apps/salads were more than I could handle. Finished about half of each.   I went on a Tuesday and the drink special was the Greyhound. Highly recommended. It was fabulous.  I will go back as I stay at a hotel close here frequently."}
{"text":"Had the Prime Rib here the other night and it was fantastic. As well you must have the french onion soup as a starter, both my wife and I really enjoyed it. Our service was fantastic, the manager delivered our food to us, and everyone was extremely polite. Will be back"}
{"text":"This is a great place to have good food in a nice atmosphere with excellent service. It is located only about 10 minutes from Toronto  airport, so it is a really convenient place to stop by either on your way to the airport or when you are coming into town.   Even though this is considered a steakhouse, they have a good selection of seafood dishes, and they are all prepared in an exquisite fashion. Today I had the Maple Bourbon Haddock with squash, asparagus and green beans, and it was excellent. The fish is blackened and then seasoned with a light maple sauce, and the result is a wonderful sweet and spicy combination that really works.   The bar area is fairly large, with lots of TVs and high tables for open seating.   This was my second time visiting this place, and I was as impressed as the first time. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying some of their steaks."}
{"text":"Not a steak fan at all, but I was invited to diner - so why not!? The place looked big and charming from the outside, located beside Sheraton hotel. The entrance was nicely decorated with white poinsettia plants and a fake fireplace.   Happy:  The appetizers were pretty good. We ordered: chicken wings which could be hotter, crab cakes which I prefer the sauce to be drizzle on top instead of being at the bottom, and steak bites which to my surprise it was tender and I didn't mind eating it!! So we had a good start to dinner. The waitress was attentive, friendly and asked us many times if we needed anything.   I ordered the lobster fettuccine which I was disappointed that there were many pieces of lobster meat. It was small, scattered and not enough. The asparagus and cherry tomatoes were just on top too. The sauce was good since I like my food a bit spicy. It was definitely not worth the $24 for this dish.   Not happy:  My partner ordered the New York strip loin and he liked the sweet potato fries. He had trouble chewing on one side of the meat, so he decided to try the other side and he said it was a lot better. So indeed, he was disappointed that it wasn't to the steakhouse standard. He commented that even the \"steak bites\" for the appetizer was a lot better!!!   Many of the people at the table didn't finish their steak as something was wrong with it or not to their liking.  (Party of 8 in total.)   Dessert was decent, but I was already too full. I like how it has a mini version of it and a full version so one is not wasting food or not sure how much sweet you can take in after a steak meal.   Verdict:  Go there for appetizers and go somewhere else for the steak, and perhaps other dishes too."}
{"text":"I thought I would try this restaurant with a friend one night, because the reviews were mixed, but there were some really good reviews.   When my friend and I were seated, our server was really friendly and helpful (which was great!). The girls at the front counter however, were snooty (not very friendly).   The service was fast (food came out quickly), however we were both disappointed with the quality of food at this restaurant. The food wasn't really bad, it was just very mediocre, and not worth the price at all. The steak was bland and the veggies were horribly bland. I used to think the Keg steakhouse wasn't the best, but compared to this place, I would have definitely preferred the Keg steakhouse (better quality food).   What can you do... at least we experienced it, but never again."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner!   I reserved online and asked for a cosy romantic table and told them it was his birthday. They gave us exactly what I wanted and more! We had our own private section of the restaurant! The waitress was extremely friendly and kind. They messed my steak and made it rare instead of med rare and the manager brought over a new steak! Everything they do they do well! The staff is extremely friendly and they have an extremely clean restaurant!  What really did it for me was the BIRTHDAY CARD the employees all signed for my boyfriend! I can't get over how the chef even signed! That is AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!   I would definitely come here again and probably bring a big group of people.  If your in the mood for a delicious steak check this place out!"}
{"text":"We went to Chop Steakhouse for a friends birthday. We were served champagne due to a long wait at the door, this was appreciated but just the beginning of a very lengthy dinner service. The food was good but unfortunately 4 hour period we were there took away from it. The reservation was set in advance for 8 but by the time the food came it was after 10 and we were starving. We were told that the table next to us stayed longer than expected so some of our party (one friend being pregnant) had to wait at the door for quite some time and was unable to join us. We were quite disappointed with this experience, as the food was quite delicious. If we are waiting more than 2 hours to eat I would expect more than a dinner roll cut into slices to be served as a courtesy, it was just a tease to a very hungry table."}
{"text":"I had good experience at Chop. The atmosphere was great. We chose to sit in the lounge. It was my birthday and I wanted more of an upbeat vibe. The lounge was great, music was on and the game was up on the screens. Excellent beer on tap. The food was alright. My wings weren't made to my liking but the manager took care of that promptly. Drinks were on point and my dessert was delicious. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  Their steaks! They offer lunch menu too so if you want a smaller meal for lunch, you can still get a smaller steak for lunch!   For appetizers we had garlic shrimp and crab cakes. I thought the garlic shrimp was okay. The menu said chilly garlic shrimp but when it came, it wasn't that chilly hot at all? The crab cakes were good and they used real crab meat instead of the cake crab. The only feedback I have for the crab cake is that it was on the slightly overfried side because it was getting a bit hard side when I was eating the fried batter of the crab cake.   I ordered top sirloin steak with seasonal vegetables. The top sirloin for lunch option is 7 oz. the Steak was alright, done to my request and served with some fried onion rings too. Nothing that I wasn't expecting.   The dessert I ordered the chocolate soufflé. I thought it was made fresh to order but actually it was not. Cut from a bigger soufflé, this soufflé had whip cream in the Center of the soufflé and it was rather hard for the top layer. Soufflé was mediocre at best.   LAST TIP?!  Make reservations if you're coming for lunch, especially on weekdays because this restaurant fills up qguockly with patrons during work hours or holiday time. If you check in on yelp, you unlock the 10% off an entree offer you can take advantage of!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  The coffee crusted steak was tender, delicious and perfectly cooked.  Get the truffle mashed potatoes if they have them available.  They were rich and yummy!  Natalie was an awesome waitress.  I will be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a date night equipped with some coupons. As it turned out, two of our three coupons had already expired. Our waitress asked us to wait a moment while she conversed with her manager, moments later she returned and said that the manager would love to honour our coupons. ($9.00 drink vouchers) The evening was already off to a great start. Our other coupon went towards a free lobster and gorgonzola dip with crostinis which we ordered alongside the Steak Bites. The dip in my opinion, while good, wasn't anything to really write home about. I've had better dip that had the same intentions as this. The gorgonzola wasn't prominent enough in the dip, and the lobster overruled it. The steak bites, however, were out of this world good. They came equipped with a sweet dijon and horseradish garlic dip. They're cooked and quick fried, retaining the juices while giving it an unexpected crunch. For our mains, we ordered off the summer BBQ menu, we both got the blackened New York sirloin, I got the baked potato accompaniment, while my boyfriend ordered the wasabi mashed potatoes (not as scary as it sounds, I promise.) Each of our plates had half of a plum tomato that had a strange pesto, couscous spread on it...we both didn't really understand this outside of aesthetics as it didn't really bring anything to elevate the dish. The steaks were cooked to our desired temperature/texture, and we left very happy. We were so surprised to hear from our waitress that she was still in training, having been on the job for only 3 days for training purposes (apparently the Moxies in London is being turned into a Chop.) We were sad to hear that she wouldn't be at this location for long, but we were so impressed with her commitment to us throughout the evening and her level of attention. To conclude the evening, we got the 9-hour baked cheesecake (as delicious as it sounds) to go! We had such a great time, we're going back next week!"}
{"text":"My husband and I do enjoy this place, though we don't go often as it is a bit on the expensive side. The first time we came, it was just by chance. It was Valentines Day 2016 and the movie we wanted to see was sold out, so while we waited for the next showing we decided to have an appetizer and a few drinks in the upstairs bar. We ordered the steak bites, and I immediately fell in love. I knew that we would definitely be returning.  The second time, we came in the summer of 2016, and ate lunch on the rooftop patio. I enjoyed the sunshine, the fresh air and the lounge music. However, we waited almost half an hour to get drinks, and then another hour before our food showed up. The Waitress seemed flustered and was telling us about wait staff problems that they were having, whatever that means. Though we were hungry, we were not in a huge rush, and still, the food was good (minus the salad I had; the vinaigrette was soooooo sour, like someone lost the cap on the lime juice.)  The third and final time we went, we ate on the main floor and it was perfection. Our server was exceedingly attentive and friendly. The prime rib was absolutely to die for, and my drink came with a scoop of sherbet in it! (The Little things impress me, lol). Also, I appreciate the ambience and differing decor, from the bar, to the main eating area, to the upstairs balcony. Overall, we do enjoy the food and will continue coming here."}
{"text":"Chop is like a sexy girl you meet on Tinder. They look dreamy at first, leaving you fantasizing over them like a piece of meat, but everything changes once you meet face to face. Well, that was my Chop experience... disappointing. The service was meh, the food was eh. Seriously, for a steakhouse, Canyon Creek is probably better than this, and for half the price."}
{"text":"Went to Chop Argentia for the first time tonight. Overall impression was just ok. The atmosphere is great. Good ambiance, good seating and very clean. Great spot for date night, girls/boys night, or birthdays etc. This location is new. It is in the Hilton parking lot. The food was just ok. The appetizer crab cakes were horrible. We ordered them right off the menu without looking at other apps because we have had them many times before from the other location at Dixon but these cakes came deep fried on the outside and mushy on the inside. They were horrible and I sent them back. I had the rib eye steak topped with the lobster and a baked potato. Steak was cooked to my liking (medium) but I did not like the cheese sauce with lobster on top very much. The sever recommended it so I tried it. Not very good. The baked potato was just ok. A bit dry and not enough toppings. My friend had the prime rib with onion rings. He said both were great. We did not have dessert. Overall the food was ok. It is very similar to the Keg but more overpriced. Service was ok too. She was very knowledgeable and friendly although what she recommended wasn't so great. The manager did comp the crab cakes and our drinks since we didn't enjoy our meal as much as we hoped to. I think they are working out the  kinks and over time they should improve. Once they do, I hope to try them again. But I think if I want to go to Chop I will stick to the Dixon location. The food is always cooked very well and the service is great."}
{"text":"I'm giving this many stars mostly because of the outstanding service!! The restaurant is beautiful!! The food was good but  was a bit too salty for our liking. The feature soup was minestrone with Spalumbo sausage and it was excellent- just like home made!!"}
{"text":"Was in town visiting family and wanted to go to a nice dinner that didn't break the bank but also served quality steaks (and other foods).  We headed to Chop and were not disappointed!  Excellent place for a high scale but not expensive dinner.  I had the bone in rib eye and it was cooked perfectly, my brother had the Ny strip, Chicago style and with a brandy peppercorn sauce and my cousin had the smoked rib eye.  I tried a piece of each meal and was thoroughly impressed - as was everyone eating as well.  The service was great, the waitress was very attentive and cordial, the managers were constantly checking in to ensure we were enjoying our meal and having a pleasant experience.  You can tell that customer service is a focus at this restaurant and they nailed it!  Highly recommend this restaurant as I will be coming back the next time I visit."}
{"text":"We have been to Chop twice and so far have not been disappointed! The food is served beautifully and is delicious. The staff are friendly and accommodating, and always pay special attention to our two kids. The overall atmosphere in the restaurant is modern and rustic at the same time, and very pleasant."}
{"text":"Great service and great food!   Went there since I staying at the hotel next door. Decors is great to be there, fa nice and chic environment without being to stuffy.  I enjoyed greatly the chicken taco appetizer and crab cakes while my friend had the burger. Drinks were also grest, you shouldtry the Pink Lemonade Cocktail.  Price was better than hotel restaurant but still on the expensive part.  So want good food but not hotel price? Go to Chop and enjoy a great time!!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving chop steak house 3 stars because the service was amazing the drinks kept coming but the food was alright. I had the mushroom sirloin, hubby had the rib eye because they where out of prime rib maybe the prime rib is awesome, we will never know but his rib eye wasn't anything special and my sirloin was not as tender as they make it out to be didn't taste all that great either. For being a steak house I was expecting way way better. Think we will stick to the keg next time we want a good tasting steak and we know they will have prime rib."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Chop Steakhouse. Our server, Michael, was absolutely fabulous and gave amazing service. He engaged, made great recommendations and was always checking up on us to make sure we're enjoying the meals and our time there. The menu was a great mix for all sorts of people (especially picky eaters like myself) It was a special ocassion and he was able to make it even more special by being so attentive. Thank you Michael, you were awesome! We look forward to going back."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful family night out with our children and their significant others at Chop last night. Our server Sean , was fantastic, funny, friendly and rolled with our family of 6. The French onion soup was one of the best I've ever had, with a brilliant kick of heat to update a classic Favorite. The Yorkie starters with beef and crispy onions could have been my whole meal it was so generous, unfortunately I couldn't finish my steak dinner.....however, it was doggie bagged home and made a delicious addition to Sunday brunch. I wish there was a Chop location closer to our home downtown Toronto, it was a 30 minute drive, but we will go back again when out around the airport."}
{"text":"I decided to try out Chop after noticing that it had finished constructions by my workplace.   This is definitely a high end restaurant which is perfect for date night, birthdays, or any special occasion. The interior decor is modern and contemporary. I decided to treat my boyfriend by taking us here for dinner last Friday. We arrived around 7 pm and were seated quickly.   We both started by sharing a Caesar salad and had a white and red sangria. The drinks and salad came out extremely fast. For our main course we both ordered the prime rib with fries. It took a longer amount of time waiting for the prime rib. This was because the salad was brought out way too quickly. Our server was very friendly and attentive throughout our visit which was great. She came by to let us know about our prime rib orders as she knew we were waiting. The prime rib was very tender and easy to cut through. Mine was cooked to medium rare so I was happy. My boyfriend ordered a medium prime rib but it looked just like mine. I didn't really like the au jus that came with the prime rib. It was thicker than most places I've had it and it tasted different.  Overall, we had a good dining experience for our first visit here. The total for our date night was about $100 including gratuity. Initially I was a bit nervous about the service when I read the previous reviews. However, I'm glad it wasn't the case. I will be back to try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"I attended this restaurant for the first time on May 7th 2016.  We had made a reservation in the bar area and were promptly escorted to a very spacious booth.  The room has great ambiance and the music wasn't too loud.  I started with the Shrimp cocktail.  The sauce is made in house and it is the perfect balance of sweetness and horse radish.  For the main I had the Hunter Chicken which has a rich mushroom sauce and is garnished with tender cherry tomatoes and fresh tarragon.  Chicken was very tender - cooked perfectly. The green beans which accompanied the meat were very fresh and cooked just enough to retain some crispness.   Of particular note was the service. Our server was Gillian.  She was very engaging, witty and very attentive to the needs of the table.  I will be recommending this restaurant to friends and plan to attend again in the near future."}
{"text":"Great service and food. First time here, needed to eat before flying to a business trip and we sat in bar area. Our waitress was excellent and we had the steak salad and mushroom ravioli....great choice for us!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Simply amazing! Great service. Awsome food with beyond expected serving size! Nice and fancy.  Good place for a good time for drinks or a great dinner date.  I love this place and would recommend to all. 5 out of 5"}
{"text":"Chop! Now that's a serious wallet killer for nothing really special...  Food is ridiculously, impossibly overpriced for what it is. There is no excuse that this is a chain, etc - many chains serve more of a better stuff, for less money. In Chop, you'll get something very mediocre which could be tolerated if not for the bill.  Drinks are not too bad, desserts are actually quite delicious.  Service is fine - all young and eager folks, friendly and full of energy, if not quite experienced. I hope they'd find a better job afterwards.  So why two stars? Well, you can definitely eat at Chop - if your company is backing the cost. I'd never go there out of my own pocket, though - and even for the \"expensed\" food there was a lot of non-reimbursable overhead to pay remaining.  Did i forget anything... ah, decor! Decor is ok."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to give this place a try since it was a new-ish place that popped up in our area. The building itself is quite magnificent. It's the type of place you kind of want to take prom pictures at before they yell at you for loitering. The interior is so chic and modern. I almost convinced my mom to let me redesign my room the same way.  We were seated in a booth and gave our drink orders. The drinks did not take long at all. We don't usually get an appetizer but how could we say no to Prime Rib Yorkies? They sounded so cute and delicious. We also both ordered the Prime Rib dinners which came with salads to start. I got mine with the baked potato as the second side. My friend started off with a Caesar salad and I had the wedge salad with a honey lime vinaigrette which came pretty quickly. The honey lime vinaigrette was a bit too tart for my taste and I think I will stick with the blue cheese next time.  The yorkies were delicious as we had hoped as they had great flavour with the shaved prime rib, fried onion crisps, horseradish aioli and au jus working together.  Not too long after we finished the yorkies we received our entrées. The medium rare prime rib I had ordered was tender and so tasty. I couldn't finish it with the baked potato I got so I had it packed up. My friend wasn't too happy with his cut as it had more fat then he would have liked.  The dining experience here was fabulous and I would recommend it for anyone who wants a special dining treat. The only downside I would say about this place is the entire dining experience was a bit too fast for me. I believe from when we sat down to when we got the bill it was about 45 minutes total. I know that this isn't the case but I felt very rushed. Usually for me a good dining experience would take about an hour for me so I could have some time to talk to my friend and catch up."}
{"text":"My wife and I wound up at Chop after having a horrible experience down the road at the Keg.  The menu and prices are similar.  The atmosphere was very pleasant, the service was superb and the food . . . MUCH better than I've ever had at the Keg.  Best of all, we were seated right away (wonderful since we were starving after spending an hour at the Keg with no food).  We both ordered the prime rib as the Chop experience.  I had the wedge salad and though I requested the bleu cheese dressing, I don't think that's what I received but what I did get was amazing.    The prime rib almost melted in your mouth and was a very nice portion and piece of meat for both of us.  I ordered the onion rings but they ran out and I got french fries instead.  I had asked for no vegetables so she offered me another side and originally was going to have a double of onion rings.  Instead I opted for their French onion soup which was delicious.  I'm very particular with french fries and wound up with a double order and their apology for not having onion rings.  The fries were wonderful, I wasn't upset with this substitution at all.  What a happy accident we had in discovering Chop and we can't wait to go back again the next time we're in the GTA!"}
{"text":"LOVE IT! the first time we were there early afternoon, it was quiet which was good. they got the menu outside with the price which you can decide if you want to go in to eat or not. we got a cozy booth. when the food came, it was awesome. both of us had steak good sized portion and the price is reasonable (for alberta at least)...the service was good. we didnt have to wait for a long time for our food. the washroom...kinda dark if you are cluster phobic then....this is not for you. nice tiles though."}
{"text":"Very nice, upscale restaurant that will be perfect for a romantic night out, or a celebration.  Beautiful decor and a very helpful waitstaff makes this as close to a \"can't miss\" that I can think of.    I had the smoked ribeye that was the house recommendation and it was fantastic. A 5th star added to this review would be easy with a little better wine selection.  Not that their selection is bad, but there is a tiny bit of room here to improve in my opinion.  Still a great location, and I'll be back to try it again!"}
