{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurant in toronto !! I absolutely recommend this place for meal!!"}
{"text":"This place is quite nice. My friend and I sat inside one of the booths. I ordered one of the dragon rolls and the mackerel. They have one of the best grilled? mackerels! it was moist and perfectly cooked. The roll was very good as well. I would definitely recommend this place. The service was very friendly and we had a good time."}
{"text":"Got the sushi at Hamaru  Service : 5 / 5 Food : 5/ 5  First time to visit here tho !! I will be back again obviously!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I've been satisfied every time! They have a good value lunch menu starting from $7.95. For sushi and sashimi sets, from $8.95. Their sushi and rolls are above average and quite tasty. The 4 stars is for my favourite dish from this place - the hae dup bap. It's the Korean version of Chirashi Don, for less! Think bibimbap with sashimi on top, with sesame oil and gochujang (red pepper paste) added to your taste. It's available for $10.95 lunch and $12.95 dinner. I was quite stuffed after finishing it.   I don't have too much experience with the rest of the rolls, but I recommend Hamaru for a solid sushi experience, with a Korean twist."}
{"text":"When I saw it had 4 star review on yelp and 5 star review on google, I was expecting somewhat good quality of fish and food. I was disappointed to find out that the fish were not very fresh and the rolls were not that great either. It's safe to say I've had better sushi."}
{"text":"All Sashimi are very fresh. The breaded pork Don is Great with the balance of sweet.    And the price is good."}
{"text":"Great lunch combos for decent price.   Venue is nicely decorated, felt Cosy and is larger than what it appears from the exterior.  Would go back, but they definitely need to crank up the aircon.  So hot inside on a summer day."}
{"text":"As I entered this restaurant the waitress showed me to a corner seat which was ridiculously uncomfortable. On top of that there were a couple of extremely noisy customers about 2 feet from me. I was a couple seconds from just walking out honestly...  I ended up relocating to a booth near the entrance which was much more comfortable. Later on I noticed others who ended up also asking to move due to seating being uncomfortable.  The food itself was good. Definitely above average. I liked the salmon a lot as well as the green tea ice cream at the end.   Torn between 3 and 4 stars. Those seats were just so uncomfortable ! Might have ruined my mood."}
{"text":"We ordered the medium sushi boat. Delicious fresh sushi and very friendly service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Was craving some sushi after some shopping and found this place - I'm glad we did! The appetizers include a miso soup, salad and some noodles. Although it was late, the sashimi was still very fresh! It wasn't very busy - maybe 4-5 other table, but service was good. I would definitely come back if I am in the area"}
{"text":"Ordered the large sushi and sashimi boat with 4 friends. We all agreed that the rice was not well packed together so that nigiri was falling apart when picking up and dipping (splashes on one of my friends dress clothes). Assortment was nothing special, except the cucumber wrapped calamari. It was nice that we got real chopsticks instead of wooden ones and the bell to call for service is smart. Green tea ice cream to finish the meal was nice but I'm pretty sure they \"pre-scooped\" because there was this crunchy frosty layer on top. Found it inconvenient that the policy is \"one table, one bill\". Would likely not come back"}
{"text":"Solid and fresh sushi restaurant. Many are simply whipped together, with giant globs of rice. Here, we had a boat for three and it was well presented and filling enough. Service was on point too. Would go back."}
{"text":"Always a great experience here. Food quality is great and servers are very polite. Fully recommend!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi that's just around the corner from me. This place is fairly authentic. This place is a la carte.  When we got inside they greeted us in Japanese and we were seated right away in one of the private booths with the fabric dividers. There is a door bell ringer to press when you are ready to order.  We ordered a medium size sashmi sushi boat and 2 rolls. It was more than enough for 4 people."}
{"text":"10% off for take-out if you pay by cash!!!   I mean.... I saved $5 by doing that so I would say it's worth it.   There are honestly too many sushi joints to choose from that are all too similar and DELISH - and I would say Hamaru is another one of those. Yay to me for stumbling upon this place!!!   I ordered the small-sized sashimi sushi and maki boat. All the fish included was very fitting to my taste buds and the sashimi was PHRESH. There were of course the typical assortment of fish that you would find when ordering sashimi - which is why I would dedicate this joint as a place where I would go to when I'm craving for sushi that's not too high-end and doesn't have a whole wacky combination of fusion style sushi.   Although I ordered take-out, the server was very generous by handing me a cup of tea to drink while I waited for my order and seated me so I wouldn't have to stand around to wait. It's those little things that really make the Yelp reviews count!!!"}
{"text":"My family came here for Father's Day and we weren't disappointed. The service here was great. We didn't have to ask for anything and they checked on us often.   The food was great as well. We had the dragon roll, seaweed salad, gyoza, shrimp tempura, assorted sashimi/sushi combo, miso soup and mango ice cream. We were also give complimentary noodle soup as well. Everything was fantastic!   I think we have found our new sushi spot...yay!  I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I came here one night with the boyfriend for dinner and it was delicious. Our server was very knowledgeable and made a good recommendation when we couldn't decide what roll to get. We ended up getting the Blue Fin Tuna Belly Sashimi, the Las Vegas roll and the Diablo roll. The Las Vegas was one of the best rolls I have ever tried and is reason enough for us to go back. I also love the booth seating of this place because they have curtains and call buttons for your server when you are ready to order or need anything. It creates a nice setting for a more private dining experience with no time wasted waiting for anything."}
{"text":"The best sushi I have tried . The servers are very professional. An authentic Japanese environment. Very good prices with big servings ."}
{"text":"I know this restaurant usually gets high scores, but I have to give it 2 stars.  The dining environment is pretty comfortable, but the food and service were not that good.  My friends and I ordered a medium Sashimi tray for dinner (about 40 pieces). There were around 6 kinds of different fishes. However, we felt fish bones on 2 kinds of the fishes, and veins on the other 2 kinds of the fishes.   Service was OK. But the server misplaced our order for desserts. When we asked for change, the server said she ordered another dessert for us,  because the one we ordered originally was sold out. And they did not explain it to us in advance.  Overall, it seems to me that this restaurant is not an authentic Japanese restaurant. I do not know whether I will go there again."}
{"text":"The positive reviews for this place is deceiving.  We were looking for a place nearby to eat on Yelp and stumbled across Hamaru. I ordered a Philadelphia roll and my boyfriend ordered an assorted sashimi platter. I ate a piece of the roll and wondered where was the creaminess of the roll and then I looked; My roll had the tiniest piece of cream cheese and salmon I've ever seen in my life.  The assorted sashimi platter was definitely not fresh and tasted frozen. At least the staff was kind and provided complimentary ice cream at the end.  Overall a bad experience due to food at Hamaru. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Toronto. I am a huge fan of sushi (and food on general) and Hamaru is my favourite sushi place in Toronto. I lived downtown for 11 years and had my favorites there but Hamaru is the best I've had. Surrounded by tons of Korean restaurants, Hamaru seems to get overlooked. I never thought I would get excited by a boring California roll but they did it somehow. All the fish is extremely fresh and the rice is fragrant and tasty. I usually get their combos with a mix of nigiri and sushi  rolls. It can be pricey but sushi in Toronto never is cheap and their prices are on part with other restaurants. The real unsung hero of this restaurant though is their soy sauce...what? Yes, soy sauce. Most people don't think twice about soy sauce but they make it in-house and it is that magical touch that most other sushi places are missing. Service is pretty good too and as I said, the place is often overlooked, so it's not usually too busy."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Hamaru Sushi I believe replaced Sapporo sushi recently. I was a frequent goer to the Sapporo Sushi so I didn't understand why the name was changed, perhaps just because. Anyhow, the location is good and it is neat and clean inside. I usually order small sushi and maki combo with udon for myself and wife. This comes out to around 60 dollars after tip and tax. I've tried many sushi restaurants and I'm satisfied for the price I pay at this restaurant, as there aren't that many good places in North York. The fish is well sized so it isn't a place where they give you a lot of rice with no fish. They give you green tea icecream as a desert. I did have one unpleasant experience here back in the day, where I found a hair on my sushi order. I complained and they gave me a new one with complementary hand rolls. I'd say the services have been pretty good."}
{"text":"I would definitely say this place is nice and clean which is always a plus.   This restaurant had a lot of similar items to the Gonoe sushi.   We ordered black dragon roll and snow ball roll, with small sashimi and the Kalbi.   The kalbi by far is the best I've had in awhile, it came out on the big thick bones uncut, as a long strip of meat. It was tender, savoury, with little to no fat ! So very lean compatibly to other places.   The rolls were fresh, I would definitely say this place hits the spot in terms of fresh, and good quality. I just felt that their food could use some more bold flavours in terms of their special rolls, and more unique and original tastes to add.   The service is quite good also, but however I still find their pricing a little bit ridiculous for the taste and portioning. They need the WOW factor to be able to charge those type of prices and it just isn't there yet.   Still I will say A+ for quality, fresh, and service."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, great service. Used to go here alot when it was sapporo sushi. Still the same great food no complaints"}
{"text":"I came here twice on a recommendation from my close friend in the area and both occasions were foodgasmic.  The star of the show here is the sashimi. I have tried the all sashimi party platters and sashimi sushi combination sets. The price has increased by a few dollars in the last two years, but it is still at a normative market cost. Plus, you get the freshest sashimi of diverse varieties here and the sashimi is on point! The presentation is aesthetically pleasing, particularly when you get the party platters in house. They have Korean dishes as well with flavourful kalbi to boot, so if you have friends who get tired of Japanese fare they have no reason not to go.   Pro tip: If you want to try natto, give it a whirl here because they serve it in a salad style that balances the pungent flavour of the fermented beans with a surprisingly pleasant mixture of soy sauce, pickled radish, salmon, egg, and sesame seeds!"}
{"text":"Visited Tues Nov 11 party of 2 for dinner. Arrived at the restaurant and it was about half-full. Promptly seated in a nice quiet booth. Ordered rainbow and dragon rolls, udon noodles, fried dumplings and avocado salad. The items came really fast, i think within 5 minutes! The food was excellent, no complaints. This is one of the few restaurants that has brown rice available for rolls, forgot to tell the server when we ordered.   I love how they have the call buttons to get a hold of staff, makes things so much easier. We were personally served by the owner Eddy who we had a nice conversation with. He even let us charge our phone behind the counter. Complimentary green tea ice cream, they ran out of other flavours that night. Total about $50 including tip. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"First time coming here because of a recommendation. I gotta say.. I was pretty disappointed. The menu lacked non-sushi items and everything was pretty expensive.   After we ordered our meal sets (combos), the miso soups and garden salads came out quick. But then the rest took 30-40 min after that. Then when the food finally came, they forgot one person's entire order. But they didn't admit it, we saw them pointing at our table to the chefs from a distance. So another 15 min. Over an hour since we sat down.  No apologies given. Then a friend joined later and got some sake. Their bill came up to $7 but wouldn't let him pay by credit card because the minimum is $10. I'm pretty sure this breaks credit card merchant contract. Also it's bad for return customers imo."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot within walking distance from Yonge and Finch! This location has changed many times, it used to be Sapporo from what I remember and something else but I think this time the owners has finally done something right. They completely renovated the inside making it look more modern and inviting. The booths still remain inside so you still have the option of sitting in a more private area. It was interesting as they had music playing in the background (kinda like Sushi Moto vibe) so it definitely was nice and casual.  I must say that the service was above average. Although it wasn't very busy on a Tuesday night, but I normally don't expect great service at most asian restaurants. Our waiter was friendly, enthusiastic, and attentive. He even gave us a complimentary salad and ice cream.   We ordered the small sushi and sashimi combo as well as a tempura appetizer. It came with miso soup and salad. The sashimi was fresh just the pieces were cut a little bigger than I'd like. We also ordered the unagi maki which tasted delicious! Presentation for everything was decent. Tempura tasted good with not too much batter and not oily. You definitely get great value here as the price per sushi if you order a set is less than $1. For two people, this was very filling!  I will definitely come back here to try their speciality rolls."}
{"text":"For only $10.95 I had a very satisfying California and dynamite lunch combo. It comes with salad, soup, 14 pieces and ends with a nice small bowl of fruit. The attention to detail for such an affordable lunch is impressive. You can see in the photo there is a lot of nice garnish and sauces that come with it. It's a very nice touch.   Considering how much Longos around the corner charges for grocery store sushi this is an excellent deal.   Service was good.   I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I am a regular here. The food is alright. Nothing special but I always come back here."}
{"text":"I travel around he got a lot and thought I'd try Hamaru Sushi which I drove by. It is delightful. Music is good, it's very clean, a TV with CP24 so I could watch the news, the shrimp tempura bento box I had was DELICIOUS. Miso soup was great and green tea was refilled.withhout asking.  The service was quick, the wait person was very nice and it's busy in here. It was a lovely touch that an unexpected tiny fruit bowl came at the end with chilled grapes, melon and watermelon. Price point very reasonable. A real long stemmed red rose at every table. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The sushi was only borderline satisfactory.  It was definitely nothing to write home about and the service made this place worse.  The lady that served us had a lot of attitude and just made the entire experience unpleasant.  Sushi was not that cheap either.    It's just not really worth it to come to a sushi restaurant with very basic types of sushi rolls that don't taste that good (consist of too much rice), isn't that cheap and has poor customer service.   I wouldn't recommend coming here, there are plenty of fish in the sea.  Get it."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi is back in their new place. The best best freshest ever.  Service is great and best ever Uni"}
{"text":"Good lunch time service but food was average out slightly above average. Good miso soup though!"}
{"text":"Wow. There were a lot of families with small children here.   I considered giving Hamaru Sushi a 4, but I think I'll stick with a 3.5 rounded down. The restaurant had two servers. The lady was knowledgeable and capable, but the man seemed a tad lost all night. His English didn't seem up to snuff, and he neglected to get us tea or bring the plate that my father requested. He also deferred to the lady a number of times throughout the night.  I live in the area, so I've known Hamaru was opening for a while now. I read Max's review and knew about the salmon cheek/head. It wasn't on the menu, so I inquired after it. I was told that it was $4.95 ish for two pieces. We were going to order it, but the lady came back and told us that she'd give it to us on the house. Score!  We ended ordering their tuna tataki roll ($11.95), their yellow tail yaki ($11.95), their pork ramen ($9.95), and their sashimi set/DS5 ($19.95). With the free somen (noodles in broth) for each person, the free salmon heads and the free green tea ice creams at the end of the meal, we were quite satisfied.  The somen was a nice way to start the meal off, but the noodles were clumped together and had to be separated. They were not overcooked. They were just stuck together. The broth was tasty though. The tuna tataki was tasty, but not as unique as I had hoped it would be. Their yellow tail yaki, while being quite generous in portion, was quite dry. Their pork ramen was tasty, especially the roast pork, which actually had a smokey flavor to it, but the broth was fairly strong on the soy sauce, and was a tad too salty. The egg in the ramen had a runny yolk, but looked like it was done in some sort of a mold, as it looks like the eggs found in McMuffins. The bamboo shoot slices in the ramen also gave the dish a strange flavor that I did not appreciate, but I understand due to the odd flavor of bamboo shoots. Their sashimi is not bad, but it wasn't particularly impressive either. The set we got had 18 pieces of sashimi, and none of them were particularly noteworthy either. Nothing fancier than red tuna. The best part of the meal were the salmon heads. Those were cooked well and generous in portion. I'd go back again just for those and a bowl of rice.  Total for four before tips was about $60 and change. Fairly good price for Japanese food (even run by Korean people).  It's nice to have another Japanese option in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Our 1st visit ,loved the freshly prepared sushi. Enjoyed the atmosphere.  Service could be a bit better."}
{"text":"This place has great salmon, I ordered an assortment of sashimi and the salmon had the best quality. I agree price is a bit higher than other places, but if I was only going to eat salmon sashimi, I think the price is OK."}
{"text":"Hamaru is a small, unassuming restaurant that left my friends and I so impressed.  We recently moved into the area, and were looking for a sushi place that was affordable but didn't compromise on quality.  We ordered a boat, and tempura, and could barely finish it all between the four of us.  We started with an order of pork belly with kimchi, and later discovered that the chef makes his own kimchi in house.  THE BEST kimchi I've ever had.  We were also told that the chef hand selects his fish.  The sushi was beautifully made, and the fish was very fresh.  They had uni, toro, and delicious salmon.  We're so happy we found our new staple sushi place!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends on a Sat at 1pm.  Was about 30% full.  Decor was modern with some cool private booths.  Service was friendly but had to waive them down a few times to get their attention.  I got the sashimi, sushi and Maki lunch combo $12.95.  It also came with miso soup, mini spring roll, korean rice roll, ginger and salad.  Portion size was good.   Salmon had some a good amount of fat on it.  Tuna tasted good too.  Would be interested in going back."}
{"text":"4-stars overall with consideration to the price versus the quality of food. This place is good value. I dropped in for take-out and was pleasantly surprised with the generous servings of fish and other fillings in the maki rolls. The salmon looked to be fresh, great quality too. All of the staff are quite friendly and even the chefs do the whole \"irashaimase\" thing when you enter (even though they are actually Korean haha). I also like the compact layout with all the rooms/booths that they have for additional privacy. Wouldn't mind coming by again for a dine-in experience. The only downside is that the parking lot is a bit small and space is somewhat limited, but it looks like it has enough spots to handle the traffic most of the time."}
{"text":"We used to go to this restaurant back when it was Sam Jung Sushi. It is right in our neighbourhood, the food was pretty good and the staff was always so friendly. They always knew who we were when we came in and treated us very well. When they changed names to Momo Sushi a year or two ago, we were disappointed but the menu was virtually the same and the quality was still very good.   Fast forward to Hamaru Sushi, which just opened this year. Our first experience was right after they opened. The staff was friendly but green - all new servers working under one experienced server. Sushi was ok, everything else was so-so. Very nicely presented on the plate. The 3rd time we went in, the waitress recognized us and had one of the new servers come over to take our order. He was brand new, didn't know what he was doing, but everyone has to start somewhere and she was watching him closely.   First, he was slow. And we were the only people in the entire restaurant at 7:00 on a weeknight. Then there was no shoyu (soy sauce) on the table and we couldn't find anyone to ask them to bring us some so we took a bottle off one of the other (empty) tables. They brought us our food but partway through the meal I thought my shrimp tempura tasted \"off\". It should be noted that the shrimp was breaded (previously frozen) and the rest of it was real tempura batter. DING DING DING first warning bell goes off in my head. Why are the batters different? I pointed it out to the waitress to tell her that one shrimp was bad and the other one was fine. I asked her to tell the chef and was fully expecting her to give me 2 fresh ones, or at least offer me a comp'ed dish. Nope. She came back and told me the chef said it came from the same batch and the rest of it is fine, and that was it. No apology, no offer to replace it, nothing.  We haven't been back since. Tempura isn't that difficult. If they take shortcuts on that, what else do they do?"}
{"text":"A true Japanese experience! Park in the back of the building. Very good service and beautiful interior! A tip for the owners: please select music that matches the ambient instead of Western pop"}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  First time was amazing, and if it wasn't for my second visit I would easily have given it 5 stars.  My boyfriend and I went and it was quite busy so wasn't too bothered by the slow service. We ordered the salmon appetizer and we each had our own bento box. The sashimi had a white layering coat of...something on it. Anyways, my boyfriend was eating it without a problem and so I decided to try it only to almost choke on a bone. Yup, there was a bone in my salmon sashimi. The waitress was super apologetic about it, took it off the bill and gave us free ice cream. My boyfriend still loves the place and much to his disappointment I won't be back."}
{"text":"Another Japanese restaurant... this one's about average. Nothing to write home about. I've ordered some rolls  here including the spicy salmon and the yam rolls,  both of which were okay. The rolls had little rice, lots of seaweed, good amount of filling, and average price. The restraint itself is not very busy and for whatever reason, the door area kind of smells. I hope they get that cleared up or put in some breeze. I guess for convenience I would come back when I crave Japanese because it's right at yonge and finch so the location is a plus. The bento boxes also look very well presented and beautiful. But very unimpressed with their rolls. Service was friendly though so I may go back for another visit."}
{"text":"When I went to Angus Pho a couple of months back, I noticed this place that seemed quite modern and busy of a sushi restaurant. I frequent the Yonge/Finch area, so I knew I was going to try here eventually, and today I did.  At 11:40am this restaurant was empty. However by the time I left at 12:30pm there was a small lineup with the restaurant being completely full; pretty good considering the competitive food environment in this area.  I ordered the Sushi A lunch set, which came with a soup and salad. The salad was okay, but the soup tasted quite good! There were also a lot of green onions in the soup, which I really liked (the greener the better!). The sushi set came way before I was finishing the soup and salad, which I sorta didn't like as it took about 3-4 minutes for me to finish the starters before I managed to delve into the sushi.  The sushi tasted very good! There was a large variety of fish, which for $11 after tax I was very surprised. The rice was a little undercooked, but not that severely.  Service was great when the restaurant wasn't that full, however once it was full it was extremely difficult to ask for the bill. I guess a problem though was I never noticed there was a button to press for assistance until after I asked for the bill...but it wasn't exactly placed at a noticeable spot.  I think Hamaru is probably the best sushi restaurant in the Yonge/Finch vicinity; I definitely prefer this place over Ume at least."}
{"text":"Great experience, service was frequent and really friendly. Food was fresh and delicious and came with complimentary mini starters and ice cream. Prices are reasonable and environment was clean. Would definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"Good sushi and solid value. It is understaffed though. The service consistently sucks. Worth putting up with."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, sashimi, chirachi, and Korean bolgogi bento box. Great service as well. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about the place. Sushis were average. Service could have been more attentive with tea top ups.  Tried the sushi maki combo price is reasonable, and food came in a timely fashion. Had the tuna collar it was smaller than the usual collar ive ordered before, taste why quiet oily seems deep fried."}
{"text":"A late review after almost 2 months.  Want Japanese food but not AYCE, so after searching Yelp, we found this restaurant in my neighbourhood.  Restaurant located in a strip mall at Leslie/York Mills.  We went there on weekday around 8pm and there were only 2 tables.  Servers are very friendly.  Hubby and I shared a small sashimi & sushi boat that comes with miso soups, noodles and salads.  Sashimi very fresh.  Also we got a salmon head on the house.  I think the small sashimi & sushi boat is around $50.  Reasonable price and good place to have Japanese food.  **********************************************************************************************************************  2nd review Been here again last Wednesday and this time I ordered an eel with rice bento box and hubby had sashimi & sushi dinner.  Like last time both meals taste yummy and the batter for the tempura is quite good.  Love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"A great experience!  Food: Excellent value, fresh and high quality; the rice was cooked perfectly  I love the bowl of rice included!   Staff: polite and fast service.  Decor: beautiful and comfortable, a nice place to chat with friends"}
{"text":"This location used to be Sapporo Sushi. I didn't even know Sapporo had closed, they kept the same number. The decor is essentially the same though little touches like wall hangings are different. Their menu is a bit different than Sapporo's as well. Some of the standards you would find in a Japanese restaurant aren't there, like Shitake Mushroom Roll (which I love). I picked up a lunch from here recently & the food was decent. I'm still trying to decide how much I like them. Won't know for sure until I try the other food on their menu. They do not deliver btw. So if you get take out you'll have to pick it up."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many years prior before the name change and renovations. Glad to see that the quality has stayed consistent. We came here on a rainy day and it wasn't too busy. Ordered a large boat (90pcs) for 5 people, but it did take a while to come. However, when it did, it was quite impressive - it came in two boats! For the price and size, I was a bit disappointed there were only 2 pieces of BBQ eel and no sea urchin. There were adequate amounts of salmon and tuna."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for dinner tonight. This place didn't disappoint again.  Came in and ordered 2 Spicy Salmon Hand Roll and Small Sashimi and Sushi Boat (like last time).   They brought us free soup to start. This time they've improved. Last time was a bit cold, but today was warm and tastes so good!  It is seasoned very well.   Then they brought out Grilled Salmon Cheek for us. Super nice of them. The Salmon Cheek cooked perfectly, it is fresh and tastes delicious!  My wife loved it!  Spicy Salmon Hand Roll came. We find there's more portion in the hand roll than Gonoe Sushi.  We loved it!!!  The star of the show is the boat. Very beautiful! The sushi chef decorated very nice and tastes wonderful!  Fresh, fresh, fresh. The sashimi melts in your mouth and the sushi rice in my opinion is the best I ever had in my area. Way better than Sushi Kiku. This place is not stingy they don't slice the fish thinly.   We also enjoyed their green tea ice cream. Yum!  My wife and I had a great experience here again. So glad this is close by to my place.   Food:  5/5 Ambience:  5/5 Service:  5/5 Cleanliness:  5/5"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have ever had of this price range! It's run by a family and the father has been making sushi for more than 30 years.  The son is the owner and he was a very nice person. We really had a good time there. Have to drop by next time."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch for the first time in May 2014 and I've been back 2 other times since then. It's hard to find a sushi restaurant in the North York area that gives you best bang for your buck.  For less than $10, I ordered the Sashimi bento box and for someone that eats a lot, this comes in a huge portion. It includes 12 pieces of sashimi, miso soup, salad, tempura (tofu was today's surprise), 3 pieces of a California roll, and a cup of rice. The great addition to this meal is the fruit cup they serve you at the end- a great way to top it off!  Also, the wasabi squid (cant remember the actual name of it) is very tasty. It had the perfect amount of wasabi.  In terms of the service, I have no complaints. The server is always happy to serve the customers with a smile. The servers seem to be the same couple of men during the lunch rush - polite and shy. The chefs are very skillful and very good at what they do.  I've been to all of the Sushi places around the Yonge and Finch to Yonge and Sheppard and this place is cute with its decor of the traditional wooden paneling detailed with beer and sake bottles. For the value of the meal, I can't be any happier."}
{"text":"Hamaru Sushi replaces another sushi place which I never been to. So I can only based my review based on my visit of this new place during lunch.  Interior deco and set up is quite good with mostly booth seating so this place probably won't be good if you are in a big group.  Lunch menu starting from $8 has a good selection including mostly Japanese and some Korean food.   Lunch Sushi A ($12) has good fish selection  and the fish was fresh. The only complaint maybe the rice was a little undercooked so a little hard and chewy.  I do love the fresh fruit cup dessert complimentary at the end of the meal.  Service is ok.  Tea was refilled without being requested.   Not a bad choice to have lunch if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I have been to Hamaru Sushi's original location at Yonge and Finch https://www.yelp.ca/biz/hamaru-sushi-toronto and glad that they reopened again.  Lunch Special till 3 pm but sadly I just missed that by 5 minute or so. (They should have put that in their menu as of when it is offered)  I ended up ordering a dinner combo of Sushi and Tempura ($19).  The sushi was well made and shari rice was balanced. Sadly the shrimp tempura has this really thick and soggy batter that would have made this a 4 star experience. It is though a good value for the price.  I will probably be back and have some of their sushi and just skip the tempura.  Lunch does sound good for the perfect portion."}
{"text":"Food was good, got seafood soup and chirashi. One note to take out staff - when asked for extra packs of soy sauce, don't say \"there are plenty\" in the take out bag, if there is just one packet. It's not liquid gold, just add one more maybe? Lol."}
{"text":"It used to run by the Korean owner. So always with Korean and Japanese foods here. But, didn't impressed me by any foods. And expensive then other places. Rather go to the Japanese buffet.."}
{"text":"Hamaru is my favourite Japanese restaurant and I have visited many excellent Japanese resturants around World, etc. The selection of sashimi and sushi is always fresh and delicious. This resturant is an authentic Japanese resturant. Very deserving of 5 stars in terms of their food and environment. Highly recommended!"}
