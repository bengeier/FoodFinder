{"text":"My family loves this place! They make ready great pizzas !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! We just tried this pizza for the first time and I can honestly say I'm amazed!!! It is so flavorful and packed with toppings and super cheap!!! We just found our new pizza go to for sure!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place and i was not disappointed in anyway.  The prices are the best every for the quality and quantity of the food.  I order a small super deluxe (which had a abundance of diffrent toppings) and a 12\" #15 which is the spicy italian, there was so much meat no it. All the meats and veggies were very fresh and the bob sauce is on point. My only issue is the bread is a little to crusty on the outside and tore up the roof of my mouth, which is my only complaint if the bread were slightly softer and my mouth did not need a recovery day i would probably eat here every day.  Overall an amazing value for the quantity and quality of ingredients. The service was very friendly and exceptionally fast. The crust bread is my only issue oh and i could have ordered one or the other and been stuffed for $7 (my total was $14 for the specialty pizza and 12\" sub)   Fyi some other places near by you will be luck to get out with a 12\" chips and a drink for $14"}
{"text":"OMG! The pizza is so good that I ate three pieces of pizza before I remembered that I was on a diet - that's how good it is. The crust is thick and tasty - words I've never said before about pizza crust. The sauce is really the star. It should be award winning.   Also, they have wraps and subs from What About Bobs. Amazing subs!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place.  They have the original what about bobs subs + pizza booyah pizza!?"}
{"text":"I'll never return here. I ordered large pizzas, cooked well done. They were doughy and soggy. A wet pizza is not appetizing to me. Greasy is one thing, wet and soggy is different.  Ordered spicy Italian subs and don't receive all of the meats that come on the sandwich. When I called to discuss the food, they didn't answer professional. They said \"hello\". I had to confirm I was calling Pizza Booyah.  I couldn't receive and answer as to what to do about my sandwiches, because they said they had to call me back in a few minutes.  Which meant I didn't get a chance to discuss the pizza until I received a return call. In the meantime, I packed up my order so I could drive 15 minutes to return it.  When returning the food for a refund, I had to check my bank card email for using my card. Because they gave me less for the refund than what was paid.  Since I didn't get an original receipt, I'm thankful I can see my card transactions. Disorganized, unprofessional with no interest in customer service skills or did quality."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of the subs! Love the crunchy bread, and loaded with meat and cheese. I haven't had the pizza yet. I'll be sure to try it soon"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, I'm friends with the owners just from coming in and going to school with their kids. The owner truly understands how much food people want and he definitely delivers it. His sub sandwiches are absolutely stuffed with flavor and meat I mean it's overflowing with the cold cuts, in the pepper mix they buy and put on top is phenomenal. The prices are extremely reasonable with how much food you get it, don't bother going to Subway or Jimmy John's is a waste of time and money when you can come here. There's nothing better like a local ownerWho helps our local economy strive to keep your cash flowing throughout the city and county.  The pizza is very good as well, it may not be like Petti's pizza, but that is a different flavor of sauce and cheeses etc. THEY HAVE GREAT PRICES!    Just be prepared if you eat a spicy italian- bring a gallon of water for the day after for the thirst from the salt/sodium...totally worth it.   I just wish they weren't closed Monday's :( I'm literally DYING for a sub!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! We played the food critic last night and pretty much ordered one of everything. We got a BYOP, pep, mild pepper rings and sausage, as well as the marg pizza. A sub (because I was told we HAD to try by a friend of mine,) so we ordered the turkey club, and a garden salad.   Let me start off by saying, when I called the woman that answered the phone was SO sweet! We're new to the neighborhood and this was our first time ordering from here. She informed me on EVERYTHING and was so kind about it. Not like I bothered her at all! (Which I feel like is hard to find at pizza places anymore.) So we started off on a great foot.   Pizza - was BOMB. PERFECT amount of the most delicious sauce, toppings were awesome. They season it too, which is different but awesome touch!   The sub - I have to be honest, I'm partial to daves cosmic subs in our area but this might have been better. (Don't hate me) Overflowing with fresh meats, and that sauce, we ordered a SMALL AND IT WAS HUGE. So so good!   The salad- Okay, I know most people don't order salads with pizza, but it tricks me into thinking we're keeping it a little healthy. :) Normally at a pizza place, salad isn't their show piece, but this one could have been! Their dressing is the same as that delicious sauce they put on their subs. Not even kidding when I said every veggie on there was SO fresh, no wilted or side veggies that looked forgotten. It was awesome.  I honestly can't wait to come back! Thanks so much for the awesome first experience!"}
{"text":"I Ordered one large pizza . Pepperoni, sausage and   Vegetables.  What are received was a sopping wet nasty pizza .  The pizza obviously wasn't baked nearly enough .  Soaked right through the cardboard. The cardboard box was soaking wet.  Wasn't fit for human consumption.     I've been eating  pepperoni and sausage pizza w/ vegetables  All my life and I know pepperoni and sausage are greasy .  Anybody with common sense never would've sold  something this gross .  The pizza was like a sponge soaked to the max  YUK  worst pizza I've ever had.  Once upon a time they were good."}
{"text":"I heard that the old What About Bob's menu was here at Pizza! Booya! so I had to check it out. It's been a long time since I had one of their subs. They used to be located in Downtown Willoughby years ago and were known for their legendary over stuffed subs for a good price. Now they have changed name, location and make pizzas too. They are primarily take out but they do have a small table inside and a couple tables outside.  The pizza is solid. Their traditional is a thicker crust. The pizza sauce is delicious with lots of cheese and toppings. I had the sausage and pepperoni and it was excellent. They put half dollar sized blobs of sausage on their pies. A little greasy so have napkins ready. By the way, it's all the toppings you want for the same price. Get a second pizza for a little bit more.  The subs are just like what they used to be when they were at their old location. The bread is crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. The Spicy Italian I had was fantastic. Nice amount of heat from the hot peppers and stuffed with cold cuts. The ultimate sauce they put on is marvelous. I don't know anywhere else where you can get a sub like theirs.  So worth checking out this place. The owners are super friendly and their prices are unbelievably reasonable."}
{"text":"My mom and grandma raved about this place so I figured I would try it when I came to visit. I assumed that if they were raving about it, it was pretty good. I was wrong. It was awesome!  I called to place my order as their online ordering system is not up and running so if you want to be the modern anti-social, you may be frustrated that you actually have to demonstrate the long lost art of dialing and talking to a live person. They offer 2 pizzas for $10/15/20 depending on size (S/M/L respectively) so I went with two of the 8-slice, medium pizzas with different toppings to share. The crust was crispy, the toppings were generous, and was ready when promised. The sausage was not crumbled but in actual chunks like you get with most Chicago style which made the slices heavy but still able to pick up. The sauce you can tell is not straight from a can and actually complimented the crust/toppings well. I recommend using a knife and fork to spare your favorite shirt from the ever dreaded cheese/sauce stain.  If you are expecting thin, NY style pizza then you will be underwhelmed but if you like something not quite deep dish, this is definitely the pie for you."}
{"text":"Pizza pretty good.... Sauce had a nice sweet taste to it, but the pizza was a little doughy for our taste.  Good option for the price, as you can get 2 Large Pizzas for $15 w/ unlimited toppings"}
