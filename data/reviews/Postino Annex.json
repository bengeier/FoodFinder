{"text":"I go out of my way to request off Monday nights from work just so I can spend my Mondays at Postinos for their famous board and bottle night. Just last night, I got to Postinos at 8:30pm and put my name on the list for a party of three, and my other two girlfriends met me about 5-10 minutes after I got sat at the table. My server, Chad, asked me what I wanted to drink and I ordered the Stagedive Pinot Noir, which is what I get almost every time. When he returned, he sat down a single glass of the wine versus the bottle, which is what I had expected to receive, especially since it was  BOARD AND BOTTLE NIGHT. I have been coming to this location for quite awhile and have NEVER had a problem like this before. Coming from a bartender myself, I did not make a big deal of this because I know mistakes and miscommunications happen more than often. I realized I guess I should have clarified what exactly I had wanted, even though it is HIS job to ask if I would like to purchase just a glass or a whole bottle, since after all, they were running a very well known special that night. He poured me a little sample and left the rest of the wine on the side. At that point, I was very confused and maybe thought that they weren't running the board and bottle special that night for whatever reason, and when I asked him, he answered, \"It is board and bottle, but I just rang in a glass since you were by yourself, and thats all I assumed you wanted\" And then he walked away, not  caring that I was clearly unsatisfied. So from my understanding, just because I am by myself I should be treated differently?? I did not drink the wine, and I asked for a whole bottle because that was what I had wanted from the beginning. When a different server brought over all of our bottles, he poured the wine that was on the side (which I was not going to drink because I clearly made it a point that was not what I ordered) into my wine glass. At the end of the night when I got my bill, I was charged the 12$ for the glass of wine on top of the rest of my bill. I do realize that I drank the wine, but I was never intending to since I spoke up right away about the miscommunication. At that point, it could have been corrected and would not have been a problem at all. However, Chad did not do anything but throw it in my face that since I was by myself, I do not get to be apart of the board and bottle special. Like I said before, since I work in the restaurant industry, I still paid and tipped since I know the employees tip share, and I did not find it fair to take money away from the other servers that contributed to my time there, but Chad especially, did not do anything to fix what could have been a simple problem. All in all, I know it is only 12$ at the end of the day, and I know mistakes happen all the time, but it is the way that Chad handled the situation that ruined my experience here."}
{"text":"Great place, this was my first time at this location but seemed similar to the other two. Great place for good beer and food."}
{"text":"I have been here thrice. May i compliment the excellent excellent service ? The staff is incredibly nice and on their feet. The food is really good. I cant wait to go back and try more stuff off their menu."}
{"text":"Food and service are good. One of the few places that's really on top of the water refills!  There's a problem though: they don't have nearly enough indoor seating. We were given the option of choosing between sitting outside in 40-degree windy weather (yes, the desert gets cold!) or waiting 30 min. for an indoor seat. We waited and sat inside, but about five minutes after we were seated, they opened the door to the outside (because they were serving people out there) and LEFT it open the whole time. After all of that waiting for an indoor seat, we still spent the lunch huddled in buttoned-up coats shivering.  This place is only nice when the weather is nice. If it's one of our cooler winter days and you're not dressed like an eskimo, or if heat exhaustion in the summer makes you lose your appetite, then you should probably eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best brunch in town! Ask for Christian- he is the best and will take great care of you. He'll even make you the best almond joy coffee!!"}
{"text":"Another great Postino right beside ASU. Their bruschettas do not betray you, ever. Great outdoor seating, industrial + rustic decor inside."}
{"text":"This location is awful. The people they have working here are beyond rude and management is beyond poor. How can it be parents weekend at ASU and they have empty tables but cannot seat because they don't have enough people working? Are you kidding me??? Apparently they don't want my money and I surely will not return to this location. Ever."}
{"text":"Had 90 min to spend in Tempe before leaving for the airport. Walked the strip past the generic chains and found Postino. Food was very good and fresh, the cucumber lemonade was outstanding. Servers were the best. Call outs to Dirk & Kiera - they really made us feel welcome and want to come back the next time we are in town. Kudos to management for encouraging servers to talk to customers - seems simple, but often overlooked. We will come back for the people and good food & drink."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  Best bruschetta ever and best waitress ever - Cat!  She was so helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Woohoo! As good as it gets! YUM!!!!!! My BF and I had mini vaca in AZ and we randomly ended up here on NYE night...we could not have been happier with everything from the food to the staff and the overall atmosphere of Postino! We literally went back the next night it was that good. Love the sandwiches and the bruschetta to die for. Go you will not be disappointed. We are back in Cali and miss it already."}
{"text":"Nice patio, great bruschetta and chicken salad, and a wide selection of beers and wine. The creme brulee is a favorite of my wife's. One complaint from my most recent visit- they have some nice soft seating but I couldn't use it because it's the apparent staff lounge. The Friday afternoon that I visited there were staff in the space for the whole two hours I was there. Not the end of the world, but not super professional either."}
{"text":"Postinos is such a great place to go to on a chill afternoon or if you and your girlfriends want to get dressed up and go out to eat! The atmosphere is amazing and the food is even better! I've had almost everything on the menu and I can't decide which is my favorite because they're all so good! Very friendly service and they have a great taste in music! 10/10 would recommend. Also ask for Sarah and talisa, best servers their by far!"}
{"text":"Sitting and enjoying the relaxing vibes here at postino. This is my second time and am visiting a different location than the first time. But regardless of where i am, i seem to always receive AMAZING service! I love that the servers , no matter what questions i ask, are knowledgeable about everything that they serve and are able to give great insight for recommendations. Ours recommended what they've nicknamed \"cougar juice\" and it was  divine. Regardless of whether they're packed, you're going to get on point service. This is the place to be if you want a place with a relaxing ambiance, good food, and great service"}
{"text":"My first time here was a bad experience in service, but since I'd been to the one in Gilbert, it was a game day, and Annex had only been open for a few weeks at the time, I knew I would give them another shot. I am glad I did because I have had great service ever since! This place has been an amazing respite from the rigors of law school for my classmates and I. I love the ambiance and the Monday/Tuesday $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine deal cannot be beat."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday last night and this place was great! I have to say it started with the host, her name was Megan, she was awesome! She not only has my name but she was so sweet about making sure my friends and I got a table even though it was very busy- she made me feel special. Then we ordered the bruschetta- can't complain! So yummy! All of it! We got a bottle of wine- the server had me taste it before he poured it and that was nice. We ordered the chocolate dessert- yum!!! Okay so I did order the soup, I think it was Italian sausage ? This was not so good. Idk but it wasn't bad but it wasn't at a level to be on the menu, it tasted like I could go get a can on chef boyardee from a gas station and pour it in a fancy bowl. Anyway overall I will be back and we are all very impressed with the service and the food!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at this location and it's past time for a review.   The vibe is a younger crowd, the location is next to Asu campus so I see a lot of students here.   Menu options are limited, but the restaurant does what it has on the lunch/dinner menu well. Actually the menu is really a lunch menu and this review is not about breakfast (I haven't tried it yet).   Service is usually good and the servers are friendly.   On Monday nights, the special is a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine for $20. That's tough to beat. Thank you, Postino, for coming to Tempe."}
{"text":"We come here almost weekly, the food and service are consistently great, Makelle and Sara are excellent!!"}
{"text":"I love going to Postino Annex on Monday nights with my girlfriends when they have the bruschetta boards and bottle of wine for $20.  I've never been disappointed with any of my bruschetta selections.  One of my favorite wines they serve is the Stagedive Pinot Noir.  I was also excited to see that they were selling a Greek white wine. Such a great selection.    I've also been here for brunch. Their brunch food was also really great, not a huge selection, but I got sort of egg white omelet with asparagus and loved it."}
{"text":"We came here for a friend's birthday. They told us the wait would be an hour and a half so we hung out at the bar. There were 9 of us so we understood the wait time. When we finally got seated, the server took forever to take our orders and never came back to check on us until we were almost done with our food. When he came back at the end of the meal and asked if we wanted dessert, nobody said yes so he left again and never got our checks. After waiting another 20 minutes, a different server brought our checks with half of them being wrong. Him and the original server took turns bringing the checks and cards back for us to sign. All in all, it was a 4 hour meal on a Tuesday night. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar with Mark and he was amazing, he went above and beyond to make sure we had a good time. It's always busy on Monday and Tuesday nights for the bruschetta and wine special but that never stops the staff from being on top of everything! Great food and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Just tried Postinos Annex and it did not disappoint. Good beer, fun, classy atmosphere and seriously great food. It's the perfect place to pregame before ASU football and is our new go-to place. The Pub Board and Bruschetta were really really good. The staff is very good, friendly and on top of things.  Plus, small pitchers of beer for $5-$6 bucks for happy hour. Which is (smartly for them) before 5 on game days. 6p every other day. Postinos is spectacular. ASU football, not so much(right now). LETS GO DEVILS!!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious! The happy hour had $5 drinks which even though I missed by 10 minutes, the waiter accommodated me and gave the happy hour price! :) The ambience is really nice and the servers are very friendly and aware of your needs. Perfect for an evening drink/snack or brunch!"}
{"text":"First, let me say that I love Postino's! Their service is consistently great and the food prompt and delicious. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed today. I went in for an early lunch, so there were only a handful of customers. After I was promptly led to a table, I was told the server would be right with me to take my order. Although the place was fully-staffed, they appeared to ignore the customers. I noticed the the table ahead of me commented that nobody was coming by to take their order either. I waited 10 minutes and even though staff kept walking by, nobody made eye contact or offered to take my order. Finally, as I packed up to leave, somebody asked me if I wanted a drink. Ugh! Seriously, if the staff outnumber the customers, couldn't somebody figure out how to take an order? I've been there during peak rush and have gotten faster and friendlier service. I'll be back, but I guess it's better to go when they're really busy."}
{"text":"Shoehorned between football merch stores and frat bro living is Postino \"Annex\", the name of a restaurant ashamed to admit its presence in Tempe. If you want to see how Postino does Tempe, go now before Annex goes out of business.   Gone is the hip styling of its sister branches, replaced by CPK yellow umbrellas, sickly yellow walls, and off-brand yellow wine lists. Half the wait staff is dedicated solely to filling water glasses. We got 3 glasses of water before seeing a waiter, who had a very special technique of walking past the table, tapping on it, and mumbling a few things while walking away. It wasn't a full house, and he had nowhere to be.  We wanted to leave almost immediately, so we only ordered an appetizer, which arrived an hour later and wrong. \"I'll get you a discount\", said Thomas. We didn't get a discount. While we waited more, I watched him drop food items off the plate and continue to serve them.  It's possible that Postino Annex will be held afloat by the twenty-something omg-gluten-free first-timers, but the young inexperienced staff and janky decor will keep me at the Arcadia location. At least then I can get LGO gelato afterwards instead of an ASU sport polo."}
{"text":"The service was mediocre for most of the meal until we were ready to leave and pay. Then it got good. I was fairly disappointed with the lack of options on the menu as well. I had the Autostrada, it was actually pretty good, but my wife had the tomato basil,smoked salmon, and artichoke bruschetta, and was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was great!  The raspberry organic chicken salad paired with my chicken Mozzarella sandwich tasted great.  Food took a little while but was worth the wait, especially when we got the bill and the manager gave us a 50% discount without us even complaining.  Great service."}
{"text":"Used Yelp to find a good place for lunch. This place was fabulous. Patio is wonderful. The panini, salad and soup were all very tasty. Service was also really great. Music was a little too loud for Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Came here for an afternoon meal and a couple of wines. My server, Christian, was great (talkative and friendly). I've only tried their bruschetta because that's what I like and it's always delicious."}
{"text":"For my mindful eating class at ASU, there was a class dine out where we were able to chose a restaurant with a few classmates to test our mindful eating skills. We came to Postino Annex in Tempe and had a great experience. The staff was very friendly and informative of the menu and recommendations. I ordered the creamy chicken soup and the quinoa farm salad under the select two option. The soup was warm and flavorful upon arrival, with many different consistencies - I thoroughly enjoyed it. I could also smell the flavors of the soup while I was eating my salad. The salad was great, as well! It was a jam-packed mix of quinoa, greens, bell peppers, cheese, fruits, and a few other things. It had so many flavors and textures as well. The combination of warm soup and fruity salad made my meal very enjoyable. My classmates ordered a variety of things from the select two option also. We all ordered the soup and had no complaints! A classmate ordered the roast beef sandwich and said it was delicious. The meals came very quickly and were brought to us by enthusiastic staff, which made the experience even better. The prices are great for the amount of food and quality that you receive. I ended up paying about $12 for the soup and salad - where one could be replaced for a filling Panini. I will definitely be heading to Postino again in the near future. It's a great option that's so close to campus!"}
{"text":"Poor service and lousy wait time. Given the time frame of 30-45 and have waited over an hour to continually be told just another 5 minutes. Excited to see the new location so close to home but truly disappointed by the service provided"}
{"text":"I have come here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and have never been disappointed. The locations are all beautiful, the portions are perfect, the price is on point, and most importantly, the food is to die for. I never want to go anywhere else for bruschetta, and I struggle to choose just one item from the brunch menu each time I go because it's all so incredible. All of their items have a unique flavor profile, you aren't going to find this stuff anywhere else."}
{"text":"I love Postino! Went to Central location for first time in June when visiting Phoenix & it was great. The atmosphere, music, food & wine will make anyone happy. I Stopped in today before my flight back to Atlanta for the bruschetta. I had the apple & brie and prosciutto, goat cheese. They were delicious! Talisa is the best server I've ever had! She was so sweet & attentive & you can tell she loves people & her job. She is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"The wine selection was meh. Five stars for ambience and dog friendliness and two for food and service. We saw our server three times in the hour we were there (once was when we asked for the check), and if we hadn't grabbed her to order when we did I'm not sure we ever would have had the chance! Granted, they had a private party that night which I'm guessing kept them pretty busy. We ordered the meat and cheese board and the caprese salad. The caprese was nice and the flavored well-balanced, and the dish was pleasantly composed. However, the meat and cheese board had about two pieces of cheese and, inexplicably, an enormous glob of hummus in the middle. What was I to eat that with? Crostini? Pickles? Unclear. The meats and pickles were nice but everything else left much to be desired. I'd skip the apps and go for something heftier next time. We left oddly full off two appetizers, but not in a good way. Like, in a bloaty I-just-ate-a-glob-of-hummus-at-a-wine-bar sort of way. Womp womp. We'll probably give it another shot due to the nice patio and the very cheap wine list."}
{"text":"I was there tonight and the food/wine was so delicious. However, we showed up at about 8:30...ordered wine and bruschetta. We didn't ask for much more. I had met up with a friend from out of town and we were catching up, around 10:00 we were asked so many times if we were doing ok. We understand the serving industry, I'm sure our waitress wanted to get off. But we were asked SEVEN times, and it wasn't even close to closing time. Then someone closed the check and brought it to us without our request, it wasn't last call and the kitchen wasn't closing. I couldn't name our server because we were passed off to different people multiple times...In conclusion, we felt rushed to finish our visit and leave."}
{"text":"I love that their is now a Postinos in Tempe, such a great location! I went on a Tuesday night with a friend and sat at the bar outside. The bartenders were awesome, so attentive.  You can't beat their bottle of wine and a plate of bruschetta deal on Mondays & Tuesday nights... $20!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the new Postino located in Tempe by ASU but my fifth visit overall, including both Scottsdale locations and the one in Gilbert.  I want to love this place but the decor for me is better than the food, hands down. I've heard so many people talk about how great their bruschetta is and I've been disappointed every time. The portion is huge and I feel like they lack depth of flavor. For a truly amazing bruschetta, I recommend heading just one block west to La Bocca Pizza and Wine Bar on Mill Ave. I've had their tuna melt before, too, although it was good, I know plenty of other places to get a delicious tuna melt or sandwich (try Ollie Vaughan's in downtown Phoenix).  I've never necessarily been struck by stellar service here, not that it's ever been bad, but I have to point out how incredible our server was the other night. Sanja was absolutely a doll. We waited quite a while to order food and I never once felt like she was irritated or blowing us off. She came around often enough to make sure we each still had a drink and see how we were feeling, without being overbearing. She was sweet, calm, patient, and had a smile on the whole evening, despite the fact that she was clearly very busy (there had been a 20-minute wait). I would probably come back just for her service.  Unfortunately, I don't think I'll drop back in unless I'm with friends who insist. Like I said, I would much rather head over to La Bocca a couple hundred yards away. In fact, my experiences here always left me wishing I had gone there instead. Maybe Sanja should see about hopping over there."}
{"text":"I went here on a dinner date. The food was good and fresh, if rather unoriginal.  The wine menu is extensive, so that is probably the main attraction. The atmosphere is nice, and the decor is trendy, but the music is too loud for conversation."}
{"text":"Very different kind of restaurant.   Food, excellent,  service beyond excellent,  ambiance wonderful.  We had Kyle, very helpful and professional with a sweet smile."}
{"text":"This place has a very classy atmosphere. Usually I do not like salmon, but I tried some of my friends smoked salmon on bruschetta and it was amazing! I would eat here again. I tried a turkey sandwich and it was delicious. I saw they do a brunch special and I may need to try it soon."}
{"text":"Without a doubt some of the best bruschetta I've ever had. Great combination of flavours to choose from and everyone has a distinct flavour. Also there is a great variety of wine to choose from. Would highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved everything about Postino Annex! I loved the ambiance and felt it was very cozy. My husband and I split the Butcher's Board and Bruschetta and each had a glass of wine. We went before 5pm, so the glasses of wine were only $5. The bruschetta was to die for and my husband loved the butcher's board. The service was great and I felt like we were well taken care of!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for brunch! Food is great and the atmosphere is awesome! Walnut toast with brie is super yummy!"}
{"text":"We went to Postino's on a Saturday night for my birthday celebration. Nicholas was our waiter and he was superb!  He answered ALL of my questions, recommended the cheese plate, and made a suggestion to add the sweet and spicy mustard to it. It was delicious!  Not to mention the rest of the crew was friendly, and didn't let any small detail go unnoticed.  Our dinner was fantastic too!  He had the roast beef sandwich, and I had the veggie sandwich. Thanks for making our night extra special Nicholas!"}
{"text":"At Postino's right now! I wish I would've found this place earlier on our trip. OMG!!!  Food: Stellar! I had the pick 2, half salad and soup of the moment. With one brushetta and a beautiful glass of wine.  Service: wonderful!!! Fast, friendly and on point. Atmosphere: beautiful and clean. Even in the crazy HOT desert sitting outside wasn't bad.   I will most definitely come back. Note: on Monday's and Tuesday night's come in for a bottle of wine and bushettas for $20!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is super super good. The sandwiches are delicious and the bruschetta are extremely good but can be inconsistent sometimes."}
{"text":"The bruschetta was incredible, christian our server was outstanding! Would definitely recommend this to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Soooo I come to Postinos all the time! Always great food! Tonight there was the most minuscule detail wrong with our chips, and the manager (Derek) and our server (Kylie) went above and beyond to make sure everything was made right! They brought us more chips and gave us a free dessert!! Thanks a million guys! It's that great service that keeps us coming back!!"}
{"text":"had a bridal shower here - service was perfect from the first inquiry to our departure. food and wine were delish and the atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"Love this new location!!  Three times bigger than the central Phoenix location.  Kayla from the bar area is awesome and very friendly.  Adrian is also very friendly and is such a cutie too.  I always get the bruschetta and big bowl of the \"soup of the moment\".  Definitely fills me up.  Highly recommended this location for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome place for brunch and mimosas!   The french toast is an excellent dessert to share with friends and family.  Staff and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Everything was great but the rap music was awful and clashes horribly with the atmosphere. You're a wine/cheese/brunch/Italian restaurant, have some class."}
{"text":"Complete disregard for the customer. Check in as a party of 8 to celebrate with family. Tell us 1 hour wait. 30 minutes in told we don't do parties of 8 and will split you up. Seriously? Just tell us when we walk in. Never again...as if you care."}
{"text":"great experience, great service, great food!  awesome job taking care of our big group today, Rae!   we'll be back...soon...and often."}
{"text":"Easily one of my new favorite places to dine at. I come here for everything except the alcohol simply because I don't drink. Everything has been delicious and fresh. I've brought my pup here a few times as well. Hoping to try out the brunch menu soon!   (P.s. one yelper mentioned the cucumber honey lemonade being bottomless. This is FALSE!!! They might top it off with some more lemonade but this isn't the case everytime. Shall we petition??)"}
{"text":"I eat here probably once/week - usually late afternoon or weekends as that is the only time I can get in because there are so many other diners.  3 staff members greet me by first name and remember which wine I drink, one owner sat with me when the place first opened and told me their philosophy of refurbishing old buildings.  You can get pitchers of craft beer like Kiltlifter and glasses of wine for $5 before 5 pm.  Food is fresh and delicious.  You can order just 2 bruschettas if you are not that hungry or half of a panini and half of a salad if you are hungry..  It is not just about bruschetta.  The Italian Picnic Salad is just full of ingredients - not just a layer of ingredients over lettuce.  Brunch on the weekends is until 1 pm.  I love the Ciabatta French Toast with Creme Fraiche, Almonds, Strawberries and house made raspberry preserves."}
{"text":"This place definitely wasn't what I expected. The menu is definitely not extensive, and the portions are medium-small. This seems to be more of a college hangout for wine-time and a classy atmosphere. Although this wasn't the \"elegante ristorante italiano\" I had expected, don't let this lead you to believe that it isn't worth the stop, because what it lacks with it's less-than-extensive menu and hip rather than fancy atmosphere it more than makes up for it with EXTREMELY tasty food. My wife and I shared a bruschetta board that was to die for, bringing light and savory flavors into a perfect balance. We both got a panini for our entree and was also very impressed in freshness and in the originality of their recipes. Bottom line: don't go to Postino Annex if you are expecting a formal (quiet) setting for dinner, but if you are okay hanging out with a bunch of college kids getting their fancy on, by all means check it out, the food won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Went to Postino Annex today for my daughter's graduation luncheon. James was our server. 1st off he has a great name, since my name is James too! The food was amazing but I thought James' service was what really made the experience so wonderful. One of my tell signs of a good server is how often my iced tea gets filled up. Well James wins the prize! He was on it today. His service was absolutely amazing. We will definitely be back and we will definitely ask for James to be our server! Thanks my friend for making us feel so special today!"}
{"text":"This was our first time and we had a reservation for 9 people and were initially sat in one of the lounge areas. I thought it was bizarre to assume that's where we wanted to sit for dinner without being asked when making the reservation. They were able to accommodate and moved us to a table which was more comfortable.  Server had great wine suggestions, food was awesome, but took a while. It was noticeably busy though. Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"This was the perfect place for Kevin and Natalees Engagement party.  Thank you Natalie Kell for being so accommodating and easy to work with. Our server, Hannah, was wonderful as well. All the guests enjoyed the catering menu choices."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time a few days ago and I have to say it was amazing. I had the turkey club sandwich on focaccia and the chips as a side. My sandwich was huge and delicious. I went during lunch time so it was busy but we sat at the bar. $5 pitchers until 5 pm, you cannot beat that. The bartender was busy but still managed to have amazing service. I definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Victory Prima Pilsner from Pennsylvania and Bruschetta (esply one with dates and pistachio)"}
{"text":"I'd be rating the food at Postino Annex on here EXCEPT that I couldn't get any food there.  Seems like if the web site says that the place is open until midnight on a Saturday, that one could actually get food in this gritty/urban/4 million+ people metro Phoenix area at midnight.  But no.  Kitchen closed at 11 pm, but the restaurant was still open for another hour.  Well, that's helpful.    If you want to present a truly urban vibe, take a look at truly urban areas, where restaurants offer decent food (not Jimmy Johns) late in the evening, AFTER a show, for example.  Might as well live in Payson, for crying out loud!  I gave the place one star because it's attractive."}
{"text":"Went to Postinos on Friday night for the first time and we are hooked. Our original plan was to eat elsewhere but once we sat down and realized we had made some real friendships both behind the bar and with other patrons, we stayed and had a great meal. The beer and wine selection was also a bonus. After a great first experience, we went back before the ASU game for drinks and after the game on Saturday evening for food and drinks and had just as good of a time, even closed it down on Saturday night.  Jess, Randy, Cassie(sp)and the rest of the group made our evenings memorable.  Looking forward to going back in November."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food. Glad we got there at 5 pm and were able to sit inside since it's still too hot outside.  Good food (had bruschetta) and wine. Appreciated the taste of a couple of wines to help me decide what to order.  Just wish there were better weekend happy hour specials. Just missed the deals by getting there at 5 pm."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday for lunch. Our waiter was dealing with shift change when we came in so we had some problems with our service. We got a new waitress towards the end who was extremely apologetic that we had to wait and the manager came over and brought us free board coupons! Food was delicious, everyone was nice, and of course the wine and beer selection was great."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and loved it! Yogurt/granola was very fresh, and Christian was an awesome server! Try to get a table with him if you visit the Tempe location!"}
{"text":"Such a great place. Low key, friendly staff, great Monday night specials and a really decent wine selection. I like coming to this place because I know what kind of service I will be getting. It's not pretentious and it's very consistent. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is so nice LOVE the look and its nice and clean + the patio this time of year is perfection and the customer service is on point... The parking is the down side but its worth going back and this one is large enough for parties."}
{"text":"Great MondayTuesday date night deal with a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board to split for $20. They're wine list is insanely awesome. They have a honey moscato that's never on the menu anymore, but they still have if you ask about it. It's incredibly sweet, but a perfectly refreshing way to wind down at the end of the day."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh you can't go wrong with Postino's.  Am so happy they are now in Tempe! I usually go with the bruschetta board- it's big enough to share and so many great options to choose from.  Great service and always love the music they play."}
{"text":"Oh man!  Gluten free brushetta appetizer?  Yes please!  My wife has a wheat allergy, so that every option comes gluten free is a super bonus!  Love the happy hour until 5 but I can't get there as much as I'd like (which lets you know it is in a college town, those of us who work can't get there before 5, unless we are \"sick\" ;-)   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Christian is awesome, great beer recommendations and super nice! Had a swell time between classes"}
{"text":"Never again.   The gatekeepers (hostesses) with their almighty tablets are just too much.  Go there, and you'll immediately see what I mean. Tonight I dropped 3 people at 7:45-7:50 while I parked the car ($6 for 2 hours). When I got to the restaurant the 3 were still standing in a line that was going out the door.  Why?  The hostesses were \"staggering the seating so we don't overwhelm our waitstaff\".  So, the empty patio was not being filled.  Group after group walked up to put in their name, and then left when they realized they'd be waiting a long time due to this policy.  We put in our name, but decided to leave when their text message alert told me there were 10 parties ahead of us-- with a nearly empty patio.    Last week I left a Yelp Tip saying the service had been great once we convinced them to let us be seated on the patio.  The manager was afraid it would rain last time.  It didn't rain, of course. The length they have made us go through two weeks in a row to be seated when the tables are empty is unacceptable.  Clearly, others felt the same way, as many people turned and left tonight.   2 stars for the nice waitstaff we had last week.  Zero stars for the bizarre seating system that leaves customers standing and waiting while tables sit empty.  Ever consider bringing in more staff on nights when you have the wine special, or does that make too much sense?"}
{"text":"Just as good as the downtown location, except parking felt far easier.  Food was consistently good (I mean, how can you screw up bruschetta). The service was mostly attentive, except they ran someone else's bill on my card. I got a promise for a refund of the difference within 5 business days and 5 brunch coupons (for every person remaining in my party).   Seating was actually much nicer- we had sofa seating outside which accommodated our originally 12+ person party easily. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Knowledgeable and friendly service.  Great bruschetta and atmosphere.  They only serve wine and beer but they have extensive selections on both."}
{"text":"Just got back to Postino Second time today the service just drew us back Monet and maddy were so great had to come back again! They are great!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor ambience and service. The assorted Bruschetta was delicious and could serve as a meal itself. Drinks are so cheap, a pitcher of beer for just 5 bucks before 5pm."}
{"text":"I love Postinos and have always had great experiences in Gilbert and Phoenix.  This location was lacking today.  I ordered a panini with ciabatta bread-was super dry and hard (I like crusty bread, but this was not good at all).  It also came with Yukon gold potato chips and they were terrible-greasy and soggy and just gross.  I am not a picky eater and usually like everything, so this was just bad.  Everyone else ordered bruschetta and said it was good.  The positive for me was my iced tea :)  The waitress was pretty attentive and kept our drinks filled, so it wasn't all bad, just my particular order.  Ick."}
{"text":"We came into Postino a couple of weeks ago for a quick lunch. We got there probably a half hour after they opened and there was already a reasonably sized crowd that got larger by the time we left.  I was pleased with the wide selection of wines available. I would maybe have liked to see a little bit more of a description of the taste/features of some of the less well known varieties for us uninitiated. I had the Llebre red-blend from Spain and really enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to trying something else next time.  We ordered the spinach/artichoke dip and hummus as a starter, and bruschetta planks as the main. The breads were excellent, as were the dips.  The bruschetta was excellent as well. We ordered four different varieties, which came as two pretty decently sized pieces each. We ordered the prosciutto and fig, the brie and apple, the tomato jam and sheep's milk cheese, and the smoked salmon with pesto. The tomato jam one was particularly intriguing to me. I can't really come up with a better descriptor other than it tasted like Christmas. It was very unique. I wasn't a huge fan of the smoked salmon/pesto variety but that may be more of my dislike of pesto than anything else. The other two were delicious as well.  One interesting thing was that it seemed like there were twice as many staff as there ought to have been working at that time. I had probably six or seven people who refilled drinks, asked how I was doing, and in general waited on us during the hour or so we were there. It seemed a little unnecessary.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone for a casual yet upscale lunch, and am looking forward to returning again soon."}
{"text":"Like the location, flavor and set up of this place. The wind flows and the bruschetta is served well. Small but concrete menu. Definitely worth the try."}
{"text":"Love coming to Annex!! Service is always great. I've had Gabi as a server quite a few times and she's always so lovely and friendly. Also shoutout to Jeremiah for being awesome too!! Great staff"}
{"text":"Postino Annex showed up when searching for Italian restaurants in the area, and because of all these great reviews I thought let's give it a shot. First off, this is NOT Italian food. It's basically just a glorified sandwich place. The interior is indeed extremely nice and classy. Wine racks, custom ceiling decorations, all that stuff. It has a pretty and sophisticated feel that's actually a nice change from the rest of this area in Tempe.  The food is weird though. There are no \"real\" hot foods. No pizza, no pasta, no meat dishes. All they have are paninis, bruschetta, and plates of cheeses and meats. That's it. (and lots of wines and cocktails) Everything they serve is stuff you can pick up at the grocery store and put together yourself. Most of what they offer doesn't require any special seasoning or cooking or really anything that requires a skilled cook. Open jar or package, cut into pieces, put on thick wood plate to give it substance - boom, snack dressed up as dinner.   The quality of the food itself seemed high.   Our meat/cheese plate had a good amount of fresh olives, various cheeses, and a couple of slices of what seemed to be good quality salami and prosciutto. I'd compare it to the stuff you'd grab at Whole Foods.   The bruschetta was decent but again nothing to write home about. Slices of white bread with your choice of 6 different toppings. We chose the salmon (good), artichoke (meh) and something else that I don't recall. I remember it had a pesto smear. Decent but not really anything we would consider an Italian dinner.   Service was friendly enough, although our server enjoyed chatting with her friends more than actually serving anyone at a decent speed.  Table was a bit cramped. Overall nothing terrible or awesome. The food just was a let down. I always feel taken advantage of when a place just has sandwiches and stuff I could make myself in 2 minutes with basic items I can buy at the grocery store. No cooking, no seasoning required.   If all you want are paninis or bruschetta, and are more interested in wine or cocktails, this place is probably great. But if you're looking for actual food that satisfies a big appetite, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my girlfriend a few weeks ago, was VERY surprised how amazing everything tasted. Very excited to go again today."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is lovely- bathrooms are clean. We were seated outside without a wait. Our server greater us within a couple minutes and had vast knowledge about the wines he was recommending to us.   We ordered Bruschetta which was amazing! There are many different kinds to chose from- you are given the option to pick up to four different ones per plate. My favorite is the Salami and Pesto or the Goat Cheese & tomatoes. They are all fantastic.   I was extremely surprised/confused when after we received our Bruschetta the manager came up and apologized for the wait. It had maybe been 15-20 minutes... with the wine and lovely weather we hadn't even noticed. They offered to comp our WHOLE meal- drinks included. Extremely unnecessary but shows they pay attention to their customers. Really great/knowledgeable service. Will return soon! Thanks!"}
{"text":"So enjoyed our last two dining experiences at Postino, Tempe.  Food was amazing, hot, fresh, delicious and wildly creative.  My favorite is the bruschetta with 8 flavors to choose from.  Really exceptional staff as well.  Manager stopped by our table and even the bus staff were super friendly and professional.  Highly recommended.   Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"We opted for their breakfast after running a 10k early in the morning. I felt bad walking in right as they happened to open, and the staff was more than polite about it. The breakfast and bruschetta were on point, along with the beer & coffee. We will be back & recommend this location to others! Finally remembered the initial server's name - Patrick was awesome & attentive"}
{"text":"Never have been here for brunch before this past Sunday.  We enjoyed ourselves on the patio with our kids, and the food was delicious. I am happy we stopped in!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times.  Great selection of very good panini's and bruschettas.  Nothing on the menu is very substantial, but what they do serve is also good and reasonably priced.  And the outside patio is a great place to sit when the weather is nice.  Knocking off one star for the service my wife and I received today by Christian.  Completely ignored our table even though the place was pretty much empty (though he did make numerous stops to the table behind ours).  We were seated for 5-10 minutes before he made an appearance.  We ordered immediately since we could see this would take awhile.  The food took much longer than 2 panini's should take.  And when we were done eating we sat for another 15 minutes before the hostess grabbed my card to close us out (the bill was never even brought to us).  I'm sure we will be back, but have learned the hard way that this isn't a place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"We looooove Postino's. We love the bruschetta, the brunch, and $5 mimosas on Sunday!!  We sat at the bar and waited for a table 2 Sunday's ago. Got a text that the table was ready, so we are carrying full mimosas to the front so we could be sat. A worker straight up turns around violently and runs into me and I quickly say, \"Sorry!!\"  But instead of him saying sorry back or excuse me or anything, he replies with, \"You're good.\" Ummm, ok lol. You are the one who ran right into me....  Also, whatever this 4 drink per table then you get cut off deal is... I understand the concept and all, but this day my fiance had 3 drinks and I had only had 1, yet we both still get cut off? Trust me, I'm not getting hammered off of 1 mimosa. The server was nice about it and I understand it's not her choice, but really?? Is this a rule for all postinos or just Tempe? Because I have certainly been with a group that was served more than 4 drinks per table at a different location. So after this, we left and went down the street."}
{"text":"This week I went to Postino Annex restaurant. I think the environment of this restaurant is very amazing. There are a lot of people around here, but nobody make very loud noise. The restaurant still have a lot of seat  The restaurant is very clean and the service is very good and fast. The location of this restaurant is very convenient for me, I park my bike under the university house and walk here in 2 minutes. I think the gluten free food and the low price attract a lot of people here. It is very hard to find a restaurant that have gluten free food in ASU campus.  I had a great experience in this restaurant. They have a lot of options to order, so I can choose my favorite dishes. I had a pick of 2 option to try both their soups and a half of panini. The special soup for that day is chicken cream soup, I think the taste of the soup is warm and amazing. I ordered a roasted beef panini, but I think the panini is very dry and taste a little bit salty. That is why I rate them 4.0. The overall experience in this restaurant is very amazing. I think it is worth it and I only paid 11.35 without the tip. I think this place is very good for 4-5 people dinning together and I recommend it. I think I will come to this restaurant next time because the experience is really good."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the atmosphere.  No wait time during happy hour & the bruschetta was AMAZING!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try this place for dinner and I'm glad I did. We were seated right away and helped quickly. The food is awesome and the atmosphere is outstanding. It is a great place to eat and hangout. Everyone is polite and courteous with very prompt service. We will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Everything was great but we had to take our food to go.  The ambience, the selection of wines, the bruschetta boards. All 5 stars!! Would love it if we had something like that here! Go check it out!"}
{"text":"We loved this place and our waiter, Michael. We were able to find something that looked good on the menu on our own, but when asked for suggestions he steered us perfectly. He was just the right amount of attentive throughout the meal, too - not a bunch of interruptions asking if everything was okay, but we could tell he was keeping an eye out and we never lacked water or adult beverages. My wife and I each had a salad and half sandwich - the one with Brie was fantastic but all the options looked good. We also split the bruschetta board - I wouldn't have considered it except for Michael's recommendation, and we were not disappointed. The wine and beer lists weren't overwhelmingly long, but they had the right based covered. I like their \"happy hour till 5\" idea, and we'd have stayed longer if we'd had the time. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Very happy with our brunch today.  Our party of 7 were seated quickly and we had a number of dishes  and everyone thought it was delicious. Would come back next time we are in town for sure."}
{"text":"I have been here a numerous amount of times because of the $5 pitchers of beer. The appetisers are awesome! To top everything off, we were stuck with six hours to kill due to rental car return being at noon and flight at 8pm. They held our luggage for us behind the counter and truly had the best experience with the employees here. Words cannot express how awesome they have treated us. We stop here every time we come to Arizona because of it. Luisa the hostess and Nick our server provided such a phenomenal service. Highly recommend. Thank you!"}
{"text":"First off my friend who lives in Denver insisted on coming here to this location. She was in town for work. You have to pay to park in the parking Garage and Postino's does not validate. We sat on the Patio and for a Tuesday night they were quite busy. The place is nicely decorated and we were seated outside after just about a 12 min. wait. Not bad. Our server came directly to get us started. we all ordered drinks and my 2 dining companions ordered a Bruschetta. Which was beautiful and very nice tasting. We also ordered an appetizer of Olives. Julie wanted the Olives, I just have to say. Well I ordered Half a Sandwich and Soup. They other 2 each ordered a Salad. After about 30 minutes after the olives and Bruschetta came , I said it is really taking a long time to get our food. Julie called the waitress over and asked her how much longer did she think it was going to be till we got our food. At this time the waitress admitted that she had forgotten to put the order in. Hey, in my book worse things have happened. It could happen to anyone. I said well it is just a little too late now. I really did not need to eat anything else.  However,my friend was very upset and asked for the manager. The manager was a very nice young lady named Amanda. She apoligized ,even though it was not her fault and asked what she could do to make it better. I said nothing all is well, things happen. But, she still gave us a cheese plate and tried her best to keep the peace. The server did not seem too sorry. But, I felt sorry for the Manager as she was really upset for us and wanted to fix it as best as she could. I wish I could tell you more about the food. But, the cheese plate was good and so were the Olives and Bruschetta. Hey what can you do things happen. I would go back though. On another note the ladies room was clean with lots of T.P. everywhere. Very industrial."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the service! Postino's $20 board and bottle special on Monday's and Tuesday nights are awesome. Our server Sanja was excellent, super sweet and personable. Even my two little dogs loved it. They gave them a bowl of ice water immediately and the whole team was atrentive. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sat down at the bar with a buddy, waited for about 20 minutes or so while others were served and we were ignored.  This place normally has really good service.  What a shame."}
{"text":"Food was good once we received it. We waited for ~30 mins to get in on a Sunday morning (normal), but it took nearly an hour to get our food delivered. That's a management problem - especially if you know ahead of time that its Parent Weekend."}
{"text":"Postino had a delicious dinner menu! My girlfriend and I started with a bottle of Tempernillo, followed by the Bruschetta (you can choose 4 from the options for $14). We got the fig & cheese, traditional, smoked salmon &  capers, and bacon burrata ....all of which were delicious! Wonderful service and funny staff. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Both the food and the service were amazing. I was there with a group of 6 and we were well taken care of.  We had several appetizers, all were awesome. I highly recommend the Nine Iron Panini, extremely tasty. All the pictures already posted say it all.  Very large selection of wine.  I would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally did tonight! Hands down one of my new favorite places for wine. My friend and I did the $20 bottle of wine and bruschetta board which was excellent! Service was great, we sat at the bar and all the bartenders were super friendly. I will definitely be back to one of the locations again soon!"}
{"text":"Good wine selection with happy hour. Outdoor patio is fun with friends. Service is good with the amount of tables they handle."}
{"text":"Love me some bruschetta! And what better way to get four different types for only $15! This option lets you pick 12 different choices including their 'seasonal' bruschetta. Location is near ASU campus, there is metered parking across the street, and because we went on a Sunday, it was free. Customer service was great, server messed up on one of our bruschettas & they quickly remedied the situation & got us the one we wanted on the house. If you must have dessert, try their chocolate bouchon, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"As usual the food was delicious. This time tho... The service was not very good. We had a kid with us and they forgot to bring his order. Our check took 20 mins to be delivered. So typically I love this place but today there was room for improvement."}
{"text":"Love this place! Especially during happy hour. $5 beers/wine?! Perfect. Plus I'm a big appetizer person and you can't beat the large amount of bruschetta and cheese and meat on the cheese board. Charcuterie done right!"}
{"text":"We went to Postino for the first time tonight. As out of Towners we relied on Yelp for inspiration. We weren't disappointed! We split the bruschetta (4 flavors) and the Bounty (veggie and dips platter). It was plenty for the 3 in our party. Fresh and delicious. But the real treat was server, Stef! She was excellent providing wine recommendations as well as food options. Ask for Stef. You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Mixed review with this place. The pros are that the paninis are amazing. The cons however, is that we waited a long time for our food. It wasn't even busy and there seemed like there were a lot of employees just standing around or talking to one another. It took about 35 mins to get our food (table of 2). We also had to remind our waitress for refills of water several times since their cups were so small. Then we had to take initiative again to grab the waitress for our bill. Why wasn't she paying attention to us more? Second con, is that they didn't have many choices for food. The menu was very limited. I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"At Postino right now and really enjoyed the food, ambiance, and tip top service!  Our waitress Emily was amazingly attentive to us while balancing multiple tables close by.  I'll give this place, service, and food 3 thumbs up if you let me borrow a thumb!  Awesome experience on my first trip to Phoenix.  It will definitely be a next trip stop!  Oh, and try the apple with fig spread bruschetta!  Bomb.com"}
{"text":"Brunch! That's all you need to know, really. Mimosas+ Farm Scramble= very happy camper here. The food was fresh, well made, lots of flavor. I came here with a friend and we really enjoyed sitting down and talking over brunch and drinking mimosas.  One thing I would suggest is \"read your table\"- it's one thing to be upbeat and gregarious with a group of women that are laughing and giggling and another to be a bit overbearing with women that are having a serious conversation that you interrupt. And it wasn't our waiter, it was another young man that was browsing the crowd and checking on the patrons.  Other than that, I will return to try their Tuesday night deal."}
{"text":"Can I come here every week? Gosh, the wait is horrible, and the service was bad, so maybe not! However, the food was on point! my favorite, the brie apple with figs and dates with pistachio.   I called to see how long the wait will be and told them I want to be in and out pretty quickly-- she responded that if I get there in 15 minutes, I should be seated within 15 minutes, I got there in 15 minutes and had to wait 45-60 mins for my table. We could have still made it to our other plans had our server showed up on time--- but he didnt even welcome/greet us for 15-20 minutes after we sat down... We ended up having to cancel our other plans, which was the most annoying part..."}
{"text":"We ate here Friday evening 12/9/2016 before Mama Mia.  Absolutely loved  bruschetta board.  Great selections.  Service attentive and informative: Bruno."}
{"text":"My daughter had visited another location - this one was near the airport and provided a convenient rest and refuel before the long flight home. I thought it would be a nice place - lively patio with misters outside, college scene - but I was pleasantly surprised with the pretty interior, incredible waitstaff, and of course the wine and bruschetta. VERY pleasantly surprised. It could have been just another trendy tiresome eat, but instead we were treated to delicious food and drink. Very reasonably priced, and such a cool atmosphere - comfy booths along one side, bar on the other - somehow not feeling cramped at all. The serving lane runs the length of the other side of the booths so servers are always there but never in the way. Cool concept. We were interested in the $5/glass wine. I figured this would be a limited selection, but it turned out to include the entire wine selection! Bruschetta selections were extensive and every one was tasty and unique. When salami came instead of salmon (oops), the exchange was made immediately without fuss. I like this kind of bruschetta on toasted yet toothsome bread that doesn't hurt to bite into, if you know what I mean. Another plus: the server was so personable to our 2 year old companion, bringing her wikistix to play with and generally being the sort of person young children adore. That was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Had such a great experience here, that I had to write a review! Such a hidden gem in the heart of tempe. The bruschetta was amazing! Our server Conor was friendly, quick, and on his game. I will definitely be back for $20 wine and board on Mondays."}
{"text":"As busy as the other Postinos but it seemed to be lacking a certain something, if I had to put it down to one thing is that it feels a bit like a copy....it's good but just doesn't have the same small hidden gem feel that some of the other locations have.    Had the Nine Iron, it's good just as good as Arcadia but the locations and feel just isn't quite right.  The other locations seem more intimate, but there feels like a real premium on real estate exists at the \"annex\".     You could do much worse in the Mill Ave area, but I'm reviewing against the other Postinos."}
{"text":"Love Postino. I've been here and their other locations several times over, and I have never regretted my choice.  Their bottle + board is the best deal in town (as noted in my other reviews). Their brunch (which is what I came here for today) is pretty good too, but it doesn't beat its bruschetta. Though the food was good, I felt like the options were pretty limited. Most things include bacon, and it's not quite my favorite thing in the world - I know I'm in the minority!! I think there might have only been one other item that included a protein that didn't come with bacon. I'm assuming you'd be able to get it substituted though, but I didn't ask since mine didn't come with a protein. I'd suggest going to Snooze if you have the time, patience, and the lack of hunger to wait.   Though I won't choose Postino as my first choice for brunch, I am still giving it 4 stars because of the other items I've enjoyed over my time here: bruschetta, paninis, salads, wine selection, etc."}
{"text":"What a groovy place. Can you tell that I am older. We entered through the back door and looked lost, which we were. The manager AJ swooped in an welcomed us. Made us feel comfortable and found us a fun table on the patio. Our server Kylie made the perfect recommendations for a bottle of wine and bruschetta. Great experience. We will definitely be back with our drinking age SunDevil."}
{"text":"I have previously been to Postinos in Gilbert and loved it. Tempe's location was also great. Probably gets extremely busy when the semester starts. I am guessing that because it was at night and during the winter break, parking was not an an issue. Might be during the school season, although there are garages near by.   We had the bruschetta for starters. I recommend all of them! I am an Arnold Palmer kind of girl and my friend loves the cucumber honey.  She had the soup of the day (cheddar and potatoes - don't remember the exact name) and thought it was pretty good. Definitely a creamy soup. We both had the chicken and mozzarella and it was delicious. I'm a cheese lover so I loved that it comes with a pretty thick slice of mozzarella. I had Hannah's Field salad and I thought it was pretty flavorful, I would definitely have it again."}
{"text":"Second time coming here. First time was for brunch: Excellent! Second time for lunch: Excellent! We ordered the bruschetta to share...soooo good! You get to pick 4 different kinds. I also ordered the Prosciutto, Brie, and Fig Panini but I ate it before taking a picture lol. It was delicious! We had stopped by for an early birthday lunch for my sister. They brought her a yummy chocolate filled brownie with ice cream! That was also delicious. Its a super nice place in a trendy part of Tempe and for the great quality, is extremely affordable. They also have great beer/wine prices."}
{"text":"Not overcrowded (yet) but the same great flavors of the other Postino locations. I think that Roasted Red Pepper & Gouda Soup should be on the menu every day."}
{"text":"Awesome spot with great seats. Brunch is 9am-3pm Sat/Sun. Had the meat plate ($14) which was very delicious and filling. They had $5 wine glasses and pitchers of beer. The pitcher fills about 2 1/2 glasses so quite a deal. A must try for dates/lazy weekends"}
{"text":"I hosted a surprise birthday party at Postino Annex, food, drink and service was excellent!!!!"}
{"text":"Super good music, super good people, super good selection of drinks. Everything here feels so authentic and thought out.  If you're looking for a fun date night or a nice place to come and get lost in good vibes, Postino Annex is the place to be.  Big shout out to Nick and Jeremiah for treating extra special on my solo night out ;)"}
{"text":"Update: After our not-so-great service, they contacted us and assured us that this is unusual for them and that they normally have better customer service. They were very professional and made it right. I will definitely be giving them another shot.   We have been wanting to try this place for quite a while. We have heard such good things. We got there and we waited a little. Someone came by to offer us drinks, which is always nice. They were off to a good start. We got to our table and between our group we ordered a panini, salads, bruschetta and olives as an appetizer. We got our drinks first. My husband's soda was flat. We ordered a new one and they never brought it out. Then they brought out our food with the exception of the olives, which were supposed to come out first. We reminded them about the soda and they brought a new (also flat) soda. They said the management was looking into it. We then had the opportunity to point out the olive situation and by the time they brought them out, we were all just about done eating. I think I ate two. We got our check and obviously the soda wasn't on there but they still charged us for our olives and didn't do anything to make up for the fact that they serve flat drinks (after you ask for them a couple times) and bring out your appetizer when you're done eating. Everything we ate was good and if I remember correctly, there's at least one other location. If we try this place again (the food was good) then we will try another location in hopes of better service."}
{"text":"So we drove to this part of town (on our way in from Tucson) because I wanted to eat at Snooze... The wait at Snooze was 25 minutes but since Postino looked like it was open for brunch with no wait, we decided to try. Best decision ever! $5 mimosas and the food was fantastic. I eat paleo and easily found a fabulous breakfast called the farm scramble. So good!! Scalloped potatoes, onions and eggs scrambled together with a large side salad of spring mix, cherry tomatoes. and lightly dressed with vinaigrette. It was exactly like a meal I would have made at home. We are so happy we found this place. My husband LOVED his B.E.L.T (breakfast BLT)... Better than snooze (which I still adore but is for maybe less-healthy options)  we cannot wait to return to Postino Annex."}
{"text":"Amazing experience in every way! Granddaughter had chicken panini and when she was disappointed it wasn't warm, the manager not only had the sandwich remade, she made sure the cheese was melted for her. Grandson had turkey panini, daughter and I split the bruschetta and an incredible Hannah's Field salad. Our table host, Susan, was helpful, friendly, efficient and took great care of us. All of our meals were delicious and nit a crumb was left behind!  Wish there was a Postino in Charleston!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to go to for dinner and drinks when my friends are in town. I love that it's so close to the university because it gives it a different vibe than other Postinos. I love getting the board and bottle deal. My favorite bruschetta is the apple and fig one and I love the downtown red blend!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for brunch! When the wait is too long at Snooze, I always hop on over to Postino for a tasty breakfast instead. Of course it's a great place to go in the evening and share a bottle of wine with friends too."}
{"text":"I have been to all of the Postinos, and thought that I had seen their best side. I hadn't. The Postino Annex is big and less cramped than the other ones. This is a more, dare I say, European style of the Postinos own style and I totally buy it.   Postinos in general has grown out of its shell, and that might not necessary be a good thing. But if they keep progressing in this direction, I will keep supporting it. It has been said before - great location, big patio, sweet ambiance.   Postinos early weekday deals are awesome, and caters to the students that need something to eat before getting it on, and also to hard working people who just need an excuse to get out and break their diet early in the week. I thank Postinos for the increased chances in pursuing alcoholism, and also for a potential early onset diabetes."}
{"text":"All the postinos vibe,  just a little slow on service. The vibe is a bit different on the campus of ASU."}
{"text":"This is definitely One if my favorite spots, any time of the week. I usually get a board of bruschetta with the Brie apples and fig, bacon burrata arugula, prosciutto figs and mascarpone, and the salmon with pesto. I've never been disappointed here. The prosciutto and brie panini is to die for with the house made chips. It all comes together perfectly with a bottle of Perfekt Riesling and a salted caramel sundae. Perfection."}
{"text":"Yum! $5 beer buckets and wine before 5pm. How could you say no?  The bruschetta is really what we come here for - so many options and really fill you up - all for only $15.  We really loved the new almond hummus, the smoked salmon and pesto, and the buratta options. We got 2 of the artichoke bruschettas - I would reccomend passing.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good not great but the service was great! Jacqueline was perfect. If more companies had employees like her, they'd rake it in. I had the half and half and it was good. I'd return because the location/atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"I regularly go to Postino for lunch, happy hour, or dinner. It is a great place to get a coffee and study or meet up with friends for a drink after dinner. Postino is known for their bruschetta boards. With being allergic to yeast, I am unable to eat bread. However, they have a special off the menu substitute of tomatoes! Would not recommend for brunch."}
{"text":"This is practically on ASU's campus. Great location, and huge patio!! Almost 3 times the size of the Arcadia and Central locations.   Food is always great at Postino's and the staff made sure to live up to the Upwards Projects name, with fast food times and great service.   The atmosphere is once again repeated here, just like all of the other restaurants this group owns. It was a really fun night catching up with old friends, and we will definitiely be back if we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Postino Annex is a must if you are in the Phoenix area.  The atmosphere is perfect for a date night or girls night out.  The food is spectacular and extremely reasonable for the quality.  If you go in on Monday or Tuesday after 8pm, you can even get an entire bruschetta board and bottle of wine to yourself for $20.    I would highly recommend the bruschetta board.  My favorites are the salami with pesto and the sweet and spicy pepper jam!  This is definitely a crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"Not one to normally complain but this was just crap. We at the bar for 20 minutes while the bartender guy served everyone else but me and a bud.... new people sat down, we didn't get served still... ended up just taking off."}
{"text":"I came in to visit Andy and Jereme, in the past they have been beyond excellent servers. However this visit, they refused to adopt my kitten.... How could you refuse a kitten as a tip????? I am forever disappointed in them. And I hope they remember to kitty no tippy -Sara, Emma, Dom   Other than that Jereme is a very good looking model"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places to visit with my girlfriend. The bruschetta is a must and the overall vibe of the restaurant is very relaxed and hip."}
{"text":"I often come to Postino's, but the reason for the 1 star is because I came in yesterday and witnessed a hostess cursing at another hostess. It was so unprofessional! This is not the kind of environment I want my family to be around, so we left. Shame on the management for allowing their employee to act out this way in front of everyone."}
{"text":"Chose this place to accommodate my parents and my girlfriend's parents when we visited tempe and couldn't have been happier with how our visit went. We also had our dog with us so we sat on the patio.   Our group's wine cohort was pleased with the selections and the server's willingness to help guide their choices. As a beer drinker I was also pleased with their offerings.   For food, we had the cheese boards, various sandwiches, and salads. I really love this place for their salads and the toppings they have in them. Everyone was really happy with their food and the quality of service, which can get dodgy with such a large group. So kudos to postino and definitely check this place out if you're in tempe."}
{"text":"After returning a few times to Postino, I haven't been quite as impressed with the seasonal bruschetta & needed a little bit of a change from getting the same regular menu ones. I decided to try the Vegetarian Panini and am very impressed. It's probably my go to selection now for a while (without the olives) until I get back on my bruschetta kick!"}
{"text":"Sat at the inside/outside bar, stools were relatively comfortable, the concrete tabletop not so much.   Very warm and inviting atmosphere. Great, eclectic, music playing over the speakers, but not too loud that it was distracting.  Food was tasty and creative, but a little sloppily put together.   Staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Was finally able to try this place at ASU and loved it. The staff there were very hospitable...the host even fixed our wobbly table. And the ambiance outside was phenomenal especially coming into the fall weather.  My sister and our friend got the bottle and board special at $20 for a bruschetta board and a bottle of wine. We got 2 boards and 2 wines. It was a pretty good amount for 3 people. We had pushed to finish all of the bruschetta (fatties haha) but it was just so delicious... and we had a little bit of left over wine that we took home.  My favorite bruschetta was the salmon and pesto and the apple one...but all of the ones we got were delicious. I didn't know what to eat first. We got a Moscato d'asti (so freaking good...I probably had 2-3 glasses total and was feeling good after dinner lol).  Anyways..it was a great experience and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My brother and I were visiting from LA and decided to stop by postinos. The restaurant had a great vibe and good music playing. Christian was our server he gave us some of his favorite wine recommendations and we went with both the bruschetta and a bowl of the \"soup of the moment\" that he suggested. Everything was super delicious! We will be returning whenever we're back in town! Thank you for the great food and the great service!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and I really dug the chill vibe! Service was excellent and everything was reasonably priced. New favorite brunch spot!"}
{"text":"The bruschetta is delicious and they have a great variety. The Monday and Tuesday night bottle of wine and bruschetta board make it a great deal with a hip ambience.   Unfortunately our server was inattentive. We came to find out it was her last shift of the evening and we got a new server halfway through our meal. He was great. One less star because the music was a little too loud and the heater by us leaked propane so it smelled a bit, but got fixed soon after."}
{"text":"Bruschetta on point. Get the $14 selection of four bruschettas and marvel at how Postino's bruschetta surpasses all the others you've had.   I was visiting my roommate's hometown and her parents treated us to lunch here. There was a fun, lively ambiance and we got a nice table for our large group. We ordered a delicious variety of bruschettas and scarfed it all down. As someone who prefers savory, I obviously loved the salmon with capers and the salami with pesto. But I could not deny that the sweet options were also superb! Everyone loved the sweet brie and apple bruschetta.  Would love the chance to try more of the menu - maybe next time!"}
{"text":"One of my fav places to go lately.  Food is always good, atmosphere chill and friendly, and good selection of draft beers.  I like to just sit outside in the patio and eat some bruschetta. Just around the corner is the University and many neat modern buildings."}
{"text":"What is there NOT to long about postinos!? Everything from the wine to the servers are great! And how can I forget the bruschetta!?!  beautiful date night location or fun happy hour with the girls!"}
{"text":"This place is great, a definite favorite of mine.  Everything on the menu is delicious but it doesn't get any better than the bruschetta! Their $20 bruschetta and wine bottle deals are amazing, definitely check that out on Monday and Tuesday nights after 8pm.  Their Stagedive Pinot Noir is such a delicious wine and you can only get it there, so I stock up on those nights :)  Always clean, super friendly and fast wait staff, great decor, great outdoor and indoor seating options, child-friendly.  Sometimes the music is a bit loud but I'm an old grandma at heart so that might just be me.  The cucumber lemonade is particularly good, give that a try on a hot day.  Their brunch is also great."}
{"text":"If you are not a fan of delicious bruschetta than you may way to take your business elsewhere, but if you are a fan & 21+, the Monday/Tuesday deal is  perfect for you or for a cheap date. For only $20 you get a board of bruschetta (which has 4 well sized pieces) with a whole bottle of wine of your choosing. Great food, great prices, great environment"}
{"text":"Love this place, especially for HH! $5.00 glasses of wine & a massive flight of varied bruschetta for $15.00. Their bruschetta is by far the best I've had in PHX. I recommend the salmon and pesto or the apple & caramel. Their special is usually very good as well. Service has been fantastic most of the times I have frequented this location. Great outdoor patio."}
{"text":"This place has great food! Salads and paninis with a good brunch menu. Excellent service. The atmosphere is really enjoyable. I had lunch outside before a football game at ASU. I would highly recommend this place! I would come be coming back"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food, wine, and service was amazing!  All of the Bruschetta's are very good, you can't go wrong with them! The manager Jeremiah was awesome, he came and talked to our table to make sure everything was going good! Defiantly will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Difficult to assess because the food and wine is great (who doesn't love a bruschetta board?!) but the service is consistently poor. Overly casual service - often to the point where they're rolling their eyes as another table sits down. Our server disappeared while we were finishing our food and considering another drink & dessert. We saw our server stumble out of the restaurant and head home. 20 minutes later, a different server appeared and dropped the check - no communication whatsoever. This isn't the first time I've experienced forgetful service but it really does dampen the overall experience time and time again, regardless of how good the food deals might be."}
{"text":"A group of us met up here after work- the food was amazing. We got several Bruschetta boards, The Pub board (the pretzels are ridiculously good), and the Bounty (perfect for the vegan in the group)...it was all great. If you're lucky enough to get Sam as your server then your service will be top notch and she won't steer you wrong with her suggestions either.  Great food and stellar service!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to check out the new Tempe location of one of our favorite restaurants- Postino's! The location is awesome right by ASU's campus in an older but revamped building. We checked it out on Tuesday night so we took advantage of the $20 bruschetta and wine deal.  The food- held up to the Postino name and was delicious! We split a board and panini. The prosciutto and brie panini is one of my favorite things to order from here. We also tried the seasonal bruschetta which wasn't my favorite, but my girlfriend loved.   Service- We've noticed that the service at the other locations can be hit or miss especially when it gets busy. Our server Vivienne was so nice and recommended a wine for us that we hadn't tried yet. The place got pretty busy but she kept checking in on us and made sure we were happy campers. A few other servers came by too to make sure we were satisfied. Everything flowed really well.   Price- Uh hello $20 for a board and bottle. You honestly can't top that.   All in all, this location is off to a great start. If you're familiar with the other Postino's you'll love this addition. It's great when you leave a restaurant and the experience meets or even exceeds already high expectations. We'll definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Non traditional bruschetta and great ambience. Killer charcuterie tray."}
{"text":"It's no secret that I'm a big fan of Postino. I started eating at the Arcadia location 12 years ago, and I've been the duchess of Gilbert pretty much since it opened. Even though Postino is part of my weekly routine, I was still excited to check out Annex before a show at Gammage.   As expected of any Upward Projects restaurant, the interior and exterior are impeccable. I really loved sitting outside with a gorgeous view of A mountain. I also like the vibe of this Postino better than Gilbert. Very few children around. On the East side, you'll see infant carriers and strollers well into the night.  I'm happy to see they brought back a Furmint for the summer. Very delicious if you like sweeter whites, and it was only $24 which is just $4 more than happy hour prices. I had a few bites of my friend's Hannah's field salad which was great.  It was a very short and lovely walk through campus to get to Gammage, so I'm sure I'll be making Postino my preshow dinner choice quite often."}
{"text":"LOVED IT HERE. What a cool area and setting. Big booze menu. Try their sours. We had lunch, but I saw some delicious brunch plates. We had 4 different kinds of bruschetta- heaven. My fave was the goat cheese and red pepper. I had the Hannah salad; it was so fresh and funky. I also had the brie panini; I did the pick 2 option- great deal. The service was awesome! So friendly, but not like annoyingly attentive."}
{"text":"Sunday lunch was delicious and great attentive staff."}
{"text":"No, no.... I am not dreaming.... Postino Tempe (Postino Annex) is NOW OPEN! Only a few minute walk from my front door now lays before me the miracle of $5 Wine (or pitchers of Beer) until 5pm and the best Bruschetta in town. I'm a HUGE fan - dating back to when there was just Postino Arcadia - and all I can say is that Tempe residents just got LUCKY!! Built in the historic Art Annex Building surrounded by all things Tempe. LOVE.  Bruschetta. Panini. Soup. Salad. Cheese board. Meat board. Olives. Awesome.  Bruschetta: Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios (sweet) and Salami with Pesto or Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato (savory) but you honestly can't go wrong with any of them! Don't pass up the Seasonal either, it's always a winner. Postino is best enjoyed eating/sharing items off the menu for several hours in good company. Italian Picnic? It's an amazing salad - and you'll feel like you're having one...  They are all about their wine, so you can't pick a wrong one. Feeling frisky? Let them recommend one based on your preference. I've done it before and been pleasantly surprised. I wasn't a fan of Bordeaux - but I tried one per their recommendation and ended up loving it. Prost!  Postino service is always top notch. They just get it. You won't find yourself with just one server, there are multiple of them checking in on you consistently and the service is always flawless. I never feel rushed. The food is consistent and timely. Always.  Tonight I had the pleasure of dining on the patio. The weather is just starting to cool off and the patio is lovely. Lush and green, cozy and sweet. Whether at Arcadia, Central, Gilbert or Tempe - there is a shared feeling amongst them all - the spaces are comfortable and I can always guarantee a fabulous evening and meal. The music is never too loud, it's the perfect place for good company and great conversations. Yes - I live in Tempe. No - I am not a college student and haven't been for a long time. I've matured - and now, apparently, Tempe has too!  Polish off perfection with a Salted Caramel Sundae and there is no way you can leave without a smile. If this is for some reason a dream, please don't wake me..."}
{"text":"Just as DELISH as the other locations, and I think I've been to them all now! There's a parking garages nearby.   Can't go wrong with $20 Monday and Tuesday's! Includes a Bruschetta board + any bottle of wine after 8pm. They'll cork it for you to take home what you don't finish!"}
{"text":"My wife loves this place and now I totally get it.  I was hungry so when she described it I was a little worried.  Dainty European fair served in a trendy environment is not in my wheelhouse.  The food is beautify prepared and they have a great selection of beer and wine.  We split a meat board and a board with four bruchetta.  There was plenty of food and each of the bruchetta was different so there was quite a variety of flavors.  The service was less than outstanding, but all in all I enjoyed it and plan to go back."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour on a Friday afternoon...this is a great spot! A pitcher of craft beer for $7 - you can't beat it. Staff was friendly, atmosphere was chill, patio is a great if the weather permits, and the food is excellent. We had a bruschetta board to start - A+! I had a chicken mozzarella sandwich and it was outstanding. The bread was the perfect combo of soft and crunchy and the flavor of the sandwich was excellent. If you're looking for a spot to chill, whether on a date or with a big group, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"this is more a comment than a review--I love Postinos.  I live in a neighborhood where I can walk to one--I have to say that I like mine a lot better than the one in Tempe--I get it--I am not the target demographic for the Tempe location.  Nonetheless--the kinetic energy that is the service went from ---oh great service to leave us the f**** alone--Either put water pitchers on the table or put signs on the table that can be flipped--water no water--the amount of interruptions was overwhelming until you actually needed  something.  in addition to water being poured every three minutes, was the individual clearing of the little carafes for wine or a single fork or plate that wasn't used.  Individual pieces cleared every time a server came by.  If you want to turn the tables at break neck speed at this location just say so--and let me manage my time--tell me you want me to gone in 30 minutes--I get it--and will respectthat-the kinetic service was really disruptive to conversation and time with a good friend.  Will I be back?  Probably--but I am bringing signs the next time so I can clearly communicate when I need/want service and when I want to sit and enjoy my wine and the conversation at the table without constant interruption     On another note--as with the other Postinos--it is a great looking restaurant and the food is always enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with equally good food and drink. I highly recommend their Bruschetta board-the salmon with pesto is delicious!"}
{"text":"Relaxed, easy dining doesn't get any better than Postino Annex. The dim lighting and cool decor upon arrival makes you feel comfortable and almost mysterious. You're greeted by amazing servers EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Upward Projects does an amazing job at hiring the best servers that are not only enjoyable your first time, but your second and third and fourth, because they remember your name and become your friend. Evan, Julia, Anna and the rest of the gang are such a delight every time I go, I always feel like they're welcoming me home. Their Monday and Tuesday night deals are no secret so make sure you get there early (and possibly with a small party). They have wine for every pallet and their bruschetta is to die for. Personal favorites? Tomato Jam & Sheep's Milk Cheese, Pistachio, Date & Ricotta, and White Bean & Chopped Tomato. Something I've learned is to get the stronger tasting ones at night time and the sweeter tasting ones during the day. So no roasted red pepper and goat cheese (though drool-worthy) during the day for you! Their Argentinian white wine is perfect for newbies who just turned 21, and if you don't finish the bottle they cork it for ya and you can take it home! Also, make sure you sign up for their eposse on their website! Free entree for your next visit, and a guaranteed reservation & free dessert for your birthday! To top it all off, their music playlists are ALWAYS on point. Every. single. time. Postino Annex (and all Upward Projects restaurants for that matter) exude excellence and consistency - the dining experience absolutely cannot get better than this! *~lUv y@, P0$t!n0~*"}
{"text":"Happy hour is ok, small menu...   but if it's a sunny day don't expect to be accommodated by something as laborious as moving an umbrella 5ft.  My recommendation is La Boca.  They have impeccable service and amazing pizza, also a sangria that contends with anything from Spain.   This was our second choice after being completely ignored by the staff at postinos, which is apparently is so hipster/civil war reenactor, that they don't need to make money.   If we want to go to postinos, we'll make sure to wear our skinny jeans and guy-liner.  Prob get VIP."}
{"text":"The food was great. But on a sunday service was so slow. We were  their for over 2 hours for a party of two. The corn soup and garden salad was great. We both had the vegitarian sandwiches which was a bit messy but good. But service has.to get better before we go back."}
{"text":"The bruschetta never fails. I get it every time and it's so good! They have great coffee and the desserts are drool-worthy (creme brûlée is my favorite). Good selection of wines too. Atmosphere is hipster/upscale with great decor. Lighting is pretty dim, so it can be hard to see the menu. Love this place- would eat here every day if I could."}
{"text":"We celebrated our sons graduation from ASU at the restaurant yesterday evening. We had great service at the bar as we were waiting for our seats.  There was a mix up with our phone number so we didn't receive our notification when our seat became available.  Upon realizing that they were one digit off on our phone number and we're not able to reach use, the mgr and start went above and beyond to accommodate us. We were so appreciative of how they handled the situation.  The meal that we had was very good. The wait staff was very professional and very accommodating. The menu selection is very good and the value  and prices are very good.  When visiting Tempe in the future, this will definitely be on our list of restaurants to visit!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, super friendly service and excellent food. Came here with 3 adults and 3 kids. Everyone enjoyed their food. Server had a good understanding of the wine menu and made a great recommendation for me. Fun atmosphere sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"Ok, so I don't like to give 5 stars unless you've truly earned it... tonight... Postinos earned it! They are typically a well oiled machine and can get you great food and drink with -at minimum- good service. Tonight, they messed up on our app but they acknowledged it and comped it to us and then messed up the type of water we ordered (pretentious sounding? Yes. But we wanted sparkling water damnit)... and then they threw in a brunch item on them. I can't say that I've ever been so pleased with a restaurant's response to their mistakes. Rock on postinos! I will definitely be coming back and recommending. Well done, indeed!"}
{"text":"I have dined at this location too many times to count, I have no idea why I'm just now writing a review to express how incredible the service is every single time my friends and I come in! Every staff member is beyond friendly, helpful and genuinely caring in regards to guest experience. What I find myself most impressed by is the team work between the servers! They all help each other run food, and refill drinks and they do this with a smile and they seem extremely willing to be a support system for each other, I LOVE IT!  I want to take a second to comment on the bar tender from last night ANDY!!   The place was absolutely packed, we were quoted an hour and 15 minutes before we would be sat, my friend and I were standing near the bar waiting to be called, when Andy (whom by the way was beyond busy behind the bar) approached us to get us started on our wine bottle and offered to have the bottle transferred to our table once we are called (meaning he would not receive a tip for this gesture, he served us the wine just to be helpful and kind!). I noticed him constantly checking to make sure we were taken care of and happy as we waited for our table, I also noticed all smiles and laughs from the customers at his bar rail who seemed to love Andy just as much as we did. About 25 minutes later (just our luck) a spot cleared at Andy's rail before we were called for a table so we ended up being able to sit with Andy at the bar! YAY! He made our experience incredible, Suggested I try the salmon and pesto bruschetta, which is now my personally favorite! And made my friend and I laugh and have an awesome dinner!   ANDY IS AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"I love this place the food is great you feel that you are eating a clean decent meal, prices are affordable and the restaurants has a style and looks really nice. It feels so comfortable having a meal at this restaurant i loved the outdoor seating area but i didn't sit there because of the heat, would like to come back for an evening to sit outside."}
{"text":"It's overpriced for what you get.   Great for a group of small girls with no appetites to enjoy some wine and gossip in a swank atmosphere. The gluten free bread is great and I love the bruschetta combos.   To feed your 200lb man I would suggest you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My daughter and I dined here tonight around 5. We opted for the patio and I'm glad we did because it seemed very loud inside. We were served water before we even sat down! They were always filled too. She ordered half a tuna panini with a small salad and I ordered a chicken panini with the salad that comes on the side. We were both very pleased with our choices. We didn't order any wine but thought the food prices were on par. We can't wait to come back and order some bruschetta ! Service and food were both excellent!!! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today and loved it! I always walk by here and have been wanting to try this place but never did until now.   You can sit inside or outside. The outside is pretty cute with comfy couches and chairs if you have a big group or just plain tables and chairs too. There are hanging lights outside and candles inside. It is pretty dark inside.   The food is delicious! I got a bruschetta to share with one of my friends. It is $14.95 and a good size for two people. You can pick four different flavors. We tried the artichoke spread, tomato basil and mozzarella, apple and fig, and pesto with salami. They were all really good. I think my favorite one was the apple fig one but they honestly all were really good. We also got the salty caramel sundae dessert. That was good too.  I would definitely recommend this place to other people! It is a great place for date night, a girls night out, catching up with friends, etc."}
{"text":"Amazing spot for a romantic night or a cozy night with friends. The location is huge making wait times much less than other locations. I came here on a Friday night past happy hour was over, but still found the prices very reasonable.   I shared a bottle of prosecco, a bruschetta board, and the raspberry chicken salad. Everything was great. The best bruschetta for savory lovers were the white bean and also the artichoke dip.   Sign up for the email list and you can get a free board too! (Worth about 14 dollars)  Definitely will be coming back to this spot often!"}
{"text":"Great mini pitchers for $5 everyday before 5pm! Awesome deal. The Roast Beef sandwich was amazing, the Turkey & the Autostrada (better w/out the spicy pepper relish for me) were really good as well. All sandwiches were big enough to split for us, all yummy to share"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Thanks for all the Yelpers for the accurate reviews that drew us to this restaurant in the first place. Christian, our waiter confirmed that we needed to order the 4 for $12.50 Bruschetta board. We ordered the green apple and brie, prosciutto with fig, salmon and capers plus the burata and bacon. Our waiter had the chef cut each into 4 bites so that our party of 4 could sample the rainbow. Chef also ordered the bruschetta from most subtle to the most robust flavors. It was divine. The green apple and brie was flavorful and refreshing, delivering a nice zip and creaminess. Next, the prosciutto and fig was sweet and salty. The salmon was topped with salty-sour capers and finely chopped purple onion. Finally, the burata and bacon was amazing with finely chopped crispy bacon and tomatoes.   We also ordered the chicken and mozzarella panini on ciabatta bread with chips, and the 9 Iron on foccacia with salad. Wow, the paninis are also delicious. Chef cut the sandwiches and plated them in halves for the 4 of us. The chicken and mozzie was good, but not as great as the Nine Iron. The combination of meats and sauces was perfect with the toasted foccacia. We also loved the salad delicately dressed served with toasted pine nuts. The homemade wavy fries were good with the spicy mayo dip which Christian kindly brought out.  We were nicely satisfied with the amount of food we ordered. All this for under $45 including tip. We were all sorry that my husband did not join us this meal and are determined to introduce him to the Postino experience. Thank you Christian and the Postino Annex team."}
{"text":"Coffee tasted a tiny bit burned and some of the food, the eggs in particlar, lacked flavor in comparison to other parts of the dish. We split the scramble and the B.E L.T. sandwich. The sandwich tasted better than the scramble due to the deliciously perfect bacon and the bread was soft and warm but the eggs tasted bland and boring. The salad that accompanied the scramble was better due to the dressing but overall the food was mediocre.  Not up to par with their Bruschetta they have during dinner and lunch but there is potential."}
{"text":"Let me preface this very long review with the fact that I generally love Postino. I have been to the Gilbert location several times and the Tempe location a couple times. I am familiar with their wait times and their general practices.   That said, I recently had the worst restaurant experience I have had in a long time. I was meeting three of my friends and got to the location about ten minutes early (at 6:20) to get my place in line for the wait - asked for five people since I thought someone was bringing a plus one. I was told there would be a 30-45 minute wait simply because they were limited in booths that could fit five people. When my friend got there about ten minutes later she changed my reservation to four people, thinking it would take less time (and because she wasn't bringing a plus one). We waited until 7:15 to get seated - and watched as literally everyone else (including others that we thought were there after us) got seated before us. Not a single other group was waiting by the time we got seated. To do the math - this was an hour wait, nearly double what we were told.   We were finally seated at one of the booths reserved for five people. Our waitress came promptly and took our drink order. She ask if we were ready to order and we needed one more minute (arguing over types of bruschetta - which we should have done over the hour wait lol). She told us she would bring our drinks right back and we can order then.   We waited and watched our waitress walk by at least three or four times, going to other tables. We watched the bartender stand there looking at a clipboard doing nothing. Finally ten minutes later (no exaggeration) we watched our waitress walk over to the computer system and put in our drinks. By the time the bartender made them, it was a good 15 minutes or so later.... and someone else was assigned to bring our drinks. So there was no putting in an order as the waitress had suggested. We waited a while longer and she finally came around to put in our order. We had been waiting an awful lot at this point.  Order 1: Bruschetta (all meat ones), two cups of soup. Order 2: Bruschetta (all vegetarian), one cup of soup. Order 3: Panini   So quite a bit later the all meat bruschetta comes out with one single cup of soup - slightly confusing based on our order. We never got water refills the entire time. Over several minutes this was eaten entirely while we were (you guessed it) waiting for anyone else's food to arrive. I had been watching to see who the manager was because I was planning on asking for him/her just to explain our situation at this point (I never do this).   The man I perceived to be the manager (bald head, dark beard) finally walked up with two cups of soup. We were worried that perhaps they forgot to put in the other orders or they got mixed up. My friend asked as he was giving us the soup (in a very nice tone might I add - my friend was not rude at all) if we also had a bruschetta board and panini. THE MANAGER LITERALLY SAID: It's up in the window - I only have two hands. The way he said 'I only have two hands' literally hit me the wrong way. It was rude, uncalled for, and just plain terrible customer service. I decided not to speak with him. It was the straw that broke the camel's back.   The waitress took a long time to get our checks, a box, and take the check, and then some other random person brought it back for us. On the way out, the manager and hostess were standing at the entrance. Neither of them said 'have a good night' until my friend said it first (again he was not rude at all).   I will not be going back to Postino Tempe again. Worst customer service I have EVER received and I would expect much better from a manager. I'm pretty sure I could go to Denny's and be treated better. Like I am seriously so pissed I am not going there ever again.   TWO STARS ONLY BECAUSE THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS AS USUAL."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome!!! You won't be disappointed!!!! Went on a Saturday night!! Great service for being so busy. The server Vivian was amazing!! Very helpful, brought us samples of wines we asked about. Ordered the nine iron panini and the bruschetta with salmon, salami, bacon, and tomato/ mozzarella. Everything was so good!!! Will be back!!! Relaxing outdoor seating area right in middle of ASU, great atmosphere!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the place that I recommend to all my out-of-town friends who visit Tempe. The happy hour is amazing. Their wine list is always solid and their food is delicious. Their patio is very comfy and dog-friendly so I bring my pup there all the time. I hosted a large dinner there recently and the servers and managers were beyond accommodating, professional, and friendly, from beginning to end."}
{"text":"We went to Postino on a recommendation of a friend for drinks and a couple appetizers.  Great beer and wine selection.  Food was fantastic!  We had the bruschetta and a panini.    The bruschetta is not your typical diced tomatoes toppings.  They give you four breads and you can get a different topping on each one!   Variety was great for us- a table of four.  We all got to have a taste of everyone's pick.    This should be a 4.5 rating.  The problem is we didn't get a drink for nearly 20 minutes after being sat.  We think the hostess screwed up because we never got silverware and the only way we got service was when a person came by to refill our waters, we let her know we haven't been attended to yet.  She was very apologetic and the experience was flawless from that point forward."}
{"text":"Great place in a nice district.  I had a glass of syrah-merlot to go witj a set of Bruschetas. Well i repeated it twice since we were sharing it. I lovestje salmon one and the buffala one.  I went also for a tiramisu dessert which was really great and tasty.  Unfortunately no expresso to end all of this but i learnt about the French press cOffee...  And great bartender tOo!"}
{"text":"I love this location because it's so spacious... Which is great especially on their busy Monday and Tuesday nights (they offer a bottle and a plank of bruschetta for $20).    All of the bruschetta is amazing but I would recommend the Brie, apple & fig; the bacon burrata; and the salami & pesto.  We usually make the planks our meal because they're pretty heavy. If you have a big group, definitely check out the butcher's board -- they have a heavenly selection on cheeses.  I'm not the biggest fan of their brunch since there's not a huge selection but overall it is tasty.   I would say 4 out of 5 times the service is amazing (I'm talking about Randy) -- however, I have had a few servers who weren't that friendly (I expect that a few times it was because they were under staffed).  Overall, I put up with the sometimes shaky service because the ambiance is on point and the plank and wine deal is killer. Check it out if you're in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Cool ambiance with some good music playing in the background perfect for small groups or weekend drinks. The half sandwich and salad were perfect for a lunch portion and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful business meeting.  Food was great and Hanna our server was wonderful."}
{"text":"The bottle and board deal is the best! Every Monday and Tuesday night from 8pm to close get a bruschetta board and any bottle of wine for $20. Best deal in town!"}
{"text":"I was already a big Postino fan when I found out this location was opening. I was beyond happy. Close to my friends, my alma mater, and a great excuse to visit my old ASU campus (which has changed so much!).  The place is 50-50 in terms of indoor/outdoor seating which is nice in the cooler months but can be a bit harsh in the summer.  That said, it doesn't take away the amazing service, delicious food and great selection of wine. I love the $20 wine & bruschetta specials they have Monday and Tuesday nights. SO yummy!  My advice is, get there early so you can get a spot otherwise it can get pretty full and your wait will be long! Overall, amazing place."}
{"text":"Best brunch in the Phoenix Metro Area - food is excellent! Christian is the best server/bartender. He makes a great iced coffee, and won't forget your Sriracha sauce!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it has failed to disappoint. Love their bruschetta boards, and $5 for a glass of wine or pitcher of beer during happy hour is such a deal. Their service is awesome and they definitely make sure to take care of you or help out if you have any questions."}
{"text":"Not many meat options but the Bruschetta Flight was very tastey! I did the Apple Brie, Roasted Pepper one, Tomato Basil, Artichoke. Tomato Basil and Apple Brie were quickly finished."}
{"text":"We didn't realize the limitations of the menu till we were seated. It's a cute spot next to ASU and seems great for drinks. I ordered the vegetarian panini, which had white bean hummus with avocado, cashews, cucumbers, roasted yellow tomatoes, goat cheese, olives, greens. Those are all wonderful items just none of them stood out to give it a kick. But it was a big portion that came with potato chips, definitely filling!"}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere and fantastic food. Try the fabulous bruschetta menu - can't go wring!"}
{"text":"WOW! This place is packed on a Monday! Make sure to get here early or make a reservation, but you cannot beat their $20 plate of bruschetta and bottle of wine! Nick was a fantastic server! I will definitely be returning because of his amazing service!"}
{"text":"Great, casual, hip vibe. Love the large open patio, perfect for our AZ weather. I usually go to the Gilbert location, but met some family here. It was such a great dinner, good food, decent service (4 stars). The gluten free bread for brushcetta and sandwiches is a huge plus! The salads are always amazing. Love Postino!"}
{"text":"Great date night place in funky atmosphere.  I can see why Postino's is popular: it's trendy, it's close to ASU, and it's just plain cool.  There is plenty of outdoor seating and the inside is decked out in brick and dark woods, contributing to the hipster feel.  While I wasn't blown away by the service -- our server was definitely NOT effusive -- I thoroughly enjoyed my bruschetta board and wine.  For our bruschetta options, my other half and I selected the brie and apple (SO GOOD), tomato/mozza/basil, roasted artichoke, and roasted tomato and goat cheese.  All were lovely and large enough to satiate both of our appetites.  We arrived just after happy hour ended (next time, we will be on time for HH) and noticed it wasn't too crowded.  The hostess seated us in a booth and we lingered over our food while people watching and pretending to be young and hip.  ;)"}
{"text":"I come here about once every 1-2 weeks, because really, how could you not? Every time I go, I get a bruschetta board AND on Mondays/Tuesdays you can get a board and bottle for just $20. Crazy.   Every time one of my friends comes to visit, I bring them here. It is just so relaxed and laid back, everyone always loves it. The service can sometimes suck, but it is typically super busy so you have to take that into account. I also wish they would take reservations because if you want to bring a bigger party in for food, the wait can sometimes be a 2 hour minimum - and when you have bruschetta on your mind, waiting that long is unbearable.   (All of the 14 bruschetta flavors are AMAZING but if I had to pick my top 3 it'd be the pesto with salmon, spinach artichoke & goat cheese and jam.) (I also love the mozzarella sandwich and the chicken raspberry salad; both so good.)"}
{"text":"There was a time where Postino Arcadia was my favorite location but after my visit to the Annex, I'm afraid Arcadia no longer holds top spot in my heart. Granted their Arcadia location is super cozy and your neighbors can be up close and personal, the Annex location has a lot of space but still retains a certain character that's unique to it's location. I love they have a large patio area, and the inside has large booths for big groups, add the long bar which is accessible to the inside and patio, makes wine drinking and bruschetta boards noshing far more enjoyable. It would have been a nice touch if there were fire pits outside when it gets far cooler to be on the patio but the candle pits are aesthetically appealing too.   I like to commend our main server Nick, he was pleasant and took the time to assist my friend's allergies with nuts and citrus. He's top notch, and an asset to the Postino Annex staff. I think there are new additions to the bruschetta such as the Salami with Pesto which was oh so scrumptious, the pesto on the MJ bread hit the spot! Overall, love the new addition to the Postino family, and looking forward to enjoying wine sips under the tea-lights at the Annex. :)"}
{"text":"Had a very nice \"grazing\" meal here with friends while on a business trip to the area last week. Everything we had was good -- Bruschetta, Butcher's Block (meats and cheeses), and The Bounty (grilled vegetables, etc.). All very good for sharing. Would be nice to see a few pasta dishes on the menu for people looking for something a bit more substantial. I think that could raise this to a five-star place if the pastas were executed as well as everything we had."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and some of the best service I've ever experienced. I highly recommend their bruschetta and just going with their suggestions (even if it sounds like you won't like it, everything is delicious). Happy hour is every day until 5, $5 for a pitcher or a glass of wine. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Have loved all the Postino's locations and was so happy to get one close to home. Been to this location now a couple of times now, our most recent visit was different. Food and service were, as always, top notch. However, unlike the other locations this new one has a rather unprotected patio when it comes to protecting its staff from the sun and heat. They seemed over heated and each time several of them would walk past, even seated inside, we would get face-fulls of body odor. I hope the restaurant does something to help the poor staff."}
{"text":"Believe the good ratings and reviews on Postino's. The Bruschettas are simply amazing - my favorite has to be the smoked salmon and pesto. I've been to this location and the one in Gilbert and I would have to say that this location is my favorite.  I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning to meet up with some people a little after nine. They arrived before me and apparently most, if not all of the patio seating outside had already been taken. If that doesn't speak for how popular Postino's is then I'm not sure what does. They have a good food list for brunch as well - ordered the Country Toast which was excellent with portions bigger than expected. As for their wines they are simply stellar. You can tell that they have an extensive tried and tested wine list and it definitely shows.  The service here is really good. The people working here are very friendly and helpful willing to give you suggestions on what to try. I really enjoy every visit to Postino's and I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal, and the service was great!  The menu was very creative, and the outdoor seating was fantastic for people watching.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not from the area (I'm from Dallas), but before I visited I made sure to bookmark some spots I would like to hang out. This one was one of the places I bookmarked.   We went there on a Sunday night. Sat down at the bar, and we were immediately taken care of. We ordered wine by the bottle and not by the glass because in the long run it would be cheaper that way.   Ended up drinking pinot grigio while we were there. The bartender let us taste other samples of wine to see if we liked anything else which was nice of him. Wasn't really a fan of the other wine we drank, so stuck with what we knew.   It wasn't incredibly expensive. Normal wine bar pricing. Good selection of appetizers and small plates. If we weren't full from the food we had earlier, I know we would have tried some. I kind of wish we were hungry so I would have gotten a chance.   Free WiFi here is a plus. It was also nice that the bartender charged my girlfriend's phone behind the bar since they don't have plugs out in the open.   We were told there wasn't really a place in the area with a better environment. That is a true statement. We went to a few other bars down the way a bit later, and those crowds were all 21 year olds. This crowd was more my speed.   I really liked this place, and if I ever come back to the area I'll check it out again (or one it the other locations)."}
{"text":"Got the $5 Victoria Pilsner pitcher during happy hour with a coworker. Definitely not a disappointment!  Sat outside; nice busy ambience; right off ASU campus  Bruschetta bread was baked perfectly; soft in the middle with the right amount of crisp on the crust.  I enjoyed all my bruschetta toppings; -pistachio and dates -smoked salmon and pesto -prosciutto and figs -tomato and goat cheese"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch/happy hour spot. I dream about the artichoke bruschetta. My favorite salad went away a while ago (Italian picnic) but the Brussels sprout salad and the nicoise (served deconstructed so you can make your own perfect bite) totally make up for it. The grilled cheese is also yummy. The beer and wine lists are good and glasses of wine and pitchers (just under two pints) are $5 before 5:00. They don't advertise it but you can get a half order of almost anything (not the nicoise). I usually  get a half salad and a single bruschetta (or two). They also have nightly specials like a bottle and board for $20. The servers can be a bit aloof sometimes and waits at peak times are long but those are the only downsides."}
{"text":"Best wine bar in town.  This place is there largest and most profitable location and our had only been open 3 months."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to splurge and spend a little bit extra on an incredible meal. While they have a couple of locations around the valley, I've found this one to be my favorite for a variety of reasons.   The ambiance is great for a small intimate group or a large group of friends. They have indoor and outdoor seating that is modern and stylish, allowing you feel as if you are at home whole dining.   The customer service is top notch. Everyone is incredibly nice and you'll always feel like you're being taken care of.   The food. The food, oh my, best part about it. My regular is a bruschetta board, which you can customize to your heart's desire. Each bruschetta board comes with four choices. I love love love the ricotta with dates and pistachios and the almond hummus with chopped tomato. Those are my two staple choices and I usually rotate the other two. Pro tip: add some pesto if you get the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil. It elevates it tremendously.   While this place can be on the pricier side, the food is made to order and you can taste the freshness. They create the coolest flavor combinations. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Usual Postino cool vibe.. good happy hour and consistent with other locations. Too hot for patio right now but look forward to spending time there in future. Also hope parking is as available once school starts again. It was perfect last week ( July )!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had brunch here yesterday and had an amazing experience. We were visiting Tempe for a music festival and I'm so disappointed that there are no Postinos in California.   I ordered their mimosa and french toast, which was delicious. My boyfriend got the plate of 4 bruschetta: smoked salmon, salami, tomato mozzarella, and BLT. After seeing his plate, I kind of regretted my decision of getting breakfast instead of lunch, but at least he shared. I even ended up ordering one extra BLT bruschetta--so good!  My friends and boyfriend shared a few pitchers of beer, which comes with enough beer for 2 glasses (I assume around 32 oz). All pitchers of beer and wine are $5 before 5 pm! We were very impressed with their drink specials and their yummy food. We probably would have come back here if we stayed another day in Arizona!"}
{"text":"ALWAYS A TREAT to be on the ASU campus...  The Postino Annex serves a TASTY lunch, prior to the SUN DEVIL Women's Softball playoff game.   Questions ?"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to come when I visit home!! You can't beat the wine deals either :)"}
{"text":"Happily enjoyed every bite and the atmosphere here. The waitress was a WINNER with a great attitude and enthusiasm. You can never go wrong with that in hospitality :)"}
{"text":"Such an amazing location, ambiance, selection, service and the patio specifically was just incredibly pleasant. Happen to get there in time for an awesome happy hour, think it was $5 for a glass of prosecco. Must go!"}
{"text":"As I'm sure all other reviews state, their Bruschetta is amazing.  Their large variety of Bruschetta and Wine is basically want makes this place what it is.  I've been to other restaurants with similar concepts, and the food just isn't the same.  In terms of this particular location, I'm not a huge fan.  Other locations around the valley, especially Gilbert, provide a different type of ambiance that I really enjoy and find unique.  The service wasn't great either.  We had to ask for water refills, which I hate since I feel like the servers should be attentive enough to their own tables.  But then again the water glasses are a bit on the smaller side so I can't judge too hard on that.  We were only checked up on when we called our server over for water refills.  Typically I feel like servers tend to check up on you within 10 minutes of you receiving your food, but I want to say this time it was a good 25-30 minutes before we had any attention from anyone at our table. My boyfriend enjoyed the romantic setting on a Saturday night but he told me he would never come back.  He is a big meat and potatoes kind of eater so the small bites of bruschetta and cheese just wasn't his thing.  And to tackle on the pricing made him convinced that we would never come back.   I would definitely come back with my girlfriends on a weekday afternoon and take advantage of their happy hour deals.  But other than that, I don't see myself returning on a weekend evening ."}
{"text":"Awesome Saturday brunch on many accounts:  1.  Service.  They use a group approach.  All servers are friendly and any one of them can help you.  As a result, no request is too small, and water glasses were full the whole time.  2.  Food.  They totally adapted to my lactose free requests.  I had the most delicious light breakfast of nicely seasoned egg whites, sautéed a la dente asparagus, and toasted focaccia.  Magnifique!  3.  Location.  Beautiful outdoor seating in heart of ASU.  Also, the wait at Squeeze next door was 60 minutes.  No wait here!  4.  Price. My aforementioned focaccia sandwich was only $9!"}
{"text":"Loved the wine bar desert casual vibe of this place. We sat in the booths in the middle. Service was wonderful, as multiple people came by to serve water, pick-up plates and check on us. Their gluten-free bread for the bruschetta was fluffy and soft. I was so happy with eating four different options. Two sweet, included dates and pistachios, then apples, honey and fig jam. The savory ones I enjoyed were roasted peppers and bacon and  arugula. All came with a cheese spread but can't remember them all!  My husband and I were headed back to CA from our anniversary road trip, so we dressed up and went out here! They gave a creme brûlée  on the house wishing us a Happy Anniversary!  We had already had champagne earlier so we didn't enjoy their wine selection. This is a must go to now when I'll be back in town."}
{"text":"Loved it! Paige was a great server!!!!  She's awesome.  The food was also excellent. The wine was also wonderful."}
{"text":"It honestly makes me sad to give this place a low rating because the food is actually pretty darn good.  It's the service that makes it impossible to give it anything higher.  Normally if a place has a strong food presence with meh service I'll do a three star but the service here was just terrible.  It took over 30 minutes just to get our waiter to take our order, we constantly had to ask for water, our beer never came so we finally just cancelled it.  The kids food came out at the same time as the entrees even though we requested that come out first, AND we had to walk to hand our bill to our waiter to pay after he walked by us multiple times without taking it (between 5-10min).  The best thing to eat was definitely the bruschetta but I personally still prefer la bocca to here for that.  The only thing better about the bruschetta here was the bread wasn't hard which I like.  My panini was a little bland and the chicken was a little dry, but the Brussel sprout salad was delightful.  Very light and full of summery flavors. Again, overall the food was decent but the service will definitely keep me from going back."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Unbeatable happy hour need I say more?  A pint of beer for $5, or wine by the glass for 5...!! But the real star is the food. The butchers block is on of the best charcuterie boards I have had. The bruschetta- amazing. The salads- on freaking point. And the ambiance is hip, Italian hipster wine bar style.... I LOVED this place and will be back."}
{"text":"Postino is definitely a crowd pleaser for anyone who dines there. Whenever I have a friend or relative visiting, Postino's is a must every trip. You can't go wrong with a board of delicious bruschetta or a panini/salad combo. My go to bruschetta board normally consists of 2 pieces of the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, 1 warm artichoke spread, and 1 smoked salmon with pesto.   On Monday and Tuesday nights starting at 8PM they have a bottle and board deal, which is where you get a bottle of wine and a board of 4 pieces of bruschetta for $20. It doesn't get much better than that for girls night or date night.   And lets not forget their brunch on Saturday's and Sunday's, which is my Mom's favorite spot. Some favorite entrees of ours are the Morning Staple, Grilled Focaccia, or Ciabatta French Toast. I also suggest it's not a bad idea to have a little desert with your breakfast, and try a refreshing peach bellini. (:   The outdoor patio and atmosphere tops just about any restaurant in the area. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food: Get their Bruschetta! You can select four different bruschettas for 14$ and you get to try various flavors. The foods never disappointing at Postinos, the food always taste fresh. The best part about Postinos is their rocking happy hour. Where else can you get a 5$ pitcher (yes I said pitcher not pint) of kilt lifter in the valley!!  Location: I have been to this location as well as their Gilbert location. I must say that their standards are followed very well from restaurant to restaurant. The ambiance at either location is so relaxed and genuinely unique. This is a great date location!  Service: The service is ALWAYS great. The serves all seem so well trained and seem to really enjoy their job, which I think speaks volumes about a company."}
{"text":"Well nice place for wines. Specially the Monday Tuesday deals are good. I believe they can expand the food options that would b great."}
{"text":"Amazing patio. All Postinos are great really and this one is really close to ASU so your crowd is all over the place which is awesome. Really good beer in tap at this location. Suggest the Collete beer!"}
{"text":"Went Monday nite. Packed but got lucky and found 2 seats at the bar. Would recommend reserve seating (possible?) if you go on a Monday or Tuesday. We got the Monday special $20 for bottle of wine and bruschetta board. Food was very good. Bread delish. Wine was just ok but cannot beat the price. Service was excellent. Fun atmosphere, loud but could be romantic. Would most definitely go back if given the chance. Visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"This is a great wine bar.   They just opened up this location in Tempe.  There's lots of seating and this is a great place to drink and eat in small or large groups.  The food is fun to share with a group of friends.   I def recommend this trendy joint."}
{"text":"First off, you can't beat the Postino happy hour - $5 glasses of wine and pitchers until 5pm each day!  Amazing space with an expansive pet friendly patio in Tempe...and great service too!  I highly recommend trying a cheese or meat board and/or bruschetta...you won't be disappointed.  This will certainly become one of our favorite places to relax the afternoon away."}
{"text":"Got Brussels sprout salad and iron! And it was great love the freshness! The cider is amazing! He atmosphere is great here! Perfect spot for hanging out with friends and having dinner"}
{"text":"Postino Annex is a winecafe near ASU, and one of a few Postino restaurants in the Phoenix area. What is a wine café or winecafe anyway? I Googled \"winecafe,\" but I'm still not sure. Postino does serve wine, cheese boards, bruschetta, paninis, and some other odds and ends.  Our server probably captured the \"cool-without-trying\" vibe of the restaurant best: She was first to every punchline, wore a strong perfume and sweet dress, and wrapped her notebook around her wrist with a rubber band.  The food had its roses and thorns. The caprese starter was nontraditional. Called \"mozzarella and tomatoes\" on the menu, it was covered in a basil herb dressing that was fine, but had me wondering if I could have substituted in balsamic. The cheese and tomatoes themselves were top notch.  The bruschetta tasted great, but the toppings were overwhelming. Expect these slices of bread to be loaded with things you absolutely love, or spend the rest of your meal wondering what other mistakes you've made in life.  The cheese board was never (wasn't ever?) explained. Sigh, maybe there isn't a personal story about who milked what cow on what day behind every bite of dairy I eat.   If you're vegetarian, I'd recommend the vegetarian panini and accompanying salad. The cashews were a nice touch.  I struggle to categorize Postino Annex. Is it great Italian? Not really. Is it great café food? Kind of. Everything felt like an appetizer. What do you call that kind of restaurant? An Italian-American take on tapas restaurants? I guess \"winecafe\" will do for now. This is the kind of restaurant I'd come back to with friends looking to hang out and have an affordable glass of wine during happy hour."}
{"text":"Manager is working to make amends from my last visit....I will update after my next visit. He apologized profusely."}
{"text":"Truly the best service I have gotten in a restaurant in a long time! Patrick was our server and was absolutely outstanding!! He was on it the whole night and was so personable! The manager, Brandon, continued our excellent experience with such great conversation and making sure we were happy!"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar with my girls last time I came in.  Our bartender was a man.  He was great.  He was fun and great service.  We had such a blast and the boards were amazing.  I will def be coming to this location and sitting at the bar more often.  I use to go to Scottsdale location but I prefer to come to Tempe now and sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Amazing! Love the bruschetta! The seasonal offering is always fun and delicious!! The soup of the day was red pepper and Gouda, sooo good!! This is the perfect place for a light meal that also fills you up! I can't come here enough!"}
{"text":"Oh Postino's how I have missed you!   I remember when I first went to thier original location with my good friend Tyler. Such a quaint location, with a great story and wonderful food. There was live trumpet music and a DJ in the background & I knew I would keep coming back.  Which I did, until parking and getting a seat became very very difficult due to the popularity of the restaurant.  I continued to go, of course, but much less frequently.    Fast forward several years...My husband and I were gearing up and getting ready to go on a date for brunch.  I turned to my trusty YELP and saw they have several locations, 2 of which are close to my home and we chose this one for our Sunday Funday Brunch Date.   It is a lovely location. I am an early bird so there was plenty of parking on the street, however I can see this being a little more complicated for dinner on a date night.   We were greeted immediately and seated just were my hubby wanted, a spot inside with a nice view of the outside.  They have these garage doors that can close in the hot weather but allow you to see thier patio. We decided to forego the traditional brunch fare and ordered thier bruschetta and some beer.  Our waiter was so very well versed on beers we spoke to him for a while about thier selection.  We ended up having a fabulous seasonal beer that had a wonderful toasted flavor due to the way it was made and our waiter filled us in on this process. The food was beautiful, fresh, amazing and made with superb ingredients. I love to order my favorites and leave space for the seasonal offering. The seasonal option had lots of mushroom and truffle oil...it was delish. The mushrooms were almost meaty in flavor and consisteny.  We also shared a bacon burrata which I didn't recall having before and I was amazing. It had arugula, which imparted a very fresh flavor, the creaminess of the burrata was a nice contrast in texture to the crispy bacon bits which were plentiful on the bruschetta.    I can't wait to go back and try some more food, beer and wine. =)"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place.  The food is great and the atmosphere is great.  The service has always been top notch.  Love to share a bruschetta board and a cup of amazing soup and a bottle of wine.  Great for lunch or dinner, but be prepared because this place is popular and can have a wait.  Also, they do not validate if you have to park in the parking garage next door."}
{"text":"I'm here every Tuesday for the $20 bottle of wine and bruschetta. Hands down the best bruschetta around. Top favorite is the red pepper and goat cheese. Also came here for valentines day to grab dessert to split with my boyfriend. We should have each gotten one, don't share dessert it's so yummy!"}
{"text":"I was here with my son last Sunday for a late lunch as we were getting ready to tour the ASU campus the following day.  The sandwiches were great and the $5 pitchers of micro-brew beer for happy hour (starting at 3pm) made it even better. But the best part of all was the outstanding service, our water was constantly being refilled and there were periodic checks by staff to see that everything was ok.  If I could give them 6 stars I would.  We are from Riverside, CA and will definitely stop here again when we come into town."}
{"text":"I love postinos! Wine and board nights are $20 and you can never go wrong with that, the employees are also super awesome. Louisa made sure we got To our table within the time she told us and was awesome to talk too. The bartenders are also very quick with service and have great personalities, thanks Bruno and Louisa! Also, the red pepper Gouda soup is unreal, and the warm artichoke spread."}
{"text":"The location is really great for students and the building has a great ambiance. Mimosa's are $5 all day & before 5 pm all glasses of wine are $5 as well. I had a panini that was delicious! Our server Paige was also very attentive and personable."}
{"text":"The last couple of times I've been here it has been great! Although before the bruschetta bread was a bit hard, it has been excellent recently. Great spot for drinks and food before 5. $5 pitchers."}
{"text":"I found Postino on Yelp and it lives up to the excellent reviews!  $5 wine and beer before 5pm.  The bruschetta is fresh and delicious!  But my favorite is the raspberry chicken salad recommended by Emily.  Emily was an outstanding server and really on top of checking in with me and making sure I had everything I needed.  I live in So Cal but come to Phoenix for work.  And Postino reminded me of my local hang outs in Newport.  I will make this my home base every time!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Yes. Yesssss. Yes! This place makes my heart happy, and it's literally a short walk from campus. I love coming here and getting the sandwich and soup or salad with a glass of wine! They have this quinoa and apricot salad that is my go to as well as the tuna sandwich, which is not your typical tuna Sammy!   Shout out to the bartenders who are uber cute and nice to have a chat with too!"}
{"text":"This has some of the best bruschetta I have ever eaten. We went on a Tuesday night, and had a deal for wine and bruschetta. It was a perfect girls' night."}
{"text":"Just as good as the other Postino locations. And less crowded... for now.  I love to catch up with friends at this place. Brunch or lunch are both great. They have a soup and salad deal where both portions are the perfect amount. Or sharing a bruschetta plate and some wine is another option. I haven't had a bad thing there, including all the wines I have tried - they're all stellar choices.  The only thing I worry about is with the huge success of the other two postinos, that this place might become as crowded and jam packed as the other two. Not allowing reservations and waiting forever for seats just kills my wanting to go, so I hope this doesn't happen. But I doubt crossing my fingers will help."}
{"text":"What a dinner, great booze and service. Thanks Megan! Had the roast beef with salad. Made me think about life. Where I'm headed. Good stuff. Anyways, get wine drunk and make questionable decisions."}
{"text":"Ended up here since snooze am had and hr wait... limited brunch menu options with out a full bar was dissappointing. Also note to the staff there is a reason a 4 top table is for 4 people not 5. Was disappointed in the seating arrangements..."}
{"text":"best restaurant in the world hands down. great food, good prices, great service. you can tell they really are a team and they love working together. ive been to three seperate locations and i have always had the best experience."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to try this place out for her birthday so 6 of us went on a brunch adventure at Postinos.   We went on a Sunday which means all the metered parking is free and it's not too crowded. They offer $5 pitchers of beer on tap and the beer selection is great until 5. With one pitcher, 3 of us all had a delicious milk stout. They also have cheap glasses of wine and a great list.  We decided to sample different boards of the bruschetta and meat/cheese boards. Out of all the bruschetta we tried, my favorite was the salmon. The salmon was so fresh and the flavors popped. The goat cheese on the meat.cheese board was absolute perfection. Great for sharing and the price is great if you are sharing too. If you are not sharing then the prices can be a little on the expensive side  This is a great place to catch up with the girls or just a nice place to hang. Grab a glass and stay classy."}
{"text":"Postinos is known for their bottles of wine and bruschetta boards. On Tuesdays you can get a bottle of wine and a board of 4 bruschetta' for $20. Weekdays before 5pm wine glasses are only $5! The menu is very small. A few options of panini's that are more like sandwiches instead of an actual panini. I'm not very impressed with those. However; their salads are very good and the tomato soup has little pieces of pasta and it is very, very tasty! For bruschetta... There's probably 10 different creative options and they are each cut into 4 small pieces, so the board of bruschetta is great for sharing. My favorite is the artichoke spread! Usually a long wait. I wouldn't go here starving, but definitely hungry enough to munch of bruschetta with your wine! This location is walking distance to the bars on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"So glad we found this place while visiting Tempe!  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about wine choices.  I ordered the Hannah's Field Salad and my husband ordered the Autostrada panini. Both dishes were flavorful, delicious, and reasonably priced! I do wish the salad had more greens - was mostly quinoa and toppings. We also enjoyed the $5 glasses of wine! Would definitely recommend this place if you are in Tempe! Great spot for a relaxing and delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing praise for Postino's since I moved to Phoenix a year ago... Finally, today, I was able to go check it out myself!  This wasn't the first time I've attempted to go to Postino's. If you get there late, there's too much of a wait to enjoy it for a workday lunch... but my two coworkers and I arrived around 11:30 today and had no problem getting a lovely table outside in the sunshine! Our service was friendly and quick, and our glasses were never empty. I've heard about the legendary bruschetta, but today, I opted for a turkey panini. (I hear that their happy hour is a pretty bomb deal on the bruschetta. It's regularly $14 for 4 pieces, but at happy hour, you can pay $20 for the same 4-pieces AND get a bottle of wine... so I imagine I'll be coming back to try it then!) That said, I was really happy with my selection! I should've had a salad with it, because once I saw the greens, they looked really good... but I went with the chips. They were a little greasier than I care for, but still very good! The sandwich was fantastic!!! I had mine on focaccia and it was delicious - melty, warm and the pesto really gave it a good finish!   The price was reasonable for a lunch out (around $13), and we couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day. I'll definitely be back here again soon! (Preferably for their happy hour... it looked like they had a great wine selection too!)"}
{"text":"I have yet to find bruschetta that can even compare to this restaurant. It's really on a whole other level. The service has always been very friendly and fast as well. I wish they took reservations because the wait can get very long, but I understand why they don't."}
{"text":"Our waitress Cat was the coolest - so friendly and such a great sense of humor.  She took the time to look up whether there was any soy in the bread, really nice.  Went here for brunch on a Sunday - got seated right away (there was a 60 minute wait next door!). Had the farm scramble - delicious.  Best-kept secret near campus!  Thanks again Cat!"}
{"text":"This isn't really an Italian restaurant...   It's a wine place that serves appetizer, sandwiches and salad.    We were hungry and thinking it had a full Italian menu.    After waiting for a table and sitting down we opted to just order food and not leave.    Waitress was very nice, and food was prompt.  My daughter had the chicken and mozzarella panini and she said it was really dry.   Her side salad was good.  I had the bruschetta appetizer.   You pick four toppings and they serve it on four slices of bread.   I picked: 1:  warm artichoke spread 2:  fig, Apple, and Brie 3:  mozzarella, basil, and tomato 4:  roasted red pepper and goat cheese. All were very good.    Seemed a little pricey at $15"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! The staff is friendly and the food is delicious. I'm traveling from California and would highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. I am not this type of foodie, and being a good old red blooded 'merican I was kind of out of place in my cowboy hat and boots, but I enjoyed the experience. Will I come again, not likely, but it still earns a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"If you want a lighter, fresher dinner fare, this place is for you as the menu only features bruschetta boards, paninis and salads in gourmand combinations. It's a cute place for first dates and catching up with girlfriends. However, your meat and potato loving guy friend will complain that this place doesn't have real food and threaten to walk over to the BBQ joints that they can smell. The beer and wine selection was very good with equally good prices."}
{"text":"Came in during a hectic hour, I guess. Service was sub par. Had to stand next to the bar to drink my pitcher because tables and bar was filled. Uninterested bar tenders, didn't feel very welcomed. Would not wanna come back on a Saturday afternoon.."}
{"text":"Update: the owner reached out to me to help out and that it self shows how customer service is done. I raised their rating just because he was so kind to send a message and ask for what happened. Great owner.  The food was wonderful and amazing. I had the pick two choice and the cucumber lemonade and it was great. But the service was not the best. Getting water refills was hard and the place wasn't packed either. We had to ask the bartender for help because our waiter went missing. I really wanted another refill of the lemonade but no one wanted to help us. We ask other waiters and they didn't really care for us."}
{"text":"Postino's is proving they can multiply success and duplicate amazing service, beautiful dining rooms, awesome food, and a well thought out beverage program. Above all what I like best about the many great things about all of the Postino's restaurants is the hospitality!!!  Last week I popped into The Postino on College Ave for a cold $5 small pitcher of beer, what an amazing price for any of the great beers on tap. Service was swift and friendly and my 30 minute visit was very enjoyable.  It was so enjoyable That when I was given a choice for my birthday gathering of friends This location was my only choice.  Birthday night was grand, and everything we ordered was delicious! The Pub Board was loaded with awesome cheeses salami, humus and other tasty items it's 15 bucks but well worth every penny. Several bottles of wine and fantastic boards of Bruschetta were also shared amongst us friends and as usual they were interesting and tasty.   Service was stellar, and ever present, but never intrusive. AJ, The General Manager even stopped by with birthday greetings while busy orchestrating one of the best run and busiest restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. The food was delicious, although the service was incredibly slow. The servers were disorganized, the kitchen would send multiple orders of sides which had not been ordered, and it took 50 minutes to get our main entrees. Reservations recommended because it was crowded."}
{"text":"I visited this place several times over the course of my trip to Arizona. The first time I went it was really crowded and really hot outside so we decided to go somewhere else. The next two visits we got seated quickly and the food was simple yet outstanding, just goes to show you more isn't always better. For both times I ate here I opted for the bruschetta, they give you plenty of options to choose from. The staff was super friendly, we had the same waiter and he even bought us desert on our final meal before we flew out. We really don't have places like this where I'm from so its nice to try new things! Overall, loved this place and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Nice space... but it doesn't have the charm of the 40th st. Location. It feels like the rest of the new developments in Tempe... shallow. It has a pretty vernier, but you can tell it lacks heart.   The prices for wine are decent and the Bruschetta's are good. Servers are nice, but the group service system they uses leaves you confused on who is taking care of you.   I think I will still come here for a happy hour glass of wine, but I doubt I would take a date here."}
{"text":"This Postino's is huge!! Now granted I have not been to the Gilbert location and I hear that it is the biggest one of them all, but I can honestly say that if I lived closer to this one, I would definitely become a regular.  It was packed on a Monday night, but then again it was $20 board and wine so why would it not be? Almost every seat, inside and out (which says a lot because even the outside area is huge) was taken. Our lovely server who's name escapes was fabulous. Actually everyone was very friendly and great which is one thing I do love about all the Postino locations. I have yet to have a bad experience (knock on wood) I will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"For Easter brunch, my friends and I decided to go to Snooze, but were disappointed to hear that there would be a 40 minute wait, especially when we were hungry. We decided to go to Postino Annex next door, and were seated right away. The entire staff members were very kind, helpful, and welcoming.   It was our first time at Postino, so our waiter was especially helpful by recommending the Vegetarian panini with chicken for my friend. She got the salad-panini combo, and I got the Farm Scramble. Although I haven't tried the vegetarian panini w/ chicken, my friend told me that it's very good. I tried some of her salad, and it was also tasty - I loved the walnuts, goat cheese, and dried fruits on top of the spinach and dressing. As for the farm scramble, it was also good - the eggs were scrambled with Yukon Gold potatoes and cheese, and came with a side salad and tomatoes. The salad and the tomatoes had some mystery dressing on it - I wish I knew their secret recipe so that I could have it more often.   I was really thirsty, so I was worried when the waiter came by with small glasses of water. However, I was very happy with the service because they kept refilling the glass. Our waiter checked in often (maybe even too often?), to see how we were doing. I'm giving the service a definite 5 - the staff made us feel like we were cared for.   I'll be back for some wine or mimosas. Recommended."}
{"text":"What a awesome experience - Olivia was an excellent waitress and we were so impressed with her attention to detail, recommendation of wine and the special treat for Gammage Theatre night!    Every employee was game on!  One of our best date nights - and we will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Postinos never disappoints and this location is spectacular! I love the large (dog friendly) patio out front and huge open air feel inside. They offer $5 glasses of wine and pitchers of beer before 5pm as well as a $20 deal on Monday nights which includes a bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta. They have a good menu with soups, sandwiches and salads, but they bruschetta is what you go here for! My favorites are prosciutto with fig, tomato jam, salmon with pesto and salami with pesto. I haven't tried a board I don't like ($14.50) so definitely mix it up! I'd recommend you add their email list for coupons and birthday gifts."}
{"text":"Food 5 I've been to the downtown Phoenix, Gilbert, and now Tempe locations and the food is always great and consistent. Great appetizers, sandwiches, and brunch items. Get a board of bruschetta.  Drinks 5 Great unique wine selection and awesome $5/glass happy hour deal.   Atmosphere/Service 5 Even though there always seems to be a lot of people the staff is always pleasant and quick to seat you. Nice, trendy interior."}
{"text":"Currently here right now and the service is terrible. If you don't look like you're going to have a pricey tab don't bother coming - you'll get ignored! Cheese board is alright, said it has three cheeses on it but I only got two. Vibes are pretty good and the hostesses were great and friendly, but that's pretty much it. Better luck at the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"I'm visiting my sister, who lives here in Tempe, and Postinos is just around the corner from our hotel. It was nice to be able to walk! They have a ton of outdoor seating, which is nice, as well as interesting, enjoyable  indoor decor and ambiance.   We only got appetizers as a snack with our coffee, so I can't speak a ton on their menu. My sister loves Postinos though! I thought it was fun to have SO many bruschetta options, although I'm not a huge bruschetta fan. We also got an appetizer with \"beer food\"- soft pretzel sticks, chorizo, corn nuts, etc, which was good. Wish I'd been hungry for more! Will be back. Wish they took reservations!"}
{"text":"The food is good. The drinks are good. The service is good, but always feels superficial..? I don't know."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this location! The servers are ALWAYS nice, fast, and attentive. Their food is amazing and they are very quick and accommodating when it comes to mistakes. I go here almost every week and have always had the most amazing experience. Love their board and bottle special!!!"}
{"text":"A group and I come every week for their board and bottle special (every Monday and Tuesday)- $20 for a bottle of wine and board of bruschetta (4 large pieces per board)!!. The food, atmosphere, and service is all great. I have also came for brunch once, decent selection and still great service. I wasn't too hungry and just got one egg with bacon (only $3, typically $6ish at other places) and my friends got the french toast and breakfast sandwich, which they said they liked. Highly recommend Postino!"}
{"text":"In Phoenix this week for spring break and had a great lunch on the patio with our dogs and a friend. Started with the Butcher Board, some beers. Then we did a super delish selection of bruschetta, pear and Brie, roasted peppers and goat cheese, artichoke spread, and the seasonal tomato jam with sheep milk cheese. We ordered two and had tons left over. Great service, amazing food! A must when visiting AZ!!"}
{"text":"With all the other restaurants I could try, I of course have to go Postino, again!  But I hadn't tried this location yet, so it's almost like trying a new restaurant.    I ordered the brie and prosciutto panini with the salad. Delicious as always!    Service was great!"}
{"text":"A group of us were meeting for brunch at Snooze (next door) when we found out the wait was over an hour! Luckily, Postino was able to sit us immediately!  I ordered the breakfast panini and a coffee and was impressed with both. The brunch menu isn't as extensive as I hoped, but everything we ordered was tasty and we didn't have to wait over an hour to be seated.  The wine and bruschetta deal on Monday and Tuesday seems awesome and I will be back to try it out!"}
{"text":"Postino's never disappoints!!! Their bruschetta boards are amazing. My personal favorites are: salami and pesto, almond hummus with chopped tomatoes, and the traditional mozzarella with tomatoes and basil. They even carry my favorite beer - lindeman's frambroise. They have a great selection of wine too. Aside from the boards, my favorite thing on the menu is the mixed greens salad. Great place!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get bruschetta! Cool atmosphere and amazing food, every time!"}
{"text":"This place just opened and I have been consistently suggesting that we go there when my OH wants to go out. I can't stop eating their bruschetta, they are all addictive. I plan on trying every single menu item, twice.  The beer selection is perfect; who can resist a good craft beer menu!?! I haven't tried their wine yet because I've been so busy drinking their beer, but I will definitely be changing it up soon! I'd like to start taking advantage of their happy hour though... they seem to have really great deals!  Service is always superb! One time, our bruschetta order came out wrong and they gave us a free one even though we begged them not to since we were going to order more anyway. The servers are very knowledgeable and extremely friendly, we love it!   Their location is so great, I am so happy that they opened up just across ASU and mill.  I will keep coming here every chance I get!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on new year's day with friends. Ordered the Tuscan tuna and wow...probably the best tuna sandwich I've ever had. I'm still thinking about it! Everything that was ordered looked, smelled, and tasted delicious. Tables around us ordered meat/cheese plates and will definitely try one of those next time. Service was fast and friendly. I would recommend. (Drinks were good too)"}
{"text":"Bruschetta and wine - a match made in heaven. We arrived around 7 on a Friday so we expected a wait, it was 30-40 minutes so we walked down the street and got a beer. They texted us that our table was ready so we headed back over. The restaurant is beautiful. It's got a casual but classy vibe. I love the indoor/outdoor bar and the patio was really nice but we opted to stay inside. I wish I could remember our servers name because he was great. He helped us decide on a bottle of cabernet, the ones he showed us ranged from $75-101 so I'm not sure what the cheaper options are because they don't put the bottle prices on the menu. The wine was amazing and the cheese board and bruschetta boards are priced very fairly at $15 for what you get. It all tasted wonderful and I can't wait for the chance to come back here!"}
{"text":"This has become my go to spot when I'm in town on Monday/Tuesdays. You really can't go wrong with $20 for a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board! I've had pretty much everything on their bruschetta menu and you can't go wrong with any of it. My usual board is filled with: brie & apples with fig spread, prosciutto with figs & mascarpone, warm artichoke spread, and burrata, bacon, arugula & tomato. To top it off, they have awesome service! Every waiter/waitress I've met has been so helpful, polite, and full of great conversation."}
{"text":"Postino Annex is in a great location, and they have a big patio. Such a perfect place to enjoy a spring day in Tempe! A must try here is the bruchetta. I think I've tried all of them and my absolute favorites are the Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato, and Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone. Get a board of four to share. It's a perfect snack or a light lunch.  Only downside is that Postino does not have a full liquor bar, so they unfortunately could not satisfy my craving for a Bloody Mary with brunch. But, they do have champagne for mimosas and their best deal is that all of their beer pitches are $5 from 11am-5pm EVERYDAY!   Postino, please open a location in Tucson!"}
{"text":"LOVE Postino. Food is awesome and decently healthy. They are definitely known for their bruschetta which is awesome, but their paninis and salads are to die for as well! Before 5:00pm, every day, you can get a pitcher of beer or glass of wine for only $5 and Monday and Tuesdays after 8:00pm you can get an entire bruschetta board and bottle of wine for only $20! The restaurant itself is cute as well with a nice outdoor seating area, couches, and string lights. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"This is the best date night place! Just moved to the area, and I'm so happy to have found this place. From their wine menu to building a bruschetta board, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Decided to try something a lil different today . Really was great and refreshing . Had a honey cucumber lemonade and some organic bean soup . Very delicious and light on my stomach . I will return soon to try other things on the menu . Staff was great to bye the way ."}
{"text":"I am updating this review, as the owner privately contacted me as he felt terrible regarding our experience and kindly made the situation right. More importantly he never asked me to change my original review.  Hopefully they clear the staff out and start over, as the environment is pretty nice!     Just meh. Basically an overpriced soup and salad place. We had a large group. And they were kind enough to give us separate tickets. However, when you tell your server you're starving, order, and over an hour later the food comes--and its half the size you expect with a shotglass of soup, and she doesn't correct you when you ask her what size to order--now, it definitely is not surprising that we had not seen our server in that hour.  When we initially sat down she took our drink orders--and it took 20 minutes to get drinks!!!! Mind you our whole group hadn't arrived and the place wasn't even close to packed--completely absurd.  Due to the fact we hadn't seen her, several of us had to go directly to the bar for our refills on beer/wine!  Really unfortunate--as this does have a neat location."}
{"text":"The ambience is so nice: half the restaurant outside and the rest inside. sitting outside, theres lots of trees and shade so it's very nice to go out with a date or some girl friends.   Food was amazing. Every time i come here I get the Butcher's block which is an expensive appetizer that comes on a block of wood, with an assortment of meat, cheese, and nuts. A favorite.  Though I was sat at a wobbly table which was annoying..."}
{"text":"When I come to Arizona to visit, I always have to make time to come here. i currently live in South Florida (but an Arizona native) and I have yet to find a wine and bruschetta place that compares to here. EVERY SINGLE once of their bruschettas is amazing. And when I say every single one I mean I've tried every single one. A few of my favorites are the roasted red peppers with goat cheese (the only place I like goat cheese), BURRATA, BACON, ARUGULA & TOMATO (in caps because this is my favorite by far), and and warm artichoke spread. Even though I named only 3 they are all still amazing.   This place has the BEST deal on Monday and Tuesday evenings. A tray of bruschetta and bottle of wine for ONLY $20. You can't beat that price. It's more than enough for 2-3 people to share. If you don't end up finishing all your wine you can cork it and enjoy it at home as well.   Perfect place for date night, girls night, birthdays, just a fun night out with everyone.  The location is also perfect. If you want to go out after on mill it's walking distance.   If you haven't tried this place, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"-1 star because there's no tomato jam anymore?! This should be a crime, honestly. Other than that, always a pleasure."}
{"text":"A group of us made our way here after one of our events. We were hot and thirsty! I arrived a bit later than most but was quickly offered something to drink. Our orders came out quickly. My colleagues most had the bruschetta board deal (which I understand is quite popular) and the wine special. Since I had overdone a few nights before, I passed on the wine. ;)  I had the tuna sandwich with a side salad which was quite tasty. Our food came out quickly. Service was prompt and professional. Our server was on top of it. My Diet Coke kept filling itself, or so I thought!    I like this place for the atmosphere and the people. The lights we low but not that low that you couldn't see the menu or your friends. The music was cool and so are the people here. The doors were open to the patio and it was a refreshing fall evening. Wish I could have stayed longer but had to work early the next day.   Our checks were split without any issues. They must be used to that being near a college campus and all. I'll be back for sure but won't wait so long between visits. Thanks Postino!  That was fun."}
{"text":"Our table ordered two Bruschetta boards.  Each had a wrong one.  When we asked to have one \"replaced\" with what we really ordered, it was delivered quickly only to find out we were charged for their mistake!  Really!  That is wrong!  The food certainly was not as good as the Gilbert location."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here!  The happy hour from opening until 5:00 lets you begin your day with $5.00 wine and pitchers of beer.  The Italian Picnic and Tuscan Tuna was a perfect combination.  Our waitress, Krystal, was attentive and friendly (she didn't even mind when we asked to change tables!).  We couldn't have asked for a more pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"Ask for Christian. He's a great server that's not overbearing. Food and wine are great. Nine Iron and Chicken Salads are my fave."}
{"text":"What can I say? Classy, fun. $5 glasses of wine or pitchers of beer until 5 pm. Great service. I'm never without alcohol/food/water for long and the servers are always happy to answer questions about the wine and beer list."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great food, cheap booze and fantastic atmosphere.I got the farm scramble and it was perfect. Eggs mixed with roasted potatoes, arugula salad and ripe cherry tomatoes and it was perfect for brunch. I don't even like tomatoes but these were great, let's just say my plate was empty. My friends got the bruschetta and it was great, lot of food though so maybe 2 people should share. A lot of options with the bruschetta and they're great. I got the Bellini too and it was perfect, no joke I've never had one and its better than the mimosa. Good vibes and good food, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great place to sit ourside. A variety of bruchettas to chose from and a great happy hour after 8 on select days."}
{"text":"This is the best bruschetta ever!!  The pieces are large enough that 4 people can get a good taste.  Each one was unique and so delicious!!"}
{"text":"I should have realized this place would be crowded! After-all, it's in the heart of ASU and it was the night of a Gammage show. What was I thinking!? Luckily, the wait wasn't that long so we were still able to sit and eat before the show. However, with that being said, I really love this new location and you can never go wrong with delicious Postino food!  They created a really open and inviting atmosphere and there is plenty of room to stretch out. They have a spacious patio and then an open and airy indoor section of the restaurant. When the weather is nice, it's great that you can be sitting inside and still enjoy a breeze thanks to the large garage style doors that they have open.   I am a Postino junkie and love their bruschetta boards. They are by far the best in town. My favorite bruschetta by far is the tomato jam. Now don't get grossed out at the name because it really tastes more like a sweet jam rather than tomato. Whatever it is, it's amazing and I could eat them all day long! Another favorite of mine is the chicken salad."}
{"text":"Postino Annex on 615 S College Ave, Tempe was a very nice experience and a great place to go for a sophisticated lunch or dinner. The hostess and waiters were really friendly and attentive of the my party of four. The interior of the restaurants create a laid back back and trendy environment. They do have different dining options between sitting outside, inside, and with different types of seating arrangements for example a booth, table or a lounge area. I had a pick 2 option to try both their soup and a half a panini. It was delicious. The soup was nice and warm and the panini had some very tasty bread. The meal was very filling and were good portions to satisfy your hunger. My meal was $11.35 which was worth it for the food and experience I received. They do have gluten free bruschetta, with a $2 surcharge! I know it can be difficult to find gluten free items on the menu, but it is an option at Postino!  I rode my bike to the location as I live on the ASU campus. However there are parking options for those who drive. It is located in a great location and a young neighborhood. It is close to Mill Ave and shopping centers. I would not recommend a family with small children coming here because it is almost like a wine bar and does not offer a kids menu. I would recommend this place for a casual but nice dinner with a group friends."}
{"text":"Fun place. We went on Wednesday night and it was bottle and bruschetta. Yummy bruschetta variations for you and your friends to explore.  The bread was wonderfully crispy on the outside and yet soft and chewy on the inside. My favorite was the one with the figs.    But be prepared to wait. We waited over one hour to be seated!  Thank goodness for the bar."}
{"text":"LOVE their outdoor patio (when it isn't 111 degrees outside). They were very accommodating and great selection of beer and wine! Also, the bruschetta is FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"thankfully we had a brunch run with reserved seating, because this place was buuuusy!   i had the farm house scramble. rarely does a scramble impress me, but the caramelized onions and roasted potatoes and Gruyere cheese holding it all together was divine. the small side salad of mixed summer greens was a nice flavor. it wasn't very big for 9 bucks. i could've eaten 2 portions (which is why we stopped by a taco shop on the way home). the brunch mimosa's were 5 bucks, and seemed heavier on the orange juice than the champagne. the bellinis are also 5 bucks and too sweet for me.   i've never been to a postino's before but i was impressed with the farm scramble and the excellent service."}
{"text":"Too bad no stars wasn't an option... Seems like they store credit card info and charge people whenever and however many times they feel like. I was charged twice on my visit on July 19th, and a friend with me that night was also double charged... a week later. How exactly do they have her credit card information, such that they can charge her a week later? Of course, I don't appreciate being doubled charged and so I called them when I found it on my statement, hoping that they would make it right. I spoke with Brandon, the manager on duty at the time I called, and he was about as interested in helping me as my grandmother would be in attending a Nikki Minaj concert. He listened as I explained my problem, offered a haphazard apology, (Red Flag #1)  and took down my info, saying he would give it to his accounting department and they would contact me \"if, I mean, when\" they are able to credit it back to me. (If? Really? Nice save, dude. Red Flag #2) It's been over 2 weeks since that call, and who's surprised? I've heard nothing back. (Red Flag and Strike #3) I have never been so disappointed in a customer service manager, and I will never visit any Postino again. I would hate for it to be true that they are indeed storing credit card information, but until I get some reasonable explanation for their nefarious credit card operations, they can double charge someone else. Steer clear or pay with cash, and be sure to check your credit card statements."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!! This is a great find! Came here with co-workers and we were all blown away by the ambiance, food, and drink selections - and that is saying a lot, since we are consultants that travel weekly and eat in restaurants every day.  The bruschetta menu is awesome, two orders feeds 6 people with an appetizer or two. My favorite was the apple-brie-fig spread one, and the guys fell in love with the smoked salmon. Great wine list as well! My only gripe was that my first diet coke that came out had a long cotton string in my ice - weird. They replaced it, but it took about 10 minutes.  The ambiance is very cool, we came when it was pouring rain but it would be great on a nice warm evening. Outdoor seating, and low candle-light. The music is awesome, I'd love to get a hold of the playlist. Definitely coming back next time I'm in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Their happy hour ends at 5pm? What up with that?  Makes no sense.  I got there at 5:02pm and met with friends who were already seated and I couldn't get the \"happy hour\" price.    The wines are pretty awesome, but pricey.  The bruschetta was delish, but also expensive considering it's just bread with an incredibly amount of ingredients on top.  The service was okay, but nothing special.  We were there on a Friday evening.  I would probably go back because I loved the wine selection.  Overall wasn't impressed for all the hype I have heard."}
{"text":"Mark was fantastic.  He was upbeat, offered wine and Bruschetta suggestions and was a pleasure to be around.  The food was DELICIOUS, and the was was pretty darn good.  The ambiance was great, good music and an all around good atmosphere for a casual date, or a pregame out with friends before mill.  We came on Monday night. Which is $20 for 4 bruschetta's and a bottle of wine.  Totally a great deal!  I really enjoyed the time that my girlfriend and I had.  I would definitely suggest coming here anytime for some good food and wine."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! $5 until 5pm! I love wine and I like it even more with friends. The atmosphere is mellow. You can laugh, drink, chill and just relax. I'll continue to come"}
{"text":"Postino's has done a great job offering very reasonable wine and bruschetta deals. They also offer a wonderful happy hour beer pitcher which is about half the size of a normal picture for $5.  There a large patio and beautiful interior is filled with mid-century and old style furniture. I really appreciate this because this style seems to be growing strong in the Phoenix Valley, with these new trendy Design forword venues embodying the asthetic it really makes your time spent here fun and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Such a treat while visiting ASU!  We had the chance last Fall and we didn't miss it this visit!  The bruschetta offers are beautifully balanced with quality ingredients and variety to please!  Try the artichoke!  So good!"}
{"text":"The most wonderful GLUTEN FREE bruschetta I have ever tasted!! Kat, our server, was absolutely wonderful!!! She was an absolute delight and very personable. Kat definitely made our brunch an extremely enjoyable experience. We highly recommend Postino! Be sure to dine outside and ask for Kat!"}
{"text":"Arrive at least 30 minutes early to get your name put in, they do not take phone reservations. Totally worth the trip. Best brunch I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"So tonight we were so excited to go here because the food is amazing and my roommate really wanted her friends from out of town to experience of our favorite eatery.  We had a party of six so we called ahead to make a reservation and were told it wouldn't be necessary but when we got here we had to wait for them to clean off some tables at a snails pace that took 10 minutes.  We then waited for our waiter for another 10 minutes before he came to greet us.  Thank goodness at least the water girl was on top of her stuff and came over right when we were seated.  Once our waiter finally arrived he took our wine bottle order and our food orders. 15 minutes later the wrong bottle of wine showed up, no food. When we notified them they left with the bottle and didn't come back with a new one for the entire time it took me to write up to this point (5 minutes). Oh finally the soup came! We waited another 10 minutes for food which came out for 4 of us first and then 5 minutes later the last two came out, I couldn't believe it after everything else. But of course when the food FINALLY did come it was AMAZING as always.   5 stars for food 1 for service- get your shit together?!"}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy good company, great patio to people watch too.  I love all the Postino's locations, they have some of the best bruschetta i have had anywhere in the country."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with a friend and it was AMAZING. We didn't have to wait on a Sunday morning, which was unusual. Every other time I've been here, I had to wait (and it was worth it). The bruschetta is good, and they have easy customization options for vegan-friendly menu items.   Brunch was good, and I found out you can get a single bruschetta for $4! It's not on the menu as a single, so it's good to know!   Definitely recommend eating here! Service is GREAT too!"}
{"text":"Cute, fun place to come with a small group of friends. Lots of wines on their list to choose from. Always a good time. Giving four stars instead of five because I wish they had more food options and they also have a consistent wait time."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with the sandwich and soup or salad combo! The appetizers I've gotten are delicious, although way too pricey compared to how much I typically spend on the main meal. The environment is very lively and during the summer they have the misters on so you're still able to sit outside on their patio area without it being too hot. They do have a deal that a lot of my coworkers and supervisors love to take advantage of ~ the bruschetta board and wine bottle for $20 after a certain time in the evenings. Their bruschetta boards are always amazing no matter what combination you get!! For your first time, definitely get a bruschetta board and if you can't finish it, you'll have an amazing leftover midnight snack for later that night!"}
{"text":"This place is great and their bruschetta is one of the best. Best times to go are during their happy hours, but be aware that waits can be long since everyone wants to be there."}
{"text":"Came back to Tempe for the holidays and was surprised when a friend said to meet at Postino's in Tempe... when did they build that?  Was a cold night but plenty of heaters on the patio that kept it warm and comfortable. Service was very good and attentive and the food was what I expected having been to the other locations in the past. Very nice location btw... good scouting.  Nothing bad to say at all. Postino's does it again - but in a better location :)"}
{"text":"i had the privelige attending the soft opening. The location is great! Right down the street fro the ASU Football Stadium. The food and wine is great and in line with other the Postino's around the Valley. The one thing this place has over the others is the atmosphere. It is very cozy and has a great patio with Glass Garage doors that open up. It will be a hit in Tempe for a long time to come!"}
{"text":"Love this place with the girls on Tuesdays! $20 bottle and boards + friends and laughs = happiness!!! Music is a little loud for conversation sometimes but what can you say it's a happening place on a Tuesday! :)"}
{"text":"This was a great little find.  Which apparently, all the locals already know.  We went for a light dinner.  Sat outside at the bar with awning and misters on.  Perfect summer seating.  Have to give a special kiddos to the bartender who could make a consistent top notch snake bite.  We had the 4 different bruschettas.  The smoke salmon was our favorite but you have to get at least one with fig.  It was awesome."}
{"text":"My 5-Star rating is just a drop in the bucket for this place. Seriously, the $5 pitcher of beer (every day before 5pm) and a panini are unbeatable. I'd go here three times a week for lunch if I could. The service is incredible. Oh and the side salad for the panini's is the best damn salad I've ever had."}
{"text":"Nice salad and sandwich lunch spot by the ASU campus. 3.5 stars.  Food: 3.5, Atmosphere: 4.5, Service: 4 Cost to worth it rating: 3.5 ($10 for panini or half panini and salad) Return worthiness: yes  Highlights: - Wine list: eclectic where I didn't recognize one on the long list. Like the $5 until 5 deal. I wasn't even feeling like having wine with lunch and I was lured into it. (I'm not a hard sell).  - Sunshine salad: different veggies plus bacon and cashews. 3.5 stars. - Turkey pesto sandwich: fresh and liked the crunchy ciabatta bread. 3.5 stars. - Bruchetta: had a bunch of options that looked good and could pick 4. I'll try that next time.  - Gluten free friendly: had GF bread options as a substitute - Patio: nice area to enjoy the Arizona sunshine  - Cool logo: peace, love, wine, and music. What else do you need in life?  Lowlights: - Potato chips: the hub thought they were overlooked and weren't so crispy   I'd come back in a wine mode and hang out in the sun for a while with my Sundevil niece."}
{"text":"Same menu as the others, good food and good drink.  Wish they would expand the selections of wines - yeah I know I am picky.  Would like to see more Spanish, Italian varietals and Romania has some amazing wines too.  Parking is the pain..."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Postinos anyway but went to the annex yesterday and was so impressed!  Love the atmosphere!  The best was the service from entry to exit.  We had a small problem with our order and the truth that everyone makes mistakes - it's how you correct them that makes the difference, came true.  This restaurant went way above and beyond to ensure our experience was not soured.  The one great thing is if you watch the staff - they love their job!  Kudos to ownership and management for creating that environment!  That makes it fun for the diners!!!   AND - of course the food and wine is always fabulous!  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix this past weekend and despite being recommended other spots on Mills and by the ASU area, dropped in and had some really good food, wine, and beer (I know, right?) and my server India was really nice. if im ever in Phoenix I'd definitely drop back in and bring friends."}
{"text":"Postinos offers a nice environment/vibe. I tried the \"Nine Iron\" and that was an impressive sandwich. Good place for a get-together (which happens to be exactly why we were there). Our server was very considerate and made sure to get my order out promptly, as I let him know I had to be heading out. My only complaint, and it doesn't really fall on the restaurant, is the parking. It's terrible around campus, specifically this block. Hopefully they build a lot nearby wherein you can get validated with a receipt."}
{"text":"amazing management!"}
{"text":"This location is amazing and the staff was so pleasant and attentive!  You can tell they are really happy working here and the happy hour prices were amazing.  The menu was very simple, however the food was good and very filling.  Just know this is an awesome hangout spot and you are not getting a formal dinner entree and it will work for you."}
{"text":"I'm lucky enough to have an office walking distance from Postino and therefore order lunch-to-go quite frequently. From placing the order to picking it up, I have never had a bad experience at Postino. The staff is always so welcoming and cheerful and my food is always delicious and ready to go when I arrive. Unless I'm in for the bruschetta board and bottle of wine deal on Mondays, I'm usually ordering the prosciutto and Brie panini on ciabatta with a side salad and it is seriously a delicious lunch. I've tried the Turkey panini and didn't find it to be very interesting so I defaulted back to the prosciutto and Brie because it never fails. Usually I feel as though the bread could be more toasted so I asked for my panini to be a little more toasted this time and it was literally perfect. If you're looking for a delicious place for a classy sandwich or some seriously delicious and giant bruschetta, with a fun ambiance, I definitely recommend Postino, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Postino never fails. Their bruschetta is amazing, their wine selection is great, and their desserts are to die for (I always get the caramel sundae). Nothing beats their board and bottle deal on Monday and Tuesday nights but make sure to get there early to avoid super long wait times. Service is always great too, even when it's busy!"}
{"text":"My GF wanted to try this place for their gluten-free menu.  The building and interior design is nice, modern and trendy.  They have plenty of outdoor and indoor seating.  They also have plenty of different types of seating which probably suits their college town customers well.  They have 2/4 tops, booths, bar seating and even couch seating...something for everyone.  We came here for happy hour, when they offer $5 wine and $5 beer pitchers.  The beer pitchers are not a standard full size beer pitcher, but about half that size.  It's enough to fill 2 glasses full and have a bit left.  Their wine selection is decent.  Try the grapefruit beer, it was my fav!  It's very similar to Schofferhofer Grapefruit beer.  My GF ordered the Bruschetta with gluten-free bread.  I was pretty impressed with their gluten-free bread.  It's a $2 surcharge.  I ordered the Sunshine Daydream salad and it seemed small and underwhelming for $10.  It also hardly had any dressing.  The service here is great!  Everyone is super friendly and helpful.  I've noticed that more restaurants are doing \"team serving\" where whoever is closest to you and not busy will come help you.  They all share the tip.  The guys were more friendly than the girls, though.  We ended up liking this place so much, we skipped out on trying a different gluten-free restaurant on our last day in Phoenix and came back here again, instead.  Their bathrooms are okay."}
{"text":"This is more of a 3.5. They have huge bruschetta and a nice outdoor patio area. A platter can easily feed two people. Their cucumber lemonade is delicious!   It doesn't draw the same amount of people as the restaurant next door which is why we picked it. I'm not sure why we were made to wait 20 minutes (I needed a table for 10) for a table when the table we sat at was available when I put my name down.   I should have checked before I paid for the bill but they mistakenly charged me for a couple of drinks."}
{"text":"Great decor and vibe.  I like this place when the weather is nice and all the windows and doors are open.  The nine iron roast beef sandwich is a winner.  They have a very good craft beer selection in addition to their wine."}
{"text":"Conveniently located by Arizona State University, Postino's is the perfect place to connect with fellow students over good food. I was meeting with a group of students from an organization that I volunteer with and they suggested this place. I could also see this as a great place for college students to take their parents. There is also a large outdoor patio that is dog friendly.   We got all of the bruschetta. Literally, we ordered one of each. Each bruschetta was cut into four pieces making it perfect for sharing. My favorites were the brie & apples with fig spread, mozzarella with tomato & basil, and almond hummus with chopped tomato. Service is great too. Our water was constantly refilled, and our waitress was attentive."}
{"text":"I've given this place three tries and it always ends the same...  Walk in, stand around like an idiot waiting for a server, no seating at the bar, outside is dirty, get frustrated, ignored by staff, leave out the side door.  I get Mill is trying to be Scottsdale, but you're no Kazmier's! At least they keep the place nice, greet ALL guest, and have an inviting atmosphere. Instead of douchey high flautin brovo-riche vibe and crap service DURING THE WEEK!!!!!  All times have been on Thursdays. I don't know if there is some special event that day or what it is, but never again!"}
{"text":"Postino's $20 Board & Bottle deal on Monday and Tuesday nights is one of the best I've ever seen - my boyfriend and I go almost every week! The bruschetta boards are huge and definitely enough for two people. I've also been to Postino for the occasional brunch or lunch, and they have a great $5 pitcher of beer/glass of wine deal that goes on before 5 p.m. every day. The entrees are decent, but on the smaller side, and nothing special.   The service at Postino's is what I think makes it most unique - all of the servers share tables and genuinely look out for everyone who comes in to dine. They're so friendly, and sometimes even take a seat at your table/lounge area to take your order or ask questions - love it!"}
{"text":"Besides the fresh and delicious food; the service was impeccable.  Michael was our server and from the start of our dining experience he went above and beyond to ensure our satisfaction. His wine knowledge was elaborate, his delivery of service was professional and his demeanor was upbeat and enthusiastic.  Thank you Michael. Will def. be coming back."}
{"text":"This place really wasn't that good.  Maybe I just don't get it or maybe I didn't order the right thing but my chicken was bland and the sandwiches really seem to over rely on the spread for flavor.  I came on a slower day so the wait wasn't bad and service was pretty good.  I do love the ambiance of the place though so there's that.  Maybe it was an off night but neither my nor my friends food was all that great... Eh I wasn't too impressed and probably won't be back (at least not at those prices.)"}
{"text":"Our server Gabriela was amazing! We came in on the tail end of Board and Bottle night so it was pretty busy but she was very attentive and our food got here super quickly. Love Postino"}
{"text":"Great vibes in this location. Definitely a younger crowd but still very knowledgeable and happy staff! This time I got the butchers block and a mixed greens salad. My boyfriend got the roast beef panini and everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"Awesome patio, delicious brusetta, friendly staff and awesome happy hour deals.  So happy to have a new great restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Alrighty y'all. I'm not going to sugar coat this place. The hosts are extremely rude. They don't say hi, they seem disgusted to even have customers. I feel like the entire atmosphere is negative. Besides that, our server Nick was very kind and exciting. The two stars are for him and his parents who raised him and the other star for the food."}
{"text":"Service was top notch, and they kept the glasses fool and my tummy happy. I am a wildcat, but I can cut them a little slack. This place is right smack dab in the middle of the campus."}
{"text":"Aside from being totally snubbed by the hostesses, Postinos was perfection. Every server that walked by helped us out, my bruschetta board was to die for, the wine complimented my meal, and the woman who brought the wine over was extremely knowledgeable! The the quality food and service makes it worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I love this new Tempe Postino space!  I'm a huge Postino Arcadia fan, so when my husband suggested we head to this new location for a little lunch date last week, I was all about it.    They did a great job on the space itself; it's warm and cozy despite being much larger in square footage compared to the Phoenix locations.  The staff was super friendly as well.  The menu is the same, and despite the Bella Postino (hummus and artichoke spread) appetizer tasting a little off, everything else we had was delicious.  That being said, our waitress brought us a second artichoke spread that was warmer and less watery after our giving her a heads-up about the first round.  I highly recommend the bruschetta to share (with your fave glass of wine of course).  You can't really make a wrong selection here, but my favorite selections are: *Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone *Brie & Apples with Fig Spread *Salami with Pesto *Smoked Salmon with Pesto (in that order)  Their seasonal selections are usually worth giving a shot as well.  And if you prefer a salad or sandwich, you won't be disappointed with that.  This Postino is definitely a welcome addition to the Tempe area... and they cater too!"}
{"text":"The GM in training, Chip, showed our party a great time ... knowledgeable service in both wine and food ... awesome patio for casually sipping Malbec while eating disgustingly bad for you bruschetta.  I recommend their artichoke dip, and anything with their salami."}
{"text":"We had a great experience Saturday night. The hostess quoted 15-20 minutes, but at around 21 minutes the manager came over and apologized for the mis-quote and offered a free appetizer. We were already having a good time, so we didn't even realize the time, but this was a fantastic gesture. The food is always amazing here and the service was out of site.  Our waiter sort of disappeared the last 20-30 minutes or so though, which was weird. We had to ask 3 different people for the ticket. Not huge, but weird.   Overall, a fantastic experience and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"$20 for bruschetta and wine! This is a deal you can't beat! Make sure to call in and make a reservation because the wait usually is over an hour."}
{"text":"I had a tuna sandwich for lunch here, and I have been suffering with serious food poisoning for the past three days. Avoid eating fish at this place!"}
{"text":"Prosciutto & Fig Brie & Apple Burratta & Bacon Salami & Pesto   Prosciutto sandwich 10/10"}
{"text":"Great spot to grab appetizers and drinks, especially during happy hour! Their beer special is great -- $5 for a pitcher (about 2 pints)! Also specials on wine and cocktails.  I came here with 2 friends/work colleagues. It was a great space to talk and catch up as it was not too loud.   We shared a butcher's board and a bruschetta plate. We really liked that you get to customize your bruschetta plate with 4 different toppings. The four we had were (1) traditional tomato-basil-mozzarella (2) fig-apple-brie (3) smoked salmon with capers (4) red pepper jelly. All 4 were so good we ended up ordering a second set! #3 was my favorite, #2 was one of my colleague's favorite.  For dessert, we split a creme brûlée. It is a good size, easy for one person to finish but large enough to share. It comes out with fresh strawberries on the side.  I would come back here again in a heartbeat-- so good!"}
{"text":"Just had a couple glasses of wine - very helpful on suggestions!  Friendly Service!  Nice appetizers.  I'll Be Back!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Everything tastes amazing. Just beware that the food takes over 15 minutes to get to your table. I have spent over an hour at this Postino's twice."}
{"text":"We recently tried their catering service for our 10th Anniversary party and it was fabulous! The bruschetta & panini's were perfect choices for the evening! Highly recommend Postino's catering!!!"}
{"text":"Had the Chicken & mozzarella witch was awsome. Also had a Bruschetta platter, you pick 4 out of 11 chooses. The Brie & Apples with fig spread was to die for. Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & tomato was great. Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil can go wrong with that. And my favorite Smoked Salmon with Pesto was amazing. Also had mimosa to wash it all out."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND  I first noticed Postino Annex when I stopped by Snooze An AM Eatery.  Every time I was in the area, Postino Annex was always busy and always looked inviting. I JUST HAD TO STOP IN.  The first time I went in, I was wildly IMPRESSED!   The staff was CHARMING; just the right amount of friendliness mixed with professionalism.  As I've said MANY times, the way the staff behaves is 100% indicative of the management, and the management is CLEARLY on top of the game.  Speaking of GREAT MANAGEMENT, as I said in my recent review of Postino Highland, owners, the DeMarco's and the Bailey's, the parent corporation, LGO Hospitality (which owns the following Phoenix Restaurants, including, La Grande Orange Grocery and Pizzeria, Chelsea's Kitchen, Ingo's Tasty Food, Buck & Rider, Grateful Spoon Gelato and LGO Bake Shop. In California they own The Misfit, La Grande Orange Cafe, Ingo's Tasty Diner and The Luggage Room Pizzeria), are killing it, and I'm a fan!  POSTINO ANNEX  In September, 2014, the fourth and largest location of Postino Wine Café opened its doors to the public. Dubbed Postino Annex, the new restaurant and wine bar is located inside the historic Art Annex building at 615 S. College Avenue, just steps from the heart of the Arizona State University campus.  The 4,200 square-foot restaurant and wine bar is the largest of the Postino locations to date. But for Upward Projects' owners, Craig and Kris DeMarco and Lauren and Wyatt Bailey, this newest location is about more than just reinvigorating another historical building. All four partners are ASU alumni and Lauren Bailey, who studied art, used to work in the former Art Annex when she was in school.  In terms of the design, Postino Annex can be thought of a sort of \"Postino 2.0,\" Bailey says. Though they tried to incorporate elements that will be familiar to Postino fans, the owners also wanted give a different type of experience, one more tailored to the blossoming Tempe neighborhood.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE   My most recent visit was exceptional, as always.  What do I mean by \"exceptional?\"  Well, it's a neighborhood college campus bar, so I'm definitely not talking about 5 Star Fine Dining. I'm talking about cute and casual good food with friendly great service.  I like that everyone is treated well and the food is always superb, at least that's what I've noticed.  I love their draft beer selections. I also love how knowledgeable the staff is about their selections. I like a certain type of beer.   For example, although I enjoy heavy IPA's from time to time, I'm not able to drink more than one. That's where a knowledgeable staff comes into play. They've researched their selection, offer appropriate suggestions, and give samples. I enjoy picking their bartender's brains to hear the latest and greatest.  Of course, I had to have one of their famous bruschetta boards before leaving. Always DELICIOUS!  CONCLUSION  I love it here, and what's not to love?    Every visit I've had at Postino Annex has been 100%.  4/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *Patio is delightful at the right time of year.  *The restroom is shared with Snooze An AM Eatery.  *Parking is a bitch. Good luck.  *For more information: postinowinecafe.com"}
{"text":"This place makes me laugh.  They have such a good thing going for them but mess it up so easily. Anywho, the food is great & service is mediocre, if not worse. Highly recommend for low maintenance people who could care less about service.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I came here purely based on Yelp reviews.  1. The location was horrible, for me personally. Parking was tricky ands many streets were cutoff due to construction. I drove around for almost 15 minutes before I found a paid parking spot. This was only a big deal because I came for lunch during the week, 15 minutes seriously cuts into my time.  2. The interior is setup really odd. If felt congested and crammed. Almost like it was a personal challenge to see how impersonal and intimate they could make it feel without giving anyone any privacy. I truly detest the way they're setup on the inside. Alas, I crammed myself into a long bar to have lunch with little room to move. If I wanted a table to have lunch on a Thursday it would have been a 30 minute wait (which I didn't have since I spent 15 minutes trying to park).  3.  I ordered the tuna melt panini with homemade chips and the potato leek soup. I must confess the soup was really good! The tuna salad itself was good but the panini was so hard, the roof of my mouth started bleeding. I could barely bite into the sandwich. I ended up eating the inside and avoiding the bread altogether. The house made chips were ok, a nice compliment to the tuna without bread.   Overall, okay food but the parking and atmosphere left much to be desired. They need a knock out menu to supplement for the awkward and uncomfortable setup."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! I absolutely love Postino's so the fact that I have to leave this review truly upsets me. The venue itself was indeed gorgeous however our servers completely dropped the ball. We called and reserved a table for 15 people a day in advance to give them adequate time to accommodate. I would also like to disclaim that I work in the service industry so I'm not one to jump to conclusions, however over an hour just to receive our checks is NOT acceptable. Also we had multiple servers so it was extremely unclear who was \"taking care\" of our party. I've been to all the Postino locations and this was BY FAR the worst! Not worth wasting your time, if you have the option go to another location please do because they clearly don't know what they're doing here."}
{"text":"Awesome time at the bar. Enjoyed leaving the pagans and joining Christian at the bar!  Fantastic service and the wine and food is everything you would expect from a Postinos!  $20 bottle and bruschetta after 8 is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Had a full team outing for our company tonight here. Staff was great. Food was amazing!  Lots of laughs and enjoyment in a fabulous atmosphere. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Good food and prices. The service was a bit slow, but what can i say $20 for a bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta is not bad at all. The atmosphere is relax n fun, a place were you would like to catch up with your friends, or have a date night w/ the husband."}
{"text":"Awesome location and great happy hour deals on beer and wine. I'd come here everyday if I could.  We also got an appetizer platter with pretzels and cheese that was great!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch experience today. Food & service was fantastic. Christian was an awesome  server! Very helpful with great recommendations for food and drink combos  :)"}
{"text":"Patrick was such a great server!!! He came after our other server left and treated us so nicely and reassured us about our food and kept refilling our drinks and was overall so nice! Thanks Patrick! (From Daisy, Alyssa, and Ciera)"}
{"text":"Had my daughters Bridal Shower on the patio today! We could not have had better service!!! Daniel was on top of everything, fast and such a thoughtful server. I would recommend Postino to anyone after our terrific service we received. Food is always good and they were so accommodating!! Great day!! Daniel you are the BEST!"}
{"text":"This was a nice place for brunch. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Their menu had limited selections, but it was nice to ask our server what he suggested. I had the salmon, and from the way the server described it, it seemed small but he also said it was filling. When the food arrived I was a little disappointed because the meal looked REALLY small, but it was filling (I think it was the bread). It was a nice place and fast service--perfect for those on a time crunch."}
{"text":"Came here before flying out of town.  Made it in time for the happy hour (before 5pm).  Got a pitcher of beer for $5.  Have not had that since college. There is great outdoor seating of which we took advantage.  We ordered the bruschetta board.  This was enough for two people and I would recommend. Bread was nice and fresh and the toppings great.  Also had the brussels sprout salad which was Ok.  Probably would not order again."}
{"text":"I've always loved this place and am a frequent goer of the Monday/Tuesday bottle and board special.   One of my favorite things here (when I'm not getting a board) is the turkey panini. It comes with a great side salad and enough turkey that I can only finish half. Unfortunately, the last time I ordered the turkey panini I felt like the kitchen skimped in the meat. Literally it looks like two very thick slices of focaccia and one slice of turkey. I asked the waiter if this is the \"New normal\" at this location and he told me that they measure it out in the back. He said he'd bring me extra turkey, which he never did but probably just got distracted so not a if deal.   However, I will say if this was my first time at Postino and I got this panini as my meal, I would probably not return. If I wanted focaccia I would've asked for just the bread."}
{"text":"Okay now I love Postinos BUT with all the new locations opening I HIGHLY encourage them to update and expand their menu! Postinos has had the same menu for as long as I can remember and they switch out 1 seasonal bruschetta option. They offer nothing (except the bruschetta) for dinner. I am bummed when this restaurant is suggested just because I know it will be the same 3 salads and 4 sandwich options. GET SOME NEW ITEMS!"}
{"text":"If you have made it for happy hour, you have just hit jackpot! Regardless, I've never been disappointed by this place. We frequently do work lunches here and the outdoor seating is also great for sharing a bottle of wine on dates!  The service, ambiance and menu are all top notch! Don't take my word for it, go check it out for yourself :)"}
{"text":"This was an excellent find on Saturday night.  My wife and I stopped in after walking by it and the food was fantastic. They had a nice wine selection and also Victory Prima Pilsner which is a favorite of mine.  The bartenders were nice.  The Bruschetta is quite large and we ordered 2 the first time and then came back after the football game and ordered 4 more.    The entire experience was nice.  The one downside was a bartender who we basically didn't even speak to just came over and gave us our check like he was saying \"time to leave,\" and we had only been there for 30 minutes.  It was obviously a mistake but it is not a professional way to go about things.  Our normal bartender fixed the problem.  They are a little unorganized there so if they tighten up their processes then it would be a 5-star review."}
{"text":"Oh Postino, how I love you. I could sing about the $5 pitchers of beer, it makes me so happy. Then there's the bruschetta. Oh goodness. I could eat a whole board by myself. My only wish is that I thought up this concept and owned the restaurant myself."}
{"text":"The place is so cool and the employees are incredible.  We really enjoyed the unique appetizers and beer selection.  The bruschetta was awesome and especially liked the Nine Iron."}
{"text":"Love love their bruschetta boards, they're to die for. The atmosphere is very lively, and I always love to sit on the patio. It's is a perfect place to have a date night or a night out with your friends to have a glass of wine. Their prices aren't too bad and they also have a great happy hour with $5 pitchers of beer and $5 glasses of wine. I get the same thing every time I come here but the bruschetta boards are what brings me back every time."}
{"text":"My roommate and I love this place we come during the week for lunch to have a amazing bruschetta board, and again on the weekend for the best brunch ever. This place never disappoints! The wait staff is amazing and works together so well, and not to mention every guy that works there is so handsome!  10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Nothing beats the amazing wine and board nights!  No matter what time of day it is I am always willing to enjoy a nice Postino date.  If you are looking for a nice urban oasis to enjoy a glass of wine while eating the highest quality bruschetta you will ever get, I would recommend enjoying your day here.  The ambiance alone makes you feel as if you are in a different state."}
{"text":"It's a cute concept, fun place buy the food selection needs to be more substantial.  It's just a glorified bar."}
{"text":"We are huge fans of postino. This was our first visit to the Tempe one. Bruschetta and wine were amazing as always. However, there was an employee (I think was the manager) eating out of a trader joe's bag (maybe popcorn). She shared with about 4-5 other servers, all of whom would put hand to mouth eating right there in public view. None of them washed their hands before going to tables. The manager handled some knives afterwards. We were so disgusted we left without having anything else. This is so unsanitary.  We won't be back to this postino."}
{"text":"Checked out a new spot! This is a great location for this restaurant. You have the option to sit on the patio (they have heaters) or inside! The service was great. There were quite a few different waiters that stopped to check on us. I had the chicken raspberry salad. It was incredible. My friend had the red pepper soup and panini. She said she liked her selections, especially the soup.  I would recommend this spot to anyone and I look forward to going there again... Except next time I'll make sure to go when I'm not working to have some wine! :)"}
{"text":"Love coming here for a place to hang out have some wine and light food!  Awesome place love the one on cental too! however atmosphere at this one is more fun and  upbeat. Music was a variety for all age groups which was cool.  Love coming here for a late lunch brought our friends from out of town they thought it was great also.  Totally recommend the butcher's platter and bruchetta. Most of the bruchetta options are to die for. And of course wine and beer."}
{"text":"The bruschetta is really good. Great wine specials. The menu is limited but if you like bruschetta you are all set. The service is great and the patio is perfect."}
{"text":"My first time here, a little uncomfortable. The service isn't great, I came here with my friends celebrating their graduation. My friends had a drink before hand and were not drunk by any means. The server sent the manager over. He was just as confused as we were. Food and wine were decent. They have good deals for board and bottle"}
{"text":"Pretty cheap and reasonable. Food was good - soup and sandwich was enough for a light lunch."}
{"text":"Having only been here once and having sampled just a small portion of their menu, it was hard to justify writing a worthy review of this place--however, their food was so insanely good, that I had to cement my legacy in the history books of Yelp's Postino page as soon as possible, because this place will drop you literally into food heaven.  I came here with two friends and we ordered two Bruschetta boards, which was more than enough for the 3 of us (I was with two girls, so if you roll in with a party of guys, err on the side of ordering more).  To all other restaurants out there: THIS is Bruschetta done right.  On each board, they give you the option of four different types of bruschetta, and each bruschetta is a sizable portion (~6 inch) divided into anywhere between 4-6 slices.  With 8 of their overall 12 types of bruschetta sitting on the table, I can't recall a single type that I didn't like. Moreover, they keep a seasonal piece available, giving you an even better reason to come back.   I highly recommend the Prosciutto for the meat lovers, the Salmon for the pescetarians, and the brie apples with fig for the straight-up vegetarians, as they were all my favorite :) they were all quite tasty and unique though, so do give them all a worthy chance!   This place comes highly recommended by many in the Phoenix area, and for good reason.  It makes me sorely regret the numerous times I turned down this place while I was a student at Arizona State University.  Postino will have to await my return visit before I reward them with star #5."}
{"text":"Best bruschetta. Every kind is so yummy and well prepared.   Salads are very fresh and organic. The paninis are also phenomenal."}
{"text":"The food at Postino Annex was actually good, but they fell down on service. We had brunch on Sunday, and there were only a few tables of guests. They had 10 employees wandering around mostly chit chatting with each other, but not checking on us. We had to chase down a coffee refill, and the employee we found (not our server) seemed annoyed. We had to chase down hot sauce, and actually walk over to the bar to gain attention. As mentioned earlier, we were one of only a few tables with guests, but once they saw I had an empty plate they tried to rush us by removing the plate and putting pressure on my companion to finish. This would be understandable if the restaurant was packed and they want to increase table turnover, but not when there is hardly anyone there. This place has great potential, but the staff needs training."}
{"text":"Get the bruschetta!! It's definitely a must when you come here. I also have had the mozzarella, mmmmm so good. It's a really cute place for a date, not too crowded or noisy, not in college town, but close, so do expect a younger crowd."}
{"text":"High energy spot practically on the ASU campus. The staff were friendly, but seemed to have difficulty keeping up with even a weekday evening summer crowd (think long wait for any food to appear, long wait for the check to appear...). The beer and food were perfectly adequate, but nothing stood-out as destination dining."}
{"text":"This is one of a kind place. If you are in this neighborhood you have to check it out. The team that runs this place operates like a family. Anyone can come and take your order and then everyone will come and check on you. Kim the manager is amazing now on the food part.  I have never been to a place which has a collection of bruschetta one better than the other. My favorite was the fig and green apple one and then we had a big argument for the second position which was split between the salmon and the artichoke one. They have a massive collection of beers and I actually missed my friend Ken  my beer buddy :)  Bottom line this is a must come and enjoy place whenever you can,  one of a kind"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in for dinner on a Sunday and we were more than halfway done with our food, when across from us in a booth were two old people who would not stop sucking face. I told the guy who refilled our water if he could tell them to get a room and he quickly walked away without saying anything. We waited for a bit thinking he was grabbing someone else for us. He didn't.   So I flagged down (a waiter?) Christian, who actually told me \"this is a romantic setting, just don't look at it\" and stormed off without letting me reply (he made it really tempting to storm off w/o paying). At this point, it's obvious Christian has no idea what good customer service or romance are. He offered to move us but I was nearly done with my food, and besides, I expected Postino's to be a classier establishment. Two people making out and getting handsy for an excessive amount of time kills a restaurant vibe (and my appetite), but I'm not in the food industry so who knows.. And no, nobody else complained because we were the only other customers in that corner of the restaurant who could see it.  I understand this isn't an everyday occurrence, but I was exercising my right as a customer to tell management why I'm not having a 100% great dining experience. If they tell me they can't/won't do anything, I understand that I don't have to continue eating there. What really disappointed me now was Christian's lousy behavior.  Christian also failed to grab the manager, which you're supposed to do when a customer has a complaint, so when our waiter comes by I ask HIM to bring over the manager. By now I'm 99% done with my food and the old people had been going at it for about 20 minutes.  Manager comes by and tells us \"sorry but we can't say anything to them if they're not being handsy\" to which I replied \"they are!\" Manager did not acknowledge this nor Christian's rude behavior when I told him what Christian said/did to us. When I finally said I don't think I'll be returning to this location because this overtly sexual behavior is okay here, he left to go grab a ticket for ONE free entree to give to the TWO of us in hopes we keep returning to this location. Between the uninterested manager and X-tian, I think another location will be worth the drive.  ALSO, the tomato/mozzarella bruschetta is way too salty. I get it every time and need to wipe it down with my finger or it'll taste like pure salt."}
{"text":"Perfect salad, soup, sandwich place with  Value wine and beer pairings.  Everything is put together nicely and easy to order. Not a huge selection, but it works  like about perfect !!  The staff is great and helpful - they know the menu, wines, and beers very well and that is impressive.   Can't wait to back - they don't do a lot here, but what they do is great and speedy !  Did the happy hour - Had a nice soup, sandwich, and excellent glass of wine for under$20. Nice value :)"}
{"text":"All of there locations are very good but this one is right on the ASU campus so has a special vibe. Happy Hour runs every day from open until 5 with $5 glasses of wine and draft beer pitchers. The bruscettas are awesome and clearly their best seller (you have to try the fig, apple and brie - devine).  Their pretzel board is also scrumptious.  The beer and wine list is diverse enough to have something for everyone."}
{"text":"I love Postino's. I've been going to the one in central Phoenix for years and was so excited when I found out there's one in Tempe. This location is always busy but we were able to find seats at the bar. The happy hour specials are great!   Don't miss the bruschetta! It is the best in the valley! I've been other places and I'm always disappointed if the bruschetta doesn't come out like Postino's. Their wine selection is superb. I haven't heard of half the vintages they carry and it's always a good chance to try something new!"}
{"text":"Having been to all the Postinos locations, can you tell I'm a fanatic, this has to be my personal fave for three big reasons. One, its proximity to mill avenue. Granted if you're not in the bar hopping Mill Ave demographic you won't understand how awesome this place is for a good pregame before hitting the night out on Mill. Their happy hour is pretty awesome! $5 glasses of vino or pitcher of beer! Two, their bruschetta! Need I say more? Three, the set up is a little different but the outdoor seating is perfect for groups small or big and the back end of the space is great for small get togethers or parties."}
{"text":"Great staff! Came for a bachelorette party and our server did great seeing as we had a larger group. The patio is so comfortable and romantic with the couches and lights I loved it. Their bruschettas are good, lots to choose from. What I keep coming back to Postino for though is their BRUSSELS SPROUT SALAD! OMG ITS SO GOOD! I crave it all the time. Please just trust me and get it. It's perfect."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with a great friend of mine. Upon arriving, I was a bit worried because the brunch joint next door was packed with a wait and postinos was essentially dead.   We were immediately greeted and sat outside where we could enjoy the beautiful Arizona spring. The menu presented a few lunch and brunch choices, all of which seemed great. I ordered a bellini and the fruit and yogurt.   All was fantastic. The service was great and we were checked on constantly by more than just our waitress. Not sure why the place was lacking customers!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite! Everytime I go there, I only order bruscettas and they are surely one of the greatest in Arizona!!!"}
{"text":"Updated review I meant to post a long while ago! Better late than never. After posting a somewhat unsatisfied review, the general manager contacted me and graciously offered to refund our meal! Because I didn't have a receipt, he sent a gift card--which we used to visit again. Thank you for the great management and customer service!  Since then, I've been back twice with my partner. Today--the whole experience was fabulous! Great, quick service. Delicious food--we especially like the green chili chicken soup. The bruschettas were much more flavorful than the day I posted my first review. Maybe an off day? In any case, give Postinos a chance or two. I'm impressed! (Also great patio seating)"}
{"text":"We were surprised that two of the best things on the menu besides bruschetta, is the coffee and the homemade scones.  They are so amazing!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!!! Monday and Tuesday nights they have an amazing bottle & board deal for $20. I always get the bruschetta or a salad and they are always amazing, my favorite is the warm artichoke bruschetta. Definitely always a good pick for dinner"}
{"text":"I have never had bad service at any postino locations. All the staff are always happy to help you and so friendly, making it such an enjoyable experience!! I've been a million times, only ever had the bruschetta! It's to die for, seriously."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome. Calmer feel and dimmer lighting, able to sit inside and out. I will be returning soon to try all the boards they have to offer! Pictured is the cheese board! So many wonderful tastes!"}
{"text":"Love their bruschetta! My favorite is apple and fig sauce and smoked salmon, my husband likes bacon and roasted pepper. Their panini is very good too. Service good! Environment pleasant. Friday night is still have place to sit outside, enjoy sunset and great food. Nice!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken moz and it was so good!! Jake was our waiter and he was incredible! He definitely deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"Best tuna salad sandwich I've ever had with a walnut salad. This place was absolutely delicious, and very reasonably priced"}
{"text":"I normally only come here on their board & bottle nights -- $20 after 8PM, BUT I had some friends in town & met them here on Fri night & it was just as crowded & delicious :) the wine is really good, we always get Notebook. And then the best thing on the menu is of course the bruschetta, all of them are really good.. haven't had one I don't like yet (my favorite though is Warm Artichoke Spread). Normally the bruschetta fills me up because the board itself is huge but the salads are & sandwiches are good as well. Highly recommend it here :) Also, nice ambiance, great patio!"}
{"text":"Management - send praises to your server Mikey! My friends and I manage Culinary Dropout nearby and we were blown away by his genuine hospitality tonight. We'll ask for him next time!"}
{"text":"Had the best lunch today with my hubby. Shared a bruschetta (1/2 gluten/free) Highly recommend the warm Artichoke Spread and Brie & Apples with Fig Spread!   Also shared the freshest, most delicious Sunshine Daydream salad.   Service was amazing and atmosphere for the laid back, with 80's music playing. Perfect afternoon!"}
{"text":"Amazing wine! Amazing snacks and bites! Such a great place to go and just be around friends and get a drink. Everyone that works here is so helpful and they all help each other out. Love the bruschetta boards and the Riesling"}
{"text":"Postino has long been one of my favorite restaurants in town so I was beyond excited when they opened a location closer to my home. And upon first visit they totally lived up to my expectations.  My boyfriend and I went for dinner on a weeknight. It was pretty busy but we managed to get a good table right away. It's much larger than the original location. We started with the butcher's block, which has a few different kinds of meats, cheeses, nuts and bread. It's all fresh and yummy.   For my meal I got my favorite - the prosciutto and brie sandwich. This is seriously my favorite sandwich anywhere. It has a ton of prosciutto, creamy brie, sweet fig jam and arugula on crusty bread. It doesn't get any better. I also got the mixed greens side salad, which at most places would be really boring but at Postino it's amazingly delicious.  While I may be biased because this location is so close to my house, I have to say I think I like this location even better than the original. It's a very welcome addition to Tempe!"}
{"text":"When I was told \"their bruschetta is really good,\" I thought to myself \"How can tomatoes and toast be good enough to be considered a full meal?\" That was before I learned ate at Postino and learned the true meaning of \"bruschetta.\" Let me just say, I came here for two meals during my 3 day stay in Tempe. Everything was amazing, service was great, and the atmosphere just made me happy. Can't wait to visit AZ again, if only for Postino."}
{"text":"Waited around a half hour to be seated, but for the most part it was worth it. Ordered a lot of bruschetta despite the arguably high price and enjoyed every piece of it. Our waitress was very accommodating and corrected an error with our order graciously. The bass from the music is way too much but people can still hear each other for the most part. The only big suggestion I have is that it would be much better if the bruschetta boards would allow more flavors instead of just four because even with two boards it's not enough to try every single flavor..."}
{"text":"We recently catered an event at Postino Annex. Catering service was great and the coordinator was responsive and helpful. Our catering spread was beautiful and delicious! The back space behind the wine shelves was a good area for our group size. Servers during the start of our event were attentive and responsive. However, towards the last half of our event we had to search for servers to request water pitcher refills and our guests were asking for a server so they could order more or close out tabs.  Otherwise, we had great service and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food like every other Postino location. I'm giving 4 stars because while waiting for a table, we order a bottle of wine and 2 waters. Wine was delivered promptly, but it's summer and we walked here so we really needed that water. We were told we couldn't have water yet because they were out of water glasses. It's Arizona, I'll drink water out of just about anything. Give it to me in a bowl, on a plate, in a potted plant, I don't care. I'll drink it when I need it!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great dog friendly patio, huge selection of beverages you can not go wrong! The staff too very positive and attentive! Highly  recommend this and the original location in Downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic spot for lunch. Really excellent beer being sold for $5 per pitcher? Delicious high-quality ingredients? Super-friendly staff? YES PLEASE!   The bruschetta is varied and delicious, the paninis are creative yet well balanced, and the salads are light and flavorful. Despite this, prices are completely reasonable.   The beer selection isn't huge, but it's high quality and covers all of the bases. Even better, from 11am-5pm, 2.5 pint pitchers are $5!  Due to unforeseen circumstances, my party and I had to hastily pack up and go; the staff was super-helpful about packing our food to go and were very nice to us about the whole thing.   This place is just awesome. Eat here."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely great! I dine at Postino's almost every week and try something different each visit. Everything is fresh and delicious. My favorites are the Turkey Panini on Ciabatta bread, Mixed Greens Salad, and the Cucumber Honey Lemonade!"}
{"text":"Bottle & board on Monday/Tuesday is my favorite. The bruschetta are huge and every wine I've ever tried here has been amazing. Whenever I've asked a waiter for a recommendation on wine they've always picked out the perfect one. Love it here :)"}
{"text":"What a happy hour! Don't miss it for the 40 oz pitchers of beer for only $5.  The food looked good, but we only enjoyed the brew and wine."}
{"text":"I had to hit the latest Postino restaurant before the big ASU game. (Fear the Fork!) We expected the same great menu items as our fave Central location, and while they had the same menu, they just didn't quite measure up to their big, good looking brother downtown. They are more the weak, pale brother who does well in math. The chicken salad lacked the right balance, the pieces of apple were huge, very little gorgonzola. The sandwiches seemed to lack the right amount of meat. And part of the sandwich had none at all, just a corner of bread...and when your splitting that results in feeling cheated! Its right next to the stadium, the seating was airy and nice view of people and everything else."}
{"text":"Like the other Postino's there's a great atmosphere, great drink specials (happy hour daily from 11-5p with $5 mini pitchers of beer) and good food.  The staff were very friendly and the only real downside is parking.  With the restaurant practically on campus you'll likely be paying to park on the street.  If you're day drinking in Tempe, looking for a great date spot, or simply want a quick bit to eat you're do yourself well here."}
{"text":"Great location, and you can't beat $5 glasses of wine.  Food is unique and satisfying.  We sat at the bar because it's usually more social,  and you get to chat with the staff.  Not much interaction today, although the gal serving us did take care of us, but no conversation beyond our orders, thus a 4 today."}
{"text":"Postino is always amazing! Who knew ASU was so classy with Bruschetta? The food is so good I had to give it five stars. The service is average but you kind of expect that near a college campus.   I change up my bruschetta options from time to time but this last time I ordered: the mozzarella, tomato and basil, the barrata, arugula and bacon, the prosciutto, fig, and mascarpone, and the salmon and pesto. The flavors blend so well. You can't really go wrong with any of them!"}
{"text":"I don't write a lot of reviews so for me to write a review means it was a great experience. I'm not a wine drinker, but I really enjoyed Postino in Tempe. The atmosphere of the restaurant is incredible. The staff was very attentive and the food was great. The service was fast and I can't emphasize enough how friendly the staff was. The prices were fair, especially the five dollar mini pitcher of beer. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Lovely decor and layout-there's an outdoor bar and seating. Great for people watching-especially the staff who are an interesting, diverse (in personality and dress) crowd.  Loud lively music ranging from today's top hits to 90's rap which I enjoyed. Was greeted quickly and given ice water and a menu. After I ordered my food and first drink unfortunately I was forgotten. I had to ask for ice water refill, second drink and extra toasts for my butcher block appetizer even though I was sitting in front of the bartender. Although wine list boasts \"best wine selection in the world\" in my opinion It was not. Included were trendy new wines which are popular with the naive college crowds (Malbec, how novel!). The butcher block appetizer was presented very nicely and had a perfect mix of salty and sweet as well as textures. Would've given 4 stars if service was more attentive and wine list was better."}
{"text":"I'm pretty impressed by this place. The atmosphere is very trendy and modern, while their food is well prepared and high quality. They offer good options with a well diverse menu - they will accommodate for vegetarians and even gluten free, despite the fact that their menu is heavy in gluten items. The have a great offer for a \"Board and Bottle\" for $20 on Monday and Tuesdays after 8PM, where you can get 4 bruschetta and a full bottle of house wine for $20. Postino's is located in what used to be called the \"Art Annex\" on ASU's Tempe campus and was renovated into two restaurants in recent years. Their food is savory and is great place to eat if you love wine."}
{"text":"Love the $5 glass of wine before 5 pm deal and the Brussels sprout salad was major yumz, but I'm super bummed that they don't do a sangria. That's a big disappointment for me at a wine bar with a fun, lively patio. There's nothing better than a fruity sangria on a warm day. I get that they don't have a full bar, but I'm totally okay with a liquor-less sangria. I was also disappointed with the prosciutto panini. The flavor was there, but the prosciutto was tough to bite through and large pieces would come out of the sandwich as I tried to tear off a bite. Not sure what's up with that. Between that and the lack of sangria, I give this place 3.5, but I'll round up to 4 because I would like to go back and try the delicious looking bruschetta flight."}
{"text":"Postino's is a super fun place to go for date night or for Happy Hour! Their $20 bruschetta and wine on Mondays and Tuesday's is one of the best deals around and even though you can almost always expect a wait, it's well worth it.  The bruschetta board is perfect to split and you get to select four different types. My favorite bruschetta are the salmon and pesto, prosciutto with fig & mascarpone, and ricotta with dates and pistachio.   They also have $5 pitchers of beer and glasses of wine during Happy Hour (before 5pm) :)"}
{"text":"We have always loved Postino, so when our son's darling girlfriend turned 21, Postino is where she wanted to go!  So we did and from start to finish, everything was perfect!  First of all, the very nice hostess gave us a choice to sit outside at a very cool almost party-like sitting area with couches and such.  We requested a heater, which was provided right away. She also nicely explained that we would have to give up our table in 3 hours to a reservation party and we were totally cool with that.  I sure appreciated having the option to be outside right away instead of having to wait for a table inside.  Then our waiter, Christian was also perfect, fun, personable, professional and right on task with all that we requested.  He suggested perfect menu items and made sure that everything went well with our 21 bday theme.  We will definitely return. We never had to look for him and we kept him busy!  He was always right there with all that we needed and we all enjoyed chatting with him, too!  Thank you Postino and Christian for making our memory so memorable!"}
{"text":"came here since the POS place next door couldn't get us in..  couple of us ordered the farm scramble and it just didn't do it,, it wasn't filling and it seemed like it was missing something."}
{"text":"We called at 4pm for a reservation at 5:30pm. The person on the phone told us don't take reservation for parties under 8 but there is \"plenty\" of open table and we shouldn't have a problem. We went and there at 5:30pm and encounter a 45min wait because they have a party of 100 people in the back.  Really? you didn't know about this and couldn't understand that it would be limited seating and busy...especially on a Friday night? We went to the bar while we waited and had a few drinks. Bartenders were excellent: curious, fast, etc. I noticed quite a few open tables on the patio even one right behind us.  We also noticed a table for 3 had a reservation sign on it and yup 3 people walked in and were sat at that table...no reservations for parties under 8...that's BS. We finally got our table after a 40min wait and you guess it, it was the open table right behind us. jeez, we could have been seated there to begin with. It was open the whole time. The waiter came over and asked us if we wanted to order something, we told him to give us a few minutes to look over the menu. He came back 10min later and we ordered food. A sandwich and bruschetta...simple enough. He disappeared.  Another server/staff asked if we wanted water; took over 10min to get. Yet another 10min goes by and we wanted to order more drinks , waiter wasn't around.  He way busy chatting with other tables. We saw another server and asked if he could get our waiter so we can order drinks. He said they are team servers and anyone could get us drinks, food, etc....strange concept.  He brought back our drinks....still no main waiter to be found and never checked on us. Our food took 40min to get to us...way to long for something simple. It was served by yet another waiter. After the food was delivered, our initial waiter asked us if it looked ok and then disappeared again...never to be seen by us till we complained later on.  We wanted more drinks, and no one was around to wait on us. We decided it wasn't worth staying and looked for our waiter to get our bill. Again, he was at the same 2 table chatting and flirting for 8 minutes. I went to the hostess and asked for someone to get our bill. She was surprised our waiter didn't attend to us. Our waiter came to our table and asked what was wrong. After we explained the poor service he said\" I'm sorry you feel that way\"....REALLY? how about \"sorry, I screwed up and forgot about you\". He acted like he did nothing wrong. We gave him gift cards to pay the bill. Then the manager came over and wanted to understand the problem. We explained everything, she apologized, cited the big party (which is a bad excuse) and said she would comp the bill, which was nice. She explained the \"team server\" process they used and said it sometimes doesn't work the best but they are trying. I think they should go back to 1 server per table and crew member to support food delivery and cleaning tables, filling water, prepping (like most restaurants do). Overall it was one of the worst experiences we had at a restaurant in a while and wrecked the mood for the night. We won't be going back to this place.  It was very disappointing since we read so many good reviews about this place online."}
{"text":"I work right down the street and I love to go to their bottle and board nights on Monday and Tuesday. It is such an amazing deal. It gets packed but it is really worth any wait. The servers are very attentive and knowledgable. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Went for my birthday dinner with a large party of 12.  They set up a nice big table for us in the back overlooking the patio.  Despite the large size of our group the service didn't suffer one bit.  Our waitress was excellent.  Prompt drink orders, refills on waters, food order in their right place.   They have spectacular happy hour specials.  You get a mini pitcher of beer for $5.  There was at least 2 pints of beer in the pitcher.  Killer deal.  The glasses of wine were all $5 too.  Which is more than 50% off most of the glasses.  The happiest of happy hours.   The food was excellent.  The menu was small but everything was on point.  We started with the butchers block and 8 of their bruschettas.  All of them were good.  I repeat ALL of them were good. I didn't even get to try some of them because they flew off the plates.   For my entree I got the \"pick two\" with a Brussels salad and their soup of the moment.  The soup was a coconut, carrot, curry."}
{"text":"I rarely use Yelp to write reviews unless I have particular feedback to give.  My experience at Postino Arcadia and Central have been great, mostly because I take advantage of their wine/bruschetta combo. Postino Annex is a different story. I went there for lunch (which was a 1st for me) so I ordered the Italian Picnic salad. The waitress was very nice and helpful.  The description says: Fresh greens tossed with roasted beets, goat cheese, bacon and walnuts topped with crisped root vegetables in herb vinaigrette.  Sounds great right? I'm vegan so I asked for no cheese and no bacon, and instead I asked to add quinoa and extra root vegetables (and I asked the waitress to charge me extra if needed).  What came to my table was: Fresh greens - Yes Roasted beets - No. Not roasted, just very soft cooked COLD golden beets. Not seasoned, not anything. My guess is they were from a can.  Walnuts - Yes Crisped root vegetables - No. I asked for extra of these and there were NONE. What they put instead was this tortilla-like strips of root-vegetable colors that tasted like, well, tortilla strips. There wasn't any root vegetables to be seen.  Herb vinaigrette - Barely any dressing on, was on the dry side.  The quinoa I requested to be added was I kid you not, less than a tablespoon mixed throughout the salad.  For $9.50 at Pita Jungle I could've gotten a giant, fresh, real crisped root vegetables salad that satisfied me and had actual substance. This joke of a salad came to my table and when my waitress asked after 2 seconds if it looked good I said yes (it did looked good).  As I searched for the vegetables and the quinoa I realized they had given me whatever that was, and my waitress NEVER came back to check on me again when I wanted to ask a few questions about my salad. A good half hour and I would see her maybe walking by fast, not looking our way.  Not her fault (she was super sweet, very nice, I liked her a lot) but I was not happy with my salad at all, and the cold soft beets and tortilla strips were super disappointing.   So no, I will not be coming back. No good vegetarian/vegan options and any substitutions you may ask for may or may not work out.  -Julie"}
{"text":"Great ambience.  I had the roast beef sandwich on ciabbata bread and the salad instead of the chips.    Wonderful salad dressing.    Recommend."}
{"text":"There was a mix up with our order. The manager made our check on the house. GREAT paninis (get the 9 iron)! Great music and environment. Friendly staff. An interesting first experience but I'll recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for a recent AZ Instameet and was surprised by the quality of the food! I mean I understood the concept of the place but did not think it would be pulled off so well! They've really set the bruschetta game standard, and also have great meat/cheese plates. The drink list includes both local and out of state craft beers which I really like. And the music! Oh my lord they have the best chill music choice of any place I've been to in the area. The outdoor patio is nicely designed as is the interior, giving off an upscale feel while still allowing some room for the casual. I can't wait to return for brunch and to try one of their mimosas!"}
{"text":"First time here and I will definitely be back. Wine was delicious, food was divine and service was impeccable. Vivian was our server and she was wonderful . Very helpful especially when choosing wine to compliment food. It is obvious she has a vast knowledge of wines (thank goodness because I have little to none). I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good food, great wine, high quality service and relaxed ambiance. Postino's will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Always loved the original Postino's, but honestly think I like this one best now. Great service. Happy hour is always a pleasant experience, whether for girls night out or date night. Breakfast is great with the family. My girlfriends and I have been known to take advantage of the mimosas by the bottle, too. Love sitting at the bar when the sun sets. Stagedive is my wine of choice with the decadent artichoke bruschetta."}
{"text":"I kinda don't want to post this because I don't want people flooding this joint like the others.  It's nice to come here whether after I'm done teaching or for brunch and there's not a huge wait to sit down. That doesn'thappen at the other locations. When school is in session, it's a pain to a park.  I teach at ASU so I have a pass, but my friends do not.  That's the only downfall to the new location.  Otherwise, you've got the standard fabulousness of Postino's:  great food, a stellar wine selection, fantastic happy hour, awesome patio, and great bruschetta boards!"}
{"text":"Hipster/Romantic setting. Service is always great here. Nothing to complain other than waiting time. Sometime(especially on Monday and Tuesday nights for $20 deal-bottle of wine and a bruschetta board) the place does get busy and you might have to wait up to an hour for a table. A good way to get around this is that you can make a reservation at anytime with a party of 6 or more. If you don't meet that requirement, there are also seats by the bar. I personally like the bar since the service there is more personalized and quick due to the many bartenders that are always there.   Favorite and most basic wine choice for me here is their Moscato. Their bruschetta board is always amazing but if you want to try something new, always ask for the seasonal, it's most likely to be delicious. Also, check out the panini and soup combo if you're not up to eating bruschetta. If you still have room for more, try their creme brûlée, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am a huge Postino fan and frequently visit the Arcadia and Highland locations, but I've been to this Annex a couple times now and have been impressed every time! Such a great spot, very open feel. Especially perfect when the weather cools down a bit :)  The last time we went was a great experience, Dan H was very friendly and set us up with a nice big tables in the back. We had amazing service from our waitress Gabriela - she navigated our large party with ease. Thank you both!  Food is amazing as always. :) My go-to din is the half/half with Mixed Greens Salads and Chicken Mozzarella Panini. Of course you can't go wrong with bruschetta either! Faves there are smoked salmon, artichoke dip, and burrata and bacon. I heart you Postino!"}
{"text":"I could eat the brie apple with figs/dates/pistachio whatever bruschetta until I explode. I love how simple their menu is -- they do one thing, and they do it right!"}
{"text":"Postinos has been a favorite of mine for awhile Their bruschetta is obviously a big draw My favorite ones are the fig and marscapone also the tomato jam Their paninis are huge so watch out if you're looking for a light meal with those"}
{"text":"Went to Postinos for brunch this morning and was very disappointed. The plates were very small for such a high price. The brunch menu was small compared to other restaurants and they charged 50 cents extra for cheese to be added to the small amount of eggs to the plate. Great place for dinner and happy hour but not for brunch."}
{"text":"Postinos is a great little place to have a glass of wine and a bite to eat. I've been here many times but today's visit will make me rethink my next visit. Upon arrival, there was a 25 min wait to be seated, but there were tables available.. lots of tables available. These sections were also being waited on so I was quite confused.. whatever, we wait waited. When we were finally seated, it took 15 mins for our waiter to come over. He took our order, and after 45 mins our food finally came. We ordered bruschetta and salad. Why did it take 45 mins?! Our waiter never came back after that. We had to go ask another server for the check. Overall, lunch took about 2 hours. Will definitely skip Postinos next time and go to La Bocca."}
{"text":"So our new  beach cruiser biker gang stopped by after a nice 10 mile cruise on a gorgeous day.  We were lookin for some cool drinks and light snacks to refuel before the ride back.  We were promptly seated on the patio, so we could keep an eye on our sweet rides.  None of us thought to bring a lock... :(  rookies!!  We were quickly given some menus and waters.  And then... we waited.  I'd say about 3-4 minutes before someone came by to take our drink orders.  We should have just ordered food right away.  It took another couple minutes for some iced teas.  And another couple minutes to come back for the food orders.  We thought maybe we were just being grumpy hungry riders.  Then we looked around.  It seemed like the service was pretty slow throughout patio area.  There were quite a few filled tables, with what looked like 2 people handling them all.  But the 3 behind the bar looked like they had it good, just standing there chatting it up.  How about jumping over the bar and help out with the customers?   Some had the half paninis and half salad combos.  Others had the full paninis with the side salad.  For me, the full panini and basic side salad was the better value.  I think we will make the trek again, and give it another shot.  The food was good.  Though, the bruchetta looked awesome!  So we will have to try it!  We just hope the service steps it up a bit."}
{"text":"Postinos is located right off Mill Ave where it fills a gaping hole that is called Brunch. There are literally 3 brunch spots in downtown Tempe and this is the best. Service is fast, seating is outside, the menu is legit. We highly recommend the Bellinis and Mimosas. I ordered two breakfast, it's a thing. Quick tip, extra bacon $3, one egg on the menu comes with bacon $3, I think you know where I am going."}
{"text":"Love Postinos, especially this location. The venue and surrounding area is nice, the bruschetta and wine selection are superb, and the staff is great! We had Sam for a waitress, and she had a great sense of humor and a fun personality while still being attentive to both us and the other guests as well. The other staff were pleasant as well and helped to check in on us during the super busy part of the evening. Always happy for our after-work dinners and happy hours here!"}
{"text":"$5 glasses of wine until 5 pm? Count me in! Postino always hits the spot, let's be honest. If you can tell me you don't crave their bruschetta boards at all hours of the day - I'm going to have to tell you you're lying! My favorite is subbing the salami on their pesto one with chicken.... SO YUM! Also a must try is their brussel sprout salad, definitely one of my favorites. There is no doubt that Mondays and Tuesday's are the best days to go. After 8 pm you can get a bottle AND board of bruschetta for only $20! However, I'll still splurge and pay the extra money when I'm craving it because like I said before, you can't go wrong! Postino, any location, is one of the valley's hottest spots. Their staff, their food, and their vibes never fail to impress me."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner before, but tried the Monday/Tuesday bruschetta and bottle deal this time.  You get to select four from a larger variety of bruschetta (some really good choices) and get a bottle of red or white wine and it's $20.  The bruschetta is well made with good combinations of ingredients (each one is cut into a couple/few pieces and are definitely large enough to share; all four can easily go two or three ways!).  The wine was good.  We had to wait to get seated, but then weren't rushed to leave.  We sat outdoors; heaters were sufficient even with a fairly cold evening.  Service was cordial.  It's a pleasant, tasty experience that is just priced right!"}
{"text":"Great food at smaller portions (if you want).  I had a cup of delicious soup, a half salad, and that left me room for dessert (and a second glass of wine).  After the first glass, the bartender let me sample a couple other wines to see if something went better with the chocolate Bouchon. In all, it was a nice lively location with a good atmosphere and music. All of the staff were friendly, even those that did not need to interact with me.  One of them called the place 'hipster', but I didn't feel out of place."}
{"text":"Yumm!  Another place to go to enjoy the Postino level of delicious food and terrific service.  Love the ambience.  This one obviously has more of a college crowd feel which is cool too."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times now and this might be my favorite Postino's location. The food, drinks and atmosphere are always great at any of the locations. However, the vibe here is great and if I lived out in the East Valley, I would be there at least twice a week. They need to open one up on the west side now!"}
{"text":"Postino is always the best time! Hannah gave us great service and the manager Jeremiah made us feel extremely welcome and made sure we enjoyed our dinner! We'll be back twice a week or more like usual!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go for a happy hour, beautiful patio and comfy!! Love this is in ASU campus"}
{"text":"Well, I finally got a chance to check this new location out a few weeks ago. It did not disappoint. Same yummy bruschetta as the other Postino locations. We also got a great bottle of red wine for a very reasonable price. It actually was surprisingly not busy; my friends and I did not have to wait at all for a table. That is always a challenge at the one in Gilbert or downtown."}
{"text":"I used to go to Postino every now & then when I was younger, and oddly, when I moved back to AZ about 2 1/2 years ago this place fell off my radar. In the past year I've rediscovered it, and have been to all 4 AZ locations in that time (including this one twice).  I love all Postino's. The food is delicious & consistent, and the service is always friendly. Depending on when you go they can all get pretty crowded. In the two times I've been to this location (both midweek...once for lunch & once for dinner) I was surprised by the crowd. Despite the fact that it's right smack in the middle of ASU's campus I didn't get a real college-y vibe. Granted, Postino doesn't seem like a typical restaurant you'd find on a college campus.   The one thing I don't like about this location is the parking situation. Since it is right on ASU's campus parking is scarce & it's metered everywhere.   As far as food/drink, like I said, it's your typical yummy Postino. You can never go wrong with a bruschetta board (I think by this point I've tried them all, and I can't think of single one I don't like). The sandwiched are all delicious as well. Also the $5 glass of wine deal until 5 o'clock every day is great."}
{"text":"I love this new location. I think its bigger than the one in Gilbert and Central Phx. The patio is nice too, there are so many couches to get cozy, not right now but when the weather gets nicer and not too cold, they have heaters too. The bathroom is located outside by the entrance. The stalls in the bathroom were made of steel and it was huge. The service was good. The food was delicious like the other locations. Parking was not bad at all, we found one right next to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Postino is great! I was in with my boyfriend for brunch today. He had the French toast and I had the granola. Both were very reasonably priced and so good! Our server was attentive and everything was brought correctly and quickly to us. I've been to this postino and others several times before for panini, bruschetta, and wine. Always a lovely experience! Postino is one of my favorites. Well priced and well worth it."}
{"text":"Went here with a few ladies and we all loved the atmosphere, wine, and the food we ordered. Service was excellent as well. No one ordered bruschetta though, so I can't comment on that. Will definitely be back for a full meal another time!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Went with a large group and ordered wine and bruschetta for hours. Great atmosphere. We tried many types of bruschetta: warm artichoke, smoked salmon with capers and red onion, brie & apple, traditional, white bean with chopped tomatoes, and bacon, burrata, tomato and arugula.    They were all on thick slices of bread and generously loaded with the toppings.  I loved all of them, but the smoked salmon with capers and red onion stood out as the best one. Absolutely delicious.    We tried the Cabernet Sauvingnon and Malbec.  Enjoyed both of these full-bodied wines, perhaps the Malbec ever-so-slightly more than the Cab.   Service was a bit slow. Wasn't a big deal since we were planning on being there for several hours.     The $20 deal for bruschetta and a bottle of wine was awesome. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I go to postino at least once a week, and the food is always consistently delicious. Their panini's are all very good, although I sometimes wish they would switch up the menu once in a while. The service has always been great, but Christian is by far the most friendly and attentive server I've had. He always makes sure everything is tasting good, and that our water glasses are full."}
{"text":"This was a great brunch place! I went on a Sunday morning (around 11am) and there was a wait for a table but it was only a half hour or so and honestly, I was expecting a wait. The food was great- I had the Farm Scramble and it was SO good. Also, the mimosas were very good and $5 a glass so win win. I would definitely recommend this to others and I hope to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Menu is pretty limited. Really just bruschetta, cheese boards, and paninis. I ordered a bruschetta board with 4 different kinds. It consisted of crusty bread slices topped with brie and figs, green apple and some kind of cheese, tomato and basil, and another with pesto and a thinly sliced meat. I'll admit I wasn't quite sure what was on my plate because my cousin ordered first, and whatever she said sounded awesome, so I told the waitress I wanted the same lol. And I was not disappointed! Also had a glass of Pinot Noir that I liked quite a bit, and I usually don't care for any wine that isn't pretty sweet.  It's a trendy little red-bricked joint right next to Snooze, another favorite of mine. I wouldn't take kids there. I doubt anything on the menu is going to appeal to a child's palette."}
{"text":"Postino's is one of my places to dine in AZ. The bruschetta is the best I've tried. My personal favorites are the brie+apple+fig, warm artichoke, burrata+arugula+bacon, and ricotta+pistachio. The soup of the day is always a good choice to pair with the bruschetta.   Decent happy hour prices and can't beat the Monday and Tuesday wine+bruschetta deal."}
{"text":"I have to tell you, I just came back from Europe and boom, seems like Europe is in Tempe, with the opening of places like the Postino Annex. I love that they created this in a brick building right off of the ASU annex and the whole space is open and inviting with that quality of food and service that by now, is an expected characteristic of the Positno's brand. I had the eggs, bacon and Walnut toast brunch option (that also came with thinly sliced and well crisped fingerling potatoes and onions). I joked with my neighbors that I would dock them a star for not carrying Tabasco but the food was so good that I didn't need any extra kick to it.    For drinks I tried the cucumber and honey lemonade which is $3 and is bottomless (they kept filling it up discretely, part of that excellent service they are known for. I also split a $5 pitcher of micro-brew - any of their beers on draft (and they have a nice selection, local and other craft brews and even a traditional mass produced light beer which I will not comment on but they cater to all tastes, even bad ones (humor!). The view from the patio or the edge of the patio (we sat right on the indoor side to take advantage of the AC) is wonderful - with a stunning view of the mosque, it's golden dome shining in the sun, and with church bells tolling, I assume from the local Catholic Church. I can't wait to go at night and see the house lights, which look just lovely.   As my neighbor noted, they don't do huge portions but what they do, is done well so I'm sure I'll come back over and over again - especially for those $5 pitchers of beer and yes, probably a bottle of wine at times, especially on Monday when they have a plank and a bottle of wine for $20  (good deal!).   Not much else to say except that this is another shining cultural star in the rapidly developing 85281 area code. I expect that when the Rio Salado development is done this place will be as packed as another of the other more seasoned Postino's locations so make sure to get here now so you can enjoy it in a less crowded atmosphere. :-)  Oh, for bike parking, the easiest thing to do is to go across the street to the ASU building where they have lots of good bike racks or you can connect it to up the fence or to one of the wrought iron balustrades around the trees in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food. Great drinks. Great people. Great atmosphere. Great service. Had a reservation tonight for a large group and I couldn't have asked for better service and/or accommodations. Both managers I spoke with on two different days were so friendly and easy! Great place to make memories with friends and loved ones. Kudos."}
{"text":"I don't know guys...I keep telling myself that I'm going to eat other places but here I am, about to go to Postino again. Maybe I'm biased because I used to work at Joyride (On Central and Camelback - Go eat there it's the best), and maybe it's because Upward Projects is one of the best companies out there that serves up delicious food with an amazing staff (I know first hand but again not being biased, just stating the facts)...But Postino has been one of my favorite spots in both Tempe and Uptown since I discovered it almost four years ago. It took me a long time to venture into getting the Bruschetta's because I love the sandwiches so much. The chicken and mozzarella and the turkey are my favorite and please do us all a favor and get it on focaccia because there is just no other way.  I've had the bruschetta a few times now and I've tried a variety of flavors and none of them have been a disappointment. My favorite is and will always be the apple with fig spread. Literally just so good.  I usually go to Postino during work lunches so I don't drink but I love how every Upward Project restaurant has their $5 until 5 (glasses of wine and pitchers of beer). Will continue to come back here until I get sick of it."}
{"text":"I'm newer to the valley and every time someone mentions a great place to try, it's Postino. I went with three other people and everyone loved their meal. For a Saturday night at 730pm, it wasn't crazy busy, nor was there a wait. I loved the ambiance. It's trendy and cozy and the outdoor seating was great. The bruschetta board that I heard so much about was to die for. Everything on my board tasted fresh and delicious. And I would go back in a heartbeat just for that.  The pub board was also amazing, soft pretzels and mustard were just incredible. I need to go back for brunch. But all in all. Very pleased with this place!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a cool place.  Easy going staff, open and fun atmosphere.  If the weather is good, try the nice patio.  One the ASU campus.  The menu is not large, and that is a plus.  The server provided us with a couple of suggestions, answered our questions and was very knowledgeable.  The sandwich suggestion had two different bread options, and I'm glad I went with the server's choice.  Very delicious.  This is a must visit location."}
{"text":"We haven't been at this location in a while. In the neighborhood for lunch, so here we are. We choose to sit outside, plenty of shade if you request. The water server placed our glasses down, first noted and only complaint the glasses were dirty with lipstick and dirty fingerprints. when brought to the attention of our fantastic server, Cameron, it was immediately taken car of and he was very apologetic.  Happy Hour (11:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m.) pitchers of beer for $5 is an excellent deal! Hands down the BEST Bruschetta Board, trust me I've had a lot of bruschetta from other restaurants. I've had all the combinations and all excellent. I also split a Panini: Nine Iron (Hickory smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise) which comes with homemade chips. All the food was very good, fresh and tasty.  My only suggestion to the owners, having been regulars for a while but stopped because the menu items/choices never change, maybe a daily special of at least 1 or 2 added combination of bruschetta would be nice.   Atmosphere, food and service (thanks Cameron) all made an enjoyable Lunch!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my time at a different Postino location, so I was definitely glad to see one open right across the street from campus. Like others have said, it definitely has a different vibe than the other locations. That's to be expected, and trying to cram a trendy & upscale winebar next door to a Subway and Panda Express wouldn't have succeeded so I'm glad to see that they are embracing the college town atmosphere.  You can expect the same stuff that any other Postino has: an eclectic array of bruschetta, a wide variety of alcohol, and decent daily specials. Would I make this an absolute go to for dinner dates? Maybe, but I'd much rather go to the other locations for that. Where the \"Annex\" succeeds is being an awesome lunch spot. $5 pitchers from 11am-5pm? Yes, please. The bruschetta plates can be split between two people for a not-too-filling lunch, so enjoy the Annex for what it is: a great place to mix it up for lunchtime, and a decent place for dinner."}
{"text":"So happy there's a Postino within walking distance from my work. We went for lunch today around noon and were seated inside right away (there was a wait for outside). This Postino's fees a lot larger compared to the one in Arcadia and Gilbert which is nice. Hopefully there will never be a wait during lunch as I see us returning often.   Everyone was very friendly, the service was great, love the decor, and the food was fantastic as always. Our waitress even split our checks for us without having to ask.   Now can we have a Federal Pizza in Tempe or Scottsdale too?"}
{"text":"Amazing food, attentive staff and just a great ambiance! Kim the manager is killing it! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the $5 pitchers til 5! Great atmosphere and food. Patio is ideal for a mid day hangout and lunch with friends. Love the staff!"}
{"text":"Always going in for some fantastic lunch. We always end up with Ian, who is a very energetic guy with a great personality. Cucumber honey lemonade is to die for, thank you staff for being so attentive!"}
{"text":"Postino's in Tempe hurray!!!! I finally have a new spot for lunch that is absolutely divine!! The Tempe Annex is much like the layout of the Uptown version. It is bright and airy, nice patio with beautiful long bar. We came for lunch and I had the split special,  1/2 prosciutto and fig sandwich with the beet salad. It was as mouthwatering as expected and not bad with a $9.95 price tag.   The menu is the same as all the other Postino's and they still do the $5 wines and beers till 5 and the awesome special $20 for a board and wine on Mondays and Tuesdays after 8. I wish they had this location 10 years ago when I went to ASU!"}
{"text":"I met a few friends here on a Sunday evening and we were greeted with low lights and candles on the table. Quite romantic for 3 girls getting together to catch up. Anyway, we each got a glass of wine and the server was really fun, telling us how they all have to go through a training something like once a month and taste all the wines on the menu. Sounds like a tough job. So she gave us good guidance on what to order. We then placed a food order - 2 boards of bruschetta (pretty much ordered every option except for the one with mushrooms) and a kale salad. Love the bruschetta, hands down the best in the valley. Always full of topping and the bread is soft and delicious. The salad was good as well. Overall had fun and enjoyed this new location."}
{"text":"Great daytime happy hour prices, delicious paninis.  Grab a seat outside and enjoy the day & ask for Mikey- THE best server!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite go-to's for brunch. Their wine & brunch menus are awesome & reasonably priced. Even when they're busy (which is usually often) I get tables quickly & great service"}
{"text":"I am rating this 4 stars only based on their board and bottle special on monday it ia a very good deal to come with a group grab some bottles and a bunch of bruschetta amd hang out. They have some really good choices . I will say its easy to feel forgotten about here by your server they have a unique server or staff way of serving tables where a lot of people stop by but if its busy that system can kinda go down sometimes ."}
{"text":"A fantastic place to grab some food and relax. I love stopping by with the girlfriends on Mondays/Tuesdays when they run their $20 board and bottle special after 8pm. The atmosphere is also great for the perfect date night.   My favorite would be the salmon, prosciutto, brie, and pistachio bruschetta. They carry an exclusive zinfandel here and it's always a treat!  Service here is always friendly and promtp. Last time I dined in the kitchen accidentally got one of our bruschetta wrong. We didn't mind the mistake, since it was delicious always, but the waiter went out of his way to fix the problem by gabbing us what we originally wanted."}
{"text":"As always, Postinos never disappoints. Went for brunch on Sunday to this location and it was our first time here. Our waitress was so friendly, sweet, and personable. The patio outside is very relaxed and with the college atmosphere around it was a great place to just lounge. I ordered a pitcher of good hefeweizen and it was only 5$, had the B.E.L.T. sandwich was absolutely delicious and also low priced, This might have been my first postinos visit without bruschetta and I was still not disappointed. Awesome job guys."}
{"text":"Love the bottle and board deal they have here. Me and my girlfriend go here every once in a while and it's a great date place."}
{"text":"I love Postino! No wonder it's such a hot spot!  The $20 for bruschetta and a bottle of wine deal is the best in town!!! The bruschetta is very filling and so delicious, the staff is wonderfully friendly and accommodating, and the wines are delicious!! The most amazing thing is you can choose from ANY of the wines on the wine list!! INSANE!!  I went with a party of four and we got 2 board and bottle deals, a cup of soup, and a chefs board. All of it was awesome!  We got a bottle of malbec and a bottle of prosecco. I don't like red wine, but the malbec was delicious. The prosecco was also spectacular, as was the cava I tasted. I love that they allow you to taste the wines before ordering.  The bruschetta was also very impressive. My favorite was the apple, brie, honey. Also love that they allow you to get it on tomato slices to accommodate low-carb diets.  The chefs board was great and was served with dried cherries, which was a wonderful treat since usually all you get is cranberries or other cheaper dried fruit alternatives. The cherries were a great touch and the goat cheese was delicious!  Can't wait to return. The ambiance can't be beat and the deal is too good to be true!"}
{"text":"I had one of the worst experiences in my life at this restaurant it was my first time too. I ordered a soup as an appetizer didn't get it let them know never received it the server was rude. My alcoholic drink I ordered I also didn't arrive until we finally got the manager involved. Never been treated so bad at a restaurant first time I ever had to get a manager involved. Great location horrible service."}
{"text":"It's a no brainer.  Five bucks for a pitcher of craft beer until 5pm... my goodness!  And they have very decent beer on tap, many different styles to choose from, and the food...oh my the food.  We did the bruschetta board as I'm sure most people do.  My personal opinion is that anyone who eats food needs to put Postino on their list.  Gluten Free? Postino has you covered.  Even their website is really cool!    Service was awesome.  Restaurant cleanliness top notch. Atmosphere superb.  It's a good thing I don't live too close, or I'd be here far more often than I should, and wouldn't see my family as much.  I still can't get over $5 pitchers of beer.  You do realize that the beers they offer in a pitcher would be at least $5 for a pint at many other places?  Unreal."}
{"text":"Good brunch but I think I ordered the wrong thing! I came here with friends for the Downtown Tempe Brunch Crawl. I ordered the walnut toast with Brie and berry preserves ($4) which ended up being 2 kind of small pieces of bread, a LOT of Brie, and some berries. The Brie was incredibly salty which I didn't like very much :(   However I tried some of my friend's orange scone with salted butter and apricot jam ($4) and it was SO GOOD. Flaky and light and fluffy and delicious :)   I'd try Postino again but I just didn't think my dish was special or particularly good."}
{"text":"Postinos is one of my favorite restaurants! The staff is real cool, they have good beer, and yummy bruschetta. The atmosphere is perfect for low key meetings or just talking. It's slightly too expensive... but worth it. I'd suggest going with somebody who won't make you pay the bill lol"}
{"text":"My daughter has been many times and suggested I go with her. We went to the one that opened in Scottsdale. It was very busy, but our wait went by quickly, as they had drink specials and we were able to sit outdoor with them. I have to say, the bruschetta board was delicious. I don't know what I expected, but it was above my expectations. I can't wait to go back again.:)"}
{"text":"we live nearby, so we often stop in for a wine at the indoor/outdoor wine bar.  The bruschetta selections are great and that's usually what we buy.  When things get busy, the servers all work as a team to get everyone taken care of.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"SO. GOOD. Every friend who's ever lived in the Phoenix area has told me to go to Postino, and I finally got to try the Tempe location out for a quick lunch on this past work trip.  My coworker and I shared the bruschetta board, which was delicious. Perfectly toasted bread with unique combos + classics. My favorites were the warm artichoke spread that had thick chunks of artichoke, as well as the prosciutto and fig.  I got the Brussels sprouts salad with chicken, and it was a huge, heaping portion of food. I loved the spicy almonds that they put in the salad, which added a nutty kick to the dish.   I was so sad when the meal was over because it was so good and I wanted to try all the bruschetta. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Great service and great staff! Will def plan the next girls night here!"}
{"text":"This was the first time that we were truly disappointed with Postino's. The Bruschetta was smaller and not as good... Not MJ's bread anymore... And the service was horrible. The wait staff was always exceptionally friendly and professional. We did not recognize anyone anymore... All new people and service left a lot to be desired.... It is really sad as it has been one of our most favorite places...."}
{"text":"Count your change.   I hate giving bad reviews. I truly do. But if you order something for $5 and give them a $20 and they give you $10 back, something is terribly wrong.  They don't respect their customers.  Maybe it was one bad apple behind the bar, or a systemic problem at a busy place on a college campus, but don't be a schmuck. Count your change and pay and tip accordingly."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour with it being from Open to 5. It has $5 glasses of wine and $5 pitchers of beer. Their menu items are limited but very good food, and atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and outgoing! Outdoor patio is very shaded so no worries about getting too hot outside. Great place to eat, drink, and hang out."}
{"text":"Luisa was such a fun, kind, and accommodating server. Having allergies makes it hard to eat out, but she made my meal super casual, super safe. Definitely check this place out. Word."}
{"text":"Okay...Postino atmosphere is what makes it. The food is good and the drinks are not special. The service, particularly the host staff, is sub-par. They are a little pretentious in the Tempe area but if you find a great server, you're set!"}
{"text":"The best food I've ever eaten in my life. And $5 pitchers of craft beer is pure sorcery! How can you resist? I literally licked my plate after eating the country toast for brunch."}
{"text":"Same great postinos in an awesome new location.  Is there anything better than getting out of a late tuesday night class and walking just across the street for the awesome bruschetta and wine deal? No, no there is not."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night and sat outside. Had a bottle of downtown red and the salmon, fig and prosciutto bruschetta. Literally everything was amazing. Great wine, great service! The environment and the feel of the restaurant in full was very much appreciated. Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great location-- Tempe needed a more \"adult\" environment and Postino is a great addition! The food and wine is amazing as always."}
{"text":"I've been driving by Postino's for awhile and my daughter been raving about this place. So we decided to try it tonight. We walked in and it was a little hot outside so we decided to get a table inside. Very modern looking, lots of energy, with music and very friendly service.   We decided to start off with the bruschetta appetizer. You get to pick four different kinds and you get four slices of each bruschetta. Perfect for our party of four cause we each got to try each one. We picked Brie & Apple with fig spread, Smoked Salmon with pesto, White bean with chopped tomatoes, and Warm Artichoke spread. We all loved it. It was so good and you get to try each one and experience the different favors. My favorite was the Brie & Apple with a close second the White Bean. Like i said they were all good with lots of flavors bursting out.   For dinner, we all ordered the two for $10 where you get a half Panini and half a Salad. I picked the Chicken & Mozzarella panini on ciabatta with arugula, organic chicken with a spicy sun dried tomato mayo. I really enjoyed it and loved the kick with the spicy mayo. The salad I picked was the Raspberry Chicken. It had pecans and apples in a raspberry vinaigrette dressing. Really nice salad and enjoyed it a lot. The panini and salad was really good and enjoyed the dinner.   My wife had the Turkey Panini on Ciabatta and Hannah's Field salad. She really enjoyed it and it filled her up. No complaints from her.   The service was great. Once we got to the table our server greeted us and brought us our drinks. Our food came in a timely manner and the servers kept our water cups filled every time. The servers had a smile all the time and really looked like they enjoyed being there.   So the place is filled with college students with a few older people but that's okay cause the food is really good, great service, and a really nice atmosphere. As you can tell I really enjoyed it and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon the awesomeness which is Postino about a month ago. I am OBSESSED!  Lots of wine choices and DELICIOUS bruschetta board options!   I've now been to this location numerous times in the past weeks and have yet to have a bad experience.  Servers are always very helpful...and have allowed me to taste different wines before actually pouring me a glass (I'm very indecisive).  Highly recommended if you're looking for wine, good snacks, or quiet location to unwind."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Gilbert location, but came to this one because it was closer to campus. My boyfriend and I went for the $20 bottle of wine and bruschetta (great deal). We went for the our usual favorites and also tried the seasonal one. We got the biutiful sparkling wine that's only offer at Postinos, it was a little dryer than expected but not bad. They also recorded it for us when we didn't finish all of it.  The atompshere was nice, and we had a short wait because it was pretty busy when we arrived. The noise level can also get pretty high, and it was hard to hear at some points."}
{"text":"We originally came to Snooze AM Eatery for breakfast but the wait was 1 hr. So we decided to come to this place next door as there was no wait. I'm so glad we did as everyrthing we ordered was awesome. The french toast was perfectly done with crisp outside, chewy inside toasts. Grrilled Foccacia was great too. Clearly they know how to make breads. The atmosphere and the service was superb."}
{"text":"You can find great deals here! $5 pitchers of beer or glasses of wine before 5 and on Monday and Tuesday there is a $20 bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta special. Great price of you consider the board is typically $15 on its own. The wine and beer selection rotates with the season and you'll always be able to find something you like here. I always go for the bruschetta. My favorites are the artichoke dip, salami and pesto, smoked salmon, and apple and fig. If you're in the mood for something lighter, their salads are great too."}
{"text":"Wifey and I brunched Saturday morning before things got crazy with the ASU game. Our visit to Postinos Annex resulted with an Oasis of calm in a fresh environment where everything was in sync. We were greeted promptly, seated and allowed to settle in to gauge our surroundings.  Contrary to parties being stacked too closely, various seating arrangements are employed. An openness conducive to extended patronage, and opportunity to sample delightful fare.  The food elevates the mood as myriad and distinct flavors complement preparation found to be attentive.  The staff executed in harmonious fashion without any measure of pretension. There was even the odd oops behind counter where glassware hit floor. Acoustics muted the impact preserving a measure of serenity.  Involved parties joined together to recover.  When it was time to leave Postinos, there was a bit of sadness (it was going to get toasty outside that day. JK). Seriously, the dining experience and food were great; morning beverages also spot on. Looking forward to returning. Wonder what's for dessert?"}
{"text":"Pros: excellent location, great atmosphere right on college campus with students walking by, received friendly and prompt service, good amount of drink options, and menu items are unique Cons: pretty small portions for the price, fairly small food menu, pretty loud with street noise, likely you are going to wait for a table, and can be difficult to find parking nearby  Went at 7pm on a Tuesday and just missed the rush. There were a good number of people waiting to get in after we were seated and really...I don't see why. I think it's a sub-par restaurant that is capitalizing on some very good real estate. I left hungry and dissatisfied with the food and don't see myself coming back anytime soon to eat. I would however come back to have drinks on the patio which I think is what most people have in mind. I think they are better suited as a bar than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Yo Michael is the best server on the block! Made me want to order the whole menu. He knows how to start a conversation as well. Went above and beyond the call of duty! Deserves a raise for sure!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best places to eat in Arizona.  This was our first time at the Tempe Postino, but have eaten at two other Postino locations - Gilbert and Phoenix (40th St) - several times.  Food has always been excellent - creative, fresh, well-prepared.  They also have great happy hour prices (2 pint pitcher of great craft beer for $5)!  Staff is wonderful, food is excellent, great selection of beers and wine, nice patio, wonderful refurb'ed old building, and a fun vibe.  The other two locations we'd been to seemed to always have the music turned up a bit too loud.  But the Tempe location was perfect.  We almost always get a Bruschetta combo - not because that's the only good option but because it is the best among great options.  They have great panini options, salads, and soup, too."}
{"text":"Up until this last Sunday I had thoroughly enjoyed this place. The food has always been above par and the service respectable. However this last week when I took my girlfriend there, it was far from enjoyable. The meal started off alright, however there was an older couple that would not stop making out in the booth across from us. A kiss here and there is one thing but to have groping and non stop making out for the better part of an hour is just trashy and ruins the atmosphere. This is a restaurant not a movie theater or your bedroom.   I understand there isn't much a manager can do in that situation unless he witnesses it, however his staff, a guy by the name of Christian in particular, was incredibly rude and unhelpful when we complained about the situation. Instead of immediately grabbing a manager he chided us and talked down towards us. When he finally got a manager it was too little too late. And then the manager simply did too little to remedy the situation. Its a shame because we had enjoyed this place and perhaps we will enjoy another location in the future. But it is very unlikely that without a reach out from the manager for further remedy that we will ever visit this location again."}
{"text":"Postino's is a great place to go for a date or a night out with friends. Delicious food, friendly staff, and a nice atmosphere make this a wonderful location."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor area. Awesome service- good orange juice and coffee. I had the French toast and it was so delicious!!!!! We also had the BELT and loved it. Would come back."}
{"text":"Always love Postinos. Harper Sawicki is the best employee in the entire world. Gotta have that famous bruschetta (pesto, salmon, mozzarella, fig,are bomb) and their soup and salad duos are perfectly portioned. Great date night place!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a recent trip to Phoenix. Their food menu is pretty limited if you don't want a Panini or Bruschetta. However, they are good at what they do, and the panini that I had was great. It was different from other paninis that I have had, as it didn't have the grill marks and was made on focaccia bread. Big sandwich, so I'd recommend getting 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad unless you're famished."}
{"text":"I've heard of Postinos and have been trying to get in to try it forever, but have just wound up busy. So finally, I Tried this out on Friday night, and it wasn't crazy busy, but we grabbed seats at the bar. The bartenders were helpful and I wound up trying two red wines I've never heard of before. Both were amazing! The bruschetta... SO. GOOD. can't wait to come back for the $20 wine and bruschetta nights."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere. Way too overpriced wine & the service was slow. If I am going to order an $11 glass of wine, I would prefer it not come out 15 minutes after I order it."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is always super friendly and I love their $5 pitchers. I just wish they would switch up the bruschetta menu sometimes."}
{"text":"I crave their brushetta boards all the time!  I might be addicted... Never a problem with service, very consistent.  If you buy a bottle of wine to take with you they take $10 off the price which is awesome.  One of my favorite spots to meet up with friends :)"}
{"text":"I just had to write a review on the Cucumber Honey Lemonade... if you even remotely like Lemonade, you need to order this drink!!   Don't be turned off if you don't like cucumbers. I personally don't like cucumbers and I LOVED this drink. The Cucumber purée is refreshing and makes it less tarty.   I also got their regular lemonade and thought it was a little too tarty. I def prefer the Cucumber Honey Lemonade. For food I ordered the Turkey Panini on focaccia and it was delicious !  TLDR: order the Cucumber Honey Lemonade !!"}
{"text":"Luisa made sure my girlfriend didn't die due to her severe allergies. That is worth it's weight in gold."}
{"text":"Luisa is a beast, literally the greatest server I've had, anyone would be lucky to have her as a server and if you ever come to this location please ask for her, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Postinos is always a good time and Jac is the best server ever. :)  I definitely go to postino way too often, but I can't help it. I love their $5 pitchers before 5pm, bruschetta, and their Brussels sprouts salad.  It's the best place to meet up with friends, share a few drinks, and eat something light but filling.  However, I only have one thing I want to say. Postinos, if you're reading this, please make the mushroom bruschetta permanent. Every time I ask if it's on the menu, I know that the answer is 99.9% going to be no but I'm so desperate and in love that I can't help but ask for it every time. Pls I need it"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to postinos you're missing out! It's has the best atmosphere and their bottle and board deal of Mondays and Tuesdays is amazing! The staff is so awesome! I was there last night and they were so busy but the staff handled everything so well. The hostesses Hannah and Rachel were so sweet and helpful about finding us a table even with the huge rush. It is the best place to hang out with friends. Their food is amazing too! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"To preface: Tomato jam. All day. Everyday. That's seriously half the reason I go to Postino!  Used to live near the Arcadia one and got crazy on some $20 bruschetta and wine Monday and Tuesday nights. (Fig one, brie one, tomato jam, and salmon, plz!) Tried this location out about five times since its opening. Food and wine are on point, decor is beautiful. Really nice to see the old ASU art annex revitalized!   But the service is seriously spotty. I've had one good experience out of the five, and the rest suffered from forgotten or wrong wine, plank of bruschetta never arriving because the order wasn't placed, messed up orders, a 45 minute wait for a half empty restaurant. Weird and really spotty service. But really enthusiastic weird and spotty service! I feel like they just a couple seasoned veterans to bring the cute undergrad servers with zero experience up to speed."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, delicious bruschetta. Very peaceful to have a board & bottle night under the lights outside. I have been here roughly 50x due to its proximity and ambiance-- I would give the bruschetta a 9/10, the sandwiches about a 6/10, smoked salmon toast (breakfast) an 8/10, the French toast (breakfast) a 7/10, the granola (breakfast) an 8/10, and the salads about a 4/10. Another thing to note is that the wait will be very long on board & bottle nights."}
{"text":"Excellent bruschetta selection. Lovely patio and atmosphere. The music is really good too.service is a bit slow! I had the autostrada sandwich and it was really good ."}
{"text":"Great venue! I've held a couple of Women In Tech lunches here. Ray is such a wonderful waitress. She's always \"Right on top of it!\" for me. From setup to getting everyone's order right she is a rockstar!   It is super easy to make a reservation online, preorder food and the back section is perfect for large parties. I also love that it can be opened up to the outdoors on a lovely spring day."}
{"text":"I recently visited Postino Annex located in the heart of Downtown Tempe, just a few blocks from the iconic Mill Avenue, Postino Annex is nestled into the old Arizona State art building, according to the placard out front.  The restaurant is built from brick and has colored concrete floors, it has a truly amazing feel to it from the second you step inside. I visited the restaurant and was immediately greeted by the host who had brought me to my table. She informed me that waters would be followed up shortly, and she was not lying, I received my water as I sat down and it was cold as can be, which is extremely refreshing after walking around campus. I had a wonderful server by the name of Sarah, she was witty and charming. She recommended the happy hour special, which I would also strongly recommend, you can select any pitcher of beer or glass of wine off their list for $5, yes you read that right five freaking dollars for a whole pitcher of beer. How could you not enjoy a nice Devil's Ale whilst sitting on the beautiful campus that Arizona State truly is. The patio featured yellow umbrellas (yellow is the company's signature color) and extra large awnings to shield you from the brutal Arizona sun. The company also features a large glass garage door that can be opened to give the restaurant a super open feel to it. After I had gotten settled in Sarah recommended the bruschetta board. Once again a great recommendation. I went with the Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone, Sweet and Spicy Pepper Jam with Goats Milk Cheese, Brie and Apple with Fig Spread, and lastly the Salami and Pesto. (it sounds very plain but packs a full flavor.) The food arrived and it looked truly amazing, I wish I had thought to take a picture before I had devoured it (There's ton of pictures on yelp so look at those). Food was priced very modestly for the quality of food. A select two combo meal (soup, sandwich, salad) is only $10.50, so I will definitely be back to try that on my lunch breaks. I only had one problem with this restaurant and in no way is their fault so I wont knock them for it. But my biggest issue is parking, there is absolutely no way to park for free or get your parking validated so be ready to pay $6 extra dollars to eat (unless you go on the weekend in which parking garages are free.). As I was preparing to finish up my meal I had noticed there was dessert on the menu, and how could I pass up that amazing opportunity. The three desserts offered were Chocolate Bouchon (lava cake), Crème Brulee, and a Salted Caramel Sundae. I ordered the Bouchon and I could not have been happier with my decision. I could not finish it all because of how rich the chocolate was, but the ice cream as I was informed came from one of the company's other concepts, an dessert shop in central Phoenix called Churn, I will definitely be visiting there in the future."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night right after graduation and was told that the wait would be 45 minutes. I am so glad that I didn't leave because I ended up only waiting about 20 minutes. Within that time, I was offered a drink while waiting.   When we got seated, we had a person in a wheelchair and they made sure to clear the path for us to get to our seat in the back of the restaurant. Super courteous! The service truly was one of the best I've experienced...they were very prompt and friendly.   Everything on the menu looked so good, we decided on brushetta and the meat & cheese board to start off. Each one was extremely good, one definitely tasted like caramel apple. For my actual meal, I got the prosciutto, fig, and brie panini. A great choice! The sweetness of the fig paired well with the saltiness of the prosciutto.   Next time I'm in Phoenix/Tempe area, I am definitely coming here! ...did I mention how cute the decor is too!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot inside the old art annex just north of Campus. It has the Postino's look of reclaimed wood, gun metal fixtures, and a garage door bar to the outside patio. I can imagine sitting out there, but it was chilly so we sat at a booth inside. our friend was already sitting and had ordered a drink, the server asked if we will having a drink, which is always the wrong way to phrase \" Can I get you a cocktail?\" I don't know, it just set me off a bit, but the table was serviced by a couple different servers, so the other server took the reigns. She was training and was short with us, but I didn't mind. I like to nit pick about service simply because the food is perfect. We always get the bruschetta. It's perfect for two and we switch it up all the time because they are all delicious. The bread is insane, so soft and fresh. I had a cup of the black bean soup which was delicious, and split a Hanna's salad which was delicious as well.Definitely go before 5, the glasses of wine are 5 bucks ea."}
{"text":"This Place Is so Much fun Very well located too with a beautiful view of downtown. Bruschetta are out of this world and they have a very good selection of wine as well.Make sure you arrived before 5 pm if you want to have 5$ Glass if wine otherwise it's regular price. The service is very good you can feel everyone works in team there everyone make sure you are not missing any service! Price are fair it's not cheap but expect quality over quantity!"}
{"text":"I think this is my new favorite location! Maybe because it's more my scene, but I love the outdoor space especially. It's large, right off the street, and they have ample tables and cushioned seating for larger parties.   I came here for the $20 bottle and board deal they have on Mondays and Tuesdays and it was just as delicious as every other time I've visited!  This time I shared the roasted bell peppers and goat cheese (highly recommend), tomato and mozzarella, apple and fig, and the smoked salmon with pesto. The first three are my favorite!! The salmon was for my friend which unfortunately I didn't sample. My favorite part about this place is how they slice the bruschetta into 4 pieces. I know that's like the simplest thing but you would be surprised how many places don't do this!! It makes sharing so easy that's why I always get the board with a friend. If you're thinking about getting a panini or salad, DO IT! They are also just as delicious.   The service was amazing! The server dropped a piece of my friend's bruschetta and he brought out another one right away! Everyone from hostess to servers were just so sweet and ready to help. I will definitely be returning to this location soon! :)"}
{"text":"Even when they're packed they seem to do pretty good at getting you a table as quick as possible. There is one waiter who works there who is way to hyper and invasive. He's the one with giant gauges in his ears. If you don't want him waving his head all over above your table, try to avoid his section. Awesome food and the soups of the moment are usually pretty good. Best bruschetta around here for sure. Servers know a lot about the wine which is cool and helpful."}
{"text":"This is just in regards to the reservation line. I spoke with Brandon regarding a future reservation and he offered some great options and answered many of my questions thoroughly.   Aloha"}
{"text":"Awesome Happy Hour, delicious food, great beer and the staff is delightful. Definitely coming back. It's especially nice to sit on the patio on a cool day. I had the NYC grilled cheese and bruschetta and a pitcher of San Tan's Sex Panther and loved all of it. Gabi was the bartender and Sara was our server and they both killed it."}
{"text":"First time at Postino Annex this week. Decided to try it based on Yelp reviews and I'm so glad we did! It's located in the heart of downtown Tempe and ASU.  The 11-5 specials are amazing-$5 pitchers of any draft beer and $5 glasses of wine (any wine on the menu). They also have a Monday/Tuesday special that includes a bottle of wine and a bruschetta for $20. I had the Boatman Wine, which is usually $11. It was a very smooth red.  We tried a variety of bruschetta's and the pub board. I loved that the bruschetta's were all freshly made with bread that wasn't as hard as toast like others I've tried. The pub board was also very good. Had corn nuts, pretzels, pickles, cheese and mustard.  The patio is very cool. We sat there before the ASU game and there was so much going on right in front of the restaurant.  Service was good. Always attentive servers and kept our drinks full even though they were busy.  Also had a kids menu with a super yummy grilled cheese. Gave the kids some Wikki Stix to play with, which they loved.  We will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's fantastic for group events/birthdays/a night out with the girls. The Monday and Tuesday bottle of wine + bruschetta is an amazing deal! The service is fast, and they're always really nice and cater to what we want. The bruschetta's are all really amazing but I love the roasted pepper bruschetta, it's the best!! They're also able to cork your wine so you can take it home if you don't finish. Absolutely great, I recommend it!"}
{"text":"The restaurant music is extremely loud and uncomfortable. It's screaming. A group of people walked in before me and walked away -- and the reason is that they said- the very loud screaming music isn't doing it for them. Check your security cameras in the lobby and you should see that."}
{"text":"Why did I pick this Postino review to write at 11 PM the night before my oral argument when I don't have time to craft an excellent review and have no creative ideas jostling in the brain? When the muse has abandoned me like a mother duck inevitably leaves her duckling who falls down a storm grate? When my eyes feel like heavy leather and my fingers feel like metal even heavier than the water supply in Flint? When my neck creaks like a brachiosaurus getting off a trans-Atlantic flight in economy class? Why now, at this inopportune time?  Because I've applied to two Yelp Elite events and I want in, and I've been a busy work boy and a lazy Yelp boy and now I must pay my penance and write a review.  Why Postino? Because everyone and their poncy purebred Australian Shepard \"rescue\" has been to Postino. Everyone knows the $20 wine and board deal is the best thing that happened to their posh, foodie souls. Every woman over 25 has already been here with her friends at least ten times, because it's not sloppy drunk if you're in a wine bar nibbling on arugula and prosciutto and sipping your third bottle. And every dude knows there's nothing like a bottle of wine in a fancy wine bar to guarantee that she'll want a massage back home...  Everyone knows this already, and everyone already loves Postino. So I'm mailing this one in.  Just let me go to the event, please. I promise more effort next time, yelp gods.  Great for: Everyone and their dog. Bad for: no one, that's why I wrote this. It literally wrote itself."}
{"text":"The bruschetta boards is the most popular item to get here!  The salmon bruschetta is my favorite. And the salami bruschetta.   Mondays and Tuesdays you can get one bruschetta board and one bottle of wine for $20. The wait for a table was about 45 minutes. So plan to wait.   Usually the bruschetta boards are $15. So I recommend coming in on Monday or Tuesday for the wine and bruschetta deal."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Postino in Arcadia, and at the one on Central, however, this is the first time I've tried the Postino at ASU. I absolutely love the atmosphere and the staff. It made me feel like I was in college again. A group of us went after watching a sporting event at ASU in the middle of a Saturday afternoon. When we arrived, our waiter (who had large earrings with the symbol for the resistance - Star Wars - printed on them and prominently displayed), was extremely helpful and we asked him to bring out whatever bruschetta boards he thought we would prefer. His choices were phenomenal!  I wish I recalled the name of the bruschetta boards he brought us, but I'll try to describe what was on them. The one with small pieces of bacon, and the one which was reminiscent of lox were my two favorites. 5/5. There was also one with a form of fruit jam on it which was incredibly tasty. 5/5. The usual suspects with salami, apple, and other assorted fruits were also very tasty when paired with some of the excellent beers they have on tap. 5/5.  If you're down in Tempe, I highly recommend that you check out this Postino. It's located near the ASU swim complex, and just south of the football stadium. The atmosphere alone is worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place at least every other week. The Mozzarella Chicken Sandwich is must AMAZING. Great lunch spot and $5 pitchers on Saturdays! Great selection of beer and their mint lemonade is to die for. Great spot for a lunch date."}
{"text":"The numerous wonderful reviews for this place did not lead me astray--I enjoyed a marvelous dinner at this location. The interior of the venue has the trendy decor of a wine bar with plenty of booth and bar seating. The outdoor patio is softly lit and kept cool with numerous misters. The music is modern and upbeat and just loud enough to be heard over the cacophony of conversations that will certainly surround but should not overwhelm you.  On to the food! The half sandwich/half salad deal is perfect for lunch or a light dinner. I tried the chicken and mozzarella sandwich and the raspberry chicken salad--both were sumptuously scrumptious! The salad was a perfect blend of greens and nuts and chicken and fruit. The sandwich was a fantastic compilation of tender chicken, fresh mozzarella, soft bread, and just the right amount of spicy mayo.  Finally, the staff is superbly friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. Don't know what you want? Just ask! They can help you choose just the right pairing of food and wine to make your day."}
{"text":"Hmmmm, well after being $30 poorer and unsatisfied, I realized this is yet another \"OMG EVERYONE GOES HERE SO I HAVE TO GO HERE AND IT'S AMAZING BC EVERYONE ELSE SAYS IT'S AMAZING\" place. I came here with a friend on a Tuesday night and we got super expensive glasses of wine because it was after 5 so no happy hour. The bruschetta was hella expensive and pretty mediocre for what we paid for, and I left with my stomach still grumbling. After paying and trudging out of the restaurant I was shocked to see a bunch of freshly 21 year olds lined up outside with full on fancy restaurant-wear?! What is happening? I know this place is always busy, but for what?? It also sucks that you have to pay ASU to park and it came out to $9 for 2 hours. Come on guys, not even validation? Finally, word to the wise, ask for the \"bottle and board\" deal before you order, they'll try to play games with you after you already ordered your super expensive glass and app. The bottle and board together is $20 and not advertised anywhere until you completely cleaned your plate and glass... Pretty nice ambiance, and good service, but I could have survived without trying this place."}
{"text":"We got to go to the soft opening and it was amazing!!! Thanks for having us! We loved the patio and the space. The street its on is really beautiful. We are really thrilled to have a Postino in our hood!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place! Good Sunday brunch, excellent bruchetta choices and wine. A great way to try different types and find a gem. Happy hour includes a $5 glass of vino or pitcher of beer every day from open to 5pm. Place can be a bit busy on Sundays, so be prepared to wait for your food. However we got our table and drinks quickly, 10 minutes quicker to get to our table than quoted."}
{"text":"Awesome food. The roasted cauliflower soup was so good!  The bruschetta are delicious!  We had a baby with us and everyone was so attentive. They even brought a bowl of sliced grapes for the baby.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Postino is great. They have several different bruschetta that are really good. You can make a nice vegetarian meal out of the plank. It's enough to share with some one. I haven't had anything else on their menu since the bruschetta is so good. I also really like that they have $5 bellinis and mimosas all day. The bellinis are delicious. Get three  of those and a bruschetta plank and you're all set :0)"}
{"text":"AMAZING. Everyone who has social media has seen these picture-worthy board's of bruschetta! So going here was a no brainer. I went on a Tuesday night, and after 8pm, a board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine is only $20!!! (Monday and Tuesday deal) talk about a bargain! My friends and I shared a board and it was a perfect amount for a small bite and glass of wine. The atmosphere was very upbeat and the vibes were super fun! 100% would recommend to anyone and will definitely be returning! Make sure you arrive early, the place was already packed around 7pm!!"}
{"text":"Postino's is always great, but this location is special. Hannah, our server, was given the task of ordering for us and she did an awesome job! Then manager Jeremiah stopped by and was extra friendly and kind. And the food and beer was great, as always! Thanks Postinos."}
{"text":"Postinos is the perfect place to take a date. The music is great, the lighting is low, the decor is hip, the staff is friendly and the food and wine...top notch for relatively reasonable prices. I'm not a big salad \"fan\" but their raspberry chicken salad was probably the best salad I've ever had. Perfect combination of sweet and savory. Also can't go without ordering a bruschetta board--every combo we've had is delicious and fresh. My favorites are the fresh mozzarella and tomato, the Brie and apples (with amazing fig jam), and the warm artichoke spread. Better yet--make sure to go on a Monday or Tuesday to get their $20 bruschetta and wine deal. Great value. Their paninis are all really great too so i recommend a combo with half panini and one of their delicious salads. Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"First I have to say that I love their bruschetta, I am obsessed with the artichoke one. But outside of the bruschetta, I do not think the menu is that expansive or great. It is fairly expensive and I do not think the paninis or salads are worth the price. Good atmosphere and location. Service is average - waiters are very friendly but usually I have to wait a while for someone to come to my table. Overall, a good place but not somewhere I would go all the time."}
{"text":"Love this place. The bruschetta is to die for. Such an amazing atmosphere that I want to come back again and again. I love sitting outside on their patio.   We were helped by the host Hannah and she was amazing. If you go definitely ask for her! She won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I have been to Postino multiple times, and it never fails! This is one of my favorite restaurants in Tempe. My friends and I go to Postino at least once a week for either lunch or dinner.   I would recommend Postino to anyone and everyone. I am a college student, and I have taken many of my family friends and relatives here. Each time I take someone new to becomes one of their favorites as well. My Aunt loved the Raspberry Chicken Salad and my favorite is the Warm Artichoke Spread Bruschetta.   On Monday and Tuesday nights, there is a deal for a bottle of wine and bruschetta board for $20. This is perfect to split with friends or a date!  Whenever I go home to Chicago, Postino is one of the things I miss most about being in Arizona, no lie. Nothing is better than an amazing Bruschetta board with a group of my closest friends in an environment like Postino. Great food and great vibes!"}
{"text":"BEST wine bar in Tempe! Awesome patio! Bruschetta is incredibly tasty. Soup of the day fresh and flavorful. The bartenders are attentive, friendly and offer great customer service! Postinos Annex in Tempe is a must when visiting Arizona!"}
{"text":"Evan and the staff are so nice! The food was amazing and they really catered to us well."}
{"text":"Went to this place last night. We were in town for a quick weekend trip. The food was amazing and came out fast. All the staff was courteous and friendly. Mark our server was excellent. We had our waters filled right away without ever asking. Honestly this place is a gem with great service and amazing food. Next time we are in town this will be a must visit."}
{"text":"As an ASU student, I've had to stop myself from drooling when I walk past Postino Annex during brunch hours more than once. I finally had the chance to try it out this week and was not disappointed!   It was less expensive than the hip artsy vibe suggests, and there are lots of special deals that make for a budget friendly outing.   I got the vegetarian panini and soup of the day (a creamy, cheesy tomato variety) and was very happy with both choices. Next time I'll have to get the bruschetta boards because those looked amazing.   The service was fast and friendly and the overall vibe made for a really special and Instagram-worthy brunch excursion. Maybe not the place for kids or cheap eating, but just right for date night or girls outing!"}
{"text":"I know how to cook which  means I have some minimum standards. Best I can say is this place is inconsistent. We were doing lunch and each ordered half a sandwich  with soup or salad. My wife said her's was fine and the salad good. My sandwich was not even close to half and the so called \"excellent\" chicken soup was pathetic.it should have been called carrot celery in cornstarch thickened broth. The amount of chicken  I found in it meant the poor chicken had parts in many hundreds of bowls.  No way I will return."}
{"text":"While on vacation we wanted to stop by the ASU campus to check it out and happened to stumble upon this place. What a great find. Awesome patio, great food and good service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service and staff. Patrick was our server last night, and had Ralphie helping him out. They were both knowledgeable and friendly. Also, they were both on top of making sure we had water, our food was prepared correctly, we were enjoying our wine, etc. Would highly recommend this location. Especially on a Monday/Tuesday night."}
{"text":"The bruschetta is my drug of choice. This location is much better than the Gilbert location because of the fact that there isn't always an hour wait and when we sat at the bar we were immediately greeted. The bartenders were kind and thoughtful."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and wonderful food and wine. The servers were very attentive - Kaylynn & Hannah were great. They definitely made our first experience very impactful. I'd highly recommend this place especially during happy hour."}
{"text":"As much as I hate to admit it, postino is good. The food is simple and basic and delicious. Why is it so good? It seems like it would be easy to make the items they sell here at home, but do I? No, I do not. I went with two other people and we shared many items. Bruschetta (of course), which is probably the best thing at postino, their soup of the day (which was a weird broth based potato soup...good, but not your typical soup), and the panini with bacon and chicken and magic sauce (ok ok not magic, but it seemed like it at the time)... This thing was so good. The best part? The leftovers were just as good as the original food. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this spot! Amazing food (they took off my favorite bruschetta  option though) :( and the prices are fitting in my opinion. Not too expensive and definitely worth it. They have amazing deals too so if you can catch those times then the prices are unbeatable, $20 for a $14 entree and bottle of wine?! Great vibes and great people. I will say that as much as i love it hear I have gotten forgotten about on a few different occasions. Once I had to ask for a server because no one greeted us for the first 15 minutes or so and I had a class to get to in an hour. I can't really know why this happens but I feel like it has to do with the fact that they pull tips and work as a team with all of their guest. It's a great concept however no one server feels as connected and responsible for a table. However I couldn't even be mad because the staff is so friendly that they can talk their way out of anything haha. I know how the industry works and I know how to get around these situations and so do they!  I would say more places should encourage this, being themselves and making conversation is a great way to connect with guests and they won't even care about what just happened. Overall awesome place and highly recommend it:)"}
{"text":"I was out in Tempe with my pal Kahlua out for a walk when we stumbled across the Postino patio. It's hard to find dog friendly places and even harder to find ones with such excellent service. Little Kahlua is a good judge of character and noticed the friendly attitude of our server Paige who found us a place not too crowded and got both of us waters. She was excellent in offering recommendations, even giving samples of the excellent turkey and bean soup which I settled on with a prosciutto and fig jam sandwich, which was even little k approved. She them recommended the delicious creme brulee. Everything came out fast and even though the restaurant was busy we felt like we were the only ones there as the whole staff especially Paige gave us attention, especially little k. If anyone wants to enjoy an excellent al fresco dinning experience with a little friend then I highly recommend postinos and it's friendly staff especially our server Paige."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the service was extremely disappointing. Our server only came to take our order and never came back to check on us. We waited and waited for the bill. Finally the bill comes and we pay and wait for our debit card to make it back to the table for at least twenty minutes."}
{"text":"I love postinos!! It is one of my favorite places to eat. They have the best bruschetta and they always have a seasonal one which is fun to try. I love their option for half sandwich and salad or soup too! On the weekends they offer a great brunch menu too. I love when we get to have Rae serve us. She is such a great server. Very attentive and awesome personality, she is great with kids at the table too which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another chance because of all of the positive reviews. I was not disappointed! Hubby and I visited the kid in Tempe and took him there for dinner. The service was stellar and attentive and the food was very yummy.  Drinks came quickly. We ordered a butcher's block again and I loved pretty much everything on it.  For dinner I had a chicken salad which was fresh and different. Husband and son's paninis were hot and yummy. Glad I went back ! :)"}
{"text":"Postino is amazing! I love this restaurant, especially the open concept. The food is delicious and the atmosphere, wonderful. I love the bruschetta, my favorite menu item. Being a vegetarian, there are so many options. I have also tried their farm scramble and the French toast. Both which are delicious. This is a great please to meet friends."}
{"text":"i LOVE this place!  we were in arizona for a wedding and i was seriously tempted to eat here every day that weekend.  it was that good!  to be honest, i did end up eating here right before the wedding, i couldn't help it =P  so this place is located on ASU campus.  we came here and it was easy to find meter parking on the street.  it was only $1.50 an hour with a 2 hour max.  if you come here during happy hour (open until 5 PM), you can get any glass of wine for $5, or any pitcher of beer (a little over two glasses) for $5.  what a great deal!  i was able to try several glasses of wine, but the riesling was my favorite.    i came here for one reason, and one reason only... the gluten free bruschetta!  it's a $2 surcharge to have it on gluten free bread, but well worth it.  the bread was amazing and had such good texture, you wouldn't be able to tell that it was gluten free.  i asked what brand the bread was, since i wanted to buy some once i got home, and it turns out they buy it from a local bakery called \"gluten free creations bakery.\"  high five to the bakery for making such fantastic bread, and high five to postino for buying locally instead of doing Udi's brand.  i was able to get several sets of bruschetta with a variety of toppings.  here are my favorite listed in order:  1. smoked salmon with pesto - it had capers and red onions also, and was a delightful combination.  the pesto really brightened up the flavor and it was really yummy.  2. burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomato - i learned that burrata is a type of cheese.  it's a pretty good choice, how can you go wrong with bacon and cheese?  3. salami with pesto - yum yum yum!  salami was good and pesto was delicious!  4. warm artichoke spread - tasted like an artichoke dip, but less creamy.   5. prosciutto with figs & mascarpone - i love prosciutto, but this flavor combination didn't work well.  it was just way too sweet.    6. brie & apples with fig spread - also pretty sweet, but good  7. roasted peppers with goat cheese - i am a cheese lover.  i eat cheese for dessert.  i eat cheese for breakfast.  i will eat cheese at any time!  however, i was disappointed in this one.  you couldn't really taste the goat cheese and the roasted peppers were bland.  the restaurant is really pretty with a variety of seats.  you can sit inside at the bar, or on the outside at the bar (on patio), or booths inside.  there are several tables on the patio with shade from umbrellas and trees.  they even have couches you can lounge on inside!  great for study groups i would imagine.  the only negative thing i can mention is the bathroom.  it's actually outside the restaurant and reminded me of public bathrooms at the park.  it's nice once you're inside, but i can't get over feeling like i'm at a public park.  the service is what makes this place a solid 5 star.  we always had excellent service.  they do a team effort approach here so you won't only see your server helping you out, but probably 4-5 additional people.  we would just turn around to look for our server, and instantly someone else would come help us.  really top notch service and such friendly people!  if we ever go back to arizona, this will be my first stop.    get the bruschetta - you won't be disappointed.  enjoy it on the patio with wine and beer while people watching!"}
{"text":"This is a spot we do not miss whenever we visit Arizona.  It has the best servers, as well as terrific bartenders that give great advice on the wine.  They don't mind giving samples either - yay!  They have $5 glasses of wine and $5 pitchers of beer that are awesome.  This is for any glass of wine, not just 'happy hour' house wines you get at most places. :)  Don't miss this spot.  We must say the Tempe location is our favorite."}
{"text":"Food is Ok, not 4 star but maybe 3 but service was subpar. They make you feel like they have enough customers that they don't have to care d about you. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I am visiting from California and I love a good wine bar. This was the best lunch spot anyone could have recommend. At first everything seemed like \"small bites\" but that was so far from the truth. Everything is light (meaning not greasy) but so filling at the same time. I highly recommend the bruschetta platter. It just SO delicious. Prices were great and their lunch wine deal you cannot pass up. I highly recommend this place. Oh and did I mention their service and menu tips were excellent! Please bring locations to Southern California."}
{"text":"First time coming here and had the worst service. Server didn't order the right drink I ordered and took forever. Waited 40 min before someone finally took our order. The food was good but service was 0 stars for me."}
{"text":"Delish! Try the bruschetta plates; you can pick a bunch. They're all creative and delicious! Service is sometimes slow, but they are usually swamped."}
{"text":"5 stars for food 1 star for service Avg: 3 stars  I stopped by this location with a large party for Saturday Brunch. We had called ahead with a reservation for our group (reservations are only for parties of 8 or more), and we were quickly seated. The service started out great with quick return with waters and menus. But, it quickly went downhill from there. I understand that it can be hard to take care of a large party with split checks, but with simple things like a cup of coffee (which came 20-30 minutes after ordering and a reminder to the server) it can be frustrating to wait a long time. I'm not sure if our server was in training or working as a trainer for someone else, but we had two servers both ignoring our table after the food was delivered. We had a couple issues with food being delivered to the wrong person (despite the separate tickets even). I think the topper was that it took about 20 mins to get the attention of the server to get the bills, and by this time everyone had been done eating and ready to go for about 30-40 minutes. It seemed like our server pair was waiting on about a third of the large inside space, so maybe there was a lack of servers on that day. Regardless, it was not a great experience.   As for the food, everyone was pleased with what they ordered, and the food quickly disappeared. I highly recommend the grilled foccacia (delicious and savory) and the cucumber honey lemonade (refreshing). I like that they have gluten free substitutes for each dish--which made our gluten-allergic friend super happy.   Overall, I think it would go back to Postinos for brunch, but I would probably try a different location next time."}
{"text":"Friendly and timely service from the whole staff, you get helped by a pool of servers and not a dedicated server. The pace wasn't too fast though which was nice that they weren't rushing out a party of one taking up a table during a weekend brunch. Great space for indoor outdoor vibe in fair weather. Mix of ages but a fairly young crowd. I've only had a few bruschetta samples, tuna salad, and the country toast. Relatively simple food but good presentation and reliably consistent."}
{"text":"Very nice on a Sunday night . . food was great, beers ok, wine was good, did not try any reserves...next time, as I will be back"}
{"text":"The bruschetta here is of course amazing, just like all the other Postino locations.  The restaurant here is quite large, with a lot of indoor and outdoor seating.  I like that the patio is dog-friendly!  Sitting outside and people watching is a great way to pass the time.  The only drawback is finding parking in the area, as this place does not have its own dedicated lot or valet.  You just have to drive around looking for street/metered parking."}
{"text":"So far, the best location among the three!! Same menu, with a more sparkly ambience and excellent service. Perfect option for a quick lunch. My Niçoise salad was superb! The tuna so fresh. It's filling but it's light. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Probably the best selection of Bruchetta' s you will ever see.  Tried a lot of them, and all were good!  Kind of place that will always be crowded, so wait times will be pretty long. Servers took a while to get to us. (Maybe thats why they are always crowded??)  Would go here again if had a chance."}
{"text":"Yummy I like everything about this place I just really hope they keep the vibe the same. I enjoy the Monday and Tuesday  special! The service has always been great but there is a wait on mon and tues but you can  get a text when  table is ready! How awesome!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for a great glass of wine and some bomb bruschetta. I recommend the fig and prosciutto bruschetta. It is amazing, easily my favorite. The staff is always really nice. They get pretty busy on Tuesday nights when they have the $20 deal for a bottle of wine and an appetizer of bruschetta. Last time I went we had to sit up at the communal table. Still good and made some new friends."}
{"text":"The food was really great and flavorful. They have gluten free options and the food is colorful and fresh. The atmosphere is fun and trendy but comfortable and easy to have a conversation. I can't wait to go back a try some of the other bruschetta flavors!"}
{"text":"Love the bruschetta and wine night! My friends and I love having a night to look forward to drinking wine and eating the bruschetta! The service is great! The ony downside is they are always crowded so expect to wait for a table."}
{"text":"No one does Tuesday nights quite like Postino. The Tempe/Annex location is a prominent social hub as evidence by the inclusive crowd (coworkers, significant others, prominent fixtures, etc.; seriously, Chris Newstrom, was that you sitting across the bar?!) who have made the weekday pilgrimage to the Annex. Even from a distant parking lot you can hear the muffled chatters of people rubbing elbows with one another.   Inside, the atmosphere is fast-paced yet intimate and evocative. Do yourself a huge favor: situate yourself at the bar, get cozy and ask for Mark (great server, bartender and all-around nice guy).  Selecting a bruschetta board is largely preferential, but try the smoked salmon with pesto, as well as the brie and apples paired with a cabernet sauvignon.  This is a wonderful way to win(e)d down and definitely a go to spot for any evening get together."}
{"text":"Olivia was the best server - what a delight!!  She made the amazing meal even better with her witty banter.  The food is all incredible.  Start out with their interesting blend of cucumber lemonade - it's so weird and so tasty!  everyone at the table did a double take after enjoying a sip!  I had their egg/potato combo with the green salad on the side.  it was delicate and so flavorful.  by friend had their deconstructed bagel/lox.  He LOVED everything on his plate.  And he said their French press coffee was nirvana...he drank 3 carafes of it - and then was dancing around for the rest of the day with all the caffeine :-)  definitely check this place out for brunch.  And I hear their wine menu is amazing - so we'll definitely be going back for dinner sometime"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great brunch with a happy hour. Outside patio is beautiful with mist and sun umbrellas. Bruschetta and salads were fabulous! We had fantastic time."}
{"text":"This is the tenth time i am coming here and I have never had any complain so far. I love their Tuesday deal on wine bottles. I go here with my boy friend and love the atmosphere, outside patio seating, wine. Very friendly people too. I love their Sandwich, Salad and Bruschetta board. Pretty much everything on the menu."}
{"text":"One of the best places for a Charcuterie Board! They balance the plate well and all their meats and cheeses are fantastic!  I stopped here while on a road trip in Arizona and it was soo worth!!!  Nice waiters, service, ambiance  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great setting, comfortable atmosphere, friendly staff and wonderful appetizers.  Definitely a place to revisit and explore more of their menu."}
{"text":"Sadly - a poor review from me this visit. Super un-friendly at check-in, inattentive wait staff, and order issues. Our beer order was incorrect, our food order was incorrect, and we felt neglected. Food - meh. The paninis were way overdressed with mayo/aoli and heavily lettuced. Where were the fillings I ask?? The potato leek soup was flavorful and brothy as promised... one high point. If this was my first time at Postino's I'd probably never come back. And the restrooms were hideous. Sorry."}
{"text":"This is one of my top favorite places! They are so amazing and efficient. I wish I could eat their bruschetta every single day without gaining a pound. They also carry the best Sauvignon Blanc- its Prisma which you can only get at postino. 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with the girls on a Friday night. The ambiance is fantastic. The wine selection is great too. It's great if you want a nice place to go without going to Phoenix. However I wasn't crazy about the food. I ordered a bruschetta board. It was just ok and way too much food for one person. I would go back if I wasn't very hungry and planned to share a board with someone and just have drinks. The service was ok. Overall it was a good experience for the beginning of the night. I think it just personally wasn't my food preference."}
{"text":"Just like the other locations: wonderful. Good deals, great food, trendy decor, incredible service.  A little more college-y but what can you expect that close to ASU?"}
{"text":"I like all the Postino's. They do a wonderful job of revamping old buildings (not that many left in town know for treating down anything old) and turning them into interesting, relaxed restaurants. This place used to be an Art Annex for ASU. Thus the Postino Annex name. I come here mostly on the exceptionally priced, bottle and board special nights. This location has less couples on dates those nights compared to other Postino's locations and instead is filled with a larger percentage of coeds on girls having wine night out with friends. The patio is my favorite place to sit and looks out at the growing skyscrapers in the area around the ASU football stadium. The line can get long, so get there right when the special kicks in."}
{"text":"Great bruschetta boards and place to come for wine/beer with friends. Just a heads up they don't have liquor, only wine and beer. My husband was never a big fan of bruschetta but after coming here, he loves it. I appreciate that they cut each bruschetta into four pieces and that you can order four different kinds for your board. They offer both sweet and savory options so it's nice that you can have a variety. The olives came in a descent sized bowl, enough to share for a table of four. I haven't tried any of their other appetizers but I'm impressed with their bruschetta selection for sure."}
{"text":"This was my first time at postinos annex, and being a big fan of postinos Arcadia, I had some high expectations! To say the least, they were not quite met. Obviously the food was delicious, but the service was not on par with my prior experiences. It was Friday night, and my party of 8 was seated promptly, but then everything after that was draggggging! We had maybe five different servers and it wasn't coordinated at all. It was as if there was a displacement of responsibility, because they each of them thought another server was attending to us. Beside the service being a bit disappointing everything else was good. Can't go wrong with a bruschetta board and wine!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing bruschetta but the rest of the menu falls short. The service did not meet the expectations that the cost of the food would imply. But this place is lovely and is the perfect setting for a date. Just be prepared to spend some money.  I would definitely come in to try the bruschetta."}
{"text":"If I wasn't so OBSESSED with their food and wine selection, I might've left a few less stars. I frequent this place often. Their bruschetta is the best I've had. I could probably eat two bruschetta boards to myself and have zero regret. The service, however, is a bit of an issue. The staff is really friendly, but you're not designated to one server, so it gets a bit confusing. So much so that we were asked twice by two different people if we wanted another round of drinks, and never received them. That's okay, but not okay when you get charged for them, then when you explain this to someone they look at you like you're just trying to get free stuff. Oh well, accidents happen, and I'm going to keep coming back! Just be sure to check your receipt before paying!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and amazing bruschetta boards. I don't recommend the cheese board we didn't like that but everything else we have had has been great."}
{"text":"I hate it when i'm wrong.  I wanted to hate this place based on its trendiness, really I did.  The Phoenix and Gilbert locations are always crowded with hipsters and trendy families and I wanted nothing with these places.   And then I got taken to the one in Tempe for lunch...twice!!!  And I really liked the food both times.  So there, I was wrong.  The bruschetta and the salad I had were delicious.  And the staff was pleasant, and took very good care of us.  And they have a patio, which I love.   In my defense, the crowd in the Tempe location is more in my style...(just joking, I have no style, I'm just boring/bland)."}
{"text":"So good! The Sierra Nevada mustard is artisanal af!! Recommended to me by my awesome server Emily. Definitely ask for her"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on Halloween day. Had the roast beef sandwich with soup, both were fantastic. The cups are pretty small, so keep that in mind if you're looking for a large serving of soup.   Nothing bad to say really, service was great, friendly and fast. Lots of room on the patio as well, so that's a plus"}
