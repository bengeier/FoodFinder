{"text":"Modern and clean restaurant with friendly staff. good location in the old town. Very busy with tables being cleaned quickly after use.  Pleased to see an old favourite on the drinks menu - dandelion and burdock! An excellent accompaniment to cod and chips.  Fish and chips are beautiful. Perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Had a lovely haddock and chips. The haddock was cooked to perfection and the batter was light and crispy. Definitely worth a visit"}

Batter a bit unsubstantial if that makes sense but. Good and hot  had a corona with my haddock and chips very nice accomp  not sure about the old dandelion and burdock ?"}
