{"text":"For the last 2 years I've brought my wife to Niji Sushi Bar for Valentines day. We love this restaurant.. the waiters and waitresses are friendly and helpful, and the food ah yes the food is fresh and tastes amazing. I highly recommend the menu degustation 6 course it's a bit pricey but well worth every cent!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi.  It's all I had so all I can really comment to.  I say at the bar and was very pleased with the quality of fish.  The chef was very personable and did a nice job."}
{"text":"A nice place to eat. Will come again.  Un bel endroit pour manger. Reviendra. Le service Ã©tait bon."}
{"text":"It's a great taste of Japan! Be careful that it's a very expensive place. They have great foods and sushis.   The separate fish options that we ordered other than sushi were melting in the mouth like butter, I swear :)"}
{"text":"An excellent sushi spot. High quality sushi, great, generous portions of fish (although you do pay for it, it's worth it), with very well done food that is cooked well. Staff is excellent as well.  Am looking forward to come back."}
{"text":"horrible service? we, my parents, my baby daughter, my husband and I went to this restaurant many times, usually very slow, but acceptable, because we know the better food need more time. But this lunch was the horrible one. The Asian guy with black frame glass with really bad attitude. We went to restaurant 11:45 which is the second table of the lunch. After we ordered, everything is fine, but today there are a lot of people for lunch. We understand the delay, but we wait 1 hour and half, and haven't have our main course. He brought to orders in the end without ask whose dish without the white rice,just place it in the middle of the table.  He told us he will bring the rice and the other two orders right away, but after five minutes, no rice no the other dishes. We asked the other waiter for rice, finally we got it when we almost finished our plates. Well, my husband asked the waiter with attitude, \" what's happening today?\" He just told us, \"it is full house!\" We did complained about the slow, he just left without saying any sorry. In the end, when we ask for manager, he told us there is manager today. By the way, the food today is not as usual as well.   Anyway, the speed and food are important but and the most, the service is really important when your clients are experiencing the long waiting."}
{"text":"Just about perfect sushi place.  Very clean and beautiful decor. Extremely high food quality and very attentive staff.  It's a bit pricey, but price is not beyond expectations for a place of this caliber.  Out of 3 days I spent in the area, had dinner here twice, and would have easily made it the third time, but work got in a way.  (Also, great variety of sake if you're a fan. I sure am)"}
{"text":"It's a sushi place. Nothing more. Took the chefs choice of sashimi and sushi.  Fresh fish but so is the fish at bento sushi at the local mall.  Included octopus marinated in a nice sauce. Starter had aga tofu which was tofu with mushrooms in  a sweet and sour sauce.  Not recommended.  Tried the steak and it was good.  For the price I wouldn't come back. You are much better off at Park in Westmount where the fish blows you away."}
{"text":"Very goo tasty and fresh food but a bit pricy even for the good quality. Lunch more affordable for the same quality of food. Friendly waiter and a lot of parking. Defiantly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great food. Fuagra roll is spectacular. Have some hidden jems on the menu so ask staff for recommendations."}
{"text":"Great sushi experience. We sat out on the terasse under the sun and just loved the staff service, the presentation of the food, and of course the taste! Niji never disappoints its clients. They recently were closed for renovations so we got to see the new Niji/ in my opinion I liked the old concept better. We had a great time and I would def recommend this place to my Vegetarian friends."}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood and i never tried this sushi place so as a HUGE sushi fan, i decided to try this place with my wife and it was a BIG and HAPPY surprise! The menu is fabulous!!!  It's the oysters season so they had a special 1$ oyster on Monday and Tuesday...but for a little extra you can order better oysters like key lime and raspberry point. The ponzu vinegar is really good. The wasabi honey sauce was a little too sweet which was taking over all the oysters taste.  As an appetizer we tried the Ise-ebi imperial, it as deep fried a lobsters claws with asparagus topped with a cranberry sauce. It was crispy and we could taste the lobster meat and the sauce was delicious.  The Highlight of the night was the Foie gras maki roll! Only 4 pieces but worth the price! Each bite was heaven in my mouth! The sauce was so good i could've lick the whole plate! Simply Delicious!!!  The have a nice variety of sashimi, hamachi toro, uni (sea urchin), salmon toro, etc.  Service was good, it was a quiet evening, it was a Monday night.  Price: a little expensive for the special maki roll but the quality is there.  Conclusion: we are coming back!!:)"}
{"text":"I have been 3 times over the past year. Why? The sushi is simple but very good. Excellent rice. Fresh fish.  No complaints on the food and the terrasse is lovely.  Unfortunately, I will not be going back. Why? The service is just too slow. No appetizers and it took 55 minutes to get our sushi... There were only 4 other tables and 4 sushi chefs. Every time I have been to this restaurant I was frustrated with the amount of time you have to wait to get your food. They had 3 chances to fix the problem, but to no avail."}
{"text":"I was taken here by my brother's friends while on vacation in Montreal. We had lunch and sat outside. It was a beautiful day, sunshine with a slight breeze. The whole area is beautiful, with other restaurants and shops around the restaurant. It has an urban, contemporary feel.  I must say that the decor and atmosphere is wonderful. Casual yet sophisticated. It was laid back during lunch. I ordered the Trilogie, which was suggested by my friend's brother. That suggestion was on point. The name alone sounds epic. The \"Trilogie\" consists of chicken teriyaki, shrimp and vegetable tempura, and maki roll. It was accompanied by miso soup and salad. I've had miso soup before but this was by far my favorite. The broth was rich and had some sliced mushrooms. The salad was great too, very good portion size. The \"Trilogie\" really hit the spot. The chicken was whole chicken breast then sliced. It was on a top of a vegetables. The sauce was not overpowering and the chicken was tender and juicy. The vegetables was well cooked. I was surprised by the tiny onion balls. Never tried it before but it was yummy. They gave 2 large shrimp tempura as well had large cuts of vegetables. It was battered well and had a nice crunch to it. Lastly the sushi was yummy. it was a large roll and sliced into 5 pieces. Everything was soo good and I was pleasantly full.  For dessert we all tried ginger ice cream. I'm not a big fan of ginger but this ice cream was fantastic. The ginger was candied and put into the ice cream. The candied ginger still had the gingery taste but was sweet and had a sugary coating. The ice cream was buttery and sweet, yet not too rich. It was a fitting end to an great tasting lunch.  I had to edit my review. The food was great but the food took forever which I wouldn't mind so much but it wasn't busy when we were there. It compounded because some people had to go somewhere after. So I dropped it one star for service."}
