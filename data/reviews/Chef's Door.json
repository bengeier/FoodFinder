{"text":"I am a very loyal customer here (weekly) simply because the food is fantastic. The service however sucks. Many times they have messed up my order (putting on hot sauce when requested not to, serving chicken when beef ordered) and their 1/2 off dinner plate special is a fraud. They charge $8 for the second when the normal price is $13.99. Or they just ignore that it is a Tuesday and try and charge you full price when the advertised price is on the window. 

Despite the crap service I keep coming back because the shawarma is so damn good. Falafels, rice, vegetables and salads are all delicious. 

I rate them a 7/10. For food 5/5 but service 2/5."}
{"text":"Best sharwarma in Oakville.  The place is usually busy during lunch times, but it is definitely worth the wait.  The prices are also very reasonable (1 large shawarma is like $6.30 and will satisfy most hungers).

The staff is also pretty nice."}
{"text":"If there could be a minus review then that's what I'd rate this place.. I'd invited my brother to a small dinner here. When I was going to pay the owner said that the men should pay!!!  I lost the opportunity to treat my brother!!  Then the food smelled sour. We both had diahrea immediately after. Never going back!!! I'll"}
{"text":"Food is very good and fresh but the tables were not clean and the garbage was overflowing.  This was this past Saturday afternoon at about 2:00pm"}
{"text":"Lately my go to lunch spot! $10 tax in gets you a very tasty, fresh generous meal complete with rice, potatoes, salad, and of course Shawarma .. Go there and enjoy!"}
{"text":"A great place to have middle eastern food. Better to have it for take out as their dining area isn't the greatest. 
A clean place and food is great. Customer service is great too"}
{"text":"It was my 2nd visit to this joint, and it wasn't as pleasant this time around. The place was clean and quiet, no line ups and quick service. However, my appetite was slightly bothered by the person assembling my shawarma. He was dripping with sweat!! I had to turn away while he was putting it together, I couldn't watch. My other complaint was that he wasn't putting enough toppings inside. One sliver of purple radish?  Two slivers of green pickle? The chicken tasted nice and as someone wrote previously, they use real garlic sauce. I won't be back. It's worth the 30 min wait at laleez's."}
{"text":"Terrible service! I called 2 hours ahead to pick up an order. When I arrived they claimed I called the wrong location. I pressed redial on my phone in front of them and their phone started ringing. I then said I would wait for my food and proceed to sit down. 20 minutes later they are looking at me and asked why I was there and whether I wanted to place an order! And they continued to blame me in front of their other customers. Messed up dinner plans for my family so not impressed. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Went there as a last resort. I was craving shawerma and I've had bad experiences with osmos near by. The place was empty and rightfully so. The chicken was dry as it rotated for hours I'd assume. The chicken wasn't salted before cooking it seems and thus has a bad smell to it. The toppings he had were empty, meaning the lettuce tomatoes etc.... Nothing was clean either"}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Shawarma Pita and Hummus. This was probably the most delicious Lebanese food I've had in a long time. The pita sandwich went well beyond the typical lettuce and tomato adding an array of fresh and pickled veggies. If you like spicy, let them put the hot sauce on your sandwich....it was great! The hummus was a generous serving enough for two to share. It was dressed up with some spices, chopped parsley, olive oil and pickled onion bits. There were about 15 tables in the place so it got busy at lunch. I would love to go back at dinner and try their Lamb Kebab."}
{"text":"I do love the shawarma plate from here. 

The service is amazing, really nice people!"}
{"text":"Best shawarma in town. The owner Abdel is awesome and cares about customers. All sauces cooked in house. He has multiple locations but this is the original. Very well priced and fast professional service leaves you coming back."}
{"text":"My go to place when I have a craving for chicken schwarma. I dont recommend getting beef because it's not on the spit which may make you wonder how long has the beef been sitting in that metal bowl. They just warm it up on the hot grill. The Kofta however is cooked fresh so go for that if you want beef.
Back to schwarma, I've had both the pita and the dinner and they are equally delicious. The dinner portion is huge. The hot sauce is spot on. Clean inside for those who dine in! Price is on par with other schwarma restaurants."}
{"text":"I came here 3 times for service in 2 days (out of towner), and after my experience the 3rd time, never again. I had the falafel twice, 1st time was way different then the first time.  I do not like the fact that it is already fried, so not fresh.  The chicken shawarma was really good both times.  The meat shawarma was great the first time and so-so the 2nd time.  When you can't have consistency, that is not good.  Also, they need to keep the sandwiches longer on the heating press.
The biggest issue I had was the guy who took my order was a d*ck.  He asked if the food was for here or to go, I said here.  He did not hear me the first time.  He asked again and said it in a louder voice for here.  He then says to me \"take it easy, no need to yell.  Relax, don't get mad\".  I said I never get mad.  He then (I did not see it, my friend told me afterwards) said \"you can go away if you get upset\" and with his hands gestured to go get out.  
After that, I will never come back or recommend this place to anyone. 
It also would not hurt if any of the 3 workers I have experienced would smile every once in awhile."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant the other day for lunch. It was well past lunch time but the place was really busy. There was a continuous flow of people for a takeout.

I ordered 2 chicken Shawarma (Large). The guy behind the counter was really friendly and efficient, it was really interesting to watch how he make the Shawarmas. In each roll, he put tons of freshly cut veges and meat. I asked \"everything\" and they were the best Shawarma I have ever had. My husband who has eaten quite a bit of Shawarmas in his life said that it was one of the best Shawarmas he's ever had.

Their falafels looked delicious and I want to try them next time I go. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I would choose this Middle Eastern restaurant over Osmow's Grill anytime. Chef's Door actually knows how to create a sharwarma and its very close to an authentic Middle Eastern sharwarma. As well, the service is amazing and the employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"The most delicious falafel I've ever had. All the ingredients were so fresh! Definitely recommend this place! And the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years. Came in today and wow portions suddenly got smaller. No longer a good deal. Time to move on!"}
{"text":"Solid, tasty food and friendly service in an otherwise sad little strip mall. That said, a MUCH better alternative to the Pizza Pizza nearby. The chicken on my shawarma was a little overdone, but all other ingredients were fresh. Got the job done nicely."}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent service. By far the best shawarma place in Oakville, possibly GTA. Cant go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Eat it at least once a week. Best food in the area by far. Staff is great and appreciates your business."}
{"text":"Want a quick bite for lunch - the Chef's Door is your place!  Located in the heart of Streetville, you can order your middle eastern fare any which way you want.

A regular chicken shawarma is under $6!  You can't beat that for a cheap lunch that is delicious!

Paying cash is the preferable method of payment at the location, there is a surcharge if you pay by credit.  I found this out after a paid my bill...

I will definitely be back for future lunch time eats with cash in hand!"}
{"text":"We frequent the Chef's Door nearly each time we make a trip into Streetsville (every six weeks or so). The food is always fresh, always well presented, and delicious. Best shawarma anywhere. They are always accommodating for our son, and often give him new things to expand his Mediterranean palate further. The establishment offers a nice friendly atmosphere. I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing. Kofta Plate is a must try; takes about 15mins for order to be ready.  Koftas made fresh; side of potato and carrots tastes amazing.

Place can get real busy during lunch-time."}
{"text":"I'm fortunate enough to live close to this restaurant. It's a quaint spot and it's the only place I go to for a shawarma pita. I'm sure there are other places that are good, but like I said, this place is convenient for me and they're consistent. The head chef is extremely friendly and always takes the time to greet the customers and make you feel welcome. He has a great memory and remembers the regulars. Whenever he builds my shawarma, he always packs it with goodies. Never skimps. I'm not picky, so I have everything they have to offer in a shawarma. I ask for extra garlic sauce (Which is crucial) and this spicy item they add (I don't know what it is. But if you don't ask for it, they won't put it in your pita). Usually, if I'm craving for it, I ask for a small side of fries. Which is made fresh every time. 
What's stopping me from giving this restaurant 5 stars, is their other dishes. I've only tried the lamb plate a couple times. It consists of 4 or 5 pieces of grilled lamb from a skewer, with potatoes, rice and salad. They give a generous portion, but for some reason, I don't like the dish. Maybe the lamb wasn't grilled to my liking (Which is med rare). I'm sure if I asked for it med rare, they would've gave it to me. But that's a dish I wouldn't get there again. I'll stick to my shawarma pita's, which is outstanding."}
{"text":"One of the best Shawarma's I have ever had, highly recommend this to be a regular stop for everyone in the west end.  The owner is a genuinely  nice guy."}
{"text":"Have been going to this place for years, ever since the first one opened on Winstonchurchhill and dundas some years back. The food is always top notch (the owner does not serve what he would not eat himself), inexpensive, and quick. A great mix for what it is. I usually get a kabob or shawarma plate when I am there."}
{"text":"This was our go to place for shawarma sandwiches (we always got chicken) when we lived in Oakville. Great food, great service, great prices! Am still trying to find a shawarma shop in London that makes shawarmas as good as Chef's Door does."}
{"text":"This review is for the Chef's Door location on Winston Churchill. This was our go to place for shawarma sandwiches (we always got chicken) when we lived in Oakville. Great food, great service, great prices! Am still trying to find a shawarma shop in London that makes shawarmas as good as Chef's Door does."}
{"text":"I tried there both location that  I am aware of, one is located I beleive on Winston churchhill, and the second in Streetsville, good food and Okay customer service
but I found small chicken bones in their chicken Shawarma as well, like some other shawarma places in Mississauga"}
{"text":"I have tried shawarma at a lot of other places but in terms of taste, this is the best. It melts in your mouth and the spices are well marinated and taste amazing. The sauces are excellent and homemade.

I have taken 2 stars off for the service. The owner, when he is around takes care of his customers. I always order double meat and he ensures that it is done right and the quantity is not stingy. He even gave me free dessert once. However, if the owner is not around, god help you in terms of dealing with his nasty employees. They simply don't give a crap. More than once they charged me for double meat but when I went home and opened the takeout container there was hardly any meat. I paid over 18 bucks for mainly rice and potatoes and very little portion of meat. I always check now before leaving to make sure these guys are not screwing  me over and for sure it happened again. When I suggested to the guy that he didn't give me double meat, he had the audacity to argue back and was quite rude. Now I don't go back unless the owner is there. I always call in advance to check. He is a super nice guy but is getting screwed over by his awful employees.

An update to my previous review. The service problems have now been rectified. New employees have been hired and i no longer have the complaints. The food continues to be top notch. This is the only place i ever go to for shawarma."}
{"text":"The worst shawarma I ever had. The owner was very rude and greedy, and he put very little chicken in the wrap. I bought two shawarmas for 15$ and he used stale pita bread and didn't put enough chicken. The taste was total garbage. I hope these people go out of business soon. I would never recommend this place to no body. Total rip off and waste of time."}
{"text":"Tried this today for the first time.  I got the fatoush salad with chicken,  almost $13.

The plates are tiny,  so there was very little salad. I couldn't believe how little chicken I got on top. About a third or half of what I would get at any other place. 

Flavour was delicious I'll admit that,  although a bit too strong, overloaded the dressing.  Hot sauce was great. 

This place would get 5 stars if the portions were correct,  I would have to pay $26 to get a plate equivalent to my normal Shawarma places."}
{"text":"117 Cross Ave in Oakville location.

Went for lunch and ordered  a \"mixed shawarma pita\"....double meat.  He started carving from the pit out front then went to the back....and came out with a fuller looking pita.  Half of my meat was moist and other half were dried, hard old pieces of meat.  I would NEVER eat there again.   Not a good start people as you have just newly opened."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and had some of the best chicken shawarma I've ever had. Everything tasted fresh, the food was served quickly and the prices were reasonable (~$10 for my hummus and chicken shawarma plate with pita). Super spot for lunch."}
{"text":"On our way to the Drive 5 in Oakville. Quick stop for dinner led us here.  
Interesting item on the menu, shawarma with pineapple.  Gonna have to try that some day but this time I stuck with the classic beef shawarma combo sandwich with fries and a drink. My wife had a falafel sandwich.

Tasty. Nice big pita, with healthy toppings. Falafel was mild and tasty. Store bought frozen fries. 

All in all worth the stop. Very pleasant people. 
Not a big patio. But comfortable."}
{"text":"A decent little Middle Eastern diner was my meeting place for a business lunch.  We arrived just after 1 PM and there wasn't any lingering crowd.  From what I hear, Chef's Door has quit a few frequent diners, a bit of a following.

By default, I ordered the schwarma plate, a bed of rice with salad, some chicken off of the rotisserie, and tsitsiki sauce.  The server asked me if I wanted hot or mild.  I asked what the hot sauce was, but could not get an answer out of him.  I just wanted to know what the sauce was so I could gauge my level of heat.  I finally convinced him that I wanted \"a bit\" of the hot sauce.  I suspected the hot sauce was simple Siracha, which asded a nice heat, but nothing spectacular.

Overall, the food was fine.  Nothing outstanding, but also not objectionable.  A solid \"A-OK\" in Yelp terms."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since it first opened! The chefs door makes the best shawarma and falafels I've ever had to date. The staff have always been nice and courteous every time I've been. Forget going any where else to get your shawarma fix."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourite shawarma spots in the area, but my last couple of visits were subpar--the staff was not very friendly at all, and on one occasion, the guy even gave me a weird look when I asked for extra garlic sauce on the side (at almost $14.00 for a basic meal I wouldn't think that was a problem!). I have also noticed that you get A LOT less chicken than you used to. I may give Chef's Door one more chance if I am ever close by as the food was still good, but I'm not getting my hopes up that the service will change."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma plate is delicious. The best shawarma in Oakville as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"At the top of my list for streetsville shawarma now, osmow's is on the bottom

This is a brand new shawarma place that opened up in the spot where every business seems to fail

Have been here at least 4 or 5 times with the gf in the short amount of time they've been open and would recommend it to anyone.  I like it when the chicken gets really charred up on the outside and they seem to do a more consistent job with that vs. other places that shave it in advance and store it in a bin

The only thing I think they should do is adjust the prices, it jumps from being $7 for a sandwich & pop all the way up to $13.99 for the shawarma plate with no pop included..  It's pretty steep and if you eat it there it really isn't a huge amount of food.  However if you ask for it to go I find the portions to be way way bigger

I definitely give them some bonus points for using actual basmati rice that doesn't taste like bland crap (like at osmow's) and it's a nice touch how they mix shredded carrots and herbs into their lettuce mix.  also a fan of how their roast potatoes side dish has chunks of either sweet potatoes or carrots in it as well (I couldn't tell due to the spicing)

Only reason I didn't give it full 5/5 is because I bit into a small bone once, but I don't blame them too much it's fairly common with shawarma places and definitely isn't the first time it's happened

If anyone at chef's door reads this my only request is that they cut up the chicken more finely, sometimes it's perfect but I don't like it when it's in big chunks that are stuck together!"}
{"text":"The other reviews previous to this one are quite accurate. 

My experience happened about an hour ago. I was waiting inline and notice the chef making Shawarma sandwiches but the pita was breaking a lot which, to me, meant their pitas weren't fresh that day so I ordered a chicken Shawarma plate to go instead. 

The size seems tiny for $11 and I didn't think I would get full but it almost took me down for a good itis nap afterward. I usually eat a lot, I swear!

The quality is better than any other in Toronto so far which isn't saying much but not as good as Ottawa. 

Their garlic paste isn't very pungent. I wasn't killing any vampires anytime soon.

Their spicy sauce is spicier than expected. A little above mild, it is good.

Very clean and cozy atmosphere. Employees didn't seem very happy but maybe bad day? 

Satisfied. Try it."}
{"text":"Yummy. Shawarma lunch plate is the best. Lots of white sauce. I have tried many shawarma places and this is the best in oakville. Love it"}
{"text":"Checked this place out today for the first time. I ordered a large chicken shwarma wrap. All I can say is that this is by far one of the best tasting and well proportioned wraps I've had lately. There are several in Oakville, but none come close to this in taste. In fact I would put this product up against any in Toronto for taste. The head chef is a great guy who will chat with you. Ask for whatever you want to personalize your dish. EXCELLENT!!!! I will be back many times and will spread the word!!"}
{"text":"The best shawarma I've had. I come here a lot, and the quality is consistently great. The people working here are friendly and are great with suggestions. If you like shawarmas, you have to try it here."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place as I was out driving today. I love shawarma so I decided to give it a try.

It's a cute little spot seemed clean to me.  The man behind the counter seemed friendly enough. I can't really judge the customer service as I was taking it to go.

I ordered a chicken shawarma with hot sauce. I have to say it was very tasty. I'm a lover of sauces and really digged their hummus, tahena and hot sauce. It was clearly all homemade.

I really like the presentation of it as well, I can't tell you how much clothing I have ruined because of the packaging of the shawarma itself. 

I will say the shawarma pita itself is on the slender side, not exactly generous portions but for $7.50 incl taxes what do you expect?

I will definitely be returning.."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow! Delicious shawarmas and excellent service. I went to their Cross Av location for the lunch service. All of their meats--chicken, beef and lamb--are made fresh right in front of you. I was a bit baffled by the menu, as I was curious to try Middle Eastern food that day but didn't know where to start (never had it before). The servers and chef were very helpful and made me up a chicken shawarma that I won't forget anytime soon! The chicken was grilled to perfection, and the spice flavoring was just right: nothing too spicy nor too mild. The pita the shawarma came in was soft and chewy, the meat and vegetables layered one on top of the other. 

And then, there was the falafels. Oh god, the falafels. I've had falafels in general before, but there's something about the way Chef's Door makes them which was just perfect. All it took was a simple slice of my fork, and I had a perfect, cohesive half. They don't \"crumble\" and fall apart like some poorly-made bread dishes do: these ones are made with great care and kitchen artistry. And the taste...I really don't have any words to describe it. Go in and try it for yourself!

The service, as was mentioned before, was excellent. Very friendly and enthusiastic staff who know the menu well. The service is also quick, yet accurate. I was there during the lunch rush, and I neither heard nor saw any complaints. Over 15 people were served in about 20 minutes. THAT is good service.

All of this food--which was generously portioned--came in at under 20$. What a treat! I'll be knocking on the Chef's Door again soon enough. Judging by how busy they were during the lunch service, so will other Oakvillians."}
{"text":"Cheifs door serves good tasting food but cheap out where it counts. I unfortunately had to come back and edit my review for the unfortunate reason that they are simply cheaping out on the amount of shwarama meat they use. The taste of there toppings and ingredients are still fresh and delicious, but ive encountered this problem now on 3 separate occasions and sadly to say i will not be going back. The shwarma is essentially all vegetables with a very very small amount of meat, even when ordering there \"large\" options. There are plenty better options in Oakville for shwarma for this very unfortunate downfall."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent staff. Good prices. 

Their Pineapple shawarma plate is the BEST! Lunch size plate is more then enough food for the average person. Dinner plate size is good for 2 meals! 

Nothing else to say. Been a regular for 2 years now. Always perfect every time. 

The store manager is awesome and you can tell he takes pride in his job and taking care of the restaurant."}
{"text":"My colleague, Shahid, and I had lunch at Chef's Door today.

I ordered a chicken shawarma combo and Shahid ordered a falafel combo.  You choose the ingredients.  I just got tomatoes and garlic spread and sauce.  My chicken shawarma combo.  It was delicious!

Shahid got everything but onions on his falafel and it was a lot more colourful!

This is only my third shawarma ever (it's the second time I've been to this restaurant in a month or so) and I'm a fan!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, good value and  friendly staff. Regular at Third Line- at least once a week. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Checked this place out for the first time. Prices are pretty high compared to Osmows and Lazeezs.  Only thing I'll give them is that their chicken is fresh and tasty but even then they cheap out on the quantity.  Wrap 6-7 small size and platter for 10-13 taxes in.   Definitely better places out there.  Worth trying and appreciating other places after.  Workers there are also slow and sad not sure why."}
{"text":"I ate at the 117 Cross Ave Location in Oakville and it's the best chicken shawarma I have ever had.  The meat was really tender and flavourful.  The chef was very friendly and provided excellent customer service.  Prices are fairly reasonable for the portions you get.  Even though this place is very busy, the chef is very efficient and you don't even have to wait too long for your food.  Love the pita chips in the salad.  I love the food.  I love the chef.  I think I'll marry him.  Oh wait!  I already did!  LOL"}
{"text":"I was excited to see this restaurant after moving to this area.  I miss their old location in streetsville which was one of my favorites.   They do offer a more authentic taste then an osmows but not as good as the chefs door streetsville location as far as I remember.   At over $7 a pita, it was also one of the smallest shwarma I have ever received."}
{"text":"Very good shawarma. Lots of authentic ingredients with good sauces. This is more authentic then Osmows or pita nutso but those cater to a different taste. I'm glad I was pointed here as I was sick of the Osmows crowd and line up. 

Place is small and there are seats available. 
 
My go to place after my haircuts every other Friday. 

Hot is hot. And I love spicy food."}
{"text":"I've only ever tried the schwarma here, but believe the hype. It really is the best in Oakville."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times, first suggested by a coworker at my old job, then tried their offerings at work through their catering.  After many visits and chicken shawarmas, mainly, later, I can say it's one of the best places I've had shawarmas.  Not as good as Shawarma Palace in Ottawa with their amazing plate size, one plate feeds two and a delicious garlic sauce, but still pretty good.  I always get the large shawarma pita.  Their service is usually pretty fast as well.  The place looks clean, usually.  Definitely will go visit many times."}
{"text":"Very good and affordable shawarma. Plate portions are generous and tasty. One of our favorite places for shawarma. Great quality at affordable price. Kids love it!"}
{"text":"The sauces, the meat and especially the pink pickled turnips remind me of some of the best shawarma I had while living in Ottawa. You have to have one with everything on it to really experience the full flavours."}
