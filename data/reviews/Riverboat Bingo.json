{"text":"highly recommend the riverboat bingo in surprise.  friendly staff, good value for your buck. they take the time to assist new players and make you feel welcome.  the profits go for a great cause."}
{"text":"Old building and old people. 

...but we had fun pretending to be bingo people. 

No cocktails served, best to stay in chatter room if you are there with all your friends. 

Woi"}
{"text":"Maria is the best if you are new and need help! So many cool old people!"}
{"text":"Good time. My husband and I have gone there for a date night and had alot of fun.  The snack shop was yummy too!"}
{"text":"This place was a riot for this first time bingo-er. If you're with friends check out their room in the back specifically for chatters!"}
{"text":"Love playing here! Staff is very nice, and will help you through if it is your first time! Clean place to relax and yell BINGO!! Although I haven't actually won yet...lol! But I will!!! ;)"}
{"text":"My friends and I have been there about a dozen times and it's great. The people are friendly, and it's really a mix of all ages. Be careful though, because it gets addicting! We go once or twice a week every week now and we love it!"}
{"text":"Played here last week- was fun! Staff is super friendly and the proceeds went to a homeless shelter and soup kitchens. My hubby had never played bingo before but he enjoyed himself and wants to go back before we end our vacation"}
{"text":"At age 40 I am pretty sure I was the youngest person in the room for Tuesday  matinee bingo.  That was not an issue.  The staff was extremely friendly and so were the other players.  I didn't win anything but that is the norm when playing bingo.  The proceeds from here go to the homeless which is nice to know you are helping to support the less fortunate.  I would return again.  Hopefully my wife will be willing to play lol"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Yes we are a little young to play bingo all the time, and yes there are a lot of older senior citizens here. But this facility is great. Outside it looks like a run down steam boat, it's kind of cute. But inside it's really has a nice set up. More than enough room to be comfortable, a snack shop that has decent food. Volunteers roaming the room to make sure you are taken care of. Best thing about this, they do this for charity. In Cali we always went to churches for bingo, but this is a new breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everyone is very nice from the staff to other players.  I've played during the weekday as well as Friday/Sat evenings. Bingo is so fun especially when you win!  They have games 7 days a week.  The facility is clean and organized. I recommend checking this place out.

1st time players can print a $2 coupon from their website."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time I played Bingo at Riverboat Bingo so I was prepared for some confusion.  I couldn't understand the caller.  She didn't identify the games right away.  It was very hard to hear her, too.

The staff were very helpful and ran operations efficiently."}
{"text":"Fun and clean Bingo hall. They even have a \"chatty room\" for us ladies who want to be a little louder than the serious folk.

The staff are really patient and helpful, answering whatever questions we might have and explaining the rules for each game.

The snacks are pretty basic and you really can't expect too much but machine water is free so that was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Modest price for an evening of entertainment. As others have stated, the staff are excellent, very patient and friendly. I was confused by the variety of games, but they helped me throughout the evening. The players were very welcoming and helpful too. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great place in the west valley to go and have fun. When ever you can't think of something do on the weekend, come here. Staff is also very friendly."}
