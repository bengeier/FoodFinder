{"text":"Best local authentic Mexican food! Family owned and full of wonderful employees. Their combination platters have enough food for two people. Highly recommended for family events or large groups!"}
{"text":"I loved this family owned Mexican Restaurant. Food was authentic and service was great. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We saw this little restaurant last week, and had to check it out just seeing the pictures on the window! The food looked excellent & not your average street taco/burrito fare. We came, we ate, and we just found ourselves a fantastic Mexican restaurant! Not only that, it's BYOB! Next time, I'll post pics!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!  Saw the other positive reviews while traveling through and thought we'd give it a try.  The mole was incredible!  The owners (husband and wife team) were super friendly and attentive.

Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I thought it was very okay (Estoy regular) the tortilla chips tasted liked cardboard and the pico had like a total of 3 tomato chunks in it, however my meal was excellent!!!! I ordered these soft tacos with steak chorizo and fried jalape√±os and it was delicious I recommend it to anyone who is going there"}
{"text":"I don't get what the hub bun is all about.  They charge you for stale chips that taste like they came from a bag, and extremely bland salsa, that tasted like it needed salt plus something else.  We ordered the cochinita tacos, tortillas were good, potion of meat was good, however it also tasted like it was in DIRE need of salt.  The other plate we ordered was the chicken enchiladas with red sauce with beans and rice. Rice and beans were both bland, and again, needed salt, and the red sauce just had no Latin flavor.....I can't put my finger on what was missing, but it was totally unmemorable. Small restaurant inside and was too warm to be comfortable on an August afternoon.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant I've been to since moving here from CA. I rate Mexican restaurants by how well they make carnitas and Las Cazuelas makes a mean plate. The first time I ordered carnitas the waiter questioned why I ordered it since not many people do, he didn't recognize me as a fellow Mexican. The pollo fundido is also a favorite worth trying.

Can't speak about the usual dinners people seem to order in this area I imagine it's good as well, just wish folks were more open to try new things so they'd expand the menu to add more unique dishes.

Only thing I'm not crazy about is the decor, too stereotypical. Suppose that has a lot to do with being in Ohio."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was very good. I recommend the fajitas. I shared the fajitas for two with my three daughters and still had left overs to bring home for my husband. Great Value and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious. It is authentic, light (which you don't often hear about Mexican food), and fresh. Everything was just simple but delicious. We got the chile relleno, enchilada with mole sauce, guac, and soup and it was all great."}
{"text":"Good priced food and good tasting food. Got chile rellenos and they were good for what they are. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Total fat kid status with the enchiladas de mole poblano, fiscally delightful, very nice staff as well, coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great service... Bam!

Not your usual Mexican hole in the wall.

We had the mole enchiladas and Asian style tacos."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot while working in the area.  My go to meals were the lunch fajitas Texas and the No. 5.  Always great service.  Chips and salsa within a minute of sitting down, quick to refill drinks, great tasting food!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new, so I yelped Mexican and Las Cazuelas came up first.  I was skeptical because I had never heard of it, but we decided to give it a whirl.  We are sold after one visit.  This place is a small, family owned hidden gem, nestled in between all the chain restaurants on Eastern!  I had chicken enchiladas de salsa verde and my husband had the taco oriental & chanclas (sliced bread rolls, stuffed with shredded chicken, avocado, onion, drizzled with chorizo sauce).  This was fun to try something new and the menu items are unique.  Everything was delicious and they serve complimentary chips and salsa.  Even the salsa was good, and different from any other salsa I have had before {which is a lot of types since chips and salsa is a staple food group for me}!  If you are looking for authentic Mexican food at reasonable prices, this is your place."}
{"text":"We love this place and are here at least once a week. Everything is wonderful and made to order. If you want it without hot peppers they will accommodate you. Favorites are the salsa Verde enchiladas and the carne asada tacos. Also the mole enchiladas are yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit and off of that alone I can see myself becoming a regular here. I had an order of pelonas with a side of frijoles charros and a taco oriental and all I can say is wow! It's very refreshing to find a spot where the food gives you that real homemade with love type of feel. I'm so glad I found this place, especially in an area where it's hard to find anything authentic!"}
{"text":"Las Cazuelas is my favorite spot for Mexican food in town. A small quaint family-run hole in the wall that seats less than 15 people with good service and food? My kind of place. It is their Mole Poblano and Chile Relleno that are the definite standouts. And where else will you be able to have Chanclas, Pelonas, Molletes, or Esquites? Their approach is traditional, so if you're looking for burritos, fast food, or supersized portions then go elsewhere. Here just order a dish or two off the menu, grab a Mexican Coca Cola, and treat yourself to a well-deserved eating break."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food we have had in Las Vegas. Haven't had one bad dish. It's nice that this place is crowded yet but it will be and I will be forced to wait in line."}
{"text":"Had the $20 voucher for $10 via Yelp and no one in the restaurant even knew what it was. To their credit, they honored it. We wanted this place to be good, but the slow service and average food/flavors left us unimpressed. We likely won't go back, after waiting 10 mins for the check and finally getting my beer halfway through the meal. Food couldn't make up for the service."}
{"text":"Food was soooo delicious.  Chilaqulies tastes so authentic. You really can't go wrong no matter what you chose. It will be DELICIOUS !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely 5 star food and service. a little different than your \"typical\" Mexican Restaurant But you should try it, awesome food and friendly people."}
{"text":"Looking for authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas?  Look no further!  Las Cazuelas is an amazing little restaurant located unobtrusively in a strip mall south and east of the Strip.  The proprietors are from Puebla, Mexico and most of the ingredients that go into their food are from there also.
 
Their menu is limited, but what they lack in number of selections they more than make up for in amazing flavors and smells.  It's not just the entrees, but the accompaniment of the homemade sauces that make this little gem of a restaurant remarkable.  Their mole is second to none.

I travel a lot for business, love real Mexican food and search out same at all my destinations.  I would put the food of Las Cazuelas against some of the best Mexican food I've tasted including all of southern California, a bastion of amazing authentic Mexican food experiences.
  
Note, the place is small and doesn't serve alcohol.  A shot or two of a nice plata tequila would complement their food nicely.  I wonder if they have a BYOB policy (forgot to ask).

I will be back...again and again."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place passing through town. Great spot for unique and delicious Mexican food. Mole enchiladas were so good. So was the corn, and these bruschetta type things with beans on em. My boys got the tacos and they looked awesome."}
{"text":"Delicious, homemade Mexican food. Rich mole that sneaks the spice up on you nicely. Chips are fresh & addictively corny. YUM."}
{"text":"I'll keep this brief. We have been coming to Las Cazuelas regularly for 5 years now, desperately sweating out their run-in with ICE a few years back, and rejoicing openly when they reopened. The food is consistently delicious, the staff is friendly and welcoming, and the prices are unbeatable. This is the real deal! Caz has the best Mexican this side of San Diego. My only minor complaint is sometimes inattentive service after the food arrives. It's our home away from home."}
{"text":"My girls and I love this place, and eat here as often as we possibly can:) I'm always impressed with the flavor and time taken with each dish that's served. Ah-maxing. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place while searching for Mexican food on yelp, and I'm so glad i did! Amazing food and amazing owners! I had the mole enchiladas which was awesome. Cant wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"It's here or Los Antojos for real Mexican food in Las Vegas. One of the best moles I've ever had in my life, D.F. included. Fresh ingredients, excellent balance."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food -- a different version than standard Americanized tex-mex. table service is very attentive; but the place is small so when it's busy I'd be claustrophobic in there. I really liked the portion sizes; I get so tired of places that heap on more food than anyone should eat at one sitting since I'm not a fan of dragging it home. Here you can order an inexpensive meal and eat the whole thing; if you want to order more I'm sure they'd oblige! Glad to find a place with Mexican slow-food (in the good sense of that word) near to our house."}
{"text":"Food is  decent. But the man behind the counter is unfriendly. This is the second and last time I eat there."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Mole, esquites, cochinita tacos, and flan ALL delicious and authentic. Definitely come enjoy it, you'll be hooked! 
My favorites were the tacos and flan  and service was unbeatable."}
{"text":"This very small and unassuming Mexican restaurant may be the closest thing to \"real\" Mexican food that we have in Las Vegas. They're extremely serious about their mole, and you will happily get fat and sassy over their enchiladas."}
{"text":"It's very rare that you find an amazing gem tucked away in an unexpected place. I had their enchiladas salsa verde and it was ridiculous. This place is a Lance Armstrong on PEDS and Robertos is that annoying little kid on the road that refuses to move out of your way when you are driving. You should quit reading this and just go experience it for yourself. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Almost every time I have a friend in town I bring them here. Love how fresh and home made the food tastes"}
{"text":"Despite the listing saying there are vegetarian options, there really aren't unless you ask to leave meat out of an item.
Food was mediocre, pretty small proportions for a Mexican restaurant.
It was ceap, service was friendly, lots of parking."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall. Not too clean. Sub par food.  The mole seemed store bought not authentic. Very small portions. Rude waiter. Nuff said!"}
{"text":"Not your traditional Mexican food. We ordered sopes and it was literally half the size of a normal sope. Will not come again."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  Could not have been much more disappointed.  Mole Poblano Enchiladas were in factory tortillas, chicken was flavorless and the Mole sauce was from a jar an way too sweet.  Chile Rellano was the same.  Rice had been reheated enough it was a lump and Frijoles were heated right out of the can.  Service was good but the tables were dirty.  All in all plastic strip mall food"}
{"text":"First time at restaurant. Tried three kinds of pork tacos - shredded pork, tacos oriental and tacos arabesque. Each unique and delicious. Home made salsa tastes very fresh too."}
{"text":"Unparalleled Mexican food in Las Vegas. Fantastic owners and wonderful value. I eat here whenever I get the opportunity which is quite frequent as I work nearby. Absolutely in my top ten favorite restaurant in all of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Went there to eat with my family and we absolutely loved it! Food was delicious and service was great! Our server was Natasha and she was just so awesome and accommodating! Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place is not like most Mexican restaurants. Las Cazuelas specializes in Mexican cuisine from the Puebla region. Having grown up eating comida poblana (food from Puebla) almost on a daily basis, I can proudly say this is the closest to authentic Puebla cuisine you'll find in Las Vegas. Last time I was there I tried Enchiladas de Mole Poblana and I was thoroughly impressed! Check this place out folks!"}
{"text":"The place is simple, but the food is complex.  The mole sauce is simply amazing; a perfect harmony of spice and richness.  For a spicier option, try the chile relleno.    Or get both like I usually do.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Went here for a workday lunch, waited over an hour for food and finally told them we'd just take it to-go.  They were very apologetic, comped everything.  Got back to the office and realized that they had messed up my order.  Two chile rellenos instead of the chile relleno and tamale.  The relleno was filled with runny cheese, no meat, and was awful.  Hate to write negative reviews, but this one seems deserved."}
{"text":"I had the Burrito Grande, which was very good.  The red sangria was huge, and very good.  The service, however, was a little slow, but worth it."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican cuisine! Doesn't look like it and hard to find in strip mall but worth finding!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, it is difficult find Mexican food (although this really is more Central American) that does not have animal products in the rice, beans, and sauces. Not only is it veggie friendly but the food is excellent. If there were a few more choices on the menu I would give it 5 stars. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The portions are large and the food is good. The vegetarian fajitas are nice, the use mushrooms and spinach. 
Do not order the churro's unless you like them stuffed with what seems to be melted liquorice. 
Aside from that it was a pleasant experience. Tge ambiance is nice and relaxed without the usual Mexican decor."}
{"text":"The food tastes great & very authentic! I had the Huevos a la Mexicana. Perfect portion size. Free chips and salsa, and their salsa is the best I've had in a Mexican restaurant in a long time. Clean, small but great decor and \"home-y\" feel to it. Feel like I'm at my nana's restaurant, if she had ever had one, or like my nana's tio's cousin's daughter's in-laws place. So, my cousin's place :) I'm coming back with friends."}
{"text":"I don't know why the ratings are so high for this place. Only a few words come to my mind after eating there, cheap food and tasteless."}
{"text":"Cute decoration and good food. I order the Taco Arabe and it was pretty tasty. Also had the Elote and it was very very good, I was a bit worried for the mayo thinking it was going to have tons of it, not at all. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great food! Location is pretty random, but it's worth the hunt. Chile verde tastes like someone's grandma made it. One of the better Mexican food spots I've been to. Def recommend!"}
{"text":"Really Enjoyed it!  Great from the start through the end of the meal. The Guacamole was excellent.   Had one of the Wood Fired Oven Entrees the Chamorro and it was fantastic...falling off the bone tender fantastic."}
{"text":"Most amazing creative Mexican food I've had in Las Vegas. Don't leave the city without coming here."}
{"text":"This restaurant may be small in size but what they serve is HUGE in flavor and quality.  Seriously, it is AMAZING!!!  The Enchiladas de Mole Poblano is addictive.  For some, mole might be a little weird tasting at first, but after another couple of bites, you are literally addicted.  The corn Elote (served on the cob) or Esquites (taken off the cob) is so delish.  Don't forget the freshly made Churros that have a sweet cream flavored filling and served with a side of whipped cream and chocolate sauce.  We took our grown kids and their kids and now they are in love, also.  The recipes and the owners are originally from the Pueblo region of Mexico.  Everything is so fresh and simply served on beautiful silver plates and bowls.  The owners are extremely gracious and pleasant and the restaurant is clean and inviting.  They are closed on Wednesdays but open for lunch and dinner every other day."}
{"text":"I had the Frijoles charros y tacos de cochinita.. The food is outstanding.
I love the plates they serve the food on.  Gives it an amazing touch. .
Great service!"}
{"text":"I think this place is fabulous. I have been there twice and been completely satisfied. I agree with the previous statement that the place itself is a little boring due to the lake of customers but I found the waitstaff completely attentive and friendly. 

Plus, a bonus I had a groupon so it was a great deal as well!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. feels and taste home cooked to the maxx. It's so authentic they don't even sell burritos!  As all of us Mexicans know burritos are a Mexican American thang. Really enjoyed my food. Chicken Flautas with rice and beans I recommend.  so good! Basically this place is really good. You can feel the Motherly Love in the food.


PS... THEY WILL MAKE A BURRITO AT YOUR REQUEST BUT THEY TRYNA KEEP IT TRADITIONAL!  RESPECT!  


GREAT FOOD. AUTHENTIC"}
{"text":"finally a small place with great real food!

tacos are stuffed and flavorful.  I tried carne asada and pastor.  they each had great seasoning and were made with quality ingredients.

I also tried cheese enchiladas verde which was cooked/ melted all the way.  it seems impossible to get melted cheese in my enchilada at the local chain place.

rice and beans...rice was good and the beans had flavor!   good flavor too.

it took about 12 minutes, I had it to go but the place is cute and clean, I'd eat there next time."}
{"text":"Would have been 5 stars but no Sopes. Real good Mexican food, no burritos here.  The service was great. Gracias for taking care of this group of crudo borrachos."}
{"text":"Wanted Mexican food and found this thru Yelp.  Reviews and pics were good so decided to try it for lunch.  It's small.. has 4-5 tables.  Only 1 other person in there when I went.  I ordered at the counter then grabbed a seat.  The gentleman who took our order also gave us chips with sauces.  The chips were bagged but they were good.  I ordered the flautas and they were really good.  The woman who cooked served us and she was very nice.   It was a cheap, quick, and flavorful lunch and I will be returning to try something else."}
{"text":"Once again, one of my favorite gems of Henderson. Authentic, specialty Mexican items that you are unlikely to find in most local Mexican restaurants. This place is a must try. 

My personal favorietes: I order the esquites and eat them with chips(looks small, but fills you up quick!), quesadilla arabe is solid if you want simple and awesome combined, pelonas, molletes, enchilladas de salsa verde and the steak tacos are great. You may notice that the portions are not overwhelming.......that's OK, because the amount of care in preparing these dishes and the taste are both overwhelming and thoroughly satisfying. If you are a big eater, typically two dishes will do the trick. 

I urge anyone trying this place to try different things as the owner is constantly adding new items and I am thoroughly impressed each time I try something new.

Tip: if you have picky kids(I do!) the owner will make specialty sandwiches with what the kids like. I think they should try to drum up a kids menu, but know they are flexible with accommodating children."}
{"text":"Went there on a sunday night around 8 no one else in the restaurant. The place says open till 10 so we went in man at the front was very unfriendly and rude the entire time. Lady in the back was nice. The mole tastes like pure chocolate sauce no spicy?  The taqitos were really good. Will never go back primarily due to rude service. Not even a thank you have a good night wow hope he wasn't the owner."}
{"text":"Good was just ok. Margarita was terrible. It tasted like prepare supermarket drink. Will not go back. Overpriced for the so so food."}
{"text":"This place was amazing from the rice to the enchiladas salsa verde to the corn on the cob elotes I believe it was called. But yeah me and my boyfriend wanted some good Mexican food and we heard nacho daddy was some weird white people twist on Mexican food so we were not down for that haha. But thanks to the ever wonderful yelp we found this place!!! It's very small but the food is delicious and I didn't have anything that I didn't like. My only complaint is that I wish their menu was bigger and the prices weren't so high. But other than that this place is definitely worth trying and even though I'm a little cheapo it's worth the money too. Support this local business and give it a try they definitely deserve it."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I have been looking for good, authentic Mexican food in Vegas and I think I have finally found it!!! So flavorful, this will be my go to place for Mexican food from here on!"}
{"text":"Sunday morning I was in the mood for Mexican food.  Not being from the area I turned to my trusty YELP.  The reviews looked promising and I have rarely been steered wrong by the fellow yelpers.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole and they were really good.  The other items on the menu also look good and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Probably my favorite Mexican place  in LV. Everything I've tried blows my mind."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The people that run it are always very nice and courteous with their service. The food is always very good. Personally I'm not a fan of their Mole enchiladas, but my girlfriend and her dad love them. I think their Verde enchiladas are much better but that's just my two cents. I haven't had a bad experience here, and I've tried most of the menus. The tortas, enchiladas, tacos, and everything are very good. Their molletes are probably one of my favorite things on the planet. Also their pico de gallo is the best ever had. 

On the flip side, their dining room is very small, and sometimes you don't get a seat right away or you have to go somewhere else. Some people see the owners as cold ( I don't personally) but they are genuinely lovely people that make excellent food. 

10/10 Buckets of Popcorn."}
{"text":"This place is family operated and the food is BOMB ASS GOOD! Very small but very personal service. I'll be a regular customer here for sure."}
{"text":"We dined in for dinner on Opening Day. It's a quaint, but clean space serving up eats from their native Puebla, Mexico. The menu is pretty simple with a about dozen items to choose from. Don't expect to find burritos, nachos and dishes loaded with cheese and sour cream. Instead, you'll find tacos and tortas with a few fresh ingredients.

We were warmly welcomed; we took a minute to look over the menu and a few suggestions were offered. We ordered Torta De Pierna and Enchiladas de Mole Poblano. We were given free dessert and a fountain drink as a grand opening special. We took a seat and after a short wait, our dinner was delivered.

The Torta ($7) is tender pork in adobo sauce on a crusty roll with beans and topped with avocado. It was a great sandwich only made better with the spicy red sauce that was brought over when we mentioned we loved heat. It was smoky with a nice kick. 

Enchiladas de Mole Poblano ($7) is shredded chicken rolled in corn tortillas covered with Mole Poblano and onions. Mole can be wonderful when it's good and downright awful when it's bad. Fortunately, this version was well done and one of the better versions I've ever had. The chocolate and chili peppers are harmonious in the this sauce. I've found that is rarely the case so this was so refreshing. I found the chicken a bit bland on its own but with the milder darker red sauce it was a match made in heaven. 

Dessert was chunks of jello and grapes in a milky sauce. It's slightly sweet. I like it best with the peanuts sprinkled over the top for a salty bite with crunch. We weren't sure what the purpose of the peanuts were, but when we asked it was explained that it is common for the people of Puebla to snack on them while they enjoy their meal. I've never heard of such a thing, but I love being educated on regional customs. 

Portions are on the smaller side. No grande meals here so if you have a hearty appetite order a couple items."}
{"text":"Let me preface this with some background- I'm a protege of the chef that put modern southwestern cooking on the map and have traveled extensively through Mexico, and I believe that hospitality and cuisine are a Mexican national treasure. I know Tex-Mex from New Mexican and Tijuanan-Border from Baja-Californian.

This is the best regional Mexican food I've experienced in 25 years living in LV. The mole poblano is benchmark, if not acme, and I haven't had anything on the menu that disappointed. The corn is can't-miss, and the enchiladas verdes are as benchmark as the mole. The passion for food in their kitchen and their ability to execute it far out-matches their humble location and lack of serious accompanying beverage (enjoy the frugality of BYOB here while it lasts). The serving dishes and plating reflect their passion and far exceed expectations.

This might be the Mexican equivalent of Lotus of Siam..."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new Mexican place and this was amazing. It's hidden, but it is so delicious! This place is in the corner of Silverado and Eastern and it has only been opened for eight months. I am going to really try to get this place some business because they were just phenomenal. I remembered seeing them in the Seven Magazine, but forgot about that for awhile until be stumbled upon it one evening. It was empty, but it was also almost 8pm so we were like the last customers before closing. They still were very kind from the time we ordered to the time we left. 

Like most places they served the chips and salsa while waiting for our food. The salsa was delicious. It was not chunky, which was great for me and it had this new taste that I cannot really describe. Thank goodness it was not too spicy either, just enough to make it heighten the taste buds. My friends also ordered guacamole, but I did not try it because I do not like my guacamole with tomato and onions in it, however, they said it was good.  

Next was our meal. They served us with these dishes that were so unique. It was a silver plate with little hold crested handles. It almost felt like medieval Spain ware or something. I am not good with eras, but I am just trying to get if you all a good picture of how cool it was. 

So I ordered the verde enchiladas and they were amazing. I usually only ever have two enchiladas wherever I go because they are so filling, but this dish comes with four and I was at the point where you know your full, but your not dying with the overeating bloating feeling. It was just perfect. I also had a side of their rice , which is what I judge most Mexican places by, and even that was delicious; light and fluffy. I was completely in love with my entire meal. 

My friends tried the mole, which is what Seven magazine wrote about. If mole is something you like, then apparently it was really really good. I tried it, but it taste like chocolate and coffee to me which is not something that goes well with my taste buds. However, every other bite my friend was just in awe of how good it was. We all ordered something that hit the spot for the night of Mexican good cravings and we thank Las Cazuelas for providing us with the craving satisfaction and a good experience. We will be back soon I am sure!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food, authentic Mexican, clean and reasonably priced. Very good salsa with fresh cilantro."}
{"text":"Great AUTHENTIC mexican food. Great fresh food at an below than affordable price. If enchiladas and /or MOLE are what you like...this place is #1.....salsa is the BOMB. its nice to see a small mom and pop place. If no one told you, you wouldn't even know it is in the target shopping center, by \"nothing bundt cakes\". If your looking for great tacos, this in my opinion is not the place. But we all have our own liking. .....its always service with a smile by the owner"}
{"text":"I have walked by this restaurant a few times, commented that we should try it, and yet never stopped in. The storefront is unremarkable, and while not uninviting there is very little to compel you to visit.

After some discussion, we decided to try based on our previous statements and the fact it is nearby and some Mexican food that is more \"home cooked\" would be welcome.

From the time we entered we were welcomed warmly, and I'm assuming the owner talked with us and helped us choose our dishes.

We ordered 6 dishes between 6 people (2 kids) and the food was delivered very quickly. While we waited, we had ample chips and salsa. The salsa was interesting, very atypical. It had a jellied quality to it that I really liked. It wasn't so spicy, one of our kids was happy eating it.

The rest of our lunch was fantastic. Very light flavors, the food itself wasn't so heavy which is unusual with a lot of Mexican dishes. I can see people being disappointed if they are expecting saturated flavors.

Great service, great food, not a 5-star establishment just because of location and ambience. It's hard to get excited when you're in a Target parking lot."}
{"text":"We came here at 8:30pm on a Friday night. The place was completely full. People were extremely loud. I felt like I was in a bar and had to yell across the table for someone to hear me. I use the sound meter in my phone and it registered 79 decibels which is extremely loud. Chips and salsa we're immediately delivered to the table. These were some of the best chips that I have ever had and a Mexican restaurant. They were nice and warm when they came to the table. The salsa was average. The hot salsa made you feel nice and warm inside. No problems getting refills on the chips and drinks. Food came out 15 minutes after ordering. The orders came out correct. They do give below average portion sizes compared to other Mexican restaurants. They were slightly more expensive. The food quality was decent. The plate with all the fixins for the fajitas was missing half the stuff you get at other Mexican restaurants. The staff was very attentive especially for how busy they were and we have no complaints about the service."}
{"text":"Food was bland and salty. Disappointed as decor is realistic."}
{"text":"Cruising down I-90 West on the way home from vacation, just didn't want fast food. Thanks to Yelp, we found Las Cazuelas! Edgar was a professional server and a joy! The Guacamole Mexicana was the best I've ever had. We each tried one of the lunch specials and they we good. Would stop again on our way through this area. Ol√©!"}
{"text":"Love the salsa here!  Lunch specials are all good. Need to make it for dinner some day."}
{"text":"In a word, inedible.   Yelp wants me to write more but there's really nothing more to say.  It was terrible."}
{"text":"Kept passing this place by in the strip mall as it is close to home, so thought I would give it a try as reviews were good from Yelpers!
Sure glad I did! 
Decided to do take out, so phoned in my order from home. Pictures dictated my first order, went with the chicken verde enchilada combo, an order of the shredded beef taquito's and of course some chips and salsa.
Place was really clean when I walked in 10 min later.....star number one! Owner was at the counter, he had taken my order personally on phone (nice guy)....another star!
Food was hot and ready to go, he even opened and showed me each item making sure it was right...star number three!!
Got home and dug in....two more BIG stars!!
I'm sold!!"}
{"text":"We just ate THEE best tacos and pozole here at this little joint! I feel sad that I'm finished already. Ha Ha. I'll be back asap."}
{"text":"There are few places you find that serve REAL Mexican cuisine at reasonable prices.  This is one!!  You must try it.  Not Tex-Mex, this is the real thing."}
{"text":"Due to the great reviews, we opted to check out this place for our Friday night dinner.  The place was small and indeed a hole in the wall restaurant. It is clean but quite small place.

We ordered 2 enchiladas in chili verde sauce and 2 enchiladas in mole sauce ($10), pozole ($8), Carne Asada torta w/ fries ($7 + $1.50 for fries), Arabe Quesadilla ($5.50) & Esquites ($3.50) for party of 4.

Here are our comments on the food we ordered:

1) Enchiladas in Chili Verde - This one is awesome! The chicken is flavorful and the green sauce is excellent with great kick.. not too spicy but just right. We all loved this one!
2) Enchiladas in Mole sauce - I thought this one was great too. The hint of sweetness with the combination of different spices sure made the enchilada great. My son and I loved it but my husband is not a fan.
3) Pozole - This is good as well but wouldn't say it's the best I've had. I did enjoy the flavor of the broth but wasn't a big fan of the chicken because it was a little tough and dry.
4) Carne Asada Torta - My husband did not like this one at all. He said it was bland and the meat was dry and no flavor... will not be ordering this for sure in the future.
5) Quesadilla Arabe - Both my son and husband thinks this was bland as well. Nothing special and will not be ordering this in the future as well.
6) Esquites - Elote in a cup.. this was alright.  I was a little disappointed on this as I was really hoping that this will be good coz I love elote. The lime and cotija cheese was overpowering everything.  I can't barely taste the corn and the mayo due to the sour taste from the lime and salty taste of the cotija cheese.  I will not be ordering this again.

Overall, this was not a bad place if you are craving for a good enchilada and not feeling Roberto's or Don Tortaco. I do feel that given the average size servings, this place is a little too expensive for me. We won't be frequenting this place."}
{"text":"Got the norm of mole enchiladas,  they are a oaxacan staple,  sweet,  chocolatey deliciousness.  Don't expect spicy red northern Mexican mole,  this is different. This recipe has more than 30 ingredients,   5 of them are dried Chiles and none of them are for spice they are for flavor.  

Also had the pozole,  I was cold,  and it warmed me up,  it made me happy. It is sweater weather after all. 

Also shared the esquite with the husband.  It's Corn off the cob,  mixed with cotija cheese,  Mayo and crushed chili pepper. Yummy. 

Ok,  we also had  the sopes lol!!!  Chorizo and asada.  Deliciousness,  perfection. Must have.

By the way we're not fat,  I swear!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great prices! We were mostly happy that we found the same menu as the previously existing El Pastor restaurant in Avon, but can you believe the food was even tastier?! We miss our favorite restaurant being down the street from us, but Las Caz is worth the drive even if only a few miles farther :)"}
{"text":"Food was ok. It's more like appetizers priced at regular food item costs. The service was bad. The waiter never asked if we wanted anything to drink. We had to stand up and walk over to him to get a drink. My friend asked for a soda and they thought he asked for a salad. Food was enough as I don't eat much, but ended up going next to the hotdog place next to it and was able to enjoy the rest of my lunch there with a hotdog."}
{"text":"Accidentally discovered this little Hidden Gem when my son wanted boba after ordering boba we stepped inside first thing I noticed was impeccably clean nicely decorated and what do you smell the Unbelievable Aroma of excellent red sauces. The food there is delicious very friendly people highly recommend. This is definitely  gourmet Mexican food in a small food court setting do not be dissuaded by its location. It is a long ways from home but I will be going back. Spread the word people small business need all the help we can give them."}
{"text":"The food is not all that bad, it's the best Mexican food in Avon Lake...but that's not saying much. Every time I eat here my food comes out hot, but was CLEARLY microwaved. Every time. Drinks are good and strong, salsa tastes like it was made in house and it's good. But like I said, my food is microwaved. I have microwaved quit a few things in my short life, and I know exactly what microwaved food looks and tastes like. It's inexcusable for a restaurant to serve people food like that and claim to be authentic Mexican food. It gets 3 stars because I'm not totally grossed out by microwave food, but if your palette is more refined, then please don't order the enchiladas. Service is lacking as always. And they have a couple of new young women working there that seem to always wear a scoul on their faces. I will probably continue to eat here, as my girlfriend enjoys the fajitas and the margaritas are solid. This place could definitely use some fine tuning and several changes.

I would also like to note that there are only really 2 Mexican food restaurants in the city of Avon Lake, and both microwave their food, so it's not like they are doing anything particularly bad based on local competition, but either way, you should never microwave food for your customers, it's unprofessional and degrades any real value you food may have had."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken enchiladas verde with rice and beans ($7) and my neither had the chicken enchiladas mole with rice and beans. With the two entrees, horchata, fried ice cream, and flan it was $29 including tax. 

The salsa is very hot and delicious to start. The service is fast and very friendly. The flan was incredible. My cousin ordered the churros which are AWESOME.  

I highly recommend this place for a quick, caudal, affordable meal.

The sign is hard to see at night, so look for Windy City,  the sushi place, and Nothing Bundt Cakes if it's your first time."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent food. Authentic as you get outside of Mexico. The Chile Relleno is the best I've had anyplace. Love love love this place."}
{"text":"OMG this food is so good. It's a small basic diner but the service is \"homey\" & the prices are reasonable. This is becoming a once a week habit. I recommend the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. My only criticism is; even though their salsa (and everything else) is fresh & made on sight, the  tortilla chips taste stale. BTW, definitely try the guacamole, the freshest!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, we used to go to Lindo but now that we've found this hidden gem, we haven't went back!!! Very authentic food at such a great price. The people who run it are amazingly sweet and very attentive! Love this place so much"}
{"text":"Here right now.   Excellent food.  This is real mexican food..not americanized.  Had the chanclas (roll stuffed w chicken with chorizo sauce on top), molletes (bread toasted w beans and mozzarella) and chilaquiles (sort of like nachos).  Great choices and great food.  Will be back to try more.  Great value too."}
{"text":"They bring you a huge pile of chips, which I think is to make up foe the smaller than average portions. Food was decent, nothing to brag about. Chicken is better than most. Streak is advertised as beef tips but is actually shredded. Huge selections of sauces."}
{"text":"This is a mom & pop or family business which I love the concept ~ however the food was disappointing.
    Ordered 2 cheese enchiladas with red sauce, granted this should be basic, I asked what type of cheese? And was told mozzarella..... REALLY?  Anyway they were fine, nothing to write home about and the red sauce might have come from a can, although I didn't see it, I'd say it's a pretty good guess. The rice was typical Mexican rice with carrots & peas, not very memorable and the beans really weren't my cup of tea even if I did get past the grayish color ~
    I was sorry I didn't enjoy this more as I really like to support small family owned businesses however I can't imagine I will be going back, adios."}
{"text":"The food here is great, and the owners are very friendly. Everytime we go we try a new dish and have yet to be dissapointed. The Enchiladas de Mole are my fav and the Esquites are the best side dish I think I have ever had at a Mexican food restaurant. The o my down fall is the seating inside the restaurant is minimal. We mostly get our food to go but on nice evenings we have sat outside at the shared patio for the shopping center, which really isn't too bad. Definitely a place we will continue to frequent when in the Mexican food mood!"}
{"text":"Great service and authentic Mexican food for a low price. 
The Mole enchiladas are amazing"}
{"text":"Always get good food here and the staff is nice every time..  The lunch servings are more than enough for one person.  Margaritas are pretty good too."}
{"text":"This place only gets 3stars. I just came in for something to go. I ended up paying $7 for 4 taquitos! I don't think I Will be coming back. Its a little too expensive considering all of the other lunch choices up and down eastern that offer more food for less."}
{"text":"Omg this is place is soooo so so DELICIOUS!!!!! 1st I wanted to try their elotes(mm mm mmm GOOD) 
2nd I saw the picture of their chanclas and I was sold! Great choice!!!! 
3rd I also wanted to try their enchiladas verdes and WOW!!!!! 

I'm in FOOD HEAVEN- As if I was back in Mexico eating the most authentic food ever (like momma's house)

The food is fulfilling and for the money! You will both HAPPY (pockets n belly)"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by how many extremely negative reviews there are of this place. I've been there twice. The first time, I got tamales that were a little dry and fairly unimpressive. I went back recently and got tacos (I ordered the al pastor tacos, and asked for one of them to be switched out so I could try a huitlacoche taco as well). The tacos were quite good; I was surprised by how much I liked the huitlacoche one (it had zucchini and lots of garlic besides the corn-fungus). My complaint would be that the tacos did not have tons of food in them, but I have to say that I was full when I finished, so maybe that's not so bad. My boyfriend was very happy with his veggie fajitas. 

The best thing about this place is that they make their own refried beans, which might not sound like a big deal, but in a town of Sysco-fied Mexican fare, that's pretty special, and you can really taste the difference."}
{"text":"Was looking for taco Tuesday specials with not much luck sooo stopped here because it was super close to my place. It is a tiny restaurant in the target shopping center. There are 5 tables to sit st indoors and some outdoor seating. We say inside and we're given complimentary chips and salsa - both really good. I ordered two small chicken tacos and it came with rice and beans for ~7$. Taco were indeed small but filling at the same time. I don't like beans but the rice was ok. There were a bunch different hot sauces to choose from on the counter. I enjoyed my meal and would recommend for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I wanted to look for a \"mom-and-pop\" Mexican restaurant for the casual atmosphere, yet served yummy, simplistic dishes, and we found this place based off the other high reviews. 
Yes, the place isn't busy, which was nice. The gentleman who worked as your cashier, server and buser was extremely courteous - think it was the owner. 
The food was yummy too! I liked my carne asada tacos. It's funny because I always order this the first time I go to any Mexican restaurant to estimate how well their food would be in the future, and the ladies in the kitchen could not go wrong with their cooking style! I honestly wish I copied my boyfriend and got the enchiladas though! 
Although they don't serve alcohol, they do have Mexican sodas, which is a bonus. 
I guess you can also eat outside of the restaurant as well because the gentleman went outside to check on his customers too."}
{"text":"Great service! Flautas and chilaquiles was wonderful! Salsa was nice and spicy and overall the food had great flavor. Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"This place has very nice people. The only reason I'm giving I 4 is because I ordered corn and it tasted kind of bad. Like they didn't even take the time to make it"}
{"text":"Good food. The Mole is awesome on the enchilada bit so is the green sauce. Also had some awesome fried ice cream.

Service was great too."}
{"text":"I have been coming here at least once a month for 3-4 years now, one thing I can say it is always consistently good food , it does not change and that is a good thing. The chicken Enchiladas in the Mole sauce are my favorite. The family that runs this business are nice people and they take pride in the food they put out."}
{"text":"Some of the best mole enchiladas I've ever had in Vegas. Highly recommended. I would come here just for the mole. The salsa verde enchiladas are awesome as well."}
{"text":"Great food, very friendly staff. Warm chips and salsa, margarita deals during the week. Nice patio. Great for groups or family dinning."}
{"text":"We were recommended here in a casual conversation with a stranger and decided to give it a try since we're close by. Wow! I am glad we did! The prices were reasonable and the tacos were great. The barbacoa was my favorite, followed by the carnitas!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, but lacking spice. Salsa was very good. However, the bathrooms are NOT handicap accessible. My mother is in a wheelchair and can barely walk. The wheelchair could not go into the stall. There were no railings for her to hold on to in the stalls. Both stalls were small, neither could hold a handicap person and a caregiver. I am not sure how the bathroom issue is even legal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town. They have the absolute best sopes!!! I would recommend Las Cazuelas to everyone."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite mexican spots!  We started of course with the chips and salsa which were fresh and hot and the salsa just the right amount of spicy.  I ordered the fresh guacamole to go with it and it was yummy although a bit chunky for my taste, I prefer it a bit smoother.  I had the stuffed pineapple and it was simply delicious!  It was stuffed with chicken, shrimp, onion and pineapple and covered with cheese. I'll definitely order that again!  My companion enjoyed her dish as well although I can't remember what it was called.  The waiter was attentive but not overbearing and the over all atmosphere was friendly and fun. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food here is always good but the prices have gone up.  The salsa used to be better. I think they changed the recipe, to many chuncks of onion and cilantro now."}
{"text":"Holy Mole Poblano! Yes, that is what is served here at Las Cazuelas!  I took a glance at the menu that was outside their storefront and noticed they had a bunch of Mexican food not found elsewhere. If you're looking for Pueblan food fare, well here it is! That's the big appeal for me. Although the menu selection is slim, I love the variety of dishes they have to offer.
 
My second visit here ended up being a mini fiesta of sorts. Orders of Mole Poblano, Pelonas, Frijoles Charros, Elote and complimentary tortilla chips and salsa covered my table. Yes all that for me. I had already tried most of the dishes on my first visit here and got hooked. The Pelonas especially! They remind me of sliders, only this is the Mexican version of it. The mini egg bun is fried with paste of refried beans smeared on and marinated shredded beef with combo Mexican sour cream/salsa sauce. Real simple but so good!  Oh and it's accompanied by the best beans ever! Frijoles Charros! Cowboy beans but Mexican version the owner explains to me.  The beans are the kind that's firm on outside and soft when you take a bite like it's been cooking all day. Simmering in with bacon, chorizo, and sausage too! It made one heck of a hearty dish.

Mole poblano is legit.  With the dark chocolate prominent. So it was more sweet, not too spicy. Oh by the way, with that said, I have to do the eye roll when I read or hear \"needs more spice\" or \"not enough of this..too much of that\"  blah blah blah. Not going to act like I know Mexican cuisine, nor am I some self proclaimed expert in tacos or whatever. There are regional differences in some of the dishes. Not all are the spicy variety. So any preconceived notion of enchiladas doused with spicy red sauce and drowned in cheese do not apply here.
 
It's a small operation run by husband and wife. Friendly, very humble and a super sweet couple.  So service is more personalized. Everything is prepared to order so my food came out one at a time for the most part, definitely not like the to-go fast food eateries speedwise.  I didn't mind a bit, since I wasn't in hurry. Serving portions are not the super size versions here either, but are just as filling. Everything is under $10. My mini fiesta was around $20ish ..not bad at all.
 
Fast/casual little restaurant. Order at counter and your meal is brought out to you when ready. The dining area is really pretty. Love the wall art deco, unique pallets with knick knacks from Mexico attached. Turns out that the wife made and decorated the place. The space is small with four tables that seat 4 fills up. No worries though, there is plenty seating outdoors in the courtyard shared with the hot dog and boba place.  How cool is that a few of my go to places are just a hop, skip and a jump away from each other."}
{"text":"We reeeeeeally like this place! First off, the price is totally amazing for what you get. Pretty much everything on the menu is reasonably priced, especially for fresh, handmade, Mexican food. The chicken enchiladas with green sauce are awesome. Their sauces in general are awesome, actually. To top it all off, the service is also top notch."}
{"text":"This was an excellent place. Even though I arrived 15 before closing, they still made my meal just the same with no problem at all. The cashier was quite amicable. I had the Enchiladas Mole Poblano. They were fantastic. But the real showstopper was the fried ice cream. Fried with a shell, it'll flip a sad day anytime. I highly recommend this establishment for service and culinary skills."}
{"text":"Quick Tip: It not an expensive place but it's clean and prices are really good. Also, you get complimentary chips and salsa if u r dinning in.

Restaurant is located right across from target. Its got many other restaurants in the vicinity including a hot dog joint and a boba tea place. It's a competitive area for a restaurant. However, what sets this place apart from others is the authenticity of the food. Mexican food in Henderson is easy to find; Robertos, Lindo Michocan, etc., but the taste of the food items in this place is exquisite. 

My favorite dish at this restaurant is Chicken Mole Enchiladas ($7). The mole sauce is rich and flavorful and enchiladas are in the league of their own. The meat is tender and has the right amount of spices. I could eat two plates of this because of the sauce. Chanclas; which is more like a french dip with avocado and shreaded chicken and its drenched in spicy sauce. Its wasn't my favorite, because the sauce didn't have much flavor to it. Complimentary, chips and salsa is good but salsa did have a lot of salt in it. 

Overall, this is an excellent place for cheap-authentic mexican food. I would highly recommend  you to checkout this location.  Mole chicken enchilada's are to die for."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Had amazing reviews and decided to try this place when we wanted to go somewhere we hadn't been before. Love, love, love this place! The staff is very friendly and the food is actually authentic and delectable. They have nice pictures on the wall of their food which are in good taste and accurately show what each dish is if you're unfamiliar. Prices are awesome! Especially when you consider the pozole (a dish that takes them over 24 hours to prepare and is available over the weekend) is $8... I can't say enough great things about this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing! This place was recommended to us and did not expect the flavor in their food! I chose the flautas.. 1 potato and 1 chicken. The chicken was good but the potato one was Amazing!! The mole enchiladas were great as well! Definitely will go back and refer people here!"}
{"text":"Great service. Food is fresh and affordable. The Molletes are so good. I would highly recommend this place for a good mexican lunch."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Mexican food. They start by bringing you a huge basket of chips with some of the BEST salsa! It is so good and if you add a little Cholula...AMAZING! They have a large menu to choose from. I have tried a lot of different things and have never been disappointed. I would suggest trying one of their quesadillas (either the mexicano or the fajita) because they are so so good! The service is excellent and they get your food out to you quickly. It is great for big groups and families as well. 

The only downfall (for me) is the margarita. They are premade and come from a machine. They are neon green and I think they taste like sugar water with a hint of margarita flavoring and tequila.  They have a great selection of Mexican beers and a full bar to make up for it though!

Otherwise this is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants on the west side!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing..If you love fresh Guacamole this is the spot for you..At 4.00 for a large container I will say this is the best guac in Vegas.."}
{"text":"My husband and I saw this place during one of our many trips to Target and decided to drop in for lunch. The menu is very limited but it seems like everything on it is delicious and done very well! They offer plates that are very difficult to find at a \"fast food\" Mexican restaurant - or really ANY typical Mexican restaurant. Very authentic. 

The place is small, but clean. It is clear that the owner really cares about presentation - not just of the restaurant but of the plates as well. 

The mole poblano is DELICIOUS and very authentic. Very very close to the mole my abuela and suegra make. The torta de pierna was also perfect!

When the plates came out my husband and I thought it wouldn't be enough food. As it turns out the serving size was perfect. We were satisfied but not overstuffed. 

I'm definitely looking forward to returning to this place many more times to try everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"First time and awesome! The service was top notch, quick and on point. We ordered the guacamole and chorizo queso which was the best we ever had. Also ordered beef burritos and combo fajitas. The ground beef and enchilada sauce in and on the burritos were delicious! Fajitas were awesome too. One more delicious item was their margarita on the rocks with Don Julio Anejo.. YUM! Will be back."}
{"text":"This is good, solid mexican food.  I would definitely come here again, but it's pretty standard Mexican fair.  Nothing all that unusual.  We used a yelp deal!"}
{"text":"Food is average here. I had carne asada sopes and my boyfriend had carne asada gotta. Customer service is 3 out of 5. The guy at the counter is dry but this is the closet to authentic  Mexican food in this area."}
{"text":"I'm sorry say that this Mexican food is mediocre at best. First, the chips taste like they came right out of the bag, little portion too. I had a chili relleno and chicken enchilada w/mole sauce. The chili relleno was swimming in grease, inedible. The enchilada was ok but I've had MUCH better. The restaurant was small and it was very warm inside. Food is overpriced imo. Service was adequate which is why I gave two stars."}
{"text":"Best green sauce in the city! Authentic Mexican food, can't go wrong with the mole either. Small place but exceptional service, the people that work here are awesome. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Would've been 5-stars except for the food took awhile especially when we were one of two parties there. Maybe lots of pick-up orders? 

Otherwise, excellent food. My husband had the carne asada tacos, and I had chorizo sopes. Will definitely return or order pick-up."}
{"text":"Great food! Fabulous margaritas! And wonderful staff! Always a great time here!"}
{"text":"Classic Mexican fare, well executed and fast service. Stop in and try the Mole or the tacos, amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! My dad and I tried the barbacoa and cochinita tacos, salsa verde chicken enchiladas, and flan. Everything was delicious-fresh, flavorful, excellent service and very very reasonable prices. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant to come to for mole enchiladas and esquites. The quality of the food is always delicious. It taste very authentic. I have been coming here for years. This place gives me life!"}
{"text":"First time coming here. This place has great service , and the food is delicious! I had the enchiladas and smothered corn! Great family atmosphere."}
{"text":"We love coming here!! The staff tests you like family. The drinks and perfect and the food fantastic! This is by far one of our favorite places to visit. And it's family friendly."}
{"text":"THE BEANS ARE KI-LLER! MT = Mighty Tasty!

I had to drop in to try some real mexican food as not doing so while being this close to the border with our Mexican friends would be like eating at Taco Bell in El, Paso, Texas. I digress.

I had the quesadilla and that chorizo mexican sausage was good. The prices are decent even though for a few dollars more you could get alot more food elsewhere. But rarely do I want quantity over quality with food (even with buffets). The quality here was very good. The chorizo was tasty and the pico sauce was super fresh. I may never get to Mexico, but this was very decent. I laughed as I saw the windy city restaurant next door as I have eaten a lot of Italian Beef in Chicagoland in the past and wasn't ready to see that in Vegas.

Try this place, I think you will enjoy it...it is not TexMex or fast food Mexican Food. I believe it is more real than at least half of mexican restaurant food served in the usa. I think it is NOT  a chain restaurant.i was happy with the food.

I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The Mole here is world-class not to mention the best you will likely ever get the chance to taste in your life.

The Enchiladas De Mole Poblano will create a smile in the \"pickiest\" of people. The dish may look small at first, however do not let this fool you. The meal is filling. The aroma and the flavors will make a fantastic memory for you and/or your date/family. 

The pickled onions are really something. I dare you to try them. (heat index is high) A unique flavor that will make the pork tacos a real treat. 

The chips and salsa are a simple food, however they tend to either bring people back to a restaurant or leave them wanting. The chips and salsa here will bring you back over and over again. (excellent flavor in the salsa) 

The best part about this little secret in Henderson, is the family that operates the business. My friends and I always enjoy coming here as a result of the incredible service and attention to every detail on the plate. 

Bring your date, wife, and/or family here ~ awesome!"}
{"text":"Cheap n cheerful. Good food with a simple but interesting menu. I'm a huge mole fan, and found their mole poblano (served over a la carte chicken enchiladas) very good but a bit too sweet. Tasty though! Also the ambiance very bright with fluorescent lights. Their salsa is rich and good, but the chips taste bagged--not bad though. Excellent friendly service. Very cool metal plates! Stop in when you're in this part of Vegas. Oh and my meal price? Under $8.00 with no drink.

Also--note that if you're eating in, they have table service with menus. The design of the place will make you think you're supposed to order at the counter (which you also can)."}
{"text":"I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS RESTAURANT! The family that owns it is so nice and welcoming. The food is authentic and reminds me of home. THE PELONAS & FLAN ARE DELICIOUS!!! This place is a hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"5 for good food on the cheap and good service. It's family owned, and they were really nice! And it's also a bonus that it's really conveniently close to our new place.

What we ordered (in the order of fave to least):
-molletas
-enchiladas de salsa verde
-chanclas (w sauce on the side so bread doesn't get soggy)
-taco arabe
-frijoles charros 
-corn in mayo, cheese, and lime"}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  The employees were incredibly kind. The food was delicious and very well priced. We will make this place a regular stop!"}
{"text":"The couple who owns this restaurant are the sweetest.  They make amazing food that always tastes homemade. We eat here on the regular and we've never had a bad experience.  Everything tastes made on the spot.  The prices are very reasonable so it could easily be your go-to spot for Mexican. Support this local Vegas business. 

Located on the corner of Silverado Ranch & Eastern in the Target shopping center."}
{"text":"The chips and cheese were pretty good. I ordered a chimichanga, and I was happy that it arrived with my many substitutions done correctly. The chicken was kind of bland and it stuck to the skillet, which was unfortunate because it lost its crispness. I also got a side of rice which was also decent. I have been going to this restaurant for about 4 years now, and I would say the flavors just aren't as rich anymore. :/ The service was good though. I got several refills of both chips and my water. They were attentive to our needs."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try it as we lived down the street. It's a local mom and pop operated eatery and the owner was very friendly.
Ordered the Taco de Cochinitas and Chicken Enchiladas Verdes. It was authentic. 
The complementary chips and salsa was really good. The salsa was spicy and we use some of it to fire up our enchiladas.
Not fancy but honest food!!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food we have had since moving to Las Vegas! 100% authentic and reasonably priced. Absolutely love this place! Their salsa is to die for and the owners are great people. Will be back."}
{"text":"Best place for Mexican food in the Avon Lake area. Service is always quick and the food is always served promptly and fresh. Fresh chips and salsa arrive at the table with minutes of being seated. Drinks specials are very popular with the local crowd.

Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"What a delicious surprise in a little strip mall. Food was delicious and extremely cheap. Husband and wife owned and operated. The wife did all of the faux painting and decorating as well as the delicious cooking. The dishes were beautiful and we sat outside. Small place, not a lot of seating. I see a new location in their future. With yummy affordable food like this, I highly recommend this eatery."}
{"text":"Work in the Avon area and finally made it into Las Cazuelas.  Great food, portions, prices, and service."}
{"text":"The presentation of the food was good. I wasn't crazy about my enchiladas but the mole sauce was good. Nothing special. It was corn tortillas and cheese with mole sauce on top. Smallest enchiladas I ever had. My husband ordered their signature item. I could tell he really wasn't enjoying it. Very disappointed even though we saw great reviews. Maybe it was the food that we ordered. Our waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"Red enchiladas are a must at this place the mole is the bomb! Not one dish has disappointed me yet."}
{"text":"If you are looking for mexican street tacos this is NOT the place! This is my 2nd trip here but 1st time trying the tacos and what a huge dissapointment! If not for my 1st visit where I had the mole enchiladas I would have given this place a 1. The service is good and they are honest about wait times if busy. Chicken tacos looked like the chicken was from the frozen Tyson chicken you buy at the store. Carnitas were dry and Carne asada had zero flavor. The tortillas are are a bit large but still tasty. Basically the meat is pre cooked and rerigerated.
Chile rellenos was also delicious so bottom line come here for authentic mexican dishes except tacos."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times already and it's never a disappointment! Every time I come here I try a new dish and you really can't go wrong! I love the pineapple juice they have it's SO good. Honestly everything tastes so delicious! The guac is so yummy , and I got the carne asada tacos today which is definitely on my favorite list now as well as the fried banana for dessert . Highly recommend. And the guy that always serves us is super nice and friendly, not sure if he's the owner but he does a great job as well as the cook."}
{"text":"A 4.5-star Yelp rating steered me to this place after I'd attended a NASCAR race outside town. I was visiting a friend in Las Vegas, and I must say I was spending time in my state's large-and-incredibly-different-from-everywhere-else-in-Nevada outlier as much for the great food as for the race or anything else.

When my girlfriend, friend and I walked into this place, I initially thought I'd made a mistake. The seating area isn't large, and one orders from a not-huge menu that's posted above the cash register. A very pretty woman who appeared to be the co-proprietor flashed me a smile from the kitchen, which cooled my sudden desire to instead check out the hot dog restaurant next door.

I'm sure glad it did. I quickly realized that I'd never tried about half the food on the Las Cazuelas menu, including the esquites -- which this place defines as \"steamed corn kernels prepared with a touch of lime, mayonnaise, cotija cheese and chili powder.\" The chili powder comes on the side, so you can control the spice level. It was a treat to try something so unexpected and great. I've been to hundreds of Mexican restaurants in big cities, and I've never had esquites. Elote apparently is a cousin dish, only the corn is still on the cob. It's also served here.

I also got a couple of types of the pork tacos, which are nice and small, and sampled my dining partners' quesadillas. The meat in all the dishes tasted fresh, and the salsa had enough kick that I had to blow my nose more than five times --¬†which is the measure of a quality place for me. The salsa served with the quesadillas is different from the salsa served with chips at the beginning of the meal. It's spicier.

My only complaint about the meal was that I ordered water and was given a small styrofoam cup. I generally need lots of water when I'm eating spicy foods because although my brain loves the spice, my Northern European body doesn't. I had to get up to refill on water far too many times. It's worth noting that I'd just spent four hours in the sun, so I was parched coming in. 

This place doesn't sell alcohol. There's really no reason it should, given that the entire dining experience lasts 20 minutes or so, but it's worth noting for those who might want a cerveza with their meal. The lack of frills at this place ends up being one of its greatest virtues, as the prices are good, as is the treatment by the proprietors. I won't be back because I live far away, but if this place were in Carson City, I'd be there multiple times a week."}
{"text":"First of all the owner is a bit curt, but i didn't come here with the intention of being his friend. I ordered a carne asada huarache and it was delicious. My daughter had the huevos a la Mexicana with the sauce on the side and she loved it. I'm glad I asked for the sauce on the side since she's only 2 but she liked some of it with her food which was a plus for us.  My husband ordered the cochinitas tacos and he loved them. I think he secretly wanted another order. What was a disappointment was the elote. I expected something like street corn, which it was similar, but it had some spice that I did not like.  Couldn't put my finger on it but nevertheless no one ate it. Overall if I'm back in this area I'll definitely be back to eat here."}
{"text":"We loved it!  Chips came out quick and were warm, we started with queso cheese dip to go along with their tasty salsa which was tasty.  I got the chicken fajitas and she went with the burro las cazuelas ( it was huge).  Neither of us finished, but happily took our left overs with us.

Very clean, we'll light, and friendly staff... We'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Really great and authentic food at phenomenal prices. Super convenient location and always clean and friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Driving from california with the kids we were hungry and googled traditional food and we found this place. Its really good and since we are mexican its for sure a traditional mexican place. The chilakiles enchiladas and sopes are good. For sure coming back on our next trip to vegas."}
{"text":"Best green enchiladas in Las Vegas it is really worth the drive if you are looking for authentic and delicious Mexican food.  Cochinita tacos and mole enchiladas are quite good as well, but my favourite over all Las Cazuelas green enchiladas!"}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian food - veggie beans, rice, and amazing vegetarian sauces (we had the mole and red sauces). Guac was delicious."}
{"text":"This is defiantly my favorite authentic Mexican spot in Las Vegas! You have to try the Mole Enchiladas! Also they always give you chips and home made salsa which is delicious! The service from the owner is great as well!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had 4 mole enchiladas for 10 bucks came with rice and beans.  Very very good. I've had this dish in the past at other restaurants but never this good. It felt so authentic and it wasn't sweet it was perfect. I thought I was exaggerating so, I let my coworker try it and he felt the same way. The owner was nice and service was quick. I'll be back here many times for sure. Place was clean as well. Kind of hidden but worth the search."}
{"text":"The food was really good - especially the fried ice cream and mole enchiladas. The mole has that signature subtle chocolate taste with a bit of bold flavor. The meal is fairly light- since the enchiladas are slightly small, but its still filling. The workers were kind and seemed professional. I'll return again"}
{"text":"Small little family restaurant.  Tacos and enchiladas had great flavor. The owner and his wife were very nice. Everything was very authentic. Nice little hidden spot for good Mexican."}
{"text":"Delicious!! 
Little hole in the wall in target shopping center... Food was fresh, salsa delicious, green sauce and creme with the flautas  was dang good!
I love family owned establishments..."}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food!!! The owners are very nice and you can tell by the taste they put their heart in the food.
My favorite was the Chili Relleno!!! Huge roasted poblano pepper filled with cheese, perfectly coated and fried. Smothered in a mild, but flavorful red sauce.

The pork tacos on corn tortillas were very good too. The pork is seasoned to perfection and the accompanying picked onions and habanero give them the perfect kick.

Enchiladas de Salsa Verde was very filling. Each rolled corn tortilla was stuffed full of chicken breast meat and topped with a zesty tomatillo green sauce.

Everything was so good and ate so much there was no room left for the fried ice cream. 

We will be back for desert! 

Aloha!!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am in this (LAME) part of town, I try to go to this little restaurant. Today I had their chicken enchiladas with mole. Always amazing! Love this place and wish they would be closer to the west side!"}
{"text":"You are always greeted when you walk in, the staff is very friendly. My children LOVE ordering ACP, I love the chicken nachos, not a healthy choice, but a delicious choice, the chicken melts in your mouth! 

Everything is priced well for Mexican food. The food is the basic Mexican food you will see at any Mexican restaurant and their guacamole doesn't seem fresh, but it's a local small business that has yummy food, good prices and a friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood this afternoon and decided to try this out for lunch because of the high ratings. It's a little place that has the nice authentic touches of Mexican pottery hanging on the walls. Outside there's a lovely little courtyard with a fountain and misters beneath the canopies so you can walk around after eating.

My daughter ordered an Carne Arabe quesadilla with elote on the side and I got the Mole Chicken Enchiladas. The quesadilla came with a side of chile chipotle which was a nice compliment to it. The food was very tasty and was truly what I imagine Mexican food from Mexico City is all about. I asked the owner where they were from because the Mexican food I'm used to eating and making at home is more Tex-Mex or Cali-style...he told me that they're from Puebla, Mexico about 2 hrs. from Mexico City. 

The food was flavorful and yet very light so you don't feel very stuffed afterwards. I knocked off a star because I thought the portions were a little small for the price, but otherwise it was very good. I will return soon if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Great little Mexican restaurant in a strip mall. Limited menu with tacos, tortas and enchiladas. No alcohol but some soda if you want. Just four tables. They are busy with takeout. My wife and I dropped in and had a quick dinner. The enchiladas des mole poblano was excellent. My wife enjoyed the marinated pork sandwich. The taquitos came with chile verde guacamole sauce with just the right level of spice."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food! I tried the green chicken enchiladas and my husband tried the mole chicken enchiladas. Food hit the spot and was ready quick. I definitely will recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This small ( 4 table) yet quaint restaurant is situated in a small plaza on the corner of Silverado/Eastern.  It is embedded in between Yummy Sushi Grill and Windy City Beefs and Pizza.  It's a great addition to the center as it is not your typical Mexican Food Restaurant.  It is a family owned business and the husband and wife team are very modest and friendly.  You can tell their mission is to showcase their native food from their city of Puebla.  

Our menu consisted of the following:

**Molletes: A split hoagie topped with beans, mozzarella cheese and lots of pico de gallo (chopped tomato, onion and chilies) added after the sandwich is grilled in the oven so the cheese can melt.  Unfortunately, our son is quite picky so he had his with just the beans and cheese...let's just say he licked his plate clean!

Chicken Enchilada Mole:  This is definitely not your average enchilada as it is dressed in a chocolate-rich mole sauce.  Not my favorite but could be YOURS!

**Pelonas: 2 sliders filled with marinated shredded beef fried with a smear of refried beans dressed with sour cream and salsa.  The description sounds nothing extravagant but believe me it will leave you wanting to order more...which we did ofcourse.

Chanclas, slider-sized bolillo rolls filled with shredded chicken and avocado and drizzled with a chorizo-infused sauce...this is definitely worth the mess or a knife and fork will do too.

Like I said earlier on my tip: you may want to look at the menu completely before ordering the tapas like dishes.  On our first visit, we started with one dish, then had to try another, and couldn't leave until we tried one more item!  Finally my husband and I agreed to return on another day as to not explode with all the yummy goodness.

I have a feeling this place won't be here too long (in a good way) as they will need a bigger brick and mortar to accommodate their Foodie Fans!"}
{"text":"This is some serious Mexican food. The kind my mom and I cook up at home. Without doubt this is my favorite authentic Mexican food place. I don't live close by but it's sooooo worth the drive! I always order something to go after I've already eaten there because it's that good. Plus, it's always great to support a mom and pop shop! 

I want to give it five stars but the customer service could be a tiny bit better. They are not rude or ignore their tables, but because they don't say much as far as \"Welcome, How are you? Thank you for coming in!\" They also are simply monotone. Even though they are  monotone servers, I'll still be back. It's not THAT big of a deal."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant. Great authentic taste and preparation. Very reasonable prices and terrific service."}
{"text":"Decided to try Mexican tonight (my husband wants to find somewhere comparable to his favorite place in Vegas) since we just moved here. We both loved it!! The chips and salsa were so yummy (could taste the fresh cilantro!) and brought out as soon as we sat down.  Hubby got a taco and couple of enchiladas and I got a carne Asada burrito (which was ginormous!) and everything was so yummy with great taste.  When the weather cools off a little more we wanna sit on the patio cause it looks very nice.  Only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 was cause our table and booth was kind of dirty when we first sat down and the table was a little sticky. But great service and real good food. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"A small, family run restaurant in Henderson that knocks out authentic regional Mexican food.  The place is very small (4 tables with about 4 seats each), the kitchen is small, but the food is big-time delicious.  Service is super friendly and accommodating and the menu does a great job of describing the unique dishes. I had the enchiladas with mole.  This mole is legit and tasty!  I also ordered  chancles, which are a lot like sliders, in a spicy chorizo sauce...so good.  Portion sizes and price are right on target as well.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Amazing place so so good  I order molletes chile relleno and elotes love it will definitly  come back authentic mexican place :)"}
{"text":"This place was great.  The food tasted great, the owner was working the dining room and was extremely polite and attentive.  The food came up quick.  For a small place, only 4 tables and 16 seats this place is worth the trip.  The portions were perfectly sized and the ambiance was small and homey.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We're in Las Vegas for a combination business and pleasure trip and searched Yelp for our dinner this evening. We found this restaurant to have good food and with a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Heading thru lost-wages this week and thought I'd give this mom and pop place a try, glad I did. Excellent food and services at a affordable price."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great feel, real authentic food. Doesn't feel Americanized or fake. Their plates are amazing as well, reminds me of going to my Mexican neighbors for dinner. 

I recommend this for a quick delicious meal."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious!!!Everything we ordered had great flavored! We ordered the Enchiladas de mole (the mole has so much flavor!),quesadilla de carne asada,and the Chanclas!!!! Overall the flavor was great! The service was terrific!! Totally recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Dallas native, moved here to VEGAS 30 years ago. This food was O.K. and cheap at this \"hole in the wall\" but not worth another drive across town. I don't care about atmosphere or service unless its really awful. Its all about the food for me. I didn't expect this place to equal my beloved \"TEX-MEX\" so I wasn't disappointed. Don't go here for TAMALES, they don't serve them! I have yet to find a really good Meskin restaurant here in VEGAS. Some say LINDO MICHOACAN is da best but I have yet to chek it out.  I'm not a Meskin food \"snob\", Meskin food is like wimmin for me, \"the worst I ever had was wonderful\".  PALACE STATION had a good meskin place for many years and their new one in same spot there is o.k."}
{"text":"The food here was OK. Nothing spectacular, very plain. It being the only \"real\" Mexican restaurant around here I guess it will have to do. The service was good. The lady that tended to us was very kind."}
{"text":"Service was great, very friendly and quick. Sadly the food wasn't what I expected as traditional Mexican food but they tried. I had the corn on the cob and it was very good. The free chips and salsa were also good."}
{"text":"Really good, errr muy bueno!! Muy authentico. Fresh ingredients make this small locale feel big on taste."}
{"text":"The food here is so good! Small family owned that take pride in this little restaurant! I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best restaurant in Avon Lake and best Mexican restaurant in Cleveland. I go probably at least once a week."}
{"text":"Yummy Chile Rellanos and Barbacoa Tacos!   We brought them home and wished we had gotten more...  luckily we'll be back and remember to get more than less!  OHHHH. Don't forget the CHURROS!  wowzers!  Makes a cute date night at home!"}
{"text":"I was hungry for Mexican food and decided to give this a try. I'll never go back. The margaritas were just mediocre and the cheese dip thin. We waited 45 minutes after ordering and still had no food.  I realize it could have been a unique problem tonight but no one came around to offer more drinks or to apologize for the wait. No excuse for that."}
{"text":"Great margaritas and service. Food is okay. Not great, not horrible. Its close to home and the ambiance is friendly. I give it four stars for the area. I wouldnt drive a distance."}
{"text":"Everything my family ordered here was delicious and quick. There is a really nice patio outside to enjoy food when weather permits. All our food was thoroughly enjoyed from my chile rellano, my kid's cheese quesadilla and my husband's torta. Delicious food with friendly service."}
{"text":"First off, apologies to Las Cazuelas for delaying this review.  This place is simply awesome, and I should have written this review sooner.  As someone who doesn't eat a lot of Central American food, LC has earned a place in my regular rotation when I am on this side of town!  

Don't let the modest atmosphere of the restaurant fool you, the food quality here is just about as gourmet as it gets.  I've heard to referred to as Pueblan food more so than Mexican.  I must admit that I am ignorant in this area, but I can tell you this is not your typical Mexican food.  

I highly recommend trying the enchiladas with the mole sauce.  This sauce is homemade with a delicious non-sweet chocolate flavor.  I crave it.  The verdes sauce is also excellent.  The new churros are the best I've ever had; custard filled with a homemade sweet chocolate sauce that will blow you mind!

This place is an absolute must try if you live in the area.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Our trip here ended in the emergency room.  My girlfriend is allergic to avocados.  We stopped by because we were in the area.  She ordered the beef taco appetizer as her meal and asked for sour cream on the side.  It didn't say anything in the description about guacamole, yet when the waitress brought it to the table, it had a big blob of guacamole on the lettuce.  We called her back and told her my girlfriend was allergic to avocados and we sent the plate back.  Only a couple minutes later, she came back with the nachos, no guacamole could be seen but the lettuce looked messy.  And my girlfriend and I looked at each and went, did she just scoop it off and give us back the same plate?  But we gave her the benefit of the doubt.  Well before my girlfriend had eaten a quarter of the nachos, she said she was starting to get itchy.  Within a couple minutes, she started having trouble breathing.  She started digging around the chips on the plate and found some that looked like they had guacamole on them.  We called for the manager, it took a long time for him to come over and we told him they just gave her an allergic reaction.  They comped the nachos but we still had to wait around for what seemed like forever for someone to bring the check so we could pay for my food, all the while my girlfriend's allergic reaction is getting worse by the minute.  She was choking when we left, she was throwing up in the car all the way to the ER.  Thankfully she was treated at the ER and she is okay but suffice it to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"It was ok. I got the enchiladas with the chocolate mole. The portions could be bigger."}
{"text":"We stopped in on our travels back home and the food was amazing. I had the sopas and they were so fresh and flavorful! Everyone in our family had something different and it was all good. The only reason why I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because it felt like we were imposing on the man serving us, and were the only people in the restaurant. This would be a regular stop if we were local!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed after reading the yelp reviews.  Ordered 4 Taco de Cochinita tacos and 4 chicken enchiladas with green sauce, beans and rice on both plates for an extra $3.25 ($11.25 each).
Very small enchiladas and tacos, they do not resemble the pictures in the online menu.  The pork looked more like a glob of meat filling with very little flavor,  the chicken had no flavor at all.
Beans are refried ( about a tablespoon) and the rice was very bland (maybe 2 table spoons) all for an astonishing $3.25 extra.
No cilantro or garnishes (as pictured online) on the plates, cheese on the enchiladas was mozzarella ??? 
Should be 2 stars, the extra star is for the kind gentlemen who took & served our orders."}
{"text":"Went looking on Yelp for some place different in the neighborhood that I had not tried. This place came up 7th on the list.. Should have been in the top 5. 
If you are looking for REAL Mexican food, not Tex-Mex this is the place. 
Family owned and operated, which I love supporting local, they serve genuine food from Puebla, Mexico. 
The salsa verde is excellent. My husband had the chicken enchilada verde, all white chicken wrapped in fresh soft tortillas and topped with green sauce and creama. Need to go back soon to have them again.. they are that good. 
One daughter had the carne asada tacos which were delicious and the other daughter had taquitos that were homemade and tasted great. 
I enjoyed the Mexican corn on the cob, a must try if you have never had it. I also had a small shredded beef sandwich, Polonas . 
For dessert, the flan which was rich, creamy and lots of flavor and an order of churros which were filled with caramel sauce.. 
Everything was spot on, and I can't wait to return! 
If you're looking for atmosphere its not here, but if your looking for an excellent meal, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Once again we are back at the Mexican joint and we are with p, all I can say this time is this shit never fucking fails, we are waiting on the Nina and I'm so fucking excited, I'm on my 4th margarita and I'm fucking lit, if you want a good bite to kill off the dope sickness this is your spot. Can't fucking believe it"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, very clean and the food is incredible!!! Great experience, nice to visit a restaurant that makes you feel special!"}
{"text":"Interesting little place.  I had a couple of Tacos (one carne, one pollo).  Wifey had chicken enchiladas and elote.  It was all good.  We'll be back again"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant! I believe it's the owner and the wife who operate it. The food is amazing and authentic, I recommend the chicken flautas. Service is always great and this is quickly becoming our favorite spot."}
{"text":"Been back a few times and tried several different dishes- all fantastic and fresh. Seriously crave this place all the time now."}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing great maybe because I'm from Mexico and I have ate great Mole Poblano, the service wasn't great either it took a while to get our food. I didn't love it, sorry! I had great expectations because of the 5 stars reviews."}
{"text":"Got simple takeout order for two. Picked it up when they where bringing it out. Got it home and they had messed the order up. Called them and had to drive all the way back to get the right order. Received a \"I'm sorry\" and that was it. Food was not that good for all the hassle. If I get again, definitely won't do takeout, not worth my time and gas!"}
{"text":"The food is good and reasonably priced. Service, however, is HORRIBLE. The owner is always rude and unfriendly."}
{"text":"I have to say once they brought us the chips and salsa we should have just gotten up to leave.. Store bought chips and salsa was obviously from a can. My corn had so much mayonnaise and cheese I had to scrape it off with a knife to eat it. The fruit on the menu was not fresh cut fruit as expected but some sort of gelatin with a can of fruit cocktail mixed in.. I would definitely reconsider the menu at this place. However my husband loved his torta.. I actually felt really sorry for the owners as you just know this place is never going to make it."}
{"text":"This place was good but nothing that makes my taste buds exclaim 

The flavors were good, nothing memorable 
We ordered the 4 taco combo plate (2 barbacoa, 2 al pastor), and 4 mole enchiladas 

Barbacoa was hands down the best we had there. Mole enchiladas were good but I felt like it was missing something. 

No chillies, but they had habenero sauce- which unfortunately was not very spicy 

I'd eat here again if it was the easiest option. But not going to go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Tacos Oriental. Best taco of my life. Period. 

I am from San Diego. We are on the border. We should have great Mexi food. It sucks. Nothing like this. AMAZING. Go here now. The owner is so nice and provides great service. Go now!"}
{"text":"Las Cas is a great little Avon Lake spot. Their lunch fajitas and steak tacos are my favorite. My to go orders are always made quickly and correctly. The margaritas are also really good!"}
{"text":"Very delicious. Perfect place when you crave authentic mexican food. Taquitos and chile relleno are top notch. Rice is just like grandma made it. If your g ma is from MX. Definitley the perfect spot for a quick lunch . Not much more to say. Eat there. Its freakin good. ."}
{"text":"Really delicious food.  Good value, and tastes very authentic as well.  I asked them to make my food extra spicy and they actually did it perfectly, which is a first.  Would definitely go back if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Great food , small location but great service and g r at food.  Mole enchiladas are the best."}
{"text":"So so delicious!  I love supporting local businesses.  The owners are so sweet and accommodating.  I was a little confused on how the infamous Mole tasted and they gave me a sample.

They pretty much told me what to order and I loved every bit of it."}
{"text":"Any Mexican restaurant with a small family style atmosphere instantly has my heart, and this one is no different. I loved the Already great reviews of this place,  which is brought me in the first place, but Also the extremely appetizing AUTHENTIC  pictures of what the food will look like upon it's delivery at your table. This served as a helpful guide for someone who had never been to this establishment before. This is definitely a place I'm keeping on the roster"}
{"text":"This is perfect for a quick not too heavy or too expensive bite to eat.  I did expect more as far as location and set up, but, it was perfect for us as a last quick meal in Vegas before heading home.

My son ordered the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano - Shredded chicken rolled in corn tortilla, covered with Mole Poblano and topped with cotija cheese, onion and roasted sesame seeds. They were a little too sweet and choclatey for our tastes.

My mom had that Huevos Mexicanos and she loved them!  

I had the Pelonas - 2 Fried Rolls stuffed with shredded beef , fried beans, cream and hot sauce.  They were not as seasoned as I would have liked, tasted like they needed salt or something was missing.  If it wasn't for the cream and hot sauce, I think the meat would have been too dry.  The bread was delicious though!

And we all shared the mini-Molletes - open face bolillo bread spread with refried beans and topped with melted cheese and pico de gallo.  They reminded me of home!"}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas and found this restaurant on Yelp.  Tried the Pelonas and LOVED them!  Guacamole was very yummy too.  Meal comes with great chips and salsa (a little spicy).  Overall great experience and friendly, nice owner!"}
{"text":"Amazing, Best in Vegas!

The food at Las Cazuelas is awesome! It's the best I've had in Vegas.  Every dish tastes like it was made fresh, even the beans.  In general, I've hated every mole I've tasted, but the Enchiladas De Mole Poblano was spot on!  I'm looking forward to eating my way through this menu."}
{"text":"You guys! Daaaaaa best mexican food it's cute and tiny and it has great sit and eat service and the food ! The food it really good! Compared to my mom and Nana's homemade mexican food. Just try at least once."}
{"text":"Small place.  Looks like a hole in the wall, but the food is delicious.  Owners are from near Mexico City.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off with their service-- because they were so friendly! When we were done with our food, he let us know we didn't have to clean, thanked us, and even the lady in the kitchen thanked us, lol. 

We ordered 2 elotes, one in a bowl and one on the cob. While we waited, he started us off with some chips and salsa; very addicting! I am so glad I found out about this place, because I would previously drive so far for non-authentic, over-priced elote. The way they prepare their's is perfect! They are very generous with the spread, and they give you a chili shaker so you could add spice to your liking. 

Was not expecting much from such a small, random restaurant that I found on Yelp. Will be back to try more food, possibly will be the first place I rate 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is redic. Great food. Inexpensive prices. Real clean spot. Must orders include the Mexican corn off the cob and the green chicken enchiladas. Authentic dishes w quality ingredients and great flavored. Plenty of desserts as well. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service was punctual and they offered us to sit down to look at a menu. We did come in to sit down and eat vs Carry out. The homemade guacamole came with the chips and salsa fairly fast. The guacamole was made to order which u have to order. I ordered the chicken taquitos which were amazing even cold later that night at home. You have to give them a try, u will not b disappointed."}
{"text":"Aut√©ntica comida mexicana!! Tacos de Cochinita y enchiladas Verdes y de mole deliciosas! El mejor restaurante mexicano en Las Vegas y un servicio espectacular."}
{"text":"Dear Lord, this was seriously the best Mexican food we've had.  I've never had mole that actually tasted chocolatey and smooth.  The meats in the each dish were standalone good and the sauces & salsas were a complex addition that wasn't \"needed\" but were certainly appreciated and enjoyed. The customer service was excellent too."}
{"text":"I feel back home every time I come to eat to Las Cazuelas. The flavors and smell of the food take me back to a Sunday morning at the mercado eating Mexican food with my family.
When my friends and family come to visit, they think I am crazy if I even suggest to eat Mexican food in the USA, but as soon as I took them to this place, they loved it!
The service and even the cooking lady are so nice and friendly.
I can't wait to have a day off and go back, next time I will try the Pierna torta that looks amazing in the pictures."}
{"text":"This small but mighty little gem in the Target shopping center on S Eastern and Silverado Ranch is wonderful. The absolutely best Mexican food I have ever enjoyed. The mole sauce was terrific as was the fresh corn. Between the four of us we tried nearly everything on the menu. And the bill total was only $65.00 for four people. Very reasonable!

Great food, great service, small but mighty good little restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Feels like I'm eating at my grandparents home. So delicious and very authentic."}
{"text":"First visit to this restaurant. Great customer service! Very attentative to my family and I. Food was great and reasonable for a family of 5.

Seating is a bit limited, but otherwise a great positive experience. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with this place! Very authentic, honestly authentic. Had the pelonas (look like mini tortas) great taste.  Carne asada taco pretty tasty as well."}
{"text":"It's like my best friends moms cooking.  Even the tortillas taste great.  This is restaurant quality food at a fair price and their menu is definitely too Mexican for me so I just ordered tacos lol. I'll be back for everyone's suggestions cause I left wanting more!"}
{"text":"Potatoe and green flautas a must to start 
The Chile rellanos as so good that there offensive, the best I've ever eaten. Topped it off with the chicken mole enchiladas which are 100% Authentic. Better than my mother's. This place is the one of the best Mexican Spot in Vegas. Truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I love this place, they serve authentic Mexican food (poblana) it's so yummy and delicious I can't have enough of it!!"}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant a 5 star because I really enjoyed the food.  I don't have much to say about Las Cazuelas other than you have to try their cooking to appreciate it. I don't need to search anymore for good authentic Mexican food in the Las Vegas Valley area. I am totally satisfied with the excellent food that came out of the kitchen each time I visited.  The taste is not overpowering with mounds of cheese and overly tangy sauce.  If you want good and real authentic Mexican cooking, you must try Las Cazuelas.  If you prefer to get rip off with Americanized junk, there are pretty of other places.  This place is unique.  I do have to mentioned the service was also very good."}
{"text":"Going to swim against the current here. I am a big supporter of family owned businesses. This place has gotten a lot of great reviews, in fact so many good reviews that, that is what brought us here.

  The place itself is small and not good for larger groups. The service was good. We ordered red sauce enchiladas, verde enchiladas, tortas, and a quesadilla. the food was tasty, nothing that stood out that was better than other places. We sampled the molle sauce and it was pretty darn good.

Here is my issue with the place; the portion sizes are lacking. Everything is about half the size of what you would get at other Mexican establishments for the same price. It's as if the dining-ware they purchased was from a misses cook set from Matel. Everyone left still somewhat hungry. Even the chips and salsa were small, I think they were single portions but we shared them among 5 of us.

If I'm going to leave a Mexican joint I wan to leave fat and happy."}
{"text":"The glowing reports are, I think, grossly over stated. While no where near the  quality raved about this place is about average strip mall cafe.
The biggest complaint that I have is the waiter. We never heard him utter one word of greeting, thanks, or goodby.

{"text":"Very good food no ambience but service was excellent! No liquor beer or wine. It is small only about 6 tables and it was full but not noisey. Very relaxing meal. Try the fried ice cream. Sauces were wonderful."}
{"text":"Mediocre Mexican food.. I lived all over Texas for 4 years,  so fortunately I have had extremely good Tex-Mex and Mexican grub... This place ain't it!  The heuvos rancheros was kinda bland and not worth mention. The chicken enchiladas with mole was decent. Wish the sauce was a tad bit Spicer. The chips and salsa was great, spicy flavorful salsa. The service was on point, however the food is not that great. Skip this place."}
{"text":"Delicious! This was my first visit so I kept it simple with green chicken enchiladas. They have several things on the menu I've never heard of and I can't wait to go back and try them!"}
{"text":"This place was good and affordable. Came on a Tuesday and thought there might be specials but there wasn't any. Place was quite and not too busy. I had the 4 tacos special with carne asada and carnitas. Both were good and they had a lot of different hot sauce choices. The server was really nice. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Take it your in the mood for Mexican food. Well around this area you have Cafe Rio, Chipotle, Nacho Daddy and Baja Fresh (maybe still open). Maybe you've tried that already so why not try a little something more homemade.

Their Carne Asada tacos are well worth the drive. For $3 you get one big ass taco and they aren't cheap with their meat, lol.

My girlfriend tried the Taquitos/Chicken which weren't nothing out of this world, but the quality of shredded chicken was good. 

The mole enchiladas are something you won't find anywhere around"}
{"text":"If you like authentic Mexican food but want to try something different this is your place. Great prices, variety and super kind staff.
The mole poblano is the best, and they open daily from 9 to 9!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday.  Place was not busy at all, and we were seated immediately.

The decor of the restaurant is nice, and the bathrooms were new and clean, unlike many Mexican restaurants.

The food was okay...I've had better, but it wasn't unappetizing.  I will admit that I had a bit of an upset stomach later in the day...par for the course with Mexican, I guess.

There are a couple better options in the area, so not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Very good food. Quick and tasty. Warm feel and friendly. I just walked in and got good advice on what to order. Chile Relleno and fried ice cream for dessert!"}
{"text":"My husband found Las Cazuelas while doing a search for best restaurants in Las Vegas.  There are a lot of small Mexican restaurants and this is by far the best we have found so far. The food was great (fresh, flavorful, and authentic)  and the prices very reasonable. 

We will be back and bring friends and family!!"}
{"text":"First time here. The food was good but not much on the portions. Staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"This place is so bomb and authentic. I cant believe it got bad reviews, i usually try places based off reviews & pics & the pics looked better than the reviews so ibhad to try it. This is my new go to place, i tried the chicken & potato flautas,esquites,asada sopes, chicken taco,asada taco, & green sauce enchiladas everything was good. The flavor on the asada is really good. I would definitely eat everything again but i think my favorite was the asada sopes"}
{"text":"Amazing guacamole! You have a choice between creamy or chunky I chose the chunky and it was yummy... Mexican is always a go to for me being a vegetarian.. my colleague had chiles poblanos he said they were excellent!"}
{"text":"When visiting in Vegas, you've got to venture out to this quaint, authentic Mexican restaurant. The service is impeccable, as is the food! Get the Esquite corn and the Tacos de Cochinita, they're to die for!"}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that my doctor and dentist are in Henderson, Las Cazuelas might be the next best reason for me to return to this far away town. It's a small mom and pop shop in the sprawling strip mall with Target and Freed's Bakery. Order at the counter, take a seat and the food will be brought out to you. While you wait, complimentary chips and salsa are provided. The enchiladas de mole poblano ($7) are an excellent bargain. As with any good mole, there's a wide range of flavors with heat, smokiness and a subtle sweetness to it. The four corn tortillas were filled with shredded chicken, covered in mole and topped with cotija cheese, onions, and roasted sesame seeds.

Despite the modest interior the food is much more refined than a typical quick/casual Mexican spot. There's a level of passion and precision in the execution of the food that you won't find at similar restaurants -- all the more reason to make the jaunt to the other side of the valley."}
{"text":"Today for Mother's Day they cooked a very tradicional dish from Mexico: Mixotes.
For those you don't know what is it? Here is a link:
http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixiote

I haven't eat this in long time, I get this when I'm back in my country.  It was wonderful, taste and the meat very soft."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican cuisine.  If you're  looking for a Robert's style Mexican then look elsewhere.  Good selection and reasonable prices.  I had the Conchinita and mole with charro  beans and Mexican street corn.  All very good and hearty.  I would come back again."}
{"text":"Holy COW! This place is awesome. Off-the-beaten-track AUTHENTIC Mexican food. The owner and his wife cook and serve the dishes; all originating from their hometown of Puebla, in Southern Mexico. Prices are low, low, low, comparable to Mexican \"fast food\" joints like Roberto's and Fausto's, but without the canned ingredients or processed cheese. 

I had the Chanclas- shredded marinated chicken on boletto buns with fresh sliced avocado and onion in a charro broth. DELISH!

My husband had the Huevos Rancheros and a Taco Oriental. He claimed his meal was heavenly and was so good that he ate it up, before I got a chance to have a taste!

They give you free chips and salsa, if you dine in. The salsa was GREAT! Not too spicy and very refreshing. 

Then the owner let us sample the Flan for dessert. My goodness! It was like I stepped back into my grandmother's kitchen. The best Flan I've had since I left New York City, eleven years ago.

We will be coming here again and again!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a few months. Finally made it and glad I did.  Place was somewhat empty then again a little hard to find.  Ordered the Mole Enchiladas which by far the Mole is very authentic and super tasty. A must have if you are a Mole fan which is an acquired taste. Defiantly a must have !!  Order the frijoles charros which needed a little salt to bring out the flavor of all the amazing ingredients.  Very good Minus the missing dash of salt. Easy quick fix !   Order torta de pierna which was a little bit of a let down. The bollilo (bread) was amazing and could have been a better torata but the pierna needs a little more flavor and the sandwich overall was dry.   The mollotes with some fresh salsa amazing!! Have them as part of your meal or always a good appetizer make sure to add the salsa.  They sell Jarritos which always helps wash it all down. Overall this place is a must when on the area especially for the mole enchiladas."}
{"text":"Great menu. Food is also good. Pricing works as well. Bar is great. New I believe. Servers are very nice. Place has loads of seating indoor and out. Took kids there and seemed comfortable."}
{"text":"Found this little gem around the corner from my house in the Target shopping center and quite honestly, I'm SO happy that I gave this place a shot!

Their food is all authentic from Puebla, MX, therefore, it may not please everyone's taste buds, but for those who can differentiate between authentic and Tex-Mex, eating here will be like sitting in abuelitas (grandma's) kitchen. The owner is sweet, humble and always attending to your needs. 

Everything on their menu is a MUST TRY. My favorite would have to be the Enchiladas, Molletes and Sopes. Glad to see all the love on Yelp for this place! They truly deserve it."}
{"text":"Glad I saw the review on Yelp or I would never have noticed this place tucked in next to Nothing Bundt Cakes. It's delicious! We had the flautas (veggie types note that you can also get pepper & potato, no meat), huevos rancheros, and elotes & esquites (although we realized these are basically the same, just one is on the cob and one in a dish). Even though we were stuffed, we also had the fried ice cream. Everything was delicious and very fresh. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is such a genuine Hispanic restaurant I lovvvvve it, I love my grandparents cooking and when I can't have it I come here, the presentation is always perfect as well I love it !!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican by family owners. Loved the pork and avocado sandwiches swimming in red broth. Mole poblano which was very good , is an acquired taste that may not be enjoyed as much by those expecting Americanized Mexican cuisine.  Try the roasted corn epizote  ( less messy when ordered off the cob.) If you wanted a truly tasty Mexican meal made by \"su abuela's\" loving hands, this is the place!"}
{"text":"We came to Vegas for a week vacation , we wanted to have tacos, check on yelp and found this place had great reviews.. this place has amazing fresh food. Clean a quite little place , we all have tacos and try a order of esquites. I recommend this place is just superb !"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem on Christmas Eve, as I had a sudden craving for pozole in this cold weather. Firstly, I was shocked they were open on Christmas Eve night (until 8pm). When I walked in, I was greeted by both the husband and wife (who were clearly the owners, cooks, cashiers, etc.). They were both so friendly!

I asked if they had pozole and they said they enough left for one order - which was perfect! I was bringing food back for someone else, so we also ordered the chilaquiles with chicken and an order of the churros to share. It was ALL delicious!

This is not a typical Robertos or Don Tortaco spot. They serve up awesome Mexican food that you may not be familiar with that's indigenous to the region of Mexico they're from. But, no fear. They have pictures clear as day on the wall of what everything looks like. 

I came home and reheated the pozole slightly and dressed it up a bit (see picture). They give you the condiments and chips to go with the soup. It was perfect! The only suggestion I would make is to give a bit more with the chilaquiles order. For $7-$8, the size wasn't very big and you only get a little bit of chicken. But, it was all delicious!!! I'm going back today to try the mole poblano enchiladas!"}
{"text":"Not a bad Mexican restaurant. The salsa is very delish. Has the perfect amount of kick. I really wish they would add black beans to their menu. Would also be nice to have sliced avocado instead of guacamole. They have only messed my order up once. Added beef instead of chicken."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for Mexican. Food is good, cheese dip is great, service is quick and pleasant and prices are reasonable:"}
{"text":"In short, one of the most boring meals I have ever eaten.

Las Cazuelas is about a block from our apartment, so my boyfriend and I decided to try it on Thursday night when we were both tired and the streets were still nigh-impassable from Wednesday's snowstorm.  We were seated quickly by pleasant waitstaff at a table near the fire, which both of us appreciated.

After that, however, service was relatively slow and lackluster, despite the near emptiness of the restaurant.  My boyfriend got one refill on his iced tea throughout the meal.  After clearing the plates, our waitress returned with the check without even asking if we were interested in dessert (despite a display of various cheesecakes and whatnot just inside the front door), or if I wanted another glass of wine.

The food itself was incredibly bland.  I had the chicken enchiladas, which tasted like unflavored grits with (overly dry) protein strips and a thin topping of, possibly, diced tomato.  It was as if the cook had never heard of spices, including salt and pepper.  The beans and rice were not objectionable, but were also completely lacking in any spice or flavor.

This seems like the perfect place to take an extremely picky 5-year-old.  If you actually like Mexican food, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"If I could put zero stars I would. Food was delicious,  service is horrible. The waiter (which is also the owner) didn't greet us, never refilled our drinks, walked away right when my friend was about to order. I mean I was shocked. We were the only ones in there and it took about 20 minutes after we were done eating to finally let us know that we pay at the front. The owner ignored us every time we tried asking for something, literally at every given request. Then towards the end we wanted to mention that he could have been nicer and needed to improve on the service and some lady that claims to be his family member started screaming at us and cursing at us to get out if we didn't like the food. I attempted at managing to explain that the food was delicious , we were simply trying to help him improve with the service because we weren't happy. This unknown family member proceeded to yell at us for having a very liberated opinion, which I believe any customer should be entitled to, and swore at us. I went on to explain to his family member that we owned a business and if a customer wasn't happy with our service, we would apologize and ask how we could improve. She said she didn't care and actually got into my sister's face as if she was going to assault her. I threatened to call the police. The owner apologized on her behalf. We stormed off.  I was completely shocked. They acted like animals and treated us like dirt for simply being dissatisfied with horrible service! We walked out of the restaurant completely ruffled and astonished. I have never in my life experienced ridiculousness like this. This place is a zoo! NEVER again."}
{"text":"So we definitely came here because of the great reviews, and they did not disappoint.

First off, beans and rice are great here. No complaints.
Secondly, you have to try the tacos. I love to try Al Pastor, and they were amazing. I tried the barbacoa and it was good but not amazing, to me. The carnitas were amazing. Oriental was so-sol. I tried the mole enchiladas, and they were good, but they just didn't sit right for me, for some reason. My wife tried the sopes, and wow, so good. 

You find what you like at every place, but Las Cazuelas does not disappoint. 

Lastly, staff are kind, attentive, and very accomodating to our party of six (including 2 kids) and in a small space. I am sure they will expand to a larger place some day, but for now, try to go during the not-so-busy hours. We were only visiting, but I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Best mole I've ever had. Very authentic Mexican. Wonderful local spot in LV. Also try the corn dishes, and the green sauce. Yum!"}
{"text":"Me and a few friends stopped by to grab a bite to eat the other day after seeing the photos and reading the reviews on Yelp. It's a small spot where you order at the window (not unlike Roberto's) and are served shortly thereafter. The owner/server was extremely polite and helpful, even allowing substitutions in my case. The interior was very clean and well kept and the dishes were served on unique metal plates which was a nice touch. The complimentary chips and salsa were also a welcome addition to the typical taco shop experience. We ended up splitting plates of Enchiladas Verde, Chanclas, and Pelanos and I'm glad that we did. The portions were on the smaller side so as a stand alone meal I'm not sure it would be enough to fill most people up. There was nothing bad about the food but at the same time the flavors didn't standout either. I liked the salsa verde but the chicken seemed kind of bland. 

Maybe I had too high of expectations due to the overwhelming positive reviews on Yelp but it was only OK for me."}
{"text":"From out of town and searched for a high star Mexican restaurant for lunch.  In a storefront and had photos of some of the meals on the window, so we weren't sure, and almost passed it up.  Glad we went in!  Food was delicious and presented nicely.  Salsa verde and red salsa were both outstanding.  Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"12 seats, maybe 16, but great home style cooked food. Very authentic. I've lived in Mexico personally and have to insist this is a hidden gem. Family run. Nice laid back attitude that  makes you feel you just walked into a relative's home, they made you feel welcome then served you some great food. At one point the cook poked her head out of the kitchen and asked how we liked the food. We will definitely be back. It's a shame more businesses aren't as welcoming. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"I recently left Vegas but came back last weekend for 2 days and had to stop here again. Still my favorite Mexican restaurant ever! I had all my favorites and my friend who hadn't been here before has been talking about going back all week. Definitely a favorite of his now too. Thanks! We'll be back next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"I was scared  trying this place (thinking ehh usual mexican restaurant), but ive been craving  for taquitos. I went in and look at the menu and nothing like mexican restaurant  menu that i go to.  They have mole, chanclas ( looks good), and lot more..   the best so far mole it ever touched  my taste buds.  I usually dont finished  my rice and beans but their rice and beans its so different  i wish they put more.  I went back .....  love this place"}
{"text":"Omg, alrighty then.... Great Mexican restaurant! My first visit and looking forward to visiting, again, real soon! Ambiance was very roomy, nice lighting and cozy. Our hostess, Mariana, was soo VERY friendly and welcoming! As we all know, half of the pleasure of dining out is hospitality! Their menu is vast and diversified with delicious dishes!! I had lunch shrimp chimichanga, filled with luscious, plump shrimp seasoned to perfection! #YUM  I, definitely, recommend this...  Avon's well kept secret!! I can't believe I never heard of this gem of a restaurant!   #SatisfiedCustomer"}
{"text":"After seeing the reviews on yelp and drooling over all the pictures of food, my friend and I decided to check this place out. It's a small, family owned and operated business. I came in and was greeted but unfortunately there were no tables available inside. The gentleman that was working told us we could pick a table outside and that he would serve us. We ordered at the counter and made our way outside. 

We shared the chicken taquitos, enchiladas salsa verde with rice and beans, esquite, and churros. Everything was so good and tasted homemade. The portions were a perfect size for us. The enchiladas were full of chicken and not a bunch of onions and peppers like most places. The taquitos were crunchy and served with a crema and green salsa on the side. The churros were amazing! 

Not only is the food excellent but the hospitality was what made me come home and write a review. The gentleman serving us brought us chips and salsa to our table even though we were not dining inside and my son spilled our horchata and when we asked for just a new cup he brought us a brand new and full cup. With good food and service like that to boot I'll definitely be back. Can't wait to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice and the food was delicious every time. You can tell that it is not your typical fast food chain which is very much appreciated. I rather wait a few minutes for a nice meal than having something served that's blend and half way done. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The best chicken mole enchiladas and frijoles charros are the best...reminds me of home cooking when I was younger..."}
{"text":"I'll be brief. The chili relleno is the best I've had north of the border. I believe the owner is from Puebla and he uses genuine poblano chiles in the dish. There are no stinking Anaheim's used here, bub! I'm also also a sucker for the elotes.  I resolve to order something different every time I go but I end up ordering the relleno. Oh, I did order the mole once and it was the second best I ever had, which isn't bad."}
{"text":"Boy, I really wanted to like Las Cazuelas.  I was heartened by the nice and somber decor, much of it a holdover from Caf√© Porta Alba (including the wood-burning stove).  We started out on a good note; the chips were warm and the salsa was very nice; both were plentiful.  Our tamal appetizer was also spicy and good, and the queso fundido was delicious, too, with a healthy portion of mushrooms and chorizo within the mixture.  Our margitas, (two house, one special with agave and higher-end tequila) were also tasty, although no match for the knock-you-out variety served at Pasqual's.

Things started to take a downturn, however, quickly thereafter.  We first learned that the restaurant was out of guacamole.  This also meant that every single dish that came with avocado, a favorite of ours, would be coming without it.  We were encouraged by the interesting menu selections, but were feeling weighed down by our appetizers, and so went with soup and salad selections.  The fajita and Yucat√°n salads, promising baby greens, came with a bed of uninspired bagged romaine.  The remaining veggies (remember, no avocado) in the Yucat√°n, including jicama chunks, were frozen.  Yes, frozen solid.  As one of my companions mentioned, \"What was I thinking ordering a salad at a Mexican restaurant.\"  Fair enough, but the more adventurous menu suggested that things might have been better and that it would be okay to risk.  My own tortilla soup was also bland and without any real flavor.  It was akin to a Progresso chicken soup.  

We skipped dessert, but the bill for three of us came to $70.  The food did not live up to this tab, nor did it match up with the decor.  Our server was nice and attentive, but I will be unlikely to return to Las Cazuelas.  This means we're still on the hunt for a really good Mexican place in Madison beyond the taqueria experience."}
{"text":"I really like this cozy little restaurant, and I enjoyed a nice quiet meal with my husband and son here tonight. I had the Huevos a La Mexicana and Flautas, and my husband tried the Huevos Rancheros, Oriental Taco, and Carne Asada. We also shared the Frioles Charros and chips/salsa - all for only $29!! Everything was yummy, the service was quick and friendly, and place clean too. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, customer service amazing as we sat outside with a group girl soccer players, Daughter loved the food...support authentic non-chain food!"}
{"text":"We love it here! We bring our family to Las Caz a few times a month. It's a great restaurtant for kids because it's fairly loud and the service is quick. Chips and salsa are some of the best I've had and they are great about letting you be creative in your ordering...I love shrimp in everything so I've tried it in different dishes. Decor is definitely predictable and sometimes the servers don't speak great english but we enjoy it and keep coming back!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Enchilada Salsa Verde with beans and rice is my favorite! Prices are affortable with a great variety.
My children will only eat at this mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"OH. MY. GOSH. 

EVERYTHING was on point. Everything! The service was amazing - we wanted to sit outside so the gentleman at the front of the restaurant brought us our salsa and chips. We then decided it was too hot and came back inside - without skipping a beat, or being upset, the same gentleman gave us the same great service. 

The dining area was gorgeous - quaint and authentic. A few pictures on the wall of what was on the menu really goes a long way. 

The food - INCREDIBLE! I have to recommend the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. Oh my gosh the BEST Green Tomatillo sauce I have EVER had. And half of my family, is Mexican! I saw so many other items on the menu that I wanted to try - which is unusual for me. I usually find one thing I like and stick with it every time I go to a restaurant. But here, I'm excited to try more! I know it's amazing when I am craving the same dish the next day. 

Oh and by the way --- the salsa with the chips they bring you first thing is absolutely delicious. Perfect amount of spicy and savory. So good. I would buy this stuff just to have it at home whenever I wanted! 

I only have one critique...and this may be a non - issue because I didn't ask too many questions. The majority of the menu seems to be focused around chicken. I cant imagine having a shredded beef enchilada with that same sauce, or even a pork enchilada...They may have more options though - you will have to ask, and so will I when I go in again...This weekend! :D"}
{"text":"Definitely one of those hole in the wall type of restaurant with only 16 seats and delicious food. This is my second time here and will definitely keep coming back.

The first time I came to this restaurant I ordered enchiladas de mole poblano and it is the best enchiladas I had ever eaten. It's definitely a must try. 
The BF ordered quesadilla arabe which was pretty good also with Elotes to share.

Our second visit we ordered pelonas, quesadilla arabe, taco arabe, and Elotes. 
The BF really liked the quesadilla that's why he ordered it again. I would had ordered the enchiladas again but I wanted to try something different. 

I definitely recommend this place and next time I will definitely try the chile Renello!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I eat here at least twice a week. We have an obsession with mole and have been to a handful of restaurants that serve it but nobody can make it better than this place! AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Very authentic! My husband and I go to Mexico City quite frequently for work and this food is authentic and fresh! Love it! They also have an extensive tequila menu! A must visit!"}
{"text":"Nice family owned Mexican food. All
Authentic and fresh. When given a choice
Support a family owned business. The food is fantastic and prices are very fair"}
{"text":"Solid neighborhood taco joint with a very unique menu.
Order at the counter with a very friendly cashier (/owner?). Chips and salsa came up promptly and our food wasn't far behind.
As everyone has suggested, the mole is the thing to get here. Agreed. We tried the mole enchiladas and they were quite good. Also, the green chicken enchiladas were a solid green choice - very limey and vinegary, just how I like it. I already forgot the name of our last dish, but I think I liked it the best. It was like 2 little pulled pork sandwiches with a creamy sauce. Saronas or something like that. The meat was not too stringy, which is a big selling point for the kids.
Prices were ~$8 per dish and the enchiladas came 2 to a plate with rice and beans. Plenty filling.
Definitely a go-to casual Mexican spot in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food and their service !!!!!!! Very mellow atmosphere with great location !"}
{"text":"First time eating here and every dish we ordered was delicious. Chicken Mole Poblano enchiladas were on point. Sopes & Huraches were also very freshly made and full of flavor! Owner was super welcoming even though we walked in 25 mins before closing.
It's a hidden neighborhood gem ..we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"So good!  The small sliders are seriously amazing. Probably not the healthiest food lol but soooo good. Also the chips and salsa are excellent.  Had the pork leg torts it was just okay. The tacos are excellent.  The churro were great too. Have been back several times. And will return again."}
{"text":"I like trying hole in the wall restaurants always looking for that gem.  This one may not have been the gem, but their friendly and fast.  

Don't go here expecting TexMex or Americanized Mexican because you won't get it. They have very reasonably priced dishes and a lot is more ala' carte so you order the parts you want and it is still reasonable. 

It was good and we may return to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"My my my. Words fail me. Had a simple meal of frijoles charros and flautas.  I'm not Latino, and even so, the meal evoked the same spirit as food my grandmother would have slow cooked over the stove all day. Prepared with love and care. I had to hurry to try my husband's tacos de cohchinitas. He offered to let me sample them, but had almost devoured them before I could. The owners are very nice, charming actually.  Understand, this is authentic. Not everything is covered in red sauce and cheese.  Treat yourself to something savory...again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"Where in the world are all of the stars coming from??? This place is not that great. The food is very Americanized and bland. I'm not from the Vegas area, and I thought I'd check out Yelp to find some good Mexican food, and what a disappointment. 

Pros:
- friendly and fast service 
- very inexpensive

Cons:
- mole enchiladas were not \"earthy\" and spicy. Too much of a sweet chocolate flavor for my taste
- Chlie rellenos were greasy and bland

I will not be going back. Two stars for friendly service and cheap prices."}
{"text":"Marginal at best. Nothing we tried was worthy of a return or belief that the earlier stellar reviews will resurrect. Lost the vision? The passion?  Bad Mexican is just bad. Oh and heavy, flavorless, sodden.  This was all those.  No Bueno."}
{"text":"Nice Mexican community feel. The waiters were very attentive and quick with their service. The salsa with their tortilla chips is very flavorful. The combinations are a good price and the portion sizes are large. Other than the fact the guacamole looked like a leprechaun took a shit in a dish, I'd recommend this place to anyone in town."}
{"text":"Seems like I've had these guys bookmarked for a while now. When my buddy Bronsen K. asked me to look up a place in the Eastern and Silverado Ranch area for lunch, Las Cazuelas was almost a no-brainer.

They managed to be a hole in the wall in spite of being in a huge plaza. Proof? I somehow didn't even remember them even though I was at Windy City Beefs a few months ago. Luckily, they are on right on top of that signpost near the Eastern Ave entrance.

After some brief discussion, Bronsen and I decided to split some Enchiladas de Mole Poblano and Enchiladas de Salsa Verde (both items $7.00 for 4). Both are based on shredded chicken inside corn tortillas, but aside from the obvious sauce differences, the Mole Poblano enchiladas had cotija cheese, a couple rings of raw white onion, and roasted sesame seeds, while the Salsa Verde had cream and melted mozzarella.

I must confess that I have never had mole before. The rich chocolate-based yet savory sauce was relatively mild in spice, which was totally fine with me. The tomatillo green sauce on the other enchiladas was vibrant and perhaps a bit more spicy, and it felt entirely different even though it was chicken and corn flour underneath both. I really enjoyed both orders and was glad to have the experience.

We also received some complimentary tortilla chips with a more medium-level red salsa to start. No complaints there. However, I had an extra Taco Oriental ($1.50) that  I could've done without. Pork, onions, parsley on corn tortilla, but nothing special compared to other taco places around town.

I probably could've used another item or a larger portion to get full, but maybe I'm too picky about that sort of thing. I am certainly looking to try a lot of the other items on their menu, since the enchiladas at Las Cazuelas were so great to me."}
{"text":"I LOVE their mole! It's so good with chicken or as enchiladas. I always get the corn too. Highly recommend the mollettes and churros if you have room!"}
{"text":"First timer today with this place. I had the sopes (2 carne asada and one chorizo) and a carne asada taco. I will be honest, I am all about honesty. I have had better ... Being born and raised with homemade Mexican food, I am extremely picky. Hot sauce was actually spicy and it's very hard to find a place that makes sopes. I just wish these places would spice up and add some more seasonings to their meet. Don't be afraid to add some flavor. But, I will go back to this place cause it wasn't terrible. :)"}
{"text":"Went here based on Yelp reviews as I was visiting  and unfortunately was extremely disappointed. The portions of the food is so small and the food is not all that great . WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!! I gave it 2 stars since it was a very clean restaurant"}
{"text":"Que lugar! Increible sabor realmente Mexicano y atencion increible. Los Tacos de Cochinita, los molletes, los esquites, las tortas TODO tiene un sabor unico. Si extra√±as la verdadera comida Mexicana no puedes dejar de visitar este lugar UNICO!"}
{"text":"It's still just a few months old and more people need to find this place.  After seeing the great reviews (and being disappointed at the lack of decent Mexican food in our neck of the woods), we were disappointed to walk in on Saturday evening and find the place empty.  Fortunately, it wasn't a reflection of there being anything wrong with the place.  Quite the opposite!

I can't vouch for the other things on the menu, which all look good, but our chicken mole enchiladas and enchiladas verdes were excellent (and made with white-meat chicken) as were our appetizer (bread with mozzarella and fresh pico de gallo) and our desserts (one of the corn-based options and the gelatin dessert).  Sorry, no menu in front of me and I can't recall any of the names.  I have never seen either of the two desserts on menus before but they were both very good and only mildly sweet, which is so different (and a pleasant surprise) compared with what we usually eat in the US.  Oh, the chips and salsa were also great.

As others mentioned, the menu is limited and this is the one thing that might prevent their getting a lot of business right now, but I look forward to the day when enough of us support them that they can move to a bigger location, hire staff, and expand their menu.  Of course, I don't know if that's their plan, but I hope so!  Also of note - portions aren't large but that lets you sample desserts at the end and still have spent very little money.  Prices are very reasonable.  They might want to try for more take-out business by adding more things to the menu that could be eaten by hand (or in the car).

The d√©cor is very attractive and has a lot of character, definitely more like a sit-down restaurant than a fast-food place.  It's very clean.   There was nice Mexican music (no TV, thank goodness).  Although they used plastic utensils, our food was all served on those cute metal plates and bowls like you see in Indian restaurants.  This isn't a kids-type fast-food joint but more of a sophisticated adult one.  

We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward for this spot to open and I have not been disappointed. I find the space warms and inviting and feel as though I am in a small eatery in Mexico. My husband ordered the Torta Pierna. He found it had a nice kick and was more sandwich than he was expecting, but the taste was so delightful he finished it in spite of being full. I ordered the chicken taco special. I found this dish good, but a wee bit on the bland side. I have had the single taco as well with the mole and limes. It's the first item on the menu, the name is escaping me, I apologize. But THAT is fantastic. All they need to do is spice up the food and kick it up a notch or two and this could be a nifty little gem here in the valley. OH! They have real Coke, in bottles, made with sugar! Hey, I was excited."}
{"text":"Great Mexican place! My husband and I found it randomly and we were very satisfied. I was very pleased with the Enchiladas Verdes and Enchiladas de Mole, they are way better that the ones at Lindo Michoacan and half the price! 
The place is convenient located and looks very clean. Staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Very good little Mexican restaurant, located on Eastern, Las Casuelas is Arabe style Mexican. The owner is from Puebla and this style is typical for that area. My husband got the carne asana tacos and I had the verde chicken enchiladas. He said his was excellent and I agree mine were muy rico. The green sauce was very flavorful. Service was friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Ok. Yea this place is ok. Had it about a week ago. Hard to really see why it has so many 5 star reviews. I mean yes for sure we are all searching for the delicious Mexican food place and this one can do for a quick fix, but it's not the end of the search. I ordered a lot of food. It's what I usually do when I want to get an idea of what the place has to offer. I tried all of the highly recommended dishes on yelp reviews, and as soon as my fam and I tried them all I forgot what they were called. I probably dropped about $50 so you know there was variety. I can remember that I had the mole enchiladas. Yea ok they were ok. I wasn't turned on or off by the flavor or the look. Carne asada tacos. Ok. Different pork dishes, again just ok. I didn't see anything that made me think there was some extra secret craft or Mexican regional delicacy involved. Yes I could see it is different, but I like different when different is good. Yea it's different than robertos but who says just because it's different it's amazing? Not trying to take a dig at this place, but it was just ok."}
{"text":"The stars are for the FOOD. The service...1 star. We almost left shortly after sitting down for lunch. An older gentleman, nicely dressed, waited on us. We felt as though he really did not want us there. We never felt welcomed. Very uncomfortable, to say the least.

We asked for an horchata and two waters. We received two very small waters in Styrofoam cups and an horchata that was not even full. Nothing was ever refilled during our stay. I gave my water to my husband since he drinks a lot more than I do. With the water, chips and salsa were brought to us. The chips were hardy, and the salsa was very flavorful. Nice and spicy.

When the food arrived, we knew where the real magic was being done here. The food looked great. We got the 4 chicken enchiladas verdes, and two carne asada tacos a la carte. These were only $3. There was so much meat in everything, and the food was fantastic. There was so much depth of flavor in the salsa verde. It had a strong lime flavor. I loved it.  It would have been nice if our guy had had back to check on us, but he never did until the end when we had stacked our plates as we typically do. 

He never said anything, so we walked to the front counter, and he was already ringing up our order. Too weird. Not a word to meet us up there, or give us our ticket...nothing. We will definitely come back for the very flavorful food, and hopefully next time someone else will wait on our table. Someone with a personality."}
{"text":"Fantastic family owned authentic mexican food.   I have been here 3 times since I figured out they were near me 2 weeks ago.  My favorite are the green enchiladas.
It's so much better than chain mexican food.  Stop by and give them some support :)

4 stars for the food + 1 star for friendly service.  I really feel like they appreciate my business!"}
{"text":"Mole enchiladas here are on point! Next time I'm getting the plate of 4. The service was good and the fried ice cream was great!!!!!!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Affordable and satisfying. No frills.
 Exactly what I wanted when I ordered the enchiladas with salsa verde. If you get it to go, you don't get the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican, this place has it! My biggest critique is regarding portion sizes, both my wife & I were still hungry after finishing our meals. The mole sauce was quite tasty!"}
{"text":"Best enchilada ever had! The red sauce is thick and the bomb! LOVE this place! Will keep coming back! MY FAV!"}
{"text":"I tried this amazing place for the first time about 3 weeks ago and I must say I instantly fell in love. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food this is the place to eat at. The owners are always very friendly and attentive. I've tried only a few dishes and some desserts, and all of them are delicious. The mole is so rich in flavor, the best I've had in my life. The chanclas are some sort of sandwich stuffed with chicken and a sauce on it made out of chorizo and other ingredients, it's so delicious. I am glad we have this restaurant in the neighborhood. I'm ready to try all of their dishes. If you like to eat TexMex don't even bother to come here, they only have delicious authentic cuisine from the Central part of Mexico."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Not your typical Mexican food joint. Very unique and absolutely delicious! Glad I found this gem."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. What you need to know is this is good typical of a particular state in Mexico- Puebla. Just like you find fried okra in CA, you find burritos here. These are region specific. And delicious in their own right. 
The mole is fantastic, the sopes are rich and delicious. And we enjoy the esquitos because then I don't have floss right after!
The owners are kind and humble."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food ever! While on vacation in Vegas we stopped by this hidden gem: Las Cazuelas. We had a Chancla, 2 small chicken tortas drenched in chorizo sauce. Traditional mole poblano enchiladas that were sooo delicious! Carne asada torta, simple but full of flavor. 
The owner was so accommodating, great customer service! 
Hit this place up when you come to the sin city."}
{"text":"Delicious. If you come, you must have the esquite (Mexican street corn in a bowl), and definitely have the flan at the end! Also try the cochinita pibil (seasoned pork). Great little place!!"}
{"text":"The tacos de carne asada were awesome. I am so confused about the drinks here though. Every time I have ordered margaritas, there was no noticeable amount of alcohol. What do you have to do to get a decent drink at this place?"}
{"text":"If you are ever in Henderson, this is a must stop. The food is great. Real Mexican food in a cool location with great service.

We loved the tacos and their rice is just wonderful. Parking is easy and the service is fast, but not rushed. You will love this place. Try it."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican food!
The mole sauce is the best I've had"}
{"text":"This is not just a basic taco burrito joint.  This place is a hidden gem.  They are a bit pricier for a hole in the wall spot, but the food is so worth it.  Also they are super quick at preparing to go orders.  I can call them and within 10 minutes it's ready.  I love their chicken enchiladas with mole, posole, and Chile relleno. Around Mexican independence day they also serve Chile en nogada.  There is seating outside in a courtyard area that might be nicer to sit out in when weather is condusive, but I usually grab the food to go. There are a couple tables inside if you want to dine there."}
{"text":"Popped in while my SO was across the street at an appt. Had a margarita, pineapple quac, and a single Chile relleno. Everything was very good! Interior was comfortable. Service was good. I recently moved to town and will likely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Just went here for dinner. They were very accommodating and made modified things on the menu for us.

We got pork tacos, chile verde enchiladas, Carne asada buritto, Carne asada quesadilla and beef taquitos. 

The pork tacos and taquitos were really good. I would go back just for the pork. You should definitely try this place and get something with pork. The frijoles charros were also delicious! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Las Caz is often the go-to place for my high school friends and I whenever we're all back in town and want to plan a bit of a reunion. It's conveniently located, can seat a party as large as ours, and no one ever goes home hungry--although part of that may be because we consistently fill up on chips and salsa before our meals ever come out... But I digress. The meals here are exactly what you'd expect from a Mexican restaurant in an Ohio suburb. It's nothing you'll read about in a culinary editorial or magazine, but there aren't (m)any authentic Mexican restaurants (especially ones that aren't chains) in the area, so it meets a need well enough."}
{"text":"Fantastic service by the owners, we are from Los Angeles and we were very pleased with the food, extremely friendly, and great taste...
A little hole in the wall but with a Big CORAZ√ìN, thank you don Manuel for your service, RICO POZOLE..."}
{"text":"So authentic and delicious! Best mole I have ever had. Their options are great, you have to try it! Amazing service as well, the owner is great!"}
{"text":"Usually happy with the food here. Had take out last night, not impressed. Ordered a spinach qassadilla,  got it home, there was a half qassadilla that was inedible.  Just a wad of spinach,  no cheese. Ended up tossing it. I had the Enchiladas supreme, very bland. I only hope this was an anomaly."}
{"text":"Ok the food is pretty good, although not consistent at times. However, that old Hispanic guy that works there is very rude and unwelcoming. Now usually I am just picking up carry out so it does not bother me too much seeing his miserable face. But the other day we actually stopped in and dined there. First of all, we got there at 8:21pm(says on the door that they close at 9pm). This old, grumpy man gave us a dirty look and seemed very upset that we came in there. Seriously WTF? I could literally feel his displeasure as we were seated. We ordered a few tacos and were put by 8:45pm. As we drove home, the people I was with all commented how they felt uncomfortable by the way this old man behaved. We all agreed that we will not be returning to a place that does not appreciate its customers."}
{"text":"Saw all the reviews on Yelp and had to try it out. I ordered ahead and was so happy to have found this hidden gem! The food is flavorful and refreshing . They make the food right when you order it so the quality is never compromised. I returned a few days after to dine in and bring my husband. He says it reminds him of his moms cooking , truly authentic."}
{"text":"Would definitely recommend this restaurant. Food is great reminds me of home. Will be coming here a lot , even my daughter like it and she's picking."}
{"text":"My mom and I have been dining at Las Cazuelas for quite some time now, and not once have we had a meal here that was anything less than spectacular. It isn't hard to tell that they always put so much love and devotion into their dishes. Thank you to Manuel, his wife, and their team for the many years of delicious food and superb service!! :))"}
{"text":"Different flavor than the Mexican food in Chicago. The food was really bland and had no authenticity.  The corn/elotes had no butter."}
{"text":"My first time here today was amazing. Service and food were both excellent. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is NOT a Tex-Mex place so if that is what you are looking for you will not find it here.

This is Authentic food from the Puebla region and this is a HIDDEN GEM which needs to NOT be a secret.

I want to see this place packed every day as the food is the most authentic place.  Look at the pictures & menu, you will NOT see burritos because that is tex-mex, not real Mexican.  

This is my first visit here and the food is AMAZING.  I had the Chanclas which was authentic and awesome and we had the Taco Arabe, both filling and both authentic.

The chips and salsa they serve is some of the best I have had in a long time.  

This place sits in the corner of this shopping center near Office Depot and a place EVERYONE needs to visit if you want real authentic food.  If you don't come here you are missing out and this place will remain my secret and it will be your loss.

I would love to see more reviews from visits...."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The staff is extremely friendly and the environment is very relaxing. Recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food! Price is good but a little higher since my husband and I can eat and get a drink (alcohol) for around 40.00, not to bad but a little pricey."}
{"text":"Lunch here today was delicious! I had the mole enchiladas with rice and beans. Best mole I have ever had. My boyfriend had taquitos and he said they were good but 4 was not enough for one serving so he left a little hungry."}
{"text":"Eat here before it gets discovered and becomes very crowded. Small...very little seating.....Run by a husband and wife...
The food is awesome and very nicely priced......Fresh - Fresh - Fresh..
No beer or wine served so take out is for those that want this."}
{"text":"Drove 14 miles to this place out of the way based on Yelp reviews only to be told we had to order to go, when it is 108¬∞ outside and we are from Colorado so no place but our vehicle to eat. There were open tables but I guess several people had pre reserved tables?? What's up with that! Very disappointed!! Going to give our business to another local Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Happy tummy right here.  So full cause I couldn't stop eating, the food was so good. Chanclas lived up to their expectations and love that they bring you extra sauce on the side. Frijoles Charros were a delicious side and pozole, the delicious pozole.....  We will definitely be coming back. It's a little small place but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I really wanted mexican, and since my previous favorite Senor Coyotes closed because of the road widening my wife and I wanted to try somewhere new.  We found this place on yelp with decent reviews.  Long story, I wouldn't come back and I'd drive farther to find somewhere better.

First, there is no waiting area, you stand in the way, with people walking in front of you, and waitresses reaching behind you for the menus.  Then the seating area is LOUD, hard to have any conversation between my wife and I.  We ordered a drink for my wife, which she liked very much I believe it was a daiquiri.  We ordered food and it took a very long time to come.  The food was okay, nothing to win us over the atmosphere and waiting area/time.  If you're in the area I'd find another place to eat.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"the first time I happened upon Las Cazuelas I ordered the chanclas and the gelatina de fruta. im not sure what I expected out of this place but I could not get over how delicious it was. maybe its the lack of authentic Mexican restaurants? I kept telling myself I would go back and I finally did. I haven't tried the tacos nor the soup yet but what I have tried is outstanding. the buns and mini bolillo bread are toasted perfectly, the mole and sauces are super tasty.
it is thrilling to have a Mexican restaurant that genuinely showcase our cuisine."}
{"text":"The enchiladas salsa verde is a great tasting dish, very flavorful, simple but keeps to the basics which makes it delicious.  The chicken was very moist and tender.  

The churros were decent, they had a caramel filling inside and you get some whipped cream and chocolate dipping sauce to go with it.

All in all, a small mom and pop shop in the neighborhood that's great for lunch.  If you're in the area, it's a good spot to drop by."}
{"text":"Hands down best Mexican restaurant in this part of town. Truly authentic Mexican food from Puebla region. Love it and will be back until I try all the plates on their menu!  Restaurant is very cute and cozy and most importantly well kept and clean! Love it!"}
{"text":"This small restaurant serves authentic Mexican cuisine from the Puebla region.  We arrived shortly after the posted 9AM opening hour, but the doors were locked.  After waiting awhile we were just preparing to depart when the owner arrived and asked us to give him 15 minutes.   On entry we were provided menus, glasses of water, and salsa and chips.  I noticed on the menu that the tacos included parsley versus the standard cilantro.  The owner explained that this was the authentic preparation in Puebla.  We each ordered huevos rancheros which were very high quality and delicious.  I also mentioned that we would come back some time to try the mole and he offered a sample but I did not want to hang around waiting for it to be reheated."}
{"text":"This place has authentic tasting Mexican food. If you are in the area I recommend you stop by and eat. We are from Arizona and we really enjoyed the food. It was delishhh. Thank you"}
{"text":"The food here does taste homemade and is worth giving a try. The store is well decorated with bright colored walls and is welcoming. There is seating available if you want to dine inside. A gentleman (maybe the owner?) asked if I was ready to order. I had an idea of what I wanted, but went with some fried mini pork appetizers. There were some people dining there and they thanked the gentleman for a delicious meal. That's good to hear. The lounge seat I was sitting at kind of sank down, but maybe that's cause many people have sat there before? Either way, the food came out about 5-8 minutes later. As I grabbed my bag to go, the gentleman asked if I have been there before. I said no and he proceeded to make conversation and said to come back soon. He was actually very nice, so if he seems quiet at first,  I would say not to take it personal. 

The pork appetizer was delicious! There was only 2, so I wish there was more for the price, maybe one more? It also came with a salsa verde which had a good kick to it. The mayo was good with the salsa as well. The bread was a fried bread of sorts and the meat was very tender. It's not super cheap food like Roberto's and it's not a fancy spot either. It is home style cooking, so someone is actually making your food to order. I would definitely come back to try their other items though."}
{"text":"This place exceeded our expectations. The winners were the chili Relleno plate and chicken taquitos. Everything else was great and that guy that works there was the sweetest. Can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The food was great and very authentic. One of the few places in Henderson that I know where you can get traditional elotes. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not great. Not bad. This Mexican restaurant has most of the traditional staples, adequate service, and the quality of fare that you'd expect from an authentic Mexican restaurant in NE Ohio; however, they fall short in a few areas that prevent them from getting a thorough recommendation. 

My latest visit was on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant had minimal guests. The server wasn't around when we hoped to order, but was quick to get drinks after seating us. The prices were a bit on the higher side and the lack of any drink specials was a little disappointing. The only food special was the carnitas and was only slightly discounted. It wasn't great and came with two tortillas. An additional two tortillas cost $1. Salsa was bland. Nothing provided a good impression. It seems to be on par with Don Tequila in Elyria. If you have time to travel, I recommend Si Senor in Westlake or Fiesta Jalapenos in North Ridgeville. Those options are a bit out of range for most, and you'll find Las Cazuelas acceptable, maybe."}
{"text":"Best chile rellenos I've ever  had. Very tasty red sauce with a crispy coating.  The pepper used was not Anaheim but it was delicious. The rice and beans were also top notch.  The green chile sauce that came with another dish was spicy but was also excellent with a deep fresh flavor.  Have been here multiple times. Don't go for the hot dogs next door"}
{"text":"We walked in the door and saw the \"B\" rating from the Health Department and turned around and walked out.   I don't care how good the food may be if the place can't maintain an \"A\" rating."}
{"text":"The esquites are so good! Had their renowned chanclas and ehh they were just okay. Someone at our table ordered the pelones and said they were really good. Had the flan and it was really good they had just made it and tasted so fresh. Owned locally so a mom and pop shop really cool decor and in a good location. Would want to go back to try some of their other stuff."}
{"text":"Such a charming little place ... the owners are so friendly .. the Taquitos are super good perfect amount of crunch !! The cream they came with is super yummy"}
{"text":"Where to start. Incredible atmosphere, you feel like you're a part of the Mexican family. Even with the older woman serving you your chips and salsa. We ordered the choziqueso and it was better than expected. I ordered 2 chicken fried burritos and my wife two soft tacos. The rice was soft not hard meaning they are turning it out quick and the prices were perfect for the portion size. Next time I try fried ice cream."}
{"text":"Real mexican food, this coming from a mexican. Delicious. favorite place. Family tradition.  the mole is authentic."}
{"text":"We visited on a Sunday evening and walked in to a packed house.  Sat down and were promptly served our chips and salsa, which were great.  As with any salsa and chip combo, it's good to get the beverages to the table to cool down the heat.  Sadly, it was a good fifteen minutes before our waitress even appeared.  We ordered our food and drinks at her first visit and hoped that we were good.  

Forty-five minutes later (and two more baskets of chips), we finally received our mediocre food.  It wasn't hot and I was not impressed.

After complaining to the head waiter - the Manager was not on-site, we received a discount on our meal, though he joked that at least the chips were free.  Bad timing on the joke, and we won't go back.  Short staffed in the house and in the kitchen.  I'll scoot down to North Ridgeville's Fiesta Jalepeno instead.  Better menu, better service, better food."}
{"text":"Not too many selections.  I was highly disappointed in the portion size.  They are way smaller and the price is not worth it.  I think I'll stick to the places I normally go to."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Mexican food I have eaten that is not made in Mexico. The flavor of the Cochinita is hard to capture and they have done the imposible. As a Mexican that has lived in Mexico and has had the opportunity to travel all over Mexico, I can honestly say Las Cazuelas in Henderson, NV is a close as you are going to get."}
{"text":"I enjoyed everything about this place.  I loved the review from Shirley B and it was a place not to miss.  My wife wanted to try some Mexican Food and of course, I was looking for something very authentic... Glad to have found this place!

a.  Ambiance - 5 Star - Ok, perhaps this may make you think too much, but this place is very basic, very simple and has 4 tables with 4 chairs each.  So approximately 16 people max.  There is nothing very special about this place or decor, but you know what it was simple yet just right for my expectations. Basic is often very good.

b.  Menu - 4 star - The menu is also very basic and if these dishes are available at other Mexican Eateries, I have not seen most of them.  The menu has a limited choice of such foods as Enchiladas, Chanclas, two types of tacos, frijoles, Molletes, Huevos Rancheros and some other choices...

c.  The food - 4 star - As I wanted to go authentic, the most authentic dish that I personally like is Caldo de Res, which I have found only in a few restaurants. This is a beef bone soup with vegetables.  So, when I meant authentic, I meant not tacos, burritos, tamales, and fajitas....  So we ordered:

Enchiladas de Mole Poblano - Chicken in a corn tortilla with the mole sauce.
Enchiladas de Salsa Verde - Chicken in  a corn tortilla with the green sauce.
Chanclas - bread with chicken, avocado and onions with a chorizo sauce.
Molletes - bread with refried beans, cheese, pico de gallo

I enjoyed the verde, the chancels and the molletes very much.  Since I am not a huge fan of Mole Poblano, I have to say that it was good, just not something I would personally order.  The enchilada was great though.  The chicken very tender!

d.  The price - all very reasonable!

e.  The service - Excellent small family style.

GK says to check this place out for some really good stuff.  My next visit will be the frijoles, and the esquires!"}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place because it's nearby.  Service was friendly but the food was barely above fast food drive thru type. The beans and enchilada sauce tasted straight out of a can. 
Much better taqueria options around."}
{"text":"I have heard nothing but great things about Las Cazuelas.  So, we decided to give it a try for lunch.  The employees were very friendly.  After ordering, we were brought chips and salsa very quickly.  The salsa was extremely watery, which I don't care for.  The flavor was okay, not great, but I've certainly had worse.

I had the chicken verde enchiladas, the wife had the quesadilla arabe, which is filled with cheese, pork and chipotle sauce.  We also tried the beans, mini molletes, and esquites.  My favorites were the enchiladas and molletes.  The molletes are sort of a Mexican bruschetta, refried beans, pico, and cheese spread over soft bread.  I loved the pico, I think next time I go to Las Cazuelas I'll ask for that instead of salsa.  The enchiladas were simple, just shredded chicken topped with cheese and lots of verde sauce.  I really liked the sauce, which made the dish.  

The beans were basic.  The esquites, or warm corn salad, was okay.  I didn't get any lime or spices, pretty much hot mayo, cheese and corn.  The quesadilla was cheesy, but it didn't have much meat.  I don't know if this is how they serve them or if we just got a sparsely filled quesadilla.

Everyone is loving this place and it's getting great write ups in local magazines.  So, it's likely that we ordered the wrong stuff (clearly should have tried a mole dish).  I'll return and give some other menu items a shot."}
{"text":"I loved there food! Mole was fantastic! My family loved their tacos! The owner was top notch, there was a mess up on the way we ordered our tacos. He caught it before bring it to the table and he had new tacos made to our order. I consider that high quality! I will come back anytime and suggest you do too."}
{"text":"Very yummy mole and awesome service. Very casual small restaurant, fast service  and great prices. 7 bucks for 4 enchilada moles!"}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the worst Mexican food I've ever had! Hubby and I decided to try since it's close to home our usual spot is Nuevo Acapulco but nonetheless had an open mind. Service was OK but I ordered the chimichanga and it had two in the description...when received they were so small my hubby and I just laughed I should have snapped a pic but really and the taste was bland. I want to add the price was 12.99, pretty pricey for such a small serving that didn't even taste that good.The chips with salsa tasted burnt and I couldn't even turn to them to get filled up Lol! Would not recommend...Taco Bell down the street would have been better!!!"}
{"text":"It's been exactly 3 years since we've been here and will NOT come back! Slow af service. NO one here but a few people on a beautiful Saturday with a nice patio. Food portions, insulting! Waited for 20 min for chips and salsa but everyone around us got theirs when they were after us! 

If you want good Mexican, go to Si Senor! Or Nuevo in North Olmsted. You won't leave hungry! 

This place blows!"}
{"text":"Was visiting LV and was looking for a spot to grub. Went off yelp reviews and this place was a 5*.

Small inside but quick service and great food.  Will go back next time in town.  Tacos, tortas, and meat were on point"}
{"text":"BEST Mexican food I've ever had! I think I've frequented every Mexican place in the tri-county area and this is the best, by far. Their portions are huge and I've never had a bad meal here. My favorite thing to order is the fajitas for two - it's a huge platter of pork, chicken, steak, chorizo, and shrimp and is more than enough for two. My husband and I have it for dinner and then he also gets a lunch out of it the next day. My other favorite is their quesadillas. Pair with a frozen daiquiri and chips/salsa. Yummmm! Also, they get a bonus star for their fantastic customer service - the staff is on point. Friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"Really good food I have try Pelonas, Torta de Pierna, enchiladas and the fried ice cream everything really good, I have only order online I haven't eat there so I can't judge the experience there but when I pick up the food is warm fast and friendly service ."}
{"text":"The food is great. Went with family las night for diner. Think will start comming more often. Recomend this place"}
{"text":"Great food with great service. The carne asada quesidilla and the enchiladas were very good."}
{"text":"Hidden GEM, is definitely worth checking out. Authentic Mexican cuisine with an exotic twist, love this place and it's amazing family service from the moment you walk in. All items are delicious, yet the corn will definitely hit the spot. If your from the Midwest and ever had an Elote, this will take you back!!! A+++ Business!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was So good! Great Mexican food right here. Everything was fresh and full of flavor. My fianc√© and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I tried the cochinita tacos, they were good. My wife tried the mini molletes, and enchiladas, she liked them. We had and elote and it was good too. The 
place is modest but clean."}
{"text":"This small, family-run place is a gem.  They serve specific regional cuisine from Puebla that is delicious and authentic.  Please go here if you want something different (and better!) than your average, Americanized Mexican fare."}
{"text":"Cookie cutter chi chis style mexican hash house. Food was served  in the temperature danger zone. I always get the hershey squirts from mexican food but this time was extremely brutal. I'm talking a four pack of charmin double rolls worth!  For your intestinal health avoid this place!"}
{"text":"The mole and the salsa verde were awesome! The owner was very nice. I recommend everyone to give this restaurant a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very nice people, I think they might be the owners. The tacos are good! And their Elotes  (Mexican style corn) are amazing!!!!!! Their pork sandwich is very tasty, with a chipotle sauce. Very clean and good costumer service!!!! I will def be back :)"}
{"text":"The bf and I decided to try Las Cazuelas upon the suggestion of another merchant in the same shopping center and were we glad we did!!  The restaurant is small, but I was impressed by how clean and attractive it is.  We arrived just after 10am on a Monday morning and only one other patron was there.  We ordered the huevos rancheros and sat down.  The gentleman taking our order at the register did not exactly exude lots of warmth but he was polite and we quickly had a bowl of chips and some of the tastiest salsa I've had in a long time.  The chips were salty without being too salty.  Most places I have to add salt to the chips but these were fresh, crunchy and with that wonderful salsa really hit the spot.  Our food came quickly and I was again impressed that when we ordered the eggs medium, that's how they were cooked.  No runny white, but the yolk still soft, just perfect for me!!!  The plates they use are very different and set off the food for a nice presentation.  The refried beans were very good and the corn tortillas that came with our meal were so hot I could hardly hold one in my hand!!  Lots of other places half warm the tortillas and they end up being hard and rubbery but these were not.  I finished off my whole plate and the bf did also.  At $5.50 for this meal, it is the bargain of the week!!!!    We want to try the enchiladas de mole poblano so badly, I know we will be back again there very, very soon!!  I am intrigued by some of the other offerings, some I have never heard of.  This is definitely a must try if you are looking for good, very reasonably priced food!!"}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Enchilada Verde and a side order of refried beans.  My husband had the Chicken and a side order of the corn on the cob.  All I can say was the food was excellent.....a touch of spice and loads of flavor.  All white meat was used for the chicken.  I only tasted the corn but I will order it next time.....thought it was heavenly.  Refried Beans were excellent.  The food came fast and was serving was plentiful.  The price was far lower than I expected.  No Margaritas but I'll just make one at home."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in town! We have been working through the menu and haven't come across anything we don't like! The severs are friendly and accommodating, the homemade margaritas are to die for, and the bartenders are funny! We try to come here anytime we have a night off together which isn't often! Lily is awesome also! Sad she isn't here tonight, but there are many other friendly faces! Try the choriqueso!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing delicious authentic Mexican cuisine. They are so kind and will bring your food outside to enjoy in the gorgeous Courtyard has plenty of shade. I ate the sopas, they were delicious and the Carne Asada it was fresh! Must try! I can't even, so good. This is authentic Mexican, hands down. So good."}
{"text":"Fresh, superbly prepared food with nice presentation!  I've tried nearly every dish and I love them all. Best Chile Relleno I've had. The owner is genuine and friendly. The restaurant is clean, attractive, inviting."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Chili Relleno. It was just the right amount of breading and the sauces was delicious!!!!! Highly recommend this!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here plenty of times and the food has always been really good. I ordered carry out for the first time last night. Not impressed. Do you think it's ok to skimp on the amount of food you give us since we don't see it until we get home? And why so many onions in the fajitas? Don't get me wrong, the fajitas tasted good but, there were more onions than anything else. Straighten up Las Cazuelas, or I'll be going somewhere else."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Henderson. The food here is authentic, fresh, delicious, and prepared quickly but with care. 

Everything on the menu is great, but I definitely recommend the enchiladas (all the sauces are delicious but I prefer the mole best) and the ESQUITE!! I could eat bowls and bowls of the esquite--it is SO DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Traditional and delicious Mexico City flavors.  The service is awesome and we WILL be back!!"}
{"text":"Este lugar es uno de mis favoritos en Las Vegas , la comida que preparan es aut√©nticamente mexicana , los due√±os del lugar son personas muy atentas y amables , su prioridad es servir siempre los alimentos con una indiscutible calidad y sabor , atender de la mejor manera a sus clientes y que √©stos se lleven la mejor impresi√≥n , lo mejor de todo es que siempre lo logran :) . Ellos tienen un extenso y variado men√∫ para dar gusto a cualquiera, recomiendo ampliamente ls enchiladas de mole, enchiladas verdes, sopes, tacos de cochinita, esquites , etc. En realidad, todo lo que ellos sirven es delicioso.. los chiles en nogada en temporada de fiestas patrias son simplemente \"√∫nicos\"!!!!  Las cazuelas es una garant√≠a de buen sabor y comida 100 por ciento mexicana :)"}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant. Amazing food! Quaint atmosphere, cutely decorated and casual. This place is good for take out as well."}
{"text":"We stopped by yesterday because I wanted some fried ice-cream. The entire family was surprised at how good the food was. It tasted home made and the price was very affordable for the quantity and quality. Defiantly going back. Loved it."}
{"text":"Authentic.  Absolutely delicious.    We ordered their frijoles rancheros, Chiles En ahogada and Guarache.
      Let's start with their chips and salsa.  As a rule, when i try Mexican restaurants I can tell if their food is good if their salsas are authentic, fresh and flavorful. 
Las Casuelas made the grade. Great salsa.  
       Now let's talk about their chips; I like chips to be natural and more homemade , these chips were a bit more commercial, so if you like Tostitos , you will like these.  Not to my liking but salsa made it almost unnoticeable. 
         Guarache, delicious! Had chicken one and loved it. 
         During Mexican Independence a very traditional dish is Chiles En Ahogada and this is a meat stuffed \"green chile \" topped with a walnut cream sauce and sprinkled with pomegranates.  This place served the Chile \"capeado\" which means covered in traditional Chile Relleno egg white covering.  The traditional Chile en Ahogada does not have the egg white coating.  However it was still delicious!  
         Finally, their Frijoles Rancheros bean soup.  The flavor was great.  Beans cooked in bacon are great.  I loved the broth. I prefer this soup to be done with Peruvian or light colored beans and they did theirs with pinto beans which tend to be a bit harder and that's what made this soup not perfect.  The beans themselves were too hard not cooked enough.
        This place still made A grade food.  Oh one last thing- place hard to find because their sign is not eye friendly. I would say it's nice logo for restaurant menu  but not for customers looking for it in a shopping center location."}
{"text":"Really good food and great margaritas. Be sure to ask for the \"homemade\" margarita. Next time I am visiting the area I will be sure to stop in."}
{"text":"As a Mexican, I always tell people that Mexican food is not just burritos and tacos; well, this is the place to taste truly authentic Mexican food. The owners are really sweet. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Really good home style Mexican food. Small locally owned joint thats clean, no wait time, and has attentive staff. The tacos are delicious! My new go to Mexican place."}
{"text":"Awesome green sauce. Enchilada salsa verde is a must get.  Elote is also delicious!!"}
{"text":"Excellent chips and salsa; standard Mexican food. I've been to most of the Mexican places in the area, and this as as good as any. It really just depends what your favorite dish is. Fajitas meals and Special tacos are great; enchiladas are just average. Everything else falls in between.

Best part is the service. They do remember you, and for Avon Lake people that's a plus. I like the atmosphere and seeing folks I know whenever I go in. I do agree with the one review that it can get hectic around the hostess stand if you have to wait for a table. All in all, my family and I just like going here."}
{"text":"Don't really eat Mexican food out much.  Usually prefer the homemade stuff.  In Vegas though I don't get much of that either so I decided to venture and try this place based on the great reviews.  We tried the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, mini-molletes, and a quesadilla arabe.  I got the chipotle sauce from the quesadilla on the side, just in case.  It wasn't too spicy but had delicious smoky flavor.  If you're a bit shy with spicy food, ask them to try the sauce before you order, they're happy to comply.  Great place, and I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ate here today with my fiance after reading rave reviews and being in the neighborhood. I would like to give it more stars but can't after being disappointed with the chicken tacos my fiance ordered. The chicken meat used in the tacos was basically frozen processed Tyson chicken strips. We were surprised because everything else was very tasty and authentic. My chicken enchiladas had marinated shredded chicken that was excellent. His, on the other hand, was bland and obviously wasn't housemade. You can see how the lil \"grilled\" chicken strips are processed in shapes and probably right out of a bag. Seriously, look at the other pics posted on Yelp of their chicken tacos... WTF??...it's the worst excuse for \"Mexican\" meat they could possibly find and sell for $10-11?? We probably won't be back, but if we do we will order something different."}
{"text":"If this place is 4 1/2 stars then Yelp is not to be trusted. We went thinking great this will finally be a good Mexican restaurant... not so fast. Chips and salsa: chips tiny, salsa very salty. Mole sauce tasted straight out of a jar. Chilequillas, soggy, vinegary, watery with dry chicken. Chicken flautas: very dry chicken. I also have never heard of a Mexican restaurant that does not have burritos... really? WTH is that? Being from Cali we are looking for an excellent Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas, haven't found one yet, most are poor to average."}
{"text":"This is a really great, small place to come and get some fantastic Mexican food for a good price. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My favorite Authentic Mexican restaurant !! Great food, good price's, big Margarita's.  Nice place with ample parking.  Our family has traveled many places, states, countries for different foods.  This is really good mexican food,  at a great price."}
{"text":"I have eaten at quite a few Mexican, Tex-Mex, and Southwestern style restaurants all over the eastern United States. Las Cazuelas has them all beat, whatever seasoning they use (which I have been unable to find anywhere else) makes even the simplest foods taste amazing. But one thing stands out above all else the ACP, or Arroz con Pollo. As it's name suggests, it is a simple dish consisting of grilled chicken on a mountain of cheesy rice, but there is nothing else like it, anywhere, it is simply indescribable, for some reason it is just good beyond words. There are many restaurants more authentic, more original, and FAR more expensive but not one is anywhere near as good. If you love FOOD eat at Las Cazuelas."}
{"text":"This is your typical Mexican restaurant. Although, they do have a really good chicken soup with big chunks of chicken and pieces avocado that isn't all that typical. If you have ever been to a Mexican restaurant you know what to expect. The food is pretty good and the service is really fast. 

On a side note a few months ago they were busted for employing a whole bunch of illegals. I'm not sure what came of that because only a couple of weeks later they had reopened."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food! The server was very nice and friendly, she was able to accommodate what my kids wanted to eat even though those items were not on the menu. This place is kind of hidden, I wouldn't of found such a great restaurant without checking on Yelp."}
{"text":"Food: chicken enchiladas with green sauce, rice and beans. I love this green sauce! It's so tangy with the right amount of spice. I also like how they use all white meat chicken. I love this so much that I haven't tried anything else! My husband enjoys the breakfast. He's also enjoyed the tacos is the past. 

Service: this is a very small mom and pop shop with maybe 5 tables, but I notice they do a lot of to-go orders. 

Ambiance: small and cozy with 2 tv's playing local news. 

Tip: they are closed Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mexican food in all of Las Vegas. Don't be turned away by the small appearance. This place will not let you down."}
{"text":"First time here food was reasonable,  but the portions were very small compared to other restaurants."}
{"text":"Best little hidden mexican food restraunt on eastern and silverado ranch in Target shopping center! Very fresh authentic mom and pop, just had juevos rancheros and it was the best!!!  Actually  oursecond time here!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. Their enchiladas were awesome. Their corn was also so delicious."}
{"text":"Customer Service: Great! Very welcoming, great at suggesting menu items & attentive overall. 

Food: Delicia! Very yummy Mexican food + They have the perfect serving sizes to satisfy your hunger. 

Hygiene: What I really loved is the restaurant is very clean & well-maintained. From the entrance , seating to the restrooms. 


Overall, The restaurant is small imagine going in to a Subway type setting. Its not for large parties as theres not enough room. If you are not familiar with Mexican food, they have a menu on the wall with pictures of the dishes. Also, the food is made fresh, you can tell once you take the first bite. If you're looking to explore, id deff recommend this restaurant :-)"}
{"text":"I thought I had written a review here before, but I guess not, so here I go!

My girlfriend and I found this place last year searching for a close but good Mexican restaurant. My girlfriend is Mexican/puerto rican so good food is essential, and she knows her Mexican foods! We came here and ordered esquites, she ordered enchiladas with mole and I ordered tacos with this spicy cabbage and I believe pork? It was delicious and super spicy, I was sick so it helped my sinuses lol.

The other few times we've been here, we've ordered the sopes (carne asada and chorizo) super delicious, the flautas (comes with two chicken ones and two potatoes with poblano chiles) again very good, carne asada tacos, rice and beans, elotes and the taquitos! 

All the food is very good, I was disappointed to not sopas the other day when I ordered via Postmates, but it happens! The owner is super friendly and nice, his wife is an amazing cook! Delicious and authentic Mexican food, located in the Silverado ranch target area, next to NothinBundt cakes and Yummy Grill sushi!"}
{"text":"Abosulety love this place! The food is delicious! I went two days in a row. The huarache is my favorite thing on the menu. My mouth is watery from thinking about it."}
{"text":"I HIGHLY recommend this place for tasty Mexican food! 

If you eat there they bring you chips and salsa while you wait for your order. You can sit inside or outside, they bring your food to you. 

We got tacos and taquitos. DEFINITELY order the pork tacos. The pork... Oh my gosh the pork.... Idk what they do to it but it is so delicious!! The taquitos were also delicious but you can't really go wrong with it. My only gripe is that there was no guac with they taquitos. 

If you're looking to fix your Mexican craving come here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely exceptional! I ordered the Mojo chicken enchiladas and they were sublime. Service was wonderful and although the dining area is very small, it was very comfortable and welcoming."}
{"text":"This little mom and pop shop is sort of tucked away, but surrounded by strong presence like Windy City (deep dish Chicago style pizza) and Nothing bundt cake (people rave about their overly sweet- not good to me at all, bundt cakes).  I digress...

From our viewpoint, looks like this joint is ran by a husband and wife team.  The husband mans the cashier and front end and the wife is cooking in the kitchen.  

Come for the fresh chips and salsa- great amounts of chili and flavor packed in this salsa mixture. The street tacos are awesome here and I appreciate the little side fixings and large slices of lime that goes with the choice mix and match a la carte or combo meal.  The pickled red onions and by request their chile verde is the bomb here.  

The restaurant can be awkwardly quiet, so maybe a little soft tune can go a long way for this business."}
{"text":"Owned by a husband and wife team, this place has what it takes to really become a great spot for traditional street-style Mexican tacos and other native Mexican cuisine. 

Favorites on the menu are the Taco Oriental and side of guacamole. 

The Taco Oriental are these tiny tacos on corn tortillas with seasoned, diced pork.  They come plain and wrapped tightly.   If this is all you get, get 6.  If you get guacamole and chips & salsa to go with, I recommend 3-4 Taco Orientals. 

Guacamole is super fresh.  This is NOT fast food.  If you stop in, prepare to wait.  It is worth it, the food is made fresh.  I am not sure the tortillas are made fresh.   Which I find somewhat disappointing since this is such an easy thing to make fresh.  I need to confirm this. 

The d√©cor is also noteworthy.  Its this fusion of Mexican and Native American with a modern, clean look.  For a strip mall, it's refreshing.  I loved the d√©cor so much I thought perhaps I might want something similar in my home kitchen.  When I asked, the owner told me his wife did the d√©cor.  How impressive!   She was also cooking.  So I will let her be for now.  Ha. 

He did lose the music: said he did not know he would have to pay royalties/fee to play music, so he has a TV now.  So there is some entertainment.  But no music is a downer to some degree.  

I always get \"to go\" here now, but there is a quaint seating area and I have dined here with my toddler before and the service is great."}
{"text":"Amazing mole enchiladas. The taquitos were very good too. Chips and salsa. The salsa was just enough spicy. Creama and spicy quac salsa. We got a flan to go. It did not make it out of the parking lot."}
{"text":"Thanks to several recent Yelp reviews showing the mole enchiladas I had to try this place! Las Cazuelas is located in the Target shopping center right next to Windy city beef & pizza. It is quite small inside with only 4 tables but there is outdoor seating as well. 

We were greeted by the owner as soon as we walked in. You can either order right at the counter or sit at one of the tables and peruse the menu. I knew I wanted the enchiladas de mole poblano so I ordered at the counter. I also had to try the churros stuffed with sweet condensed milk (purely for my review of course!). You can order 2 or 4 enchiladas for $7. If you order two it comes with rice and beans which I opted for. 

There was one table open and I was served chips and salsa as soon as I sat down. The salsa was excellent, just the right amount of heat for me. Within a few minutes my enchiladas arrived. The two enchiladas were on the small side but the mole sauce was absolutely delicious, just the right amount of sweet chocolate and spices. The shredded chicken was also moist and tender and the rice and beans were standard mexican sides. 

The chips and salsa were quickly replenished without asking. Just as I was finished with the enchiladas the churros arrived. The order is 4 small churros served with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. They were hot and covered in cinnamon sugar. The filling was okay, but they would have been fine without it. 

Overall I really enjoyed Las Cazuelas. The owner provided excellent service from beginning to end making sure we were happy. Although the enchiladas were a litte on the small side they were very good and priced fairly. Definately somewhere I will return to."}
{"text":"I visited Las Cazuelas for the first time last week when a friend and I stopped in for a late lunch.  The chips were fresh and tasty.  I only had the Quesadilla Especial for my meal, which makes it a little hard to give an overall rating for the restaurant, but I didn't have any complaints.  The chicken was tender and everything tasted fine.  I already have a favorite Mexican restaurant, so I'm not sure when I'll be back to this one, but there's no reason I wouldn't return.  I love that my servers picked up on the fact that I can speak Spanish and gladly let me practice the language a little bit!"}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food. We tried it for the first time on a Saturday night right before closing. The owner (I think) was very friendly.  I had two chicken enchiladas with red sauce, beans and rice. All delicious!  My husband had a torta. So big he could only eat half. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We Never had potatoes in enchiladas before, not good. Asked for more salsa and chips, they never came, marguerites were lousy. Service was very poor. With all the Mexican choices this doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. I got classic fajita's. The cast iron pan was not sizzling hot. The guacamole was browning. Lettuce was wilted.  Food tastes old and reheated. I hesitated to eat so picked around for what looked decent. 
Don't waste your time. Head to Si Sinors where you get good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food great service was the same only reason a 4 star without beer it's just not a true Mexican feel"}
{"text":"Very tasty Mexican food and great service!  Close to home, so it's convenient. Large portions, friendly Mexican servers, and great, fresh chips and salsa!

Be sure to check out their Facebook page for daily food and drink specials!

This place is good, but I like Cozumel in Lakewood and the S√≠ Se√±or chains just a bit more."}
{"text":"Me and My Beautiful Wife found this place close to home because of our son. This is authentic Mexican food from Puebla Mexico served from a Husband & Wife Owners!
What can beat that! My favorite is the Chile Rellenos and my wife's is the Elotes and mole Poblano!
No she doesn't want to eat there anymore because I always want to eat there!! 
Support your local places guys!!
Thanks"}
{"text":"Have been a customer of this place for years!! Out of all the authentic Mexican joints in the area, this one is the top!!! The service is always great and quick, the food is always hot, delicious, and flavorful, and their menu itself is unbeatable! We tend to order different things, but have some staples like the \"cocktel de camerones\" which is an amazingly awesome mexican shrimp cocktail (think gazpacho-like, no horseradish, lots of avocados and whole shrimp in a tomatoe-y broth) and the Fajitas for two can feed 3-4 people!! Love this place. Also, we visit every couple of months but several of the servers that recognize us stop by our table and say hi! So nice to feel like a \"regular\""}
{"text":"Just ok. Corn on the cob looked really good, it would have tasted so much better if they use parmesan cheese."}
{"text":"Great food for a reasonable price (would highly recommend the ACP). 

From the moment you walk into the restaurant, you are greeted and treated like their most important customer. The service is fast and courteous. Sitting at the bar is a good time, they have a great selection of margaritas and the bartenders are always very helpful and fun to chat with. 

Some friends and I have become friends with one of the bartender/servers very well over this past summer and we love talking to him and enjoy his company very much. 

If you want some delicious authentic Mexican, than head on over to Las Caz you gueys."}
{"text":"This location is cute and their plates are nicely put together. I thought the food was okay but everything lacks flavor. I wouldn't call this authentic Mexican cuisine. Definitely not a place I'd come to again."}
{"text":"The bes chicken enchiladas in town...and the chilaquiles uff! Excelent for hangovers lol this place is small but is authentic mexican food.
Las mejores enchiladas verdes de la ciudad....y los chilaquiles ni se d√≠a...y m√°s si andas crudo jaja es un lugar peque√±o pero es comida aut√©ntica mexicana"}
