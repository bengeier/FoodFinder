{"text":"Good burgers but very pricey. Service is fast and friendly. Extras seem overly pricy, more so than most burger spots."}
{"text":"Very nice and quiet. Every time I come in I get served quickly.  The food tastes fine, but not any better than I'd expect from a burger joint.  I wish it didn't cost as much though, I mean, sauteed onions cost considerably more. Either way, it's a nice place to go for a meal."}
{"text":"Love this place!  They have wonderful tasting burgers and sides.  Choices also include chicken, turkey, salmon and vegetarian burgers- all with a great smokey taste. They have Gluten free buns, too, so your GF friends will be able to eat a real burger!  Great friendly service."}
{"text":"I really really loved the food. I thought it was delicious. Sadly this place is gourmet, with prices to match. I have a feeling they will be around for quite some time, only not because of my money. Sadly it is far outside my budget. If it was not for a treat from a friend, I would not even know what it looked liked inside."}
{"text":"I was on my back from Horseshoe Valley and was starving after running a 5K obstacle course race, but I didn't want to stop at any of the service centres as they have boring meals.

This is your typical Hero Burger and I ordered a soul burger (veggie burger) with fries.  The burger was good and not greasy and the fries were great and made fresh. The cashier was also very friendly and made recommendations (I'm guessing he was the owner).  

So while the food is your typical Hero Burger joint, I'm giving them points for not being greasy, fast turn around time and friendly service."}
{"text":"Just when we were going to completely breakup with hero burger as a whole company, we have an excellent experience! Our order was taken quickly, properly, the staff were welcoming and professional.
Gluten free meal was perfection, the way they even put the burger together was art, flawless! 
Amazing experience! Props to the management to training and maintains their location so well! The locations at Vaughan really can learn a few things from this Bradford location! 
Will return when in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I took off 1 star for the restaurant pricing in a fast food setting.  Food however is excellent.  Our burgers were cooked perfectly, the poutine was delish and the staff were friendly and helpful.  It's a well run place, just a lil pricey for fast food."}
