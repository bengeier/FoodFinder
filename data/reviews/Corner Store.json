{"text":"Always great service, I am glad we don't have to leave Verrado to have access to a Convenient Store any more!!!"}
{"text":"Why does the store think it's ok to charge all of use Verrado residents 20 cents more per gallon than the all 3 of the corner stores in suprise and el mirage this is wrong"}
{"text":"Awesome place really gets your heart pumping If you like fun and great times than this is the place for you Come and get it bitches"}
{"text":"Wish there was a zero star!! Can't believe in business only1 year and everything's out of order!!! And cash only really sucks!!! You call this a convenience store?????best to stay away till things get fixed!!!"}
{"text":"Did a quick stop here for gas and restroom break.  They have nice tables and chairs outside for you to have a quick meal, it would have been nice if they had that area shaded in the hot Arizona weather.  The restrooms are very clean and in great condition, I hope they maintain this way the next time I return."}
{"text":"Nicest staff I've ever experienced at a convenience / gas station. Always friendly and helpful.   Store is always clean.   Only gripe is the premium gas seems more here than elsewhere."}
{"text":"Clean, convenient, can get a little crowded, but all in all good service. It is just a mini-mart.  The price on gas tends to be more than the Circle K on Watson, however it is better priced than the Chevron on Jackrabbit."}
{"text":"I give it three stars for the nice cashier in the morning. Other than that if you need something you may want to try a different location if they're not out of gas they're out of hot food if they're not out of hot food they're out of hot dog buns always out of something I stop there twice a week get $200 worth of fuel and something to eat but I'm going to have to find a new location.  It's convenient, but not that convenient when I stop there and have to go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Great place, clean affordable and pleasant employees. A good place to stop for a quick run"}
{"text":"Nice and clean. Morning staff is extremely friendly.... they learn your name which doesn't happen a lot these days!! Burritos are fresh cooked in the am. Only thing that would make it perfect is fresh brewed Ice tea before 5am!!! Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"The coffee is really good! Love how cheap it is! I only go in there for that. But it's always out of supplies at the counter. Service is terrible! Seems like they are out of other stuff a lot."}
{"text":"Awesome new gas station great location! Nice car wash too but my favorite part is that there is a culvers next to it so perfect for fueling up and grabbing a bite to eat before heading out."}
{"text":"This corner store was probably the best gas station/convenience store when my fiance and I first moved to Buckeye in April but since then we have had so many problems here whether their system went down to not having gas. It's been super inconvenient due to their unpredictability. I feel bad for people in Verrado cause this is their closest gas station.  Out of towners/cross country drivers do not stop here for coffee, it's honestly disgusting and their creamer machine hasn't functioned right for at least a month now.  Edit also-- we have also had an issue with them not labeling their food properly so if you have an allergen really take a look at the store made items to make sure it's the right kind of food for you"}
{"text":"Slowest car wash EVER! I could've washed, dried, and vacuumed my truck myself and finished before I actually entered their wash. 2nd star added for gas prices."}
