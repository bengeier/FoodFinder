{"text":"Decided to try today since I saw the 5 star 6 review on here and boy this place doesn't disappoint. Very clean and super friendly staff! I took half a chicken plate, comes with salad and fries. The chicken wasn't small like other places, it was a nice size. Very flavorful charcoal taste with a not too spicy sauce. The fries and salad were very good too. The prices are very decent. For desert, we took the natas and they were out of this world. Best ones I ever had by a longshot. They aren't the usual natas, there's a twist but I comprised not to spoil it so see for yourself, you will not regret. All in all, one of the best Portuguese places I had the pleasure of visiting. Great job!"}
{"text":"Belle découverte. Définitivement à revisiter pour essayer leur mix plate (poulet, chorizo, ribs, salade, frite , riz....et j'en passe!!"}

{"text":"If you are craving excellent chicken/ribs look no further.  This place is a must. All fresh food therefore call ahead to order."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in this little gem on a whim and it was so good!  This place had the best Rissois that I've ever had in a restaurant, not mass produced but completely homemade. The Frango churassco was delicious and make sure you polish off your meal with a delicious Pastel de Nata."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken! Freshly made chicken and ribs on  charcoal fire! Super delicious food and great owners! Definitely recommended and going back again! They accept delivery as well"}
{"text":"So a friend of mine points me out to this little \"hole in the wall\". Made me try a piece of chicken and was like this is delicious. Decided to go for a try. Recommended the poutine with chorizo and chicken basque in its ever tasting sauce with a brandy \"poutine\" sauce. All i can say is wow. This place is not only a repeat, it's sure to be a regular spot now for me. Cannot wait to try the rest of the menu.. Sorry no pics yet. The dish was just too good. My brother had a taste and was impressed. Seriously people GOTTA EAT THERE ASAP."}
{"text":"Ok Sunday adventure...found on yelp..shrimp croquettes with chipoltle mayo 8/10 nice texture a liitle bland for the shrimp taste. Drinking \"Sumol\",traditional pineapple beverage..sweet and refreshing. Great home cut fries fresh garden salad and Amazing chicken."}
{"text":"They weren't kidding when they wrote 5 stars!  Everything is fresh! Chicken is  BBQ'd on wood charcoal ! The owner and staff are very friendly!  The price is very reasonable for the large amount of food you are getting ! I have been to a lot of Portuguese restaurants, this is by far the best!"}
{"text":"This was by far my best takeout choice in the last year. Chicken is amazing and you have to get the tomato rice dish."}
{"text":"En consultant Yelp, j'avais beaucoup d'espoir de préférer cet endroit à celui où je vais d'habitude pour le poulet portugais.  Le décor est très joli et ça sent merveilleusement bon dès que l'on ouvre la porte. Les employés sont très gentils et accueillants, les prix raisonnables, le menu varié et les portions généreuses. Tout y était mais petit bémol, le poulet est tendre mais manque de goût car il n'y a pas de sauce dessus. Le riz est réchauffé à la poêle, pâteux et sans saveur et la pâte des natas est molle. Les frites et la sauce sont bonnes mais sans plus. J'ai bien aimé la vinaigrette de la salade.  Dommage"}
{"text":"The best meal I've had in years!   Skip the touristy Montreal joints and head straight to this place for the best dining experience you will find.   The place is on the small side but it lets you sit kitchen side at the bar and watch the culinary magic take place.   The food is off the charts insanely good. Every bite blew my mind. The chicken is so juicy, the fries are seasoned to perfection.   And the poutine! The best poutine in the world. The portion is huge, and there is nearly more meat than fries. I ordered a small size but it was so big that it was bigger than a dinner entree. If you are even remotely close to Montreal you must try this poutine!  The owner is super friendly, and I hope he opens more locations ( like Toronto).   Value, taste and an incredible dining experience. I'd come to Montreal just for this place. And I plan on doing so soon."}
{"text":"Grillades Portugaises excellentes, cuisinées à la perfection  par des chefs portugais de haut calibre. Belle emplacement, bon, abordable. En somme, 5 sur 5 !!!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place nearby for Portuguese chicken and found this place on yelp. With 5 stars it was clearly a no brainer. Oh boy was I happy I did. For starters the smell when you walk in smashes you straight in the face, In a good way! We tried the chicken, chorizo,ribs and the pork chop. All amazing!! Everything was fresh moist and very flavourful. The fries are also money. Everything was served nicely with good portions and MUST save room for the nata dessert. The best I ever had! Not much room to eat inside but the owner went above and beyond to make us comfortable. Amazing food, great staff equals winning recipe in my book. A must if you like Portuguese food."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken cooked right on the grill.  The rissois were out of this world, if you like fried food don't miss out on these beauties.  If you sit at the counter you can chat with the owner who is super friendly and watch him cook.  My only complaint is that they aren't closer to me!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Escudo Express and I was very happy that I did! Normally one would have to go all the way down to Montreal around Rachel street to find good Portuguese food of this caliber but somehow this establishment is located in the quaint neighborhood of Boisbriand.  Located is small and relatively easy to miss but clearly not worth missing. Interior is clean with a busy owner working on many delivery/pick-up orders and serving in-house patrons. Portuguese themed decorations with cute plates glued on the roof, Portuguese accessories along the walls and a huge bar you can eat at and watch the action in progress.  I went with their quarter chicken with side fries and salad. The chicken was moist and tasty..... just as I'd expect a competent Portuguese place to provide me with with a great charcoal grill. What really knocked my socks off was how fantastic the fries were! Literally the best fries I have ever eaten. Perfectly prepared and then covered in their household secret blend of 17 spices.... these fries are literal taste-bud heaven! Portion size is generous, it's a huge plate.  Along with my meal, I had a Sumol Passion fruit drink and a Pastel de Nata. I love Sumol (imported from Portugal) and it compliments this food perfectly. The Pastel de Nata was really good as well and I liked it so much I ordered a dozen to go to share at work. They were a big hit and I ended up going back to Escudo Express with some co-workers so they can enjoy what I experienced.  They loved the chicken and freaked out how good the fries were. Everyone was delighted on how great the food is.  Price-tag is reasonable, value is very high. I recommend their chicken, fries and Pastel de Nata.  This place is truly a hidden gem on Montreal's north shore. Owner is direct yet friendly and funny. We enjoyed our time here and plan to go back."}
