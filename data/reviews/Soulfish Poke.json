{"text":"Discovered yesterday while waiting for a gluten free cake to be frosted next door. Upon entering, there was a guy in line very nice & proceeded to tell me how it all worked. (That was the nicest part of my first visit & he was a customer!) Everything was fine at first. The girl who waited on me seemed stressed, but trying to be nice. She kinda rushed me thru it. By the time I was finished, I was surprised by the size of the portion! How small was?! After tasting, I was willing to overlook my disappointment. I went back up to order another bowl for later (since I did not live in the area.) I ordered a large this time around. To my surprise, it looked the same size as the small? They know that too! Also, while I was in line, another worker came up to help because owner (I'm assuming) was fulfilling a big order. This new counter help person, didn't even acknowledge me, nor ask who was next? He looked right at the guy clearly (BEHIND ME) & proceeded to help him. I let it go, then the stressed out girl stepped up & was even more stressed out this time. She rushed me thru again.. while trying to be nice about it. I took note of the ingredients that I ordered & will now make this at home. They should all be wearing gloves, by the way! Make your portion sizes true!!! ..And be nice to your customers! Won't be returning, even though there is one coming closer to where I live. Just left a bad taste in my mouth! Not the food, however!"}
{"text":"Love their unique toppings to choose from. Also their sauces are bomb.com. I Also like that they offer quinoa as a base."}
{"text":"Amazing bowls! The fish is so fresh and melts in your mouth like butter. A perfect healthy fast food option! I am addicted"}
{"text":"Great concept but didn't taste good. Employees are there to hang out instead of providing customer service. Dinning area is clean (we were the only table) but behind the window where the ingredients are seems dirty. We won't go back. Sorry."}
{"text":"First time to this establishment, party of 4 and we each tried something different but all agreed it was good. Stuck to their basic menu items, next time we all decided we would be more adventurous and mix it up a bit.  The amount of food you get is deceptive. At first I thought it wasn't very much for the price but in the end I couldn't even finish my bowl. Ingredients were generous, fish was fresh tasting, the servers very helpful and the décor added to the experience.   We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place-its like a salad bar for sashimi,  You make your own bowl-choose greens or a carb, choose fish from a good selection and then a plethora of sauces and condiments.  Very fresh for sure.  Restaurant is green so very environmentally friendly too.  Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I had called between 7:30pm-8:00pm and no one answered the phone. I called 3 times, so that irritated me. I went the next day and the service was good and I enjoyed the selection, but I was really disappointed in the quality of the fish. I didn't enjoy the taste at all, I threw it out"}
{"text":"Looooove this place, service was awesome and friendly. Coming back here whenever I visit Vegas again!"}
{"text":"My first time going there and it will be my last. The service was horrible. The guy behind the counter just looked at me and didn't say anything. Even after mentioning it was my first time there. I later went on to creating my bowl. I chose the ahi tuna as my protein, it was the worst quality of fish I have tasted in a while. I took two bites of my bowl and could not eat anymore. The fish was so bland. The bowl it self had no flavor. Overall the experience was tasteless. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick and healthy meal. I had a tuna bowl and the fish was fresh and delicious. I will definitely be coming here a lot to eat."}
{"text":"Hands down best poke place in town! I like that it's a build your own! I'm so addicted to this place. They give you a lot of fish in the 12oz. I'm not sure what everyone else is complaining about? Maybe it was an older server who didn't give a lot. I've tried so many places on eastern, but all the other ones charge extra for items. I will remain a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best finds in a long time Gus is awesome only paled by the freshness of the fabulous food served dust off all those old sushi style restaurants and give this a try"}
{"text":"My new favorite place!!! Such good fish and sauces and toppings. Such a great idea for a restaurant. The employees are nice too. I've had the spicy tuna and salmon once with mixed greens and once with rice and both times it was amazing."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Very clean and service staff was great. Ordered a large and was still hungry. Very small portions of fish. They have a great selection of veggies, wakame, mango, pineapple and much more but very tiny portions. It is supposed to be unlimited but It was uncomfortable to keep asking to add more.  They were very nice but they could have been a little more generous with portion size. The large bowl was mostly rice. The sauces are amazing. I tried the ponzu, spicy garlic and siracha mayo.  They should bottle it and sell them. Overall great concept but pricy for what you get"}
{"text":"What a great place! Fish was really fresh and tasted really good. My and brother liked this place very much. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"After work me and my bf decided to go get poke. We were really looking forward to eating here reading all the good reviews. We went in hinting, it out first time there guy is literally looking at us not giving us time to order. So we just pick something of the menu. The guy prep our bowl then he hands it off to another employee to add the final ingredients. The girl there is reading the ingredients off the menu and and am pretty sure she did not even get it right. The smell of the tuna was strong and the taste even worse. It did not even have any mayo sauce like the menu said. So basically we took two bites and left. Waste of $23.00."}
{"text":"Having spent a good bit of time in HI and a huge fan of poke I've tried almost every spot in Vegas and this place easily takes the cake! Freshest fish and ingredients with great service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, so much so that I'm Yelping about it while I'm still eating my poke bowl. I did a build-your-own-bowl with 1/2 noodles, 1/2 brown rice for my base. For seafood choice, I picked 1/2 spicy tuna and 1/2 octopus. Drizzled with sriracha mayo and Soul Sauce (spicy garlic) and a variety of toppings....so ono. Everything was fresh and of high quality.  Staff provided good service and was friendly enough. I didn't interact enough with them to determine if it was exceptional service.  Place has limited seating and there were no tables available when I was there, which bummed me out cause that just meant I had to drive home and wait to eat my poke bowl, but so worth it. I foresee a lot of Soulfish Poke in my life."}
{"text":"Just smashed a super delicious ahi bowl at this brand new healthy eating joint. I love how fresh the ingredients are at Soulfish. You can't find a better mix of good-for-you and omg-give-me-more."}
{"text":"Fresh new concept a whole different twist on sushi lots of choices and options,could find myself eating here weekly"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service. I waited for someone to help me for almost 10 minutes before I started yelling for help. Truly unbelievable."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to agree with Sarah. I was ecstatic to see Vegas had finally caught onto the pokè bowl train but it seems they've come up really short. Fish quality was subpar, and they were out of shrimp. They didn't add enough sauce  and they were out of 3 of the toppings I wanted. I could understand if they were busy but it seemed pretty dead."}
{"text":"I understand that this place is new, but boy do they need to get it together! First off, they didn't have an open or close sign so I was hesitant to get out of my car at first, but then I decided to go pull on their door to find out they were indeed opened. My first steps into the restaurant were pretty awkward, there was no one working behind the counter and after a while, someone who seems to be the owner or manager, finally came over and helped me. Eventually the workers came out and help me. But to make things awkward again, the owner or manager stood there yelling at the worker the whole time....I just don't understand why can't they do that behind closed doors or at least after the customer leaves.  Customer service aside, the food here is not worth it. The poke bowls can either be preset or create your own. They offer fresh toppings to go with your poke and that's pretty great. What's not the greatest is the quality of the fish, which is the most important component of the poke bowl. In addition to that, they are stingy with their portion. Their small, medium and large all seem to be the same amount regardless of what they say, it's made in the same size bowl. It's definitely a place that great for a grab and go poke, but if you're looking for a quality and authentic poke, I'd try somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is really excellent. I had only tried poke twice before & I have to tell you that the quantity & quality of fish that they give you here is exceptional. I had a medium Passion Soul Bowl with both ahi poke & salmon & it was so flavorful, fresh & delicious. The interior of the restaurant is cute & clean & the workers are super friendly & helpful. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is so promising.. but. Pros: Fish is actually fresh and delicious, and I chose to make my own bowl and toppings. I know what I like so my bowl was great, but my friend got one of their preset bowls and she didn't like it at all. Hmm.  Cons: Too expensive and portions are small. Quite stingy with the fish. I'm a little uncomfortable with the fish just sitting out in containers like that without even a lid or ice.  The guy serving us didn't have gloves on and just didn't seem hygienic. I mean this is raw fish, you want to have the upmost cleanliness or my appetite is out the door!  Side note. One of their bowls is called the Buddha Bowl. Really? If you're trying to be hip and cool, then name it the Namaste Bowl or whatever. I thought it was quite offensive to reduce Buddha to a menu item."}
{"text":"Very casual ambiance. Selective choices much like a buffet form of your own build it yourself poke bowl. The quality of the bowls were fresh and the staff was very helpful if this is your first time. The portions don't live up to the price however. So be cautious and make sure you order the exact value to your bowl. The location is convenient but of most of the selection, poke was more of the delicious choice if you're into fresh fish."}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for a new poke place, I was excited to try Soulfish Poke. Pros: good fish options & topping options, generous fish portions, very friendly staff, cute interior. Cons: out of white rice and the brown rice was dry, the AC was on but barely, & it is a little on the pricey side (about $3 more than my usual Ahi Poke Bowl at Island Sushi). Overall, it was yummy (esp the Buddha Bowl) and I'd be willing try it again, tho I might get it to go."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever having a Poke bowl... And I was blown away by how fresh, and delicious it was. I was very hesitant to try it out... I'm very picky about the fish that I eat (it has to be SUPER fresh) and this place did not disappoint! I got an Ahi bowl, with brown rice- and too many toppings to name. If I would have closed my eyes, I would have thought I was sitting by the ocean In Maui, eating Ahi that was caught that day- it was so amazing. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a surprise. This small fast food restaurant provided the perfect meal. I never went to a poke restaurant and now wish these were in every city. I order the Passion bowl with mixed green and quinoa base, ahi, avocado, and mango. The dish tasted amazing and was filled me up for the day. If I could eat here everyday, I would."}
{"text":"I really hope this place does well! It just opened last week and I noticed it on IG and stalked it for my trip home to Vegas ... It's Henderson location isn't close to where I stay but Soulfish was well worth the drive . I decided to create on my own bowl but they do have Soul bowls which are \"house faves\".  Being my first time there I had a ton of questions and they were super patient and helpful.  I had the small bowl which is 2 scoops of fish , tako and ahi tuna , then picked extras like grains and veggies, sauce etc. My bowl was fresh and made with care ! It was just the right amount of food post workout and I feel the price was just right.  I had to pay a lil extra for the octopus but I understand some fish is more than others, didn't bother me .  Great job y'all!"}
{"text":"This is a great concept with a unique take on poke.  I got a couple scoops of the ahi, which was more than enough with their soulfish sauce and so many toppings I can't recall.  I left feeling full but great.  It's very healthy and the staff was wonderfully helpful."}
{"text":"Drove here because website says open till 9pm, got here at 8:35 and they are closed.  Sign on door says open till 9pm 7 days a week, this must be the 8th day.  Bad decision, change your hours if Sundays are slow."}
{"text":"We only went here because we had a groupon and unsure if I want to return back.  I've not had something like this before. More just something like poke that's already made like at poke express where the flavors were all there in the seafood.   I was confused on how it worked to make a bowl, but the nice girl explained it to me and we took 3 bowls back to our hotel to eat for later. I'm just not sure if if lacked flavor or maybe I made my own bowl wrong?  I tried for effort, but it's not my cup of tea and will stick to poke express for my poke."}
{"text":"Wife and I were really excited to try this new take on poké but we were sorely disappointed. First we were not greeted when we walked in. We notified the male individual behind the counter that we had a Groupon and he replied rudely that they did not accept it anymore due to some dispute. We asked when they stopped accepting Groupon he replied rudely again and sounded like he didn't exactly know when but just answered with \"like a week and a half ago.\" He also stated for us to \"call Groupon for a refund or whatever.\" Afterwards he didn't care to acknowledge if we still wanted to dine or not and no apologies were given about not accepting our Groupon."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for some food after a 9 hr day at work without food so I was super hungry. Soulfish is ANOTHER poke place to pop up in town like a \"cockaroaches\" as one of my friend says in the past year or so. Thought it was quite interesting after reading some reviews as they offer some different things that others don't typically offer.   Soulfish has a few \"preset\" menu items but of course has a \"artisanal build-a-bowl\" style.   (according to their menu on the web site) First Base - White rice, brown rice, quinoa, rice noodles (soba), and mixed greens.  Go Fish - Yellowfin (ahi tuna), Alaskan salmon, tofu, crab, shrimp (ceviche) Get Sauced - Sriracha mayo, honey mayo, wasabi lime aioli, orange citrus yuzu, sesame wasabi, sweet chili (gochujang), spicy garlic, and raspberry miso Top It Off - Nori, sesame seeds, wonton strips, wasabi peas, sea salt, avocado (+$1), seaweed salad (+$1), and tobiko (+$1),   (according to the menu in store on the wall) First Base - White rice, brown rice, soba noodles, kale, quinoa, mixed greens Go Fish - Yellowfin (ahi tuna), Alaska salmon, Octopus, Black tiger shrimp, scallops, tofu Mother Earth - Baby radish, bell peppers, carrots, bean sprouts, yellow onion, red onion, green onion, English cucumber, fresh ginger, pickled ginger, garlic, jalapeno, fresno peppers, wonton strips, kimchi, mango, dried seaweed, macadamia nuts, shaved almonds, crispy onions, avocado Get Sauced - Sweet chili, citrus ponzu, miso vinaigrette, teriyaki, wasabi cream, spicy garlic, sriracha mayo, herb horseradish mustard  quite the difference between the web site and in store menu  I ended up getting a large bowl with soba noodles, salmon, wasabi cream, red onions, avocado, tobiko, wonton strips  avocado they use was like mashed avocado, similar to guac. wonton strips I guess they were out? so they offered tempura crumbs or whatever it was called  The person who helped me seemed a bit impatient to let me pick toppings so I didn't get much. On the website, it had stated it was extra for avocado, seaweed salad, and tobiko but it does NOT state that on the menu in store.   I had read a tip on yelp stating how they automatically did the highest 20 something % tip or something so I paid close attention to that. It auto-selects the higher one, and I believe the lowest one was like 15 or 18%. It does have a selection to put other amount. In the end, after tip, it was almost $16. Ouch ?   The bowl itself wasn't that big. Smaller than normal amount of base than what im used to from like Jaburritos, or similar. The salmon amount was fairly decent as they put at least 3-4 scoops. As mentioned before, the guy who helped me seemed a bit impatient when I was picking toppings. He didn't put much of each of the toppings I had asked for. The wasabi cream sauce was a bit thick so was kind of hard to mix around. And it had no other flavor than mild wasabi. Kind of unexpected a bit. Usually wasabi sauces are a bit more flavorful. So overall, my bowl was a bit bland. You'd think id enjoy it more as i didnt eat for 9 hours... Pretty pricey for what I got too.   Overall, quite disappointed with this place. With the amount of places opening around, probably won't return to this location."}
{"text":"Great concept, build your own bowl, popular in CA.  But the seafood portion size needs to he increased if you want to be known as a poke place. Typically poke is served in larger amounts, not the 2 ounce size for a small that was explained to me. So I just added an extra protein. I get that you have the choice to choose from many flavorings/garnishes etc. But the focus should be the fish, the amount of it, and not the fluff that is added to it for the price.  Friend ordered a small and I ordered a medium. We both left hungry. Shouldn't be the case for Hawaiian style food.  Clean & cute place. Will come back, but would have to order extra food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been coming here since they opened. The staff is amazing and the food is outstanding but my low score is in regards to a particular visit. We went for dinner today and decided to dine in. The Owner or upper management of some sort was there speaking very disrespectfully to the manager of the store who had helped us. What bothered me about this interaction is that he insisted on having this conversation in the dining area where we're seated which was very uncomfortable.  All the while he was talking down to her and speaking to her in a demeaning way. I understand if you have issues to address within the establishment but it should've waited until we left or should've been taken in the back. I felt that the owners choice to have this conversation next to us meant he had no respect for his customers or employees. These two stars are not for the business or the staff but the lack of respect and courtesy by the owner or upper management (whoever they were) ."}
{"text":"The food does not justify the price. Neither did waiting 20 min waiting for someone from the back to come and notice me.  They don't refill their utensils, don't really clean their tables and overall probably don't care about their business based on my experience.  I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Nov 10.  Since there is alot of these poke places opening up, i am rating this place base off of all the places i've tried so far.    I definitely will not visit again -9500 S. Eastern Ave Suite 110 Henderson, NV 89123.  I rather go 'Island Grill Sushi' next door.  (da original for Las Vegas).  The guy that served us appeared to be lost.  And the girl was dress more appropriate to serve us than he did.  He couldnt wait to leave for the day apparently.  Artisanal Bowl Large (12.50) - The salmon was fresh, the brown rice was hard.  Bottle water (2.00)  Lunch $14.50 one person, + tax, not worth the price.  Price of the bowl was OVERPRICED.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Stopped in a couple of weeks ago on a rainy Saturday night. Only 2 others in the venue. Process for ordering is simple. Like that they have 6 or so \"pre formulated\" bowls so for a newbie you don't have to create your own combination. Opted for one of those (forget the name now). I added extra veggies to it as well. Loved that you can do that w/o an additional charge. Liked the different options for the base as it isn't only rice. Opted for the Quinoa. Only a couple of hiccups in that they ran out of their bowls & ours had to be put into tall containers that were extremely hard to mix the items up to infuse the flavors. The person that made our bowls saw that I have having a difficult time & brought me out a hard plastic bowl to use which made it way easier to eat. Also would have liked salt packets to add a bit of salt to make the flavors really pop. Also liked that you could try the sauces on the side as I ended up trying 4 of them. I'll be back."}
{"text":"A friend of mine invited me to lunch and introduced Soulfish Poke. It's like a cross between Chipotle meets poke. The concept is where you design your own poke bowl. All the ingredients are fresh and you build your bowl just the way you want it. I got the Buddha Bowl which is basically spicy ahi tuna. You choose your base rice, brown rice, sobe noodles, etc. then you add toppings and sauces all for one price. So if your bowl doesn't taste good, its your fault. The only thing I wished they had was a fountain drink with ice tea. Definitely be back with my co-workers and friends. Love poke? Got to try this place on Eastern near Serene."}
{"text":"Disappointed they 86'd the soba noodles and replaced it with the thicker rice noodles because it's gluten free?  Why not have both? Soba is the healthier alternative. Lower sugar content compared  to starchy white rice noodles  Seriously this GF trend is out of hand.  They got rid of other toppings as well. Thing is their signage posted  on wall and on their website has not changed. So not sure if the employees there are feeding me BS.  If I had known, I would've steered my friends to another place. I was primarily there cause I wanted soba noodles for my base. Consumers be warned."}
{"text":"Came here when they first opened and used a groupon and it was just ok. Came a couple of other times without a groupon and felt the price isn't worth paying for the amount you get (they make you pay extra for poke bowl basics-i.e. Seaweed salad and masago). Also, the fish doesn't taste as fresh as other \"poke\" places. I would make the drive to To See Roll on Rainbow. Trust me!"}
{"text":"I cannot wait until they open their two other forthcoming locations- this poke place is pretty far from me, so I have to settle for weekly visits. Prices are good, fish is fresh, and everything is customizable, so it can be as healthy or indulgent as you want.  The menu has a handful of set bowls (Passion and Buddha bowl options are solid- $11/ea), or the option to DIY- my preference being greens and quinoa as my base, with a mix of ahi and salmon for my protein, and I mix up my add-ons but always include avocado (no extra charge!). The spicy garlic sauce is a bright green color but doesn't have a wasabi flavor, thankfully.  If I could make one suggestion, it would be to reorder the line so that you select your fish and it is mixed with the sauces and veggies (onion, cucumber, etc)  to marinate for a minute while the base bowl is being assembled. I've had better flavor with places in CA that do it this way, such as Poke Bowl in San Jose. For now, I just ask for extra soy sauce to add, as the bowls can be a bit dry.   Service is fairly good- if you're with a group, keep an eye on your bowl so it doesn't get mixed up with someone else's by accident. The medium size is $10 and the perfect portion. Location is in the same plaza as Crepe Expectations and Gluten Zero bakery, signage can be a bit difficult to spot from the street."}
{"text":"This place is a waste of money and time.   Came here once for lunch after my yoga practice and never again. I asked the employee if I should get the small or medium poke bowl , he told me if I'm not super hungry but want something to fill me up- get the small , but if I'm really hungry- get the medium. The sizes (small , medium , large) is according to how many scoops of protein so a small is one scoop and medium is two scoops of fish.   I was pretty hungry and I love poke a lot so I chose the medium. I agree with other reviewers that they DO skimp on the fish and toppings. The guy literally gave me like less than ten pieces of ahi tuna. I don't understand how is that medium size , it was more like extra small to me. The fish quality isn't as good compared to Island Flavor down the street or Soho SushiBurrito on Sahara/I-15. For toppings , I had to ask the guy three times for a decent amount of seaweed salad for my bowl.  The only things that they DON'T skimp on is the rice and sauces. I hate places like this where they give you mostly rice and drown it in sauce. When I finished all the small amount of ahi tuna the guy gave me , I had to throw the rest of my bowl away because I couldn't stand just eating rice drenched in sauce. Forgot to mention when I was paying at the cash register , the employee told me \"feel free to ask for any more sauce , there's no extra charge on sauce.\" Why would I want more sauce if you filled my whole bowl with mostly rice and sauce ??  An hour after my meal , I'm still hungry and spent over 10$ + tax for a meal that left me dissatisfied and ended up eating more food anyways when I got home. And I'm tiny I don't know how a medium or even a large can even satisfy the average person. Didn't even take a photo of my poke bowl to post on here because it wouldn't look good on my Yelp account aesthetic. Friendly service , but the food portion and price you pay is definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Great new poke joint in the neighborhood. I've been in twice already and have had an exceptional experience both visits. The employees are friendly and helpful in navigating the \"build your own bowl\" concept of their menu. If you're looking for healthy and fresh fish options, I recommend stopping into Soulfish; it's especially refreshing for lunch during the hot Vegas summer days."}
{"text":"Clean, fresh, a lot of choices for add ins  simply irresistible and what a good deal."}
{"text":"Fresh fish driven in from Santa Monica every day, amazing friendly people. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I love poke and have been waiting for a place like this. Finally we have a healthy poke spot that's quick and easy. I read about the smaller portions but they just raised the protein portions so now the bowls are very filling! I'll be back everyday!"}
{"text":"Well the food filled me up and didn't kill me, but that's about it. I wanted to like this place, but I just can't, not with so many better options around. The fish is fresh but I think it must have been previously frozen or something, I mean all fish here is sent frozen to some degree but this was...let's say not sushi grade. The sauce and toppings were okay, but nothing to write home about. Portions were good! Drink selection is abysmal, they had Diet Coke...that was it on this particular day, well, other than tap water. I would suggest another stop, I gave it three stars for the friendly staff and portions but I wouldn't waste a meal here."}
{"text":"Seriously the best poke I've ever had! Such an amazing, healthy and affordable option for lunch. Very impressed. I would literally eat here everyday"}
{"text":"Such an amazing concept! Tasty and super fresh. Only thing I had a problem with was the portion of the fish servings.I got a medium and counted I had 7 pieces of fish. Still debating if my $10 was well spent."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here.  The first time I shared a passion poke bowl, and the second time the zen.  Couldn't help but feel that it was missing something when you take a bite into it.  I like the concept and think it's great where you can add on what you want to it, but something is missing.  When you order the bowl, they place all the ingredients on top of the rice and serv it that way.  The fish is not marinated in anything or mixed in anything.  It might be my taste that's used to the traditional taste of poke, but I found myself just eating it to eat it.  I will come back to try the zen bowl again but try something different with it - ask for a separate bowl with the poke and ingredients and mix it all up before putting it on top of the rice.  I think by doing that, you'll get a better poke taste."}
{"text":"Not very impressed with how this place turned out. Thought I give it a try after seeing a top 20 places to eat off Facebook. don't get me wrong food is okay but I feel some of the vegetables were chopped very unevenly had some big chunks of fish, cucumbers, red onions and very small ones. Service was very up front and friendly don't hesitate to ask for suggestions."}
{"text":"I left this place disappointed overall. Even though I ordered the large size, the portion was so incredibly tiny. They filled up my plastic bowl only about half way, and the majority of it was just rice. It was very plain with not much flavor.   For the price I paid here at Soulfish Poke, I could have just gone to Poke Express right down the street, and bought 1.5 POUNDS of pure poke, then just came home and dumped it on some brown rice and a few shreds of red onion, and it would have tasted the same. Well actually, it would have tasted much better, since the Poke at Poke Express is delicious and flavorful with real poke sauces.   We left still feeling hungry, and ended up needing to cook another meal at home."}
{"text":"I'm so completely obsessed with this place. I usually eat here at least once a week, depending on when I work my 2nd job.  The bowls are amazing, the 8 oz portion is perfect size, whereas other places have \"small, medium, large\" and don't always live up to those sizes.  The topping and sauce options are great and this place is always superrrr clean. I even have a couple stamp cards :). My only negative comment is that they don't have more locations! I live all the way in summerlin which is why I don't eat here more often, coming to eastern and 215 is a trek! But I still always come once a week :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed that this place that calls itself a \"poké\" joint... THIS IS NOT POKÉ ! First of a there is not accent on the \"e\" so this place is called Soulfish Poke ()  I ordered an 8 oz bowl of their spicy ahi and couldn't even finish the bowl because of how it tasted, mind you I spent nearly $13. It is not authentic in taste or presentation. The fish is not marinated like it should be and the additions of what's in it does not complement the fish.. the sauces to choose from were more of fusion Japanese flavors.. I understand doing fusion but if you going to do it, do it right. They didn't even have the traditional Hawaiian style sauce. This place is like a chipotle but with a fish substitution.  I definitely see the potential of this place and location. But feel that the foundation of their menu could have been better executed. They should've put a \"local\" person from the island to show them how to properly prep and make poké. You can reach out to me and I'll show you how I prep my poké!   Overall,  the staff was friendly but the food was beyond disappointing and it ultimately left me with a bad taste in my mouth.   If you want good poké head to Pa'ina Cafe or Poké Express!"}
{"text":"Great place. Angelo and Joseph are very helpful and provided exceptional service. Food is amazing and ill definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been here twice and every time I loved the freshness of their fish. Their specialty soul sauce is a must try if you like garlic. If not, their citrus ponzu sauce is good as well. This place barely opened so there are still some fine tuning that needs to be done in terms of customer service etc. but over all this will be a go to place for me and my friends and family."}
{"text":"Out of dozens of poke places, this one has the nicest interior. Unfortunately the manager behind the counter was unfriendly and unhelpful. There was only one customer behind me but she kept rushing me and actually apologized to the customer behind me. I don't think you can make a bowl smaller than that - it's sample size! Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Delicious! The only poké place I've been to thy has pineapple and mango which changes the game! The guy serving us is as funny and hooked it up with the fish!"}
{"text":"Very good fresh fish. Good to keep on a protein based diet. Fish isn't overly (at all) marinated, but the sauces and add ins are plentiful. They have everything from rice, to quinoa to mixed greens. Kimchi, seaweed, ponzu, siracha, pretty much everything you could want.  The ordering process could be made a little more explanatory - but it's basically like chipotle. Pick a base, then a protein, then your toppings. It comes in small, medium and large. $8.50-$11.50 Definitely different poke than Island Sushi one parking lot North - less overwhelming marinade, more fresh tasting.   A Medium bowl was plenty of food for me for dinner and I thought it was really tasty. Good music, decor and friendly guys behind the counter - and those are all must haves for me in addition to the food."}
{"text":"Anytime say the word \"Poke\" feel like kid in candy store. It one of my favorite foods growing up in the 808. Vegas being known as the ninth island not only Poke but local food scene blown up over the years. Some good some not so good. I would place Soulfish Poke somewhere in the middle. Things that I like about the concept at Soulfish Poke then there other things that truly not fan. The Poke just by itself just ok. I feel like the freshness not there compare too other Poke places around town. The cuts of the Poke can vary but I feel more like tartare style small diced pieces. Poke in my mind always been nice square pieces of tuna and not with lot of sinew. The Poke is definitely not traditional 808 style. The bowls come in three different sizes with each one having different amount of fish. I notice they never weighted it just scooped it out. Not sure if getting right amount or maybe get extra with heavy hand.   I do like the fact that you can make up your own combination of toppings or pick from one of the set bowls. I went with one of the menu bowls \"The Passion\". All the toppings tasted nice refreshing and looked great the way it was displayed can see your options. I added kim chi. I guess if order any pre set bowls can add more toppings on no charge. The kim chi was just ok. I like the option of having soba noodles as carb then just your normal white or brown rice. They are pretty open if feel want more of one thing while they assemble your bowl. The lady did my bowl asked if there was enough soba noodles in my bowl. The Passion bowl looks awesome. It has lot of different textures, flavors, and very eye appealing. Overall with everything it was good. Nothing to rave about.   The interior decor fan of for sure! I like the different artwork. The Poke definition sign and the fact they go green with different trash one of plastic/regular trash. The display two different rows set up great! One that can see them put your bowl together whether preset or your own artwork. The workers are awesome. It was my first time she explained the whole concept, friendly, and lot of aloha.   Soulfish Poke place that would come back if in the area. Truth if looking for great Poke it falls short to the competition. It does offer someone diversity more then normal Poke bowl."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while now and I'm so glad I did! I built my own bowl with the rice noodles, seaweed, carrots, avocado, teriyaki sauce and yellowfin and it was delicious. I think next time I'll try it with quinoa or white rice though to mix up the textures. Overall I'm really happy with my experience, and the staff was so friendly. I'll be coming back forsure"}
{"text":"Postmated this place. The worst Poke bowl I've ever had. Rice is super dry and HARD, salmon is cut up in small tiny pieces, and apparently what I paid for is the large size. Seasoning from the sauce isn't enough or something. Not flavorful at all. Never again."}
{"text":"I came here TWICE and they weren't open when the hours said the should be. GET IT TOGETHER PEOPLE!!!  Excited for DIY Poki to be opening on Eastern and Horizon Ridge soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!  The staff is super friendly, the fish is really fresh, and all of the flavors are perfect. We have no complaints at all and will be back at least once a week.  They make their poke exactly the way I like it.  Just the right amount of seasoning and sauce and I love the warm rice with the cold fish."}
{"text":"I was very excited to eat here but turned out to be extremely disappointed. The portion sizes were so small for the amount of money you had to pay. The food tasted fine, but I prefer to not finish my meal after two bites. Would definitely consider returning if the serving sizes changed."}
{"text":"Coming in, we were greeted by Chef Guss and his big, friendly personality. He was very helpful about the process of customizing your bowl to your liking or choosing a preset bowl setting.  The restaurant has a cute vibe to it, the price is reasonable, and the food is tasty."}
{"text":"Loving the concept of creating your own bowl. They have a lot of topping choices. I wish they had masago to go with their spicy mayo.   Gotta give this place another try and next time we gotta eat our bowls right away at the restaurant. We brought it home and by the time we ate them, the warm rice already made the raw fish too warm. The texture of the warm raw fish was making me so grossed out ahhh."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Delicious and fresh.  I love this place -- and can definitely see how people can get addicted tot his fresh lifestyle.  Whether you choose the menu bowls or create your own : it's just so enjoyable."}
{"text":"First all of the good: The place is clean. The people are nice. The effort to create something healthy is a plus. Now the reality. This is not a poké restaurant.  Poke is not fish on rice or noodles in a bowl. Poke is creations of chopped raw tuna, salmon ect.  This interpretation is costly. Six ounces of fish that was frozen in a bowl for 8.50 is expensive. To have two portions of fish is 4.00 more. When they say you get to pick your ingredients, you do but they portion it. The day I went they did not have a few things. I'm not sold on this concept. I'll keep going down the street to Poké Express."}
{"text":"My 3rd time here already, since i had purchased the groupon deal. which wasnt bad. I would recommend this place, only if you're into the whole poke thing and raw fish. The brown rice is really good, it cooked just right!   Staff are great and the cleanliness of the restuarant is good!"}
{"text":"One of  best poke place I've been to in las vegas so far. You get a lot of fish and unlimited toppings. I love this place and the people were so incredibly friendly"}
{"text":"For the first time in my life I was given TOO much poke.  I'm usually always whining about how poke places are so tight with their portion sizes and how I want more, well at this place you definitely get it.  Both my boyfriend and I were unable to finish our bowls and we aren't modest eaters by any means.  I really appreciate the green environment, I wish there was a trash can to scrape my leftovers into, I kinda felt like a bitch throwing it in the recyclable can...unless there is and I am a bitch and totally didn't see it.  The chef was up front training a girl and he was super excited, it was a little much for us but we were also coming from a three hour zipline in Boulder City and just wanted to be given our food and eat not really talked to.  The food was great, the atmosphere was awesome, it's not in our area but if we are around we would eat here again. Maybe split a bowl lol."}
{"text":"As far as customer service goes , they did a very good job at suggesting what's best and explaining the menu and how it works. The flavor was average , the salmon was good but the tuna did not taste fresh . The vegetables were roughly chopped and the large onion pieces took away from the flavors of the meal . Maybe I'll come back another day and try again ."}
{"text":"tldr  This is a chipotle style poke spot where you pick and choose what to add into your bowl. I came in during opening week and was impressed with the decor and overly friendly staff.  Got: -ahi tuna passion soul bowl: generous amount of poke and toppings, the set ingredients was a great combination.  Protip: don't be afraid to ask for more of anything if you feel it's not enough."}
{"text":"Super fresh fish! Passion bowl is amazing. I will eat here at least 4 times a week. Soul fish is perfect for anyone training and needing to eat super healthy and clean. The buckwheat soba noodles are so good. Highly recommend eating here. The staff are super friendly. Atmosphere is chill with great Hawaiian and reggae music!"}
{"text":"The rice noodle was hard and half cooked. The fish wasn't even sushi grade! I got sick after lunch and had a run for the whole night! BAD FOOD!"}
{"text":"Hmmm well went to try this place on a Monday, they were closed up 40 minutes before closing so I didn't get a chance to try it. The next night, I went in again to try it. Sutra is one of their main options which is a shrimp ceviche bowl. She told me they had 86d shrimp because they had a slow week the week before so she didn't order it. I looked at the cut up ahi and it was really fatty looking. Anyways, food may be good but I haven't had any. Never had such a hard time giving my money away."}
{"text":"Since I am trying to cut carbs I love that 5hey offer quinoa. I'm not a Poke expert so I am not going to make any comments to the authenticity of Soulfish's poke. I have been here twice and I found them to be helpful in creating my bowls sorry I was eating while writing this so.. No photos of my good. But I will post a few of the interior."}
{"text":"Have been twice. Once at 4 in a sunday and 1:30 on a saturday. BOTH visits: no soba noodles and no quinoa. Even if you choose greens, still $12/bowl.  The menu is posted on the wall - and both times, the employees had to continually reference the menu for what to put in the bowls we ordered. (We chose from the pre-set bowls, instead of make your own combination).  The guy making our bowls, was yelled out by the \"chef\" or lady in a chefs coat - says he put too much rice in one of our 4 bowls, that the door was open too long at 10 am. Super professional. Restaurant is very tidy...but they are big on \"recycling\" but use non recycled napkins, disposable chop stick for dine-in and the throw away bowls for dine in. The togo containers are also not eco friendly.  Lots of room for improvement!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loving the customization of the poke bowls here and I LOVE the fact that it's healthy and tasty.... I hate eating healthy too lol. Must try"}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelorette night to grab a bite and this place was reasonable tasty. The selections were limited (no salmon or octopus), so I resorted to yellowtail. The maneuvering of the menu is strange - you pick fish, base, and can do toppings. For some people who are unfamiliar with the ordering style, the staff didn't really help much with how to order - one of the gals I was with ordered the fish and base, but since she didn't say anything about toppings, she had no toppings!  The one strange thing I saw here was rice noodles were an option (you can also choose brown rice, veggies, or white rice). It seemed strange to me, but when in Vegas!  Condiments are limited and you must ask - staff seemed to not be enjoying their shift because it felt like a sink or swim scenario for ordering - you either knew what you wanted and ordered like a bullet, or you were forced out quickly."}
{"text":"This was my first Poké experience and it was absolute fantastic!  I got the zen bowl and it was delish.  Friendly staff and extremely clean environment.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not good there's only 1 guy that works there it's a lil weird the portions are small The avocado is never fresh there's other options to go to the location is great but I think they will be more poke   places that are better"}
{"text":"Great portions of fish for the price. Vegetables and sides are always fresh-tasting and the employees are always helpful and courteous. Place is clean and colorful. Great lunch spot if you want to eat something lighter."}
{"text":"Poke craze is expanding!  4.5 **** for my review. This one is located in the Park Plaza off Eastern.  In my searching, I didn't find too many poke spots here in LV.  This place just opened a few weeks ago from 5/22/16.  Two more will be opening in SW area per the owner.  Yay points!  A medium bowl for $10.  Scoops are determined as  8 oz. So I got yellowtail, salmon, scallops with cucumbers, mango (yes fruit), baby radish (didn't know these bite your tongue), crunchy onions -  atop salad with wasabi cream dressing!  Mmmmm yes happy taste buds  :-)  Well four ingredients I didn't expect to go perfect together even if it contained just these:  - scallops  - cucumber  - mango  - cilantro How? This is what was left in my bowl towards the end of being a poke face.  What's it like in here? The tall tables are in the back on the left. Nice dining area set up, especially the wood piece walls. Oh yeah the restaurant aired music.  Though I didn't notice a soda fountain dispenser, they have cold bottled Iced Teas water and Coke.  Less half a point for minimal  selections.  May I suggest a drink fountain dispenser with green teas and green tea fusions (like with mango or peach or raspberry flavors)?  To match the meal...  And the lady who was helping me (I wish I got her name) is super friendly!  And you know I'll be back! I'm excited for the other locations to open too!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's like subway for sushi but a zillion times better! Totally my go to place for nights I get to eat home alone. They were super nice and accommodating too with helping me discover my perfect bowl!"}
{"text":"fresh and delicious!  Definitely a spot to get a fix for something light and refreshing!"}
{"text":"I live in LA...home of the \"poke tuna jump off\" & I've had some great experiences. When I was in Vegas for the Cosmoprof Beauty Convention & heard there was a poke spot that recently opened not too far from the strip, I HAD to check it out! I'm kind of addicted....it's healthy AND delish!    I wasn't sure what to expect, but the moment I walked up, I could tell, this place was cool & had a very LA/zen vibe to it! And when I walked in, I was disappointed!  That Zen vibe continues through out the small, but hip restaurant. The menu is written quite clearly up on boards behind the counter. They have \"set\" menus, but if you're feeling adventurous, you can go ahead & make your own bowl!  The staff is accommodating, helpful, & knowledgable!  I decided to go with the Passion Bowl, which happens to be the most ordered, & after one bite, I know why!!!  Scrumptious!!!   As I was eating, a gentleman came over to ask if everything was ok, & I told him I'd eaten at most of the poke spots in LA, but Soul Fish was my new favorite!  Too bad I don't live here! Lol!  It turned out that this was the owner, Mike Malin, famous for such Hollywood hot spots as Dolce, Geisha House, & Ketchup!  Now it all made sense...of course everything was meticulous & perfect!  Mike brought all his knowledge, aptitude for perfection, & stellar reputation to Vegas to create the supreme poke tuna bar!  I will, no doubt, be returning...& the next time, I'm going to take a ride on the wild side & make up my own bowl!!! If you live in Vegas, do yourself a favor, & head on over. If you're heading to Vegas for a quick trip, make time to hit up Soul Fish...you won't be disappointed!!! #truth"}
{"text":"I noticed this place after going to Taco y taco several times. I finally stopped by a few days ago to pick up dinner and it was a pretty good experience.   They offer a poke bowl with 3 types of fish for $13, which is a bit on the expensive side. I chose the yellow tail, spicy tuna, and salmon for both bowls. I asked for the ponzu sauce, wasabi sauce, and the garlic sauce on top.   Overall, the fish quality was pretty good. They also offer a pretty wide variety of toppings. One bowl was white rice (gf's bowl) and the other bowl was brown rice. The rice was not too hard so that was good. The only gripe I have is that the sauces were a bit on the plain side. Maybe I just chose the wrong combination of sauces... I will try the other sauces to see if I can get a bit more flavor on my next visit."}
{"text":"Custom make your poke bowl with a wide assortment of sauces and toppings. Choose as many toppings as you like. Fish is fresh and cut in big pieces, get the large bowl for more fish/seafood."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise  Fresh and healthy choice with an amazing flavor!!!  The staff was fun and very helpful"}
{"text":"Worst poke place I have ever tried in the Valley..  most expensive for the least amount of food. Try Sweet Poke across the way in the Walmart shopping center if you don't want to go too far. You get double the amount, and it's more flavorful. Trust me on this YELPERS, I am a poke addict and this is just a no-no."}
{"text":"Ordered with a delivery app on December 11th. The bowl was tiny, barely any mixed greens. They need bigger to go boxes to fit the food, or don't offer to go in a large size. Very disappointed with the portion.   I had asked for the sauces on the side but received it on the bowl, which ended up being soggy and gross by the time the food got to me. Inconsiderate.   Also, I asked for onions thinking it's green onions as other places (was not specified). Nope. Got some nice chunks of yellow onion.  Not a happy cust Will not try this place again."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! Everything is fresh and made to order. A lot of tasty options and just something different than you regular lunch - choose rice or a salad, fish, sauce, and condiments. They modify your order, so I had no problem fitting it in my diet. Great option for all watching their macros."}
{"text":"Average. Came here with my bro for the first time and ordered the passion bowl. Rice and seasoning was good, however was not overly impressed with the quality of tuna. Three stars."}
{"text":"Well I had gone back here a few times and I'm not surprised they closed, start removing items from the menu and jacking up the prices and the service started to be surprisingly odd, not only did I have to wait for 3 to 5 minutes before the one employee came to build my bowl and basically kept saying we are out of items, no loss there's three other sushi bowl/burrito places with in a mile radius"}
{"text":"My girlfriend picked up a poke bowl for me and it was the worst poke bowls I've ever had plus it's overpriced for the small amount of poke that they give you. I also have no idea why they put so much ginger in their poke. All you can taste is ginger which overpowers everything else. Fans of real Hawaiian style poke go elsewhere if you want real and better tasting poke."}
{"text":"I have never had poke before but heard great things about it as a more cost effective way to get my sushi fix. Soul Fish Poke definitely fulfilled my expectations. I tried the Passion Soul Bowl and it was delicious. Great food and great service too"}
{"text":"This place is great! I love the variety in toppings and sauces. I work in this plaza and am constantly craving it. The fish is delicious and fresh and I love that they let you put as many toppings as you want. (I love toppings on my poke) I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Service was good but slow.  I think it's because the staff has to meticulously add the protein, and other toppings to your bowl.  But, the review is for the food and the raw fish is not of good quality.  My hubby got the salmon and I went with the ahi tuna and both were kind of chewy.  Chewing chewy pieces of fish is a turn off for me.   We took it to-go and only at home was when we realize there wasn't enough sauce.  Eh, hubby added sriracha to his bowl and call it done.    Concept is good, but the quality of the fish needs to be upped."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far, had good experience on both visits. The first time I was here I told the guy over the counter that it was my first time here and he patiently explained to me how it works.  1. Choose your base; white rice, brown rice, quinoa, soba noodles or green salad. 2. Choose your protein; tuna, salmon, scallops, octopus or shrimp 3. Choose your sauce; I think there are 6-8 options, I don't remember.  4. Get unlimited toppings like seaweed salad, onion, sliced jalapeno, mango, carrots, cucumber, avocado, etc  Good portion; I can share with my daughter when I order large"}
{"text":"Soulfish Poke is a Chipotle-style concept of food service, this time with a poke bowl. So as I was driving by in the center, I was intrigued and decided to check it out.   So I ordered a large \"Passion\" bowl (aka Ahi tuna with some stuff in it) along with a bottle of Coke. Cost me about $15. Was it good? Was it worth the cost?  Well, I really like the concept of the place, and the bowl that I had was good. But could it be better? Yes. For one, like another reviewer had posted, with a large bowl, I was still kind of hungry and was tempted to stop by Hot & Juicy Crawfish for something else. I would've expected a small order to leave me hungry and a large bowl to be just right. But no.  Another thing was that while it did taste good, I wish that there was a condiment island or something like that to add more Himalayan sea salt, Sriracha sauce, soy sauce, hot sauces, etc. just to add more flavor if desired.   It also would be nice if they had a few sides/appetizers to add on as well.....like maybe edamame, Kim chi or a kicked up miso soup? That would've made it feel more like a complete meal.   Yes, I know that they just opened up the joint a few days ago, so I'm hoping for the best and will check them out again later."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, generous portions, fresh, delicious, unlimited toppings. This was the perfect healthy lunch my husband and I were looking for while on vacation. Top notch place for sure!"}
{"text":"This is not traditional poke, but more a Chipotle-ized build-your-own take on poke. None of the fish is marinated, which can make for a bland bowl. The sauces that you can add are really what make this place good. The spicy garlic sauce is amazing, the portions are big and the fish is fresh. If you're in a pinch and can't make it to Poke Express on Stephanie, this is a quick, trend-ified alternative. Another plus: you can add lots of toppings for no additional charge."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4.5 stars.  Yo Yelp, let us give half stars already!!!!  I love poke, I always have.  I've been on the poke bandwagon for many many years, well before it became a trendy thing, and this is one of the better poke places I have ever been to.  The fish tastes fresh, as does their avocado, the assorted options for extras is outstanding, and the Soul Sauce (basically a garlic soy sauce with some kick) is amazing.  I have had several of their bowls, and the Buddha Bowl is my favorite, I just substitute the Soul Sauce in place of the Sriracha Mayo.  The Zen Bowl is also very outstanding if you are more in the mood for salmon instead of tuna.  The decor in the restaurant is simple but definitely fits the vibe they are going for.  The staff are always kind and respectful and very helpful.  The food is filling and delicious. clean and simple, and a good value for the price.  Come give Soulfish Poke a try, you will be glad that you did!"}
{"text":"Interior was nice and new. When you order your food, you walk down the line and pick what you want in your poke bowl (like chipotle style) They have a lot to choose from and I like that I can pick what I want. They also weight the poke, rice and noodles on a scale. I got 3 large bowls: 2 with soba noodles and 1 with rice. My bf and sister did not like the soba noodles. They said it was bland. The portions are small and by the end of the meal all of us was still hungry."}
{"text":"It's no secret that I love sushi and poke. Growing up in Hawaii, how could you not? When I heard there was a new poke joint in town, I knew I had to try it! Soulfish Poke is now serving up fresh and healthy made-to-order poke bowls here in the Vegas valley.   It's a fast/casual Chipotle-esque type of establishment but instead of choosing your meat, you choose your type of raw fish.  For the menu, you can either choose a 'Soul Bowl' which is their preset combination bowls or you can create you own! If you decide to do the latter, you start with your base (white or brown rice, quinoa, kale, greens or soba noodles) and add in your raw fish of choice (yellowfin tuna, octopus, scallops, shrimp, salmon or tofu).  Next up is your pick of toppings to mix in with sauces until your heart and stomach are content. (I was pretty bummed they did not have avocados during my visit, but will chalk it up to first day jitters.)   Soulfish Poke does deliver on the fresh and healthy front that they are touting. The portion size was good and the fish was plentiful. A little bummed there were no avocados or wonton strips in sight. Maybe next time!  However, nothing will ever be able to beat real poke bowls at home in Hawaii! (Some might even say that the way these mainland poke places are making poke bowls are sacrilegious.)"}
{"text":"Love this place!   I come here every Friday to celebrate the end of my week and it's such an amazing start to my weekend. The service is great and the employees are very friendly.   I always get a build a bowl because I prefer my creation and they're very helpful with explaining everything. I make poke myself and I can definitely say that the quality is great and the fish are fresh.   Love the sauces! I always get the lemongrass wasabi, spicy garlic and the ponzu. Only thing I wish they had was the option to add masago because that would truly make my meal perfect!   Always looking forward to going back. Although I wish it wasn't so far away."}
{"text":"Cute little Poke bowl place.  The food was great and the fish seemed fresh.  We had salmon and crab bowls.  They have a lot of toppings and sauces to choose from also.  The girl that helped us was super nice and helped guide us as it was our first time.  The only issue was the rice seemed overcooked and clumpy.  I am not sure if that is an issue or if this was a one off thing.  Other than the rice, it was good.  My wife had the soba noodles instead of rice and she liked them,  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This was a tough review. Let's get the most important part out of the way - this is not a traditional poke place. Think of it as sort of a new age, Chipotle-style poke bowl spot with lots of customization options.  That said, I really like the concept. It's great being able to put in soba noodles as the carb base instead of rice, for example. They also have a huge variety of add-ons, from bean sprouts to carrots to ginger to jalapeños to macadamia nuts and almonds. There are a variety of sauces too, like their sriracha mayo that was pretty good. It really adds an extra dimension to be able to mix it up so much.  The problem though is that the portion sizes are just so, so small. We ordered two \"large\" bowls which basically came out to be $25 and for that money I would literally have gotten more fish at a sushi place. (Let's not even get into how that would buy us 2 *pounds* of poke at a typical poke spot in Hawaii.) Their pricing would be more defensible if they included more of the \"other\" stuff, but they don't either - I got one with salad base and one with soba noodles as well as a bunch of add-ons, and for $25 there wasn't even much of that stuff in there either. I don't judge on value alone in my reviews, but even for this type of poke bowl concept, I just don't think that pricing works for me.  I acknowledge that Soulfish is a new restaurant and I'm definitely going to keep an eye on reviews here and see if I want to try it again in the future, and hopefully I can update!"}
{"text":"I've been anxiously awaiting this place to open, and it didn't disappoint. I built my own ahi bowl, with staff suggestions. Great price point, solid serving sizes, and super fresh food. Pro tip - make sure and add the seaweed salad to your bowl, and don't be afraid to mix multiple sauces. This place will be my new go to for a healthy lunch."}
{"text":"The food was great. For someone from the Midwest I take every chance I can to get fresh Poke. This place didn't disappoint. They have a few out of the box choices to put in your bowl that I enjoyed.   Then highlight of the visit besides the food was meeting the owner. Boogie was a real down to earth guy. As a BB super fan this was a dream come true.   We will be back every time we come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! They have it set up where you can pick a bowl they have designed or you can make your own! It's like chipotle but for poke! They are all very nice and will let you try anything you'd like. They have a wonderful selection and everything tastes very fresh!! HIGHLY recommend"}
{"text":"Giving this place 3/5 because the staff was friendly, cool atmosphere, cool concept, and fish was very fresh, however, there were some things that were just so so or not as well done, so let's break this down.  Food: I ordered a large bowl with white rice and salmon, which is just an 8oz portion as opposed to a 4 or 6oz. I then topped it with green onion, bean sprouts, cucumber, avocado, and ponzu sauce. While everything was fresh and well done with lots of topping choices, I didn't like that the rice was so warm, bordering hot. When you eat sushi or poke the rice should be room temperature at most because hot rice with cold fish isn't a pleasant combination and can even start to cook the fish. Also, I got quite a few chunks of crunchy rice, the burnt bit that comes from the bottom of the rice cooker and I had to spit it out because it was so crunchy. I love sprouts of all kinds, but bean sprouts isn't the type you'd use for something like this, gobo would be the appropriate choice. I think if I did go back I'd also like to sample some of the other sauces before choosing, I went with ponzu because that's always a safe bet.   Pricing/location/atmosphere/staff: I got the large which was $11.50 for 8oz, which is roughly on point for market average, a little high, and the quality, and I felt like it was a good amount of fishplus you're getting to choose your own toppings. The actual atmosphere was cool, it had a very laid back vibe, and I appreciated the aesthetic. Location wise, it's in that very cramped shopping center that is saturated with food places and can sometimes be a pain in the ass to park at, but is easy to find the location itself. The staff was super friendly and gave extra sides of sauce upon request and was very patient with me while I mulled over my choices.   Overall: mixed feelings about visiting again as the rice was so off-putting that it kind of ruined my meal. There's a Hawaiian sushi place one or two parking lots over that has Hawaiian food and a poke express inside. If you're not looking for the frills, go there, pricing is better and always great quality. A pound is usually about $15-20 there, which for anyone that didn't catch it earlier in my review, the largest portion is 8oz, which is 1/2 lb. may try again in hopes of a better experience, hopefully cooler rice and gobo instead of bean sprouts next time."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open since I saw the \"coming soon\" sign. So my son and I finally got to check it out today and it was awesome! Fresh food, friendly staff and amazing decor. I'm definitely coming back!  Good job guys! Keep up the good work !"}
{"text":"Build your own poke bowl places are popping up all over the Las Vegas valley. Soulfish Poke was one of the first that I tried. After multiple visits to Soulfish Poke, I just find it ok, I'm not head over heels in love.   My biggest issue is the protein itself is bland! All of the ingredients are thrown in a bowl and sauce is added, but the protein doesn't get to marinate when bowls are built in this manner. The ingredients  have always tasted fresh, but the overall flavor of the bowls have always been lacking.   I also find Soulfish Poke to be overpriced when compared to other poke bowl spots. A small build your own bowl only contains 4 ounces of protein but is $10, and if you want avocado or seaweed salad, that'll cost an extra buck a piece.   And finally, service could be better. On my first visit, the employee working was very friendly and helpful but on subsequent visits the service has declined. I even walked out once due to a total lack of service (employees were too busy chatting to realize someone had walked in).  There are too many spots in town where I get can my poke on these days, so while Soulfish Poke is ok, I don't see myself returning often."}
{"text":"So, this was different than what I am used to with poke bowls. Groupon had a pretty good offer, so the sissy and I went to try it out. Great selection of protein but they were missing 2, one of them shrimp which would have been one of my choices. Base is white rice which is like sushi rice, brown rice, or soba noodles. Chose the white rice which could use more seasoning. Got the tuna and scallops (ceviche style) if they did yum yum style might be better. Lots of topping selections to choose from. Once you get the toppings on there, you could end up with a really big bowl. They need to offer a shoyu/sesame seed oil sauce like the original poke is made with. Overall I would come back but look for another Groupon :)"}
{"text":"This is haole-fied poke.  Looking at the menu... It is not what I expect to see when I want poke.    I went in at about 3:30.  There was no one there.  No patrons, no employees.  While I stood around waiting for someone to come out from the back, I looked at the fish in the case.  The ahi and the salmon were cut so small, and irregularly shaped and kinda old.  After waiting for a few minutes... still no service so I left."}
{"text":"I've shied away from the new build-your-own poke fad for a while, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity when my coworker decided to grab lunch here.  Soulfish Poke is in the massive plaza on Eastern and Richmar. They pride themselves on sustainable sourcing and green materials, but I was mostly concerned with the food. Thankfully, it was good.  I went for a large takeout order of their \"Passion\" soul bowl (ahi tuna, green onion, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds, seaweed) with soba noodles. I usually go all out on customization, especially at the Chipotle-esque pizza places, but I figured that I should start with something safe.  The soba noodles were especially great (thanks Shirley B), and they're actually appropriate to serve cold (in contrast with my coworkers' rice). Although at least one review complains about skimping on protein, my fresh cubed ahi was massively portioned. By that, I mean I'm starting to worry about mercury poisoning. That went a long way toward impressing me.  Toppings were great, especially the seaweed strands. I was confused by the presence of nori (the thin sheets) when they weren't listed, but I appreciated them. Soy sauce was a bit weak, and thankfully I found additional soy sauce to add. My biggest gripe was the ginger, which wasn't minced too finely and was either missing from bites or overpowering. Next time, I'll get customizing because I definitely could've used some avocado on my palate.  I'm glad that I tried Soulfish Poke. It might not be fully authentic, but it's yummy. I'm gonna have to try out all of the other new places now that I've had one good experience. But this is the closest one for me, so I'll be back."}
{"text":"First off, I was looking forward to a new poke spot opening up in this area. However, I was disappointed with my first experience here.   Interior: the restaurant itself looks nice and clean with a modern feel to it, but the seating area is a little cramped (tables were too close together).   Food: Portions were very small. I got the medium for $10. The fish was cut up in very tiny bits and pieces, and eating it was like having to dig for the treasure buried in the rice. The presentation was not very great either. When I got the bowl, it didn't look very appealing at all. The sauces were pretty tasty though. I liked the spicy garlic and citrus ponzu.   If you're looking for an Americanized poke spot with chipotle feel, then this is the place to go. If you want a more authentic poke place then I would not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Soulfish Poke just opened and I must admit, it's delicious. Located on Eastern in the same shopping center as BJ's, Twin Peaks, Smash Burger and Big 5 Sporting Goods, Soulfish Poke is sure to be the new healthy raw fish version of a standard sandwich and salads deli.  Interior decor has reclaimed wood and blue painted walls with picturesque murals of tranquil Hawaiian beaches.  White tables and chairs sit juxtaposed the stainless steel counters where one would place an order. First, one chooses either white or brown rice, or soba noodles. Next, choose a fish; yellowfin ahi, tiger shrimp, scallops, octopus or salmon (or tofu). Moving on, select from a plethora of toppings such as kimchee, sliced onions or julienned carrots, avocado, bell peppers, mango chunks, bean sprouts, jalapeño, pickled ginger, sliced almonds, etc. Lastly, select a sauce such as spicy garlic, sriracha mayo, teriyaki, wasabi cream, and others. Hand-mixed and then served in a bowl with your choice of chopsticks or a fork, it's a healthy option chalked full of protein and nutrients. A salubrious choice when grabbing a bite to eat, I will be most assuredly be returning to enjoy a Poke bowl soon."}
{"text":"Had another bowl, this time with mixed greens and citrus ponzu. I liked it so much better!"}
{"text":"A+ for quantity......... And that's about it for their passing scores.  The quality of the fish was disappointing, the avocado was UNRIPE, they were missing 2 out of the 5 toppings I asked for. To top it off the girl working was indifferent, apathetic, disinterested... Oh do those all mean the same thing? Yeah I know, it was for emphasis.  There's been a huge boom with poke bowls in California and I was so excited Vegas finally caught on....But Soulfish made me question if Vegas was ready.  Unripe avocado? Not so fresh sashimi? MMMMMMmmmmMMMMMM I don't know Soulfish. I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband was the one who went inside while i stayed in the car since I was feeling a bit under the weather, and i thought i needed some really healthy stuff with lots of protein. I had brown rice with ahi and salmon, sweet chili, citrus ponzu sauce, spicy garlic, mango, green onions, and jalapenos. It was AMAZING! My husband said i would probably want more stuff if i went inside the restaurant myself, so I'm probably gonna rate this 5star the next time i come visit"}
{"text":"A delicious way to eat healthy!! Fresh ingredients and lots of choices!!! I had the octopus and ahi tuna with avocado, peppers, cilantro, lemon, quinoa, sesame oil, ponzu, sesame seeds, and seaweed salad!! Bomb!! Craving it again already!!!"}
{"text":"Staff was super helpful explaining the menu and ingredients. Built my own bowl which turned out great and actually had leftovers, which rarely happens in my world! Will be back soon"}
{"text":"I popped in town from San Diego... Did not expect to get smacked in the mouth this good!!  I frequent tons of nice restaurants out here, plus I'm from the beach; I know good fish... This is fresh, flavorful and super generous! No skimping goin on here  If someone put the bowl in front of you, you'd think its a $20-$30 gig. Not the case. Mad bang for your buck  Treat yourself- reeediculous"}
{"text":"Henderson vs. Summerlin vs. Downtown. It seems as though all of the different areas of Las Vegas are starting to become more competitive in the culinary battle as more and more new restaurants are sprouting throughout the valley. Soulfish poke had been on my radar for quite a while and upon returning from NYC it seems as though they are open, but how much soul is put into the food? I'm not sure if there is.  Interior: Fairly open setting with the interior reminiscent of a yoga studio, the area is clean with a minimalist menu that actually is very unclear and should include the steps to order the bowl. Utensils along the wall and a basket of straws by the cashier. For the most part the toppings look organized  Order process: All the bowls are the same size with 2 scoops of white rice/brown rice/etc.. Small = 1 fish, Medium = 2 fishes, Large = 3 fishes. Then the toppings and sauce are unlimited so load that bowl up!  Food: The poke itself is meh, difficult to compete when island sushi is right by and their poke is fresh and flavorful. I wouldn't even call it poke because it's just squares of raw fish with no type of seasoning. There are quite a few toppings to choose from that sound good individually, but when combined didn't give any wow factor. The sauce I got was the creamy wasabi which was ok but needed flavor from a decent squirt of sriracha. The bowl looked and tasted quite ordinary.   Service: The guy behind the counter was a bit overzealous and unclear when asked about the process of ordering. When I sat down a different guy had taken over and welcomed customers with \"Welcome to Soul food\" about 3 times lmao.... kinda sad.  Overall: I can't see myself coming back here when Poke express has great poke, AYCE sushi places are all around, and sushi burritos are taking over Vegas."}
{"text":"I ordered two small bowls and they were plenty. The girl gave me plenty of fish which was nice. I loved all of their sauces. I liked their variety of toppings as well. It was tasty and worth the try."}
{"text":"Been here several times for which I would've given 5 stars all those times. Today not so much. Several things are marked off the menu because they're not in stock.. including noodles. There is only one guy working both food and register. I'm waiting (yes writing this in line) behind four women who are obviously new to the concept.. and the intersection light to turn here went 5 rounds without turning green. Bottom line, if you come here today, on Wednesday December 28, don't come if you are pressed for time, expecting soba or salmon.   Food is always good here just today it's not normal."}
{"text":"Love the concept, hate the food. Been here twice and I choked down a really bland 'zen' bowl. The second time, the fish was warm and cut into huge chunks. I couldn't even stomach it. Warm fish???"}
{"text":"The lady behind the counter was the executive chef of this chain.  Rather than have me mumble off the ingredients for our bowls, she let me give her the paper and made the bowls to-order.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very cool concept. Lots of choices. Healthy and a great addition to this part of town. Like a sushi bowl yum!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from soulfish. I did a create your own bowl. I ordered spicy tuna on white rice with assorted toppings and a spicy mayo sauce. Overall it was good. nice quality fish and fresh veggies. The one thing that I would say was a downer was the portions. For example I had ordered cucumber and seaweed I got a few piece of cucumber but what felt like a heap of seaweed that it was almost overwhelming. I just ended up pulling off some of the seaweed so there wasn't so much but overall i enjoyed the bowl and the sauce had just enough spice."}
{"text":"After going to another poke place that didn't meet my standards, Soulfish Poke did so easily. The menu and ordering was clear and simple.   MENU: For the base, they offer carbs like rice and soba noodles (a plus) and salad. For the protein, they offer yellowfin, salmon, octopus, tuna, and a couple of more options. For the sauce, a great variety. And then toppings.  FOOD/QUALITY: I ordered the soba noodles with three scoops (two of salmon and one of yellowfin) and these were big scoops!! I mixed it with their soul garlic sauce, which is yum. And I topped it off with some green onions, avocado, seaweed, and jalapeños. Everything tasted amazing together, and the fish tastes fresh.   PRICE: Small 8.50, medium 10.00, and large 11.50. With a groupon deal, I paid $3.   ENVIRONMENT: This is a great lunch spot or get to-go.   Overall, I'd come back here and I can't wait for their location on Warm Springs to open up."}
{"text":"This place was yummy! If you dont want your fish slightly warm dont order rice... rice needs to be warm to eat and warms the fish up.. nothing to knock on.. I go there every payday.. is kind of pricier but whatever its good!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!! I'm new to poke but my bf is a major enthusiast and we've pretty much hit up all the spots in the Vegas area and most poke places sell by the pound which is kind of whack cause you don't get all the goodies with it. Soulfish poke where have you been?! They load you up here and at a good price!!! Fish and other ingredients always taste fresh to me and the employees are there to greet and help you customize your bowl. Definitely a staple in my books."}
{"text":"worst poke bowl I've ever had. Ran out of salmon, gave me tuna without asking. a worker picked up something off the floor then reached their hand into one of the toppings containers to put in my bowl. although sauce is added, poke is dry and does not taste fresh. if you want legit Hawaiian poke, head to Island Sushi. sorry, but that's the truth."}
{"text":"Bad quality unflavored fish, skimpy portions of fish like others have mentioned. Not authentic whatsoever.  Much better options around that do not come from a corporate chain trying to capitalize on the poke trend.  The place seems clean and the ingredients justify 2.5 stars  Save your money and go down the street to poke express"}
{"text":"What happened this place was so good and now very bad cuts of tuna a lot of grizzle and a bit fishy not to sure I'll be back makes me sad"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! Service was excellent!! Love the decor & vibe. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"With all the poke bars opening up, I enjoy trying them all to see which ones I'll come back to. This has definitely been my least favorite here in Las Vegas. It's the most expensive with the least amount of options to choose from. For $13 you can build your own bowl w/ 3 scoops of seafood, while other places you can get 5 scoops for around $11.   The fish was fresh but even with adding sauces & toppings the bowl entirely lacked in the flavor department. My favorite toppings to get at a poke bar are always eel sauce & furikake seasoning but this place didn't have either. The sauce options are limited & subpar. I feel the same way with the topping items as well.   The night I went there was 2 people ahead of me & then about 5 people behind me before I left. There was definitely a wait because there was only 1 guy working. Staffing was extremely short for a Saturday night.   WARNING: Check the screen before you sign to pay, if you're paying with a credit/debit card. The employee that rang me up had the 25% tip button hit & I almost just signed, until I noticed the price was much higher than only the 2 bowls I order."}
{"text":"Came here off a Groupon and will definitely be back. I was able to buy 3 groupons and received great service every time. The salmon was fresh and tasty all three times.  My bowl was .... Brown rice, salmon with teriyaki sauce"}
{"text":"First off, the place looks clean and counter person is very friendly. That's all good. Now there are choices, so being the healthy eater I am...I choose brown rice for the base. I like both tuna and salmon so I got both. Then I choose one of their sauces, it is spicey, sweet and tangy, good flavor. The server added some veggies over the top and it looks colorful and beautiful (see photo). I am now thinking they will cook the ingredients, perhaps a stir fry type thing, right?       Wrong, I am now educated on what poke means, and it is pronounced pokey, as in \"The Pokey Little Puppy\".      No problem, I took it home, threw it in a stir fry pan and \"there we go\" (pronounced  as in \"The Greek Wedding\" part 1 & 2). Delicious!!!      And, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've only had a few poke bowls before and this was definitely at the bottom of my experience. Hubby got a Groupon but when we got there they said they weren't taking them anymore. The guy was super nice and apologetic about it and since we had driven all the way out there, we decided to give it a try. I wish we hadn't. I made my own bowl with white rice, spicy tuna and salmon. The rice was chewy and hard, just really ruined the entire experience. There was also way too much spicy mayo, and the avocado is like guacamole. The bowls are $10-$12 and not worth it at all. It really seems like the owners might've had a great concept and then after opening just let it die.  The place was empty and chairs hadn't even been taken off tables...an indication that, sadly, this restaurant will not last long."}
{"text":"Great fresh ingredients make for a wonderful experience. I got a large bowl with salmon and tuna and it was so good. Added a bunch of veggies and mango and man it hit the spot. Sauce wise did ponzu and spicy garlic. Defin be back again!"}
{"text":"I've never thrown away $28 of poke before, but Soulfish changed that. I've never seen brown on raw salmon. Soulfish changed that too. They didn't have masago either. More concerning: they didn't know what it was. #pokefail"}
{"text":"Portion of fish is way too small for the price. I like that the toppings are of no extra charge such as avocado and seaweed salad, but unfortunately I'll be sticking to other poké places."}
{"text":"It's a build your own poke bowl basically. If your not familiar with poke it's raw fish usually tossed with some soy sauce and green onions or served in a spicy mayo sauce but here you pick your base add your protein and its topped with fresh ingredients. They give you a huge amount of fish for the price you pay. The bowl looks small but they add a good amount of ingredients. I wish the fish was tossed in some type of sauce instead of adding it on top but you can Doctor it up your way and fix it to your liking. Clean interior and they're very eco friendly and have trash receptacles for paper and plastic which is really cool. They're looking to add another location close to the south outlet mall area so keep a lookout for it!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend after work, since my friend told me how this is his fav place to go to. So I figured let's try it since it's down the street from my house. I ordered a Buddha bowl.  It wasn't that great at all, the only thing I enjoyed from the bowl was the tuna and wasabi peas. Their white rice tasted so damn plain it wasn't even sushi rice.   One bowl already costs $11 which wasn't all that great. I then notice on my transaction history on my bank account I got charged nearly $15. That's more than a 20% tip!! That I know for sure I didn't click on, which is a bit frustrating but whatever the guy must've added his own tip.  ***please watch out if you do plan to pay with a card. Cause I've noticed on a past review they said the same thing where they added their own tip***"}
{"text":"Pok? is great fresh fish good size portions the actual lay out of the place is beautiful it's got a zen vibe.  Music is great service is wonderful (Kevin) the guy behind the counter is super informative!!! and explains everything step by step made my first experience here a great one will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Honestly this place stinks. They do not marinade the tuna like they should and the accompaniments are bland and unappetizing. My friend and I got a bowl for about 12 bucks and although the portion size was big, it lacked flavor. Brown rice, flavorless tuna with little marinade and sauce. Also we did not get a very friendly vibe when we walked in. With so many other options of poke in town (even right across the street) i would never return. I rarely give out 1 stars but this was really bad. My only hope is that management sees some of these reviews that all say similar things and they do something about it. Needless to say i finished half my bowl and threw it away.  Insert poo emoji. 1/5"}
{"text":"I'm a professional photographer here in Las Vegas and I've done shoots for dozens of restaurants in the valley. One of them was for Soulfish Poke. Normally when I do these shoots I don't have an opportunity to actually try the food I'm shooting because by the time we're done shooting the food, it's not really fresh anymore and with this type of food, fresh is king. But the place looked really nice and the owner and staff were very friendly so I decided to come back one night as a customer. I'm very glad I did.  Now I'm no expert on Poke' bowls, but I have eaten at a few different ones in Vegas and they are really all about the same but Soulfish Poke really goes a step further. Their chefs actually take a LOT of pride in their recipes and each bowl looks like it was carefully prepared, not just slopped together by a bunch of counter monkeys who's last job was working the assembly line at Subway. The staff...all of them, are cheery, explain everything to use Poke newbies, and are a great part of the eating experience. I got the large Budha Bowl, but decided to customize it a bit with some additional veggies and toppings and I thought it was absolutely delicious. Their Sriracha mayo is awsome, and all the ingredients are very fresh. When the whole bowl is assembled, it tastes as good as it looks, which is impressive.  None of their locations are really close to me (I live out in the NW) but I have since eaten there a second time with some friends and everyone loved it as much as I did. Every time I'm near Green Valley or in the SW, I'm going to be sure to stop in for another poke bowl. As far as I'm concerned, these guys are the gold standard in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The poke was okay. The fish portions are pretty small compared to traditional poke.   Really weird observation, but the napkins available were baby blue and baby pink. Almost as if they were leftover from a gender reveal party. It totally didn't go with the deco or theme. Makes me think its 'cheap'. And if they're cheap on that stuff, I'd hope they're not cheap on ingredients.   3 stars because I would go back, but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Got a large bowl...11 bucks. Salmon (so fresh...tasted like butter the way fresh salmon should) was piled on. Watched him put 4 huge scoops of fish on the noodles. Threw on some ginger, seaweed salad and other odds and ends. It was fantastic. Was afraid I wasn't going to be full or hungry soon after but it filled me up and kept me satisfied for awhile. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Umm hmm. This was the 2nd and possibly last poke bowl place we ever try in the mainland. I respect that they want to do their own twist on a classic Hawaiian dish and that's fine BUT my rating was based with their pricing and their lack fish in a poke bowl... If you ask me, it should be called a \"RICE/VEGGIE\" bowl instead of poke bowls...   A small \"rice/veggie\" bowl will cost you about $8.50, and I was given 4, yes, 4 small cubes of Ahi... I'm from hawaii and I've ordered a poke bowl that's smaller than SoulFish's size and its covered with poke... Like a blanket... To have another 4 pieces of ahi it's another $1.50...  Their veggie option is awesome! However it looks like they're also pretty stingy with their veggies as well...  I asked the gentleman behind the counter if they had traditional poke sauce to which he replied \"they're all poke sauces\" I don't think he knows what I'm talking about...  At best it's a good concept, however I will be going elsewhere for my poke fix. I just do not understand their philosophy behind their very small portions..."}
{"text":"DO. NOT. COME. HERE!!!  Second time trying to come to this place during posted business hours and it is CLOSED.  DO NOT trust what the sign on the door says.  Waste of my time, very bad business, will not be back.  Making sure all my friends know not to come here. Spreading the word, HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than a star I would. I was really excited to try this place because of word of mouth. Came in a little after it had open in the afternoon. There wasn't anyone in there and I was the only one in the restaurant. I looked at the menu and had a  lot of questions. The two ladies working there seemed irritated and frustrated as if they didn't want to be there. As I was placing my order, the one who was making my bowl gave me attitude and told me they didn't have a type of fish I wanted when clearly the menu states it on the wall. She then slapped everything else into the bowl and quickly checked me out. Overall the bowl was pretty blan and the I think for what I got that it was overpriced. For being a new restaurant, you would think the customer service would be better. I don't think I would ever come back."}
{"text":"Warning! Do not get there hottest sauce I forgot what it's called but it's ridiculous I like really spicy food but something in there spiciest sauce was not good it burned in a bad way maybe the horseradish? Idk but don't get it, it's uncomfortable they need to warn people."}
{"text":"Really good and fresh.  Nice change to have in the area as opposed to another sandwich shop."}
{"text":"I went into Island Sushi first and there was barely even standing room there. I had seen Soulfish for a while and decided to try it out. This place feels a little like if Chipotle opened a poke bar, in that it's build your own style. It's kind of \"poke for white people\". One girl working, two other customers. I actually found the layout of their menu options a little confusing at first. The girl working was cute and pretty neutral. She didn't ask if I had been there before or offer to explain their process.   I tried their Passion bowl ($12 with tax). Most of the ingredients behind the bar seemed pretty fresh which was good. Unfortunately, the quality of the fish itself, the most important part, was lacking. It is not sushi grade, in my opinion. Also, their fish portions are kind of stingy. So you get maybe a 10-12 small cubes of tuna and a whole buttload of rice, with a few other small veggie add-ons. It's filling, it wasn't bad, I might even try a second bowl, but nothing about it is anything that I would ever crave or drive specifically to this place just to get. I asked for avocado added on, but they scoop out guacamole instead of sliced avocado, which added to the Chipotle taste, haha.   I feel like this location was a bold choice considering it's proximity to Island Sushi, which has a healthy customer base and a popular poke bar of their own. Island Sushi has better quality fish at a better price point and it's basically in the same center. There's a reason IS had customers spilling out the door and Soulfish had two. I don't see them lasting in what is already a shopping center with a high restaurant turnover.  Three stars for clean store, nice color scheme, neutral service, and clean but unexciting food."}
{"text":"It's my first time trying this place since it was an option on UberEATS, & im sad that I wasted my money. The bowl looked beautiful, but I couldn't even swallow the first bite of the spicy tuna because it just tasted horrible. I tried to get around it & took another bite, but that's not at all what spicy ahi is supposed to taste like. Also, I got the bottom of the rice pot rice. It was so hard & crunchy."}
{"text":"So excited to gave a new healthy place to eat and they don't limit you on what you can put into your bowl. Two build your owns. Angela was great encouraging us to go for it."}
{"text":"I expected so much, but left disappointed. Service was on point, but the product was not poke, more of a raw ahi with salad and different sauces. Can't imagine returning."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in LA. They have some pretty amazing food, expect the unexpected ;)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The fish is very fresh. The spicy tuna was excellent! You get to add whatever toppings you'd like to your bowl. I added brown rice, edamame, wasabi peas, & sesame seeds. So delicious!"}
{"text":"Fish was pretty fresh, serving size was great. I wish I could've taken a picture but I ate it so fast cause it was so good. Nice friendly staff. Great poke place overall."}
{"text":"Last Soulfish Poké standing. Kinda of sad about this reality, since I am rather fond of their non-traditional take on the Hawaiian poké.  Anyway, I had a meeting on the East side of Las Vegas and planned on making this detour before heading home and relaxing with some movies or binge watch some Dragonball Super on the Kodi box I've tinkering with.  I am glad this location is still opened, and it apparently is owned by a different owner than the other two locations West of the I-15.  The menu and interior decor and logo is essentially the same.  Even the Groupon promo I purchased is the same.  The guy making my upsized poké bowl is friendly and efficient at his task, and the food looks great (even after the lid is closed on the scoop of avocado is thus smashed).  The ingredients look and tasted fresh. I really have nothing bad to say about my visit to Soulfish Poké. Next time I am back on this side of the freeway I will come back and fill up my stamp card. 5 more to good for a free one!"}
{"text":"omg waiting for this place to open!!! so worth the wait!! i got an octopus bowl so delicious the octopus is so fresh and the veggies too. the atmosphere is awesome too and the chef that made our food has a great out going personality!!!  next time i think i want to add all the protein in one bowl.  great time coming back always"}
