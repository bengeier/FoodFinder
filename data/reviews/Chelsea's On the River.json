{"text":"My husband and I have been to Chelsea's a couple of times since they added food to their offerings. We love the friendly atmosphere and the fun bar-tender, and the drinks are always spot on. So of course, we had high hopes for the new food menu. Now I will say, the menu is very small. I prefer a greater variety. But the food they do serve is amazing! The fried portabella mushrooms and fried cheese are amazing. And the pulled pork and Buckeye steak sandwiches are also to die for. There is also a burger on the menu that is quite comparable to those at Swenson's! The only thing we're not crazy about are the chicken tenders. They do appear to be hand-battered, but both times we tried them, they were dry and very rubbery. Overall, I would definitely recommend Chelsea's. It's a cozy neighborhood bar with above average food and drink. Always a great time!"}
{"text":"Chelsea's on the River no longer makes food. They will serve you food from the cafe next door, which wasn't that great. The previous reviews are not relevant, as they no longer serve the food that was mentioned. We ordered quesadillas, which were soggy and overpriced for the portion size. The fries were burnt. The bar tender made us feel bad for even ordering food, stating that they only bring food to customers when they're not busy, like it was an extra hassle for him. The bar was dirty and uninviting. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I have been going to Chelsea's for some time now and it is a great local bar.  When they decided to do food I will admit I was a bit skeptical but intrigued.  Since they have opened I have had the Chelsea's Burger, very good and very big with a heaping helping of fries.  It was cooked perfectly and came out quickly.  I tried the Chicken Tenders next and again, good and a lot of food.  Homemade, tender and juicy.  They also just started having specials like a Porterhouse Pork Chop and Chicken Fried Chicken.  I tried both and have to say, this place is not typical bar food at all, it is far beyond.    Being that it I a bar I would not recommend it for kids.  The food comes out quickly and because the portions are so heaping you may considers sharing food.  They have a Facebook page which is where I heard about the specials so that is nice that it is posted, they even have photos of some of the food.  Dress is very casual and there are many TV's as well as music.    If you are a fan of casual dining and great food you should really check this place out!"}
